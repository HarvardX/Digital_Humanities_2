a general view of the writings of linnaeus by richard pulteney m d and f r s  london printed for t pain at the mewsgate and b white fleet street m dcc lxxxi  advertisement as the writer of this volume could not for very obvious reasons entertain the most distant intention of standing forth the professed biographer of linnaeus he wishes to preclude any undue expectations by observing that the few memoirs relating to the life of this celebrated professor which will be found interspersed in the first part of this view were almost wholly collected from linnaeuss own writings and other printed works and serve principally to relieve the tediousness of a bare account of books and to connect in a better manner the series and occasion of his publications he regrets that his sources of intelligence have not been sufficiently copious to enable him to render these memoirs more equal to his wishes and more worthy the acceptance of the public to those who are conversant with the works of linnaeus he is perfectly aware that these pages can afford but little amusement and still less information and can have no merit in their eye beyond that of recalling to their remembrance a succession of facts and observations with which they were before acquainted they will however concur with him in wishing to diffuse the knowledge of the writings of so great a master and in endeavoring to excite an emulation in younger minds for that science which they cultivate  all the works of linnaeus as far as they have come to the authors knowledge are noticed in the succeeding pages but as most of them were subservient to his great object the system of nature the outlines of that work bear a principal part in this view of his writings  the classification of diseases is but a small part of his works yet as linnaeus was an early writer on that subject which has since excited the attention of many physicians and is at this day not sufficiently discussed it has therefore been exhibited more largely than many of his other writings  the amoenitates academicae although strictly speaking they are not linnaeuss own works have yet so large a share of his authority stamped upon them are so intimately connected with his writings and it is presumed are so much less known than they deserve to be that it was judged proper to give a brief account of the whole collection  the pan suecus having been first presented to the english reader several years ago by the author of this volume in a periodical publication is here subjoined with additional observations and some improvements in the general arrangement of the tables  few or no criticisms on the linnaean system will be found in these pages no system yet invented can stand a rigorous examination through all its parts and linnaeus was perhaps better acquainted than any other man with the defects of his own the study of nature on scientific principles notwithstanding the manifold improvements of later years may yet justly be considered as in its infancy and all arrangements hitherto proposed have in their turns given way to others at present the system of linnaeus possesses the advantage of a general superiority in the public approbation how long it may enjoy this preeminence time only can discover in the mean while it would be a more agreeable employment to endeavor to strengthen its basis supply its deficiences and heartily correct its errors than to object to those anomalies and imperfections which will most likely be ever inseparable from artificial arrangements and as to natural method it is as yet so far unknown that in the vegetable kingdom botanists themselves are not agreed on what principles it ought to be established  a general view of the writings of the late celebrated linnaeus etc charles von linne the son of a swedish divine was born may      0  at roeshult in the province of smaland in sweden of which place his father had the cure when this son was born but was soon after preferred to the living of stenbrihult in the same province where dying in      at the age of  0 he was succeeded in his cure by another son we are told in the commemorationspeech on this celebrated man delivered in his swedish majestys presence before the royal academy of sciences at stockholm that the ancestors of this family took their sirnames of linnaeus lindelius and tiliander from a large limetree or lindentree yet standing on the farm where linnaeus was born and that this origin of sirnames taken from natural objects is not very uncommon in sweden  this eminent man whose talents enabled him to reform the whole science of natural history accumulated very early in life some of the highest honors that await the most successful proficients in medical science since we find that he was made professor of physic and botany in the university of upsal at the age of    and six years afterward physician to his sovereign the late king adolphus who in the year      honored him still farther by creating him knight of the order of the polar star his honors did not terminate here for in      he was ennobled and in      the present king of sweden accepted the resignation of his office and rewarded his declining years by doubling his pension and by a liberal donation of landed property settled on him and his family  it seems probable that his fathers example first gave linnaeus a taste for the study of nature who as he has himself informed us cultivated as his first amusement a garden plentifully stored with plants young linnaeus soon became acquainted with these as well as the indigenous ones of his neighborhood yet from the straightness of his fathers income our young naturalist was on the point of being destined to a mechanical employment fortunately however this design was overruled in      he was sent to school at wexsio where as his opportunities were enlarged his progress in all his favorite pursuits was proportionably extended at this early period he paid attention to other branches of natural history particularly to the knowledge of insects in which as is manifest from his oration on the subject he must very early have made a great proficiency since we find that he was not less successful herein than in that of plants having given them an arrangement and established such characters of distinction as have been universally followed by succeeding entomologists  the first part of his academical education linnaeus received under professor stobaeus at lund in scania who favored his inclinations to the study of natural history after a residence of about a year he removed in      to upsal here he soon contracted a close friendship with artedi a native of the province of angermannia who had already been four years a student in that university and like himself had a strong bent to the study of natural history in general but particularly to ichthyology he was moreover well skilled in chemistry and not unacquainted with botany having been the inventor of that distinction in umbelliferous plants arising from the differences of the involucrum emulation is the soul of improvement and heightened as it was in this instance by friendship proved a most powerful incentive these young men prosecuted their studies together with uncommon vigor mutually communicating their observations and laying their plans so as to assist each other in every branch of natural history and physic  soon after his residence at upsal our author was also happy enough to obtain the favor of several gentlemen of established character in literature he was in a particular manner encouraged in the pursuit of his studies by the patronage of dr olaus celsius at that time professor of divinity and the restorer of natural history in sweden since so distinguished for oriental learning and more particularly for his hierobotanicon or critical dissertations on the plants mentioned in scripture this gentleman is said to have given linnaeus a large share of his esteem and he was fortunate enough to obtain it very early after his removal to upsal he was at that time meditating his hierobotanicon and being struck with the diligence of linnaeus in describing the plants of the upsal garden and his extensive knowledge of their names fortunately for him at that time involved in difficulties from the narrow circumstances of his parents celsius not only patronized him in a general way but admitted him to his house his table and his library under such encouragement it is not strange that our author made a rapid progress both in his studies and the esteem of the professors in fact we have a very striking proof of his merit and seize inasmuch as we find that after only two years residence he was thought sufficiently qualified to give lectures occasionally from the botanic chair in the room of professor rudbeck  in the year      the royal academy of sciences at upsal having for some time meditated the design of improving the natural history of sweden at the instance particularly of professors celsius and rudbeck deputed linnaeus to make the tour of lapland with the sole view of exploring the natural history of that arctic region to which undertaking his reputation already high as a naturalist and the strength of his constitution equally recommended him this tour had been made for the first time with the same view by the elder rudbeck in      at the command of charles xi but unfortunately the whole fruit of that expedition except two or three copies of the campi elysii perished in the dreadful fire of upsal in   0   as this expedition could not take place till the succeeding summer linnaeus spent his winter with his friends and relations in the south and particularly paid a visit in january      to his former preceptor stobaeus at lund whom he left in february to visit his native province of smaland and returned to upsal about the middle of april to prepare for his journey he left upsal the   th of may and took his route to gevalia or gevels the principal town of gestricia    miles distant from upsal hence he traveled through helsingland into medalpadia where he made an excursion and ascended a remarkable mountain before he reached hudwickswald the chief town of helsingland from hence he went through angermanland to hernosand a seaport on the bothnic gulf seventy miles distant from hudwickswald when he had proceeded thus far he found it proper to retard his journey as the spring was not sufficiently advanced and took this opportunity of visiting those remarkable caverns on the summit of mount skula though at the hazard of his life  when linnaeus arrived at uma in west bothnia about    miles from hernosand he quitted the public road and took his course through the woods westward in order first to traverse the most southern parts of lapland being now come to the country that was more particularly the object of his enquiries equally a stranger to the language and to the manners of the people and without any associate he committed himself to the hospitality of the inhabitants and never failed to experience it fully he speaks in several places with peculiar satisfaction of the innocence and simplicity of their lives and their freedom from diseases in this excursion he reached the mountains toward norway and after encountering great hardships returned into west bothnia quite exhausted with fatigue he seems to have been much struck with the singular use that the laplanders make of the pinguicula vulgaris which we call butterwort or yorkshire sanicle they receive the milk of the reindeer upon the fresh leaves of this plant which they immediately strain off and set aside till it becomes somewhat acescent and the whole acquires in a day or two a consistence equal to that of cream without separating the serum and by this method it becomes an agreeable food when thus prepared a small quantity of the same has the property of rennet in producing the like change on fresh milk but to return our traveller next visited pitha and lula upon the gulf of bothnia from which latter place he took again a western route by proceeding up the river of that name and visited the ruins of the temple of jockmock in lulalapland or lapmark thence he traversed what is called the lapland desert destitute of all villages cultivation roads or any conveniences inhabited only by a few straggling people originally descended from the finlanders and who settled in this country in remote ages being entirely a distinct people from the laplanders in this district he ascended a noted mountain called wallevari in speaking of which he has given us a pleasant relation of his finding a singular and beautiful new plant andromeda tetragona when traveling within the arctic circle with the sun in his view at midnight in search of a lapland hut from hence he crossed the lapland alps into finmark and traverfed the shores of the north sea as far as sallero  these journies from lula and pitha on the bothnian gulf to the north shore were made on foot and our traveller was attended by two laplanders one his interpreter and the other his guide he tells us that the vigor and strength of these two men both old and sufficiently loaded with his baggage excited his admiration since they appeared quite unhurt by their labor while he himself although young and robust was frequently quite exhausted in this journey he was wont to sleep under the boat with which they forded the rivers as a defense against rain and the gnats which in the lapland summer are not less teazing than in the torrid zones in descending one of these rivers he narrowly escaped perishing by the oversetting of the boat and lost many of the natural productions which he had collected  linnaeus thus spent the greater part of the summer in examining this arctic region and those mountains on which four years afterward the french philosophers secured immortal fame to sir isaac newton at length after having suffered incredible fatigues and hardships in climbing precipices passing rivers in miserable boats suffering repeated vicissitudes of extreme heat and cold and not unfrequently hunger and thirst he returned to tornoa in september he did not take the same route from tornoa as when he came into lapland having determined to visit and examine the country on the eastern side of the bothnian gulf his first stage therefore was to ula in east bothnia from thence to old and new carleby    miles south from ula he continued his route through wasa christianstedi and biorneburgh to abo a small university in finland winter was now setting in apace he therefore crossed the gulf by the island of aland and arrived at upsal in november after having performed and that mostly on foot a journey of ten degrees of latitude in extent exclusive of those deviations which such a design rendered necessary  the result of this journey was not published till several years afterward during his residence in holland for the present he only gave in to the academy a florula lapponica consisting of a very few pages in the acta upsaliensia for the years      and      in this little catalogue the plants are disposed according to the system which was afterward called the sexual and which we should not have mentioned here but to prove how early linnaeus had laid the foundation of that method which he afterward wrought up to such perfection  in      he visited and examined the several mines in sweden and made himself so well acquainted with mineralogy and the docimastic art that we find he was sufficiently qualified to give lectures on those subjects upon his return to the university the outlines of his system on mineralogy appeared in the early editions of the systema naturae but he did not exemplify the whole until the year       in the year      linnaeus was sent by baron reuterholm governor of dalekarlia with several other naturalists into that province to investigate the natural productions of that part of the swedish dominions each gentleman had his particular department assigned and they noted daily the observations made relating to geography etc but particularly and as their principal object the economical and natural history and mineralogy a full account of these observations was intended to have been published but the design was laid aside it was in this journey that our author firft laid the plan of an excellent institution which was afterward executed in a certain degree at least by himself with the assistance of many of his pupils and the result published under the title of pan suecus in the second volume of the amaenitates academicae  after the completion of this expedition it appears that linnaeus resided for a time at fahlun the principal town in dalekarlia where he tells us that he taught mineralogy and the docimastic art and practiced physic and where he was very hospitably treated by dr more the physician of the place it also appears that he contracted at this time an intimacy with one of that gentlemans daughters whom he married about five years afterward upon his settling as a physician at stockholm  in this journey he extended his travels quite across the dalekarlian alps into norway but we have no particular account of his discoveries in that kingdom from its situation however in the same parallels of latitude and of longitude nearly with sweden as well as from the face of the country but little variety could be expected and from the flora norwegica of bp gunner since published the vegetable productions of nature appear to be nearly the same except that the norway coast abounds with fuci or seawracks not known in the baltic  in the year      linnaeus traveled over many other parts of sweden some parts of denmark and germany and fixed in holland where he chiefly resided until his return to stockholm about the year      he here took his doctors degree in physic in june      how clearly the great boerhaave saw his merit will appear hereafter on the present occasion he sustained a thesis under the title of hypothesis nova de febrium intermittentium causa it is an enquiry into the causes of the frequency of that distemper in sweden particularly in upland and the southeast parts of that kingdom which he was inclined to attribute to a local cause after the most minute scrutiny into the soil and situation of those places where this distemper was so remarkably prevalent and obstinate and finally proposes whether it might not be owing to the strong impregnation of the water with argillaceous particles whether or not he afterward adhered to this opinion we are uncertain as it is but justice to observe that he did not republish this tract himself since it was placed at the head of the first volume of the amaenitates printed at leyden as we believe without his knowledge by dr peter camper in the mean time we may observe that howsoever insufficient this hypothesis may be to solve the difficulties that have attended the search into the remote causes of this disease the advocates of the modern theory relating to it may think the authors facts of its frequency in low situations confirm and illustrate in no small degree their own according to which it is imputed to miasmata arising from moist and marshy ground  in this year linnaeus also published the first sketch of his systema naturae in a very compendious way and in the form of tables only in twelve pages in folio by this it appears that he had at a very early period of his life certainly before he was    years old laid the basis of that great structure which he afterward raised not only to the increase of his own fame but to that of natural science  in      linnaeus came into england and visited dr dillenius the late learned professor at oxford whom he justly considered as one of the first botanists in europe he mentions with particular respect the civilities he received from him and the privileges he gave him of inspecting his own and the sherardian collections of plants it is needless to say that he visited dr martyn mr rand and mr miller and that he was in a more singular manner indebted to the friendship of dr isaac lawson he also contracted an intimate friendship with mr peter collinson which was reciprocally increased by a multitude of good offices and continued to the last without any diminution dr boerhaave had furnished him with letters to our great naturalist sir hans sloane but it is with regret that we must observe they did not procure him the reception which the warmth of his recommendation seemed to claim  dr boerhaaves letter to sir hans sloane on this occasion is preserved in the british museum and runs thus  linnaeus qui has tibi dabit literas est unice dignus te videre unice dignus a te videri qui vos videbit simul videhit hominum par cui simile vix dabit orbis  this encomium howsoever quaintly expressed yet was in some measure prophetic of linnaeuss future fame and greatness and proves how intimately boerhaave had penetrated into the genius and abilities of our author and strained as this parallel might be thought it is likely however that the opening of the sexual system so different from rays by which sir hans sloane had always known plants and particularly the innovations as they were then called which linnaeus had made in altering the names of so many genera were rather the cause of that coolness with which he was received by our excellent naturalist probably we have reason to regret this circumstance for otherwise linnaeus might have obtained an establishment in england as it has been thought he wished to have done and doubtless his opportunities in this kingdom would have been much more favorable to his designs than in those arctic regions where he spent the remainder of his days in the mean time we may justly infer the exalted idea that linnaeus had of england as a land eminently favorable to the improvement of science from that compliment which in a letter to a friend he afterward paid to london when speaking of that city he called it punctum saliens in vitello orbis however the english naturalists may now congratulate themselves on having adopted a most excellent disciple of the linnaean school who with an illustrious associate shared the perils of a navigation round this globe incited by thirst of knowledge alone and who now enjoys that general esteem among us which is due to his extensive science and to his singular liberality of mind and manners  one of the most agreeable circumstances that happened to linnaeus during his residence in holland arose from the patronage of mr clifford in whose house the country seat and garden of mr clifford was at hartcamp about three miles from haerlem he lived a considerable part of his time being now as it were the child of fortune  exivi patria triginta sex nummis aureis dives  are his own words with mr clifford however he enjoyed pleasures and privileges scarcely at that time to be met with elsewhere in the world that of a garden excellently stored with the finest exotics and a library furnished with almost every botanic author of note how happy he found himself in this situation those only who have felt the same kind of ardour can conceive  whilst in holland our author was recommended by boerhaave to fill the place then vacant of physician to the dutch settlement at surinam but he declined it on account of his having been educated in so opposite a climate he recommended however to that department a young german physician of great merit who had the misfortune to fall a sacrifice partly to the climate and partly perhaps to ill usage from the governor in half a year after his arrival a circumstance which linnaeus has very pathetically lamented in the flora suecica no     when treating of a plant to which he has given this gentlemans name  besides being favored with the particular patronage and friendship of boerhaave and mr clifford as is abovementioned our author had also the pleasure of being contemporary with and of reckoning among the number of his friends many other learned persons who have since proved ornaments to their profession and whose merit has most deservedly raised them to fame and honor among these we may properly mention dr john burman professor of botany at amsterdam whose name and family are well known in the republic of letters to whom our author dedicated his bibliotheca botanica having been greatly assisted in compiling that work by the free access he had to that gentlemans excellent library john frederick gronovius of leyden editor of claytons flora virginica and who very early adopted linnaeuss system baron van swieten late physician to the empress queen isaac lawson beforementioned afterward one of the physicians to the british army who died much regretted at oosterhout in the year      and from whom linnaeus received singular and very important civilities kramer since well known for an excellent treatise on the docimastic art van royen botanic professor at leyden lieberkun of berlin famous for his skill in microscopical instruments and experiments on this occasion it is not foreign to our plan to remark that linnaeus being present with several of these gentlemen at a meeting when the latter was exhibiting the animalcules in semine masculino openly declared his opinion that these moleculae were not true animalcules and he appears ever afterward to have retained the same opinion relating to them to these may be added also the names of albinus and gaubius and of others were it requisite to show that our authors talents had very early rendered him conspicuous and gained him the regard of all those who cultivated and patronized any branch of medical science and to which doubtless the singular notice with which boerhaave honored him did not a little contribute  early in the year      after linnaeus had left mr clifford and as it should seem when he resided with van royen at leyden he had a long and dangerous fit of sickness and upon his recovery went to paris where he was properly entertained by the jussieus at that time the first botanists in france the opportunity this gave him of inspecting the herbaria of surian and tournefort and those of the abovenamed gentlemen afforded him great satisfaction he had intended to have gone from thence into germany to visit ludwig and the celebrated haller with whom he was in close correspondence but he was not able to complete this part of his intended route and was obliged to return without this gratification  our author did not fail to avail himself of every advantage that access to the several museums of this country afforded him in every branch of natural history and the number and importance of his publications during this absence from his native country sufficiently demonstrate that fund of knowledge which he must have imbibed before and no less testify his extraordinary application as these works laid the foundation of his future fame and distinguished character it will be incumbent on us to enumerate them and give a brief account of each as nearly as we can in the order of time in which they were published before we accompany our author into sweden whither he returned to receive at length the reward of his merit  the first of these was the systema naturae five regna tria naturae systematice proposita per classes ordines genera et species lugd bat      fol pp    in latin with the swedish names annexed as this is little more than the general outlines of his work we shall reserve a fuller account of it till we come to the enlarged editions in which it was fully exemplified by the introduction of the species  fundamenta botanica quae majorum operum prodromi instar theoriam scientiae botanices per breves aphorismos tradunt amst        o pp    the science of botany is in this work reduced to     aphorisms or canons and what sethus calvisius has said of ptolemys canon mutatis mutandis may be truly said of this work  omni auro pretiosior est si dudum innotuisset nec adeo in diversas sectas botanici abiisent sed res botanicae multo melius se haberent it passed through several editions and was published with a comment upon each aphorism in      under the title of philosophia botanica hereafter to be noticed  bibliotheca botanica recensens libros plus mill de plantis hucusque editos secundum systema auctorum natural in classes ordines genera et species dispositos additis editionis loco tempore forma lingua amst        o pp     and afterward in  o      much enlarged botanic writers are in this work distributed into    classes and it is by no means so unentertaining as might be expected from the general idea of a catalogue merely as the author has frequently subjoined short characters of the books and at the beginning of each class as also in the orders or subdivisions takes occasion to explain several of his terms used in his subsequent writings the preface contains a short history of the rise and progress of botany and an acknowledgment of the aid the author received in the compilation of this work by his free access to the libraries of mr sprekelsen at hamburgh dr gronovius at leyden and particularly to those of his patron mr clifford and dr burman professor of botany at amsterdam authors are classed in this work as follows   patres   commentatores   ichniographi   descriptores   monographi   curiosi   adonistae   floristae   peregrinatores  0 philosophi    systematici    nomenclatores    anatomici    hortulani

 specifying wherever it was possible the year of their birth and death  the flowering of the plantain or banana musa paradisiaca this year a thing not seen in europe before more than thrice in the garden of our authors patron m clifford produced a complete history of that plant from linnaeuss pen under the title of musa cliffortiana florens hartecampi      prope harlemum lugd bat  o pp    this piece is drawn up with the utmost precision according to the authors own methodus demonstrandi printed at the end of the systema and is a model for monographers in this way it is embellished with two plates one representing the plant at large the other the parts of fructification separately  genera plantarum eorumque characteres naturales secundum numerum figuram situm et proportionem omnium fructificationis partium lugd bat       o pp     in this work which exhibits what linnaeus has called the natural characters of the genera of plants the classes are established upon the number or situation or both conjointly of the stamina analogically considered as the male parts and the orders or subdivisions of the classes upon the pistils analogous to the female parts and the genera themselves from the agreement of all the parts of fructification compared with each other as they agree in number figure situation and proportion hence the linnaean characters of plants are applicable to any classical method founded on the parts of fructification alone in which respect they have the advantage over those of all foregoing writers and will probably stand firm even although the classical part of the system should be set aside this is to be considered as one of the capital of linnaeuss works he tells us that before the publication of the first edition he had examined the characters of  000 flowers those alone who have been accustomed to examine plants with a scientific view can judge how arduous this undertaking must have been and how great the application that he must necessarily have bestowed thereon and that at an early period of life neither can any others sufficiently admire that accuracy with which so great a number of flowers have been examined and compared or see the aptitude of that assemblage of terms which were invented by linnaeus to express the different figure situation and proportion that exist in such a variety of subjects if this was a proper place to expatiate upon this subject by extending the idea to all that linnaeus has done respecting every other part of plants as considered in their specific distinctions it must still farther exalt the merit of the author and place him above all praise at the latter end of this work was given the general plan of a system invented by linnaeus and founded upon the different kinds and arrangement of the calix or cup of the flower in plants but this was omitted in the latter editions also a fragment of that primum et ultimum in botany the natural method  the first edition of this book contained     genera the sixth and last at stockholm in      has extended the number to      and the mantissae since to      it has been thought by some that the first idea of the sexual method was received from the writings of jungius a learned professor first at helmstadt and afterward rector of the gymnasium at hamburgh where he died in      and whose works contain an uncommon display of original observations on the subject of plants and prove him to have been a most accurate observer of nature he has not only discriminated with peculiar nicety the structure and several parts of plants but he has also with equal judgment shown the impropriety of many of the old generical and specifical distinctions and has given rules for forming them anew that have been of the greatest service to his successors in the science and of which they have not failed to avail themselves but jungius did not however exhibit any plan by which it appears that he laid the basis either of the sexual or any other system  before the conclusion of the same year      our author published the corollarium generum cui accedit methodus sexualis in  o the former contained only the addition of sixty new genera of plants all which were taken into the next edition of the foregoing book and the latter exhibits a brief view of the sexual system as far as respects the classes and orders neither would it be of importance to mention a small piece published in the same year during his residence with mr clifford under the title of viridarium cliffortianum were it not incumbent on us to mention all that came from our authors pen  in this year      appeared likewise the result of the lapland expedition as far at least as relates to the plants of that country for we are now deprived of the expectation of ever seeing the lachesis lapponica intended to complete our authors history of this country through all its parts this volume includes the plants of a tract of country not less than  00

literary society by whose munificence this work was adorned with the plates on which are engraven    of the more rare and chiefly alpine plants this is preceded by additional prolegomena in which the geographic and natural description of the country is set forth and the difference between the alps and the desert distinctly marked concluding with some observations on alpine plants in general the work is interspersed with many very curious observations relating to the inhabitants their simplicity of life and manners their diseases the animals of the country the medical and economical uses of

particularly in the species plantarum a work not published till sixteen years afterward the specific names of plants not taken as had been customary with former authors from the color of the flower relative size of the plant smell taste place of growth time of flowering name of the discoverer virtues uses duration none of which are sufficiently permanent but from those invariable and essential parts which fully and clearly distinguish each species under the same genus and in the compass of ten or twelve words convey such an idea of the plant intended as will more effectually distinguish it than the verbose descriptions of many foregoing authors linnaeus has taken incredible pains with this part of his system which is certainly as difficult as any that leads to the perfection of the science since it depends upon a nice inspection of every species belonging to each genus and of every actual variety belonging to each species  the plants of lapland are but few not amounting to more than     species and in this number are included upwards of an hundred discovered by linnaeus in this journey not known to be natives of sweden before and of which some were nondescripts among the former there seems to be a propriety in mentioning specially the campanula serpyllifolia or thymeleaved bellflower which as it turned out to be a new genus was appropriated to our author by dr j gronovius and engraved in this volume by the name of linnaea  no part of linnaeuss writings had given more offense to the contemporary botanists than the liberty he had taken in changing the generic names of plants which had necessarily taken place in many instances from the rules established by the fundamenta even dillenius was by no means reconciled to this innovation linnaeus who had entertained an high opinion of our english professor having said of him  nullus est in anglia qui genera curat vel intelligit praeterquam dillenius  probably therefore dedicated to him his next publication the critica botanica in qua nomina plantarum generica et specifica et variantia examini subjiciuntur selectiora confirmantur indigna rejiciuntur simulque doctrina circa denominationem plantarum traditur lugd bat       o pp   0 this is a large comment upon the  th  th  th and  0th parts of the fundamenta from aphorism   0 to     inclusive in which he has amply explained all his reasons for these alterations and there were at that time many who saw the justice of his remarks ludwig says when speaking of this work  rigorosus quidem sed saepissime faelix botanicorum censor est the work is rendered very applicable to use by two excellent indexes  linnaeus printed at the end of this volume discursus de introducenda in scholas et gymnasia historiae naturalis lectione pp    written by dr browallius who afterward defended very ably the system of linnaeus against professor siegesbeck of petersburgh  in      was likewise published the most splendid of all our authors writings the hortus cliffortianus plantas exhibens quas in hortis tam vivis quam siccis hartecampi in hollandia coluit vir nob et genesis georgius clifford j u d reductis varietatibus ad species speciebus ad genera generibus ad classes adjectis locis plantarum natalibus differentiisque specierum amst      fol pp  0  t    as this book was printed at the expense of mr clifford it is ornamented with an elegant frontispiece and adorned with some of the finest engravings of plants that are extant the drawings for which were made with all possible accuracy by the late mr ehret by the munificence of mr clifford many of the celebrated botanists received a present of this book how rich this garden was in plants the book will testify they are arranged as in all our authors succeeding works in the sexual method the varieties are reduced to their several species the natural places of the plants are particularly noticed many new genera and species under former genera are introduced with their descriptions at large and curious observations interspersed throughout the whole and what must have been more especially acceptable to those who began to relish our authors system was the farther exemplification of his specific characters which the vast number of plants included in this work necessarily led to add to this that from the copious number of synonyms it is almost a pinax of every plant therein mentioned and on this account as well as others will yet retain its value though superseded in a great degree by the species plantarum to the curious and critical botanist also it is no small satisfaction now to see in this volume compared with later works the progress of the authors own knowledge manifest by the removes and alterations that better information enabled him to make in the dedication our author enumerates those patrons who have cultivated botanical gardens so greatly to the emolument of the science he gives a list of the cliffortian library and annexes two tables with explanations of all the variety of leaves according to his new method of defining them this addition was very necessary as the number of plants synonymed in this volume amounts to near   00 we conclude with gesners opinion of this work in a letter to the celebrated haller opus sane egregium et acerrimi judicii nec minoris eruditionis quo difficulter botanicus carebit  mihi perplacet ab eo in nominibus specierum notas earum essentiales exhiberi quod ante vix quisquam botanicus recte praestitit  the last book which linnaeus published of his own during his stay in holland was the classes plantarum seu systemata plantarum omnia a fructificatione desumta quorum    universalia et    partialia compendiose proposita secundum classes ordines et nomina generica cum clave cujusvis methodi et synonymis genericis lugd bat      pp     this work is a very large illustration of the second part of the fundamenta from aphorism    to    and contains a compendious and useful view of all the systems of botany or methods of classing plants both general and partial from caesalpinus in      who is considered as the inventor to linnaeus himself in      to the generical name in every system he has added that by which it stands in his own which is a great advantage in the use of this book a new edition with the requisite additions would be very acceptable to the public even now the systems at large that are displayed in this book are those of caesalpinus morison ray knaut herman and boerhaave founded on the fruit rivinus ruppius ludwig and knaut on the number of petals in the flower tournefort and pontedera on the figure of the same and of magnol and linnaeus on the cup of the flower after these follow linnaeuss sexual system and his fragments of the natural method we say nothing of the arrangement of particular classes such are the composite flowers the umbelliferous plants the graminaceous the ferns etc a very large index referring to every genus in each system concludes the volume  linnaeus whilst in holland sustained a very severe loss in the premature death of his friend and fellow student artedi with whom as has been before observed he had contracted the firmest friendship whilst they resided at upsal insomuch that they had in case of death mutually bequeathed to each other their manuscripts and collections in natural history artedi had been particularly assiduous in arranging anew and describing all such fishes as had fallen under his own inspection and had taken a voyage to england in      to give more perfection to his plan our author after his death procured though with some difficulty all artedis papers and put the finishing hand to them and published them at leyden in      in octavo under the title of petri artedi sueci medici ichthyologia sive opera omnia de piscibus scilicet bibliotheca ichthyologica philosophia ichthyologica genera piscium synonymia specierum descriptiones specierum omnia in hoc genere perfectiora quam antea ulla posthuma vindicavit recognovit cooptavit et edidit carolus linnaeus in this work fishes are arranged in an entire new method and which our author adopted with little or no variation and continued through all the former editions of his system to the tenth when he removed the cetaceous order into the class of the mammalia and instead of retaining in the remaining orders the distinctions arising from the bony or cartilaginous texture of the fins he established them on the situation of the ventral fins which he considers as analogous to the feet in other animals as they are placed either before underneath or behind the pectoral fins  in this work artedi has exhibited an instance of genius labor and application that cannot fail to excite the greatest regret at his early death he has given to ichthyology that degree of perfection which his friend afterward extended through all the animal kingdom and which must remain a lasting monument of his abilities in particular his descriptions of the indigenous fishes of sweden are scientific to a degree that had never before been seen and we cannot sufficiently admire the pains he must have taken to extricate the synonyms from every author on the subject artedi after his return from england was retained at the recommendation of linnaeus by seba of amsterdam to complete that part of his thesaurus relating to fishes and was unfortunately drowned in one of the canals in that city linnaeus in a short account of the authors life has lamented his untimely decease in a manner which does no less honor to his friend than to his own feelings  we must now accompany our author into sweden whither he returned about the latter end of the year      or the beginning of the next and settled as a physician at stockholm where he seems to have met with considerable opposition and was oppressed with many difficulties all of which at length he overcame and got into extensive practice and soon after his settlement married the lady before spoken of by the interest of count tessin who was afterward his great patron and even procured medals to be struck in honor of him he obtained the rank of physician to the fleet and a stipend from the citizens for giving lectures in botany and what at this time especially was highly favorable to the advancement of his character and fame by giving him an opportunity of displaying his abilities was the establishment of the royal academy of sciences at stockholm of which linnaeus was constituted the first president and to which establishment the king granted several privileges particularly that of free postage to all papers directed to the secretary by the rules of the academy the president held his place but three months at the expiration of which he made his oration de memorabilibus in insectis oct        in which he endeavors to excite an attention and enquiry into the knowledge of insects by displaying the many singular phenomenon that occur in contemplating the nature of those animals and by pointing out in a variety of instances their usefulness to mankind in particular and to the economy of nature in general  during all this time however linnaeus appears to have had his eye upon the botanic and medical chair at upsal at this time occupied by rudbeck who was far advanced in life we learn indeed that he was so intent on pursuing and perfecting his great designs in the advancement of his favorite study of nature that he had determined if he failed in procuring the professorship at upsal to accept the offer that had been made to him by haller of filling the botanic chair at gottingen however in course of time he obtained his wish in the year      upon the resignation of roberg he was constituted joint professor of physic and physician to the king with rosen who had been appointed in the preceding year on the death of rudbeck these two colleagues agreed to divide the medical departments between them and their choice was confirmed by the university rosen took anatomy physiology pathology and the therapeutic part linnaeus natural history botany materia medica the dietetic part and the diagnosis morborum  during the interval of his removal from stockholm to upsal in consequence of this appointment our professor was deputed by the states of the kingdom to make a tour to the islands of oeland and gothland in the baltic attended by six of the pupils commissioned to make such enquiries as might tend to improve agriculture and arts in the kingdom to which the swedish nation had for some time paid a particular attention awakened as it were by the desolating wars of charles the xiith to extend their commerce and cultivate the arts of peace the result of this journey was very successful and proved fully satisfactory to the states and was afterward communicated to the public  linnaeus on his return entered upon the professorship and pronounced before the university his oration de peregrinationum intra patriam necessitate oct         in which he forcibly displays the usefulness of such excursions by pointing out to the students that vast field of objects which their country held out to their cultivation whether in geography physics mineralogy botany zoology or economics and by showing the benefit that must accrue to themselves and their country as rewards to their diligence that animated spirit which runs through the whole of this composition renders it one of the most pleasing and instructive of all our authors productions that intimate knowledge which linnaeus himself had acquired of his own country by his repeated travels fraught as he was too with every requisite for making useful observations enabled him to point out with the utmost precision the most proper objects of investigation in every part of nature and his love to his country gave a zeal to his wishes that showed him on this occasion to great advantage not to add the aid arising from that selfcongratulation which he must feel having just gained by his late appointment the summit of his wishes  the iter oelandicum et gotlandicum in  o pp     were printed at stockholm in      in the swedish language as was also the iter scanicum in       o pp     we cannot help regretting that these itinera have not made their appearance in the english or some other language besides that of sweden for though in a country cultivated like ours many hints perhaps might not be drawn from these volumes of real importance to agriculture here yet they are so replete with curious and philosophical observations that they could not fail to be an acceptable present to the public as the general scope of these volumes is to adapt natural history to economical purposes in the iter gothlandicum et oelandicum linnaeuss instructions were directed principally to these particulars  he was to endeavor to find some kind of earth proper for making potteryware in imitation of the porcelaine of china he was to notice every production of nature that might supersede the necessity of the importation of any article used either in physic or manufactures and in fine he was to have a regard to every part of natural history in the execution of his plan however he went much farther than his commission extended having interspersed a number of observations relating to the antiquities of these islands the mechanic arts to the manners of the people their fishery and various other articles he was as might reasonably be expected unsuccessful in the first part of his commission since the two islands are almost entirely composed of limestone or coral rocks which abound in a remarkable degree in the baltic  as a proof of the little attention that had been paid to natural history in sweden we may observe that our author in this journey discovered above an hundred plants which before were not known to be indigenous many of which were such as are used in physic and in dyeing he pointed out to the natives several plants of great use in rustic economy and showed them the advantage of planting the seareed grass arundo arenaria to arrest the sand and form soil on the shores to which it is extremely well adapted by the length of the roots in the iter oelandicum there occurs a curious remark in vegetation confirming the annual increase of the wood in an oaktree in which was perfectly distinguished the hard winters of           and   0  by the narrowness of the circles in those years he describes the process for making tar as practiced by these islanders and further intersperses many observations relating to mineralogy in general to iron in particular with which sweden abounds describes the iron mountain taberg see phil transact vol xlix p  0 the alum mines of mockleby the poma chrystallina or aetites marmoreus which illustrates the formation of chrystals etc  in the iter scanicum performed in      our author treats largely on the culture of marshy grounds on the useful and noxious herbs for instance the stakan supposed to be the phellandrium aquaticum or water hemlock which it is believed renders horses that eat it paralytic on the gramen mannae or festuca fluitans the seeds of which are so particularly useful in fattening geese on the agaricus muscarius etc  in      on occasion of conferring a degree on dr j westman the professor delivered his third oration de telluris habitabilis incremento an elaborate and ingenious defense of that hypothesis which sir isaac newton and several other philosophers have inclined to that the proportion of water on the globe of this earth is constantly decreasing this leads the professor also to discuss the    d section of the philosophia  initio rerum ex omni specie viventium unicum sexus par creatum fuisse suadet ratio  the visible recession of the waters of the sea in diverse parts of the earth particularly apparent in the baltic had inclined the swedish philosophers to this opinion of sir isaac newtons the position of the philosophia he thinks naturally deducible from the foregoing hypothesis and necessarily so from the mosaic history in solving the difficulties attending the latter part of the hypothesis he is led by his subject to enter largely into a part of the economy of nature which renders his discourse highly interesting independently of ali conjectures relating to the main argument this relates to the various ways in which vegetables are disseminated and by which they find their way to every part of the globe to this effect winds rain rivers the sea animals etc are all subservient as well as the various structure and properties of the seeds themselves in illustrating which last affair the professor has taken great pains and constructed tables of the genera founded on these different properties of the seeds in the introduction to this oration our author turns the attention of his readers to some of the more remarkable discoveries that had lately been made in natural history and philosophy such were those relating to the polype rattlesnake and the senega etc among others also he mentions a remarkable fact that had been communicated by sauvages of montpelier respecting the effect of the berries of the coriaria myrtifolia spec pl      myrtleleaved sumach in occasioning instant epilepsy  the three orations of linnaeus are subjoined to the second volume of the amoenitates academicae printed in       in      the professor published his flora suecica exhibens plantas per regnum sueciae crescentes systematice cum differentiis specierum synonymis autorum nominibus incolarum solo locorum usu pharmacopoeorum  o holm pp          and again with many additions in      pp     the first edition contains    0 plants in the second they are increased by his own and the discoveries of his pupils to      no generical characters are introduced into this work but references made to them as they stand in the genera plantarum before spoken of a number of select synonyma is added to his own specific name under each plant and not only the swedish names in general but the provincial ones highly worthy this of imitation in works of this kind and quite necessary in so extensive a kingdom many of the rare plants are described at large and botanical criticisms added to many others in the last edition the author has interspersed a great number of curious observations relating to the economical and medical uses of the plants and has particularly noted those that are capable of being applied to the purposes of dyeing the author moreover never fails to mention euporistic medicines which he seems to think perhaps very justly have not been attended to by physicians as they deserve the plan of this work has been a pattern for all succeeding writers of local catalogues more especially those who have followed the linnaean system and has been very little improved by any perhaps excelled by none the plants of lapland are all included in this work and the preface besides the account of swedish authors on botany contains a curious division of the several provinces of the kingdom in respect to their different soils and situation as adapted to particular plants specifying under each province the plants found therein  in      appeared the fauna suecica sistens animalia sueciae regni mammalia aves amphibia pisces insecta vermes distributa per classes et ordines genera et species etc stockholm       o and again greatly augmented in      pp     the first edition contained    0 subjects the latter comprehends not less than      neither in this work are any classical ordinal or generical notes given at large the world had never seen so compendious and it may be truly said at the same time so complete a zoology before here as in plants the author has given to each animal a new specific name expressive as far as possible of its essential character the synonyms are added or referred to from almost every author on the subject and almost every animal is moreover compendiously described insects make a very considerable part of this catalogue near   00 species all found in that kingdom are enumerated distinguished and methodized in a manner entirely new and which has been adopted by nearly every writer on the subject since we shall speak more fully of the classification in the abstract intended to be given of the systema naturae a compendious manual of english zoology on this plan is a work much wanted though we think it could not fail to enhance its value if the tables of the genera were prefixed to each class and the characters to each genus as in the system of our author two plates of some of the rarer birds chiefly accompany this volume on which are explained the technical terms used in ornithology the number of each class of animals stands thus   mammalia       aves        amphibia       pisces       insecta         vermes        an accident having thrown into the hands of the professor an herbarium consisting of five large volumes of plants he discovered that it was the collection of the famous dr paul herman which had been made in the island of zeylon by that gentleman at the expense of the dutch east india company this herbarium had been lost for upwards of half a century until chance threw it into the hands of m gunther apothecary to the king of denmark who sent it to linnaeus requesting the professor to examine it and affix the names to the plants of this superb collection its great value as being collected by so eminent a man induced our author to examine the whole with great attention and he was thereby enabled to form many new genera and settle many doubtful species he published the result of his labor under the title of flora zeylanica sistens plantas indicas zeylonae insulae quae olim    0       lectae fuere a paulo hermanno professore botan leydensi demum post  0 annos ab a gunthero orbi redditae holm       o pp     tab    this work is yet of use as a pinax of these plants and as a linnaean catalogue of burmans thesaurus zeylanicus published in      and illustrated with the figures of upwards of  00 of these plants many of the rare species are described and a very copious number of synonyms added to several of the east indian plants the herbarium consisted of about   0 plants of which the true places in the system are assigned to upwards of  00 and the remainder were too imperfect to admit of distinction this volume is rendered valuable by a concise history of the progress of botany from the restoration of learning in the   th century a natural history of the island and its general produce the life of dr herman a short account of j hartog who was sent by dr sherard to make collections in this island and of burmans thesaurus zeylanicus linnaeus authenticates this herbarium to have been hermans by showing that the numbers and the plants answer to his museum zeylanicum published in       we now see linnaeus fixed in the situation that was so well adapted to his character his taste and abilities and which seems to have been the object of his ambition and center of his hopes soon after his establishment he labored to get the academical garden which had been founded in      put on a better footing and very soon effected it procuring also a house to be built for the residence of the professor the whole had been in ruin ever since the fire in   0  and at the time linnaeus was appointed professor of botany the garden did not contain above  0 plants that were exotic his correspondence with the first botanists in europe soon supplied him with great variety he received indian plants from jussieu of paris and from van royen of leyden european plants from haller and ludwig american plants from the late mr collinson mr catesby and others and variety of annuals from dillenius in short how much the garden owed to his diligence and care in a few years may be seen by the catalogue published under the title of hortus upsaliensis exhibens plantas exoticas horto upsaliensis academiae a sese linnaeo illatas ab anno      in annum      additis differentiis synonymis habitationibus hospitiis rariorumque descriptionibus in gratiam studiosae juventutis holm       o pp  0  tab   by this catalogue it appears that the professor had introduced   00 species exclusive of all the swedish plants and of varieties which latter in ordinary gardens amount not unfrequently to one third of the whole number the preface contains a curious history of the climate at upsal and the progress of the seasons through the whole year from these observations we learn that the greatest degree of heat in the summer of      at upsal was on the second day of july when celsiuss thermometer stood at  0 degrees above 0 that the greatest degree of cold on the   th of january    0 was    degrees below 0 in this thermometer the freezing point is 0 and boiling water  00 from seven years observations on the leafing of the oak it was found never to push before the  th of may or to be retarded beyond the   d  about this period it was that linnaeus made a remarkable discovery relating to the generation of pearls in the river pearlmuscle mya margaritifera syst      this shellfish must not be confounded with what is called the mother of pearl shell as that belongs to another genus is a seashell and an inhabitant of the warmer countries only the shellfish in question is found in rivers in all the northern parts of the world in norway and sweden it abounds it is found in the rivers of the county of tyrone in ireland and in those of donegall in scotland the don is said to abound with it and it is not unfrequent in the rivers of england this fish will bear removal remarkably well and it is said that in some places they form reservoirs for the purpose of keeping it and taking out the pearl which in a certain period of time will be again renewed from observations on the growth of these shells and the number of their annular laminae or scales it is supposed the fish will attain a very great age  0 or  0 years are imagined to be a moderate computation the discovery turned on a method which linnaeus found of putting these muscles into a state of producing pearls at his pleasure though the final effect did not take place for several years he says that in   or   years after the operation the pearl would have acquired the size of a vetch we are unacquainted with the means by which he accomplished this extraordinary operation but it was probably published at the time and considered as important since it is certain that the author was rewarded with a munificent praemium from the states of the kingdom on this account we regret that we cannot speak more fully on this head but may observe that it is probable from a paper published many years afterward in the berlin acts that the method consisted in injuring the shell externally perhaps by a perforation as it has been observed that these concretions in shellfish are found on the inside exactly opposite to perforations and injuries made from without by serpulae and other animals  from the time that linnaeus and rosen were appointed professors at upsal it should seem that the credit of that university as a school of physic had been increasing and the fact indeed is certain that numbers of students resorted thither from germany attracted by the character of these two able men and certainly in sweden itself many young men were invited to the study of physic by the excellent manner in which it was taught who otherwise would have engaged in different pursuits we must not deviate into the line of rosens department suffice it to say that these two eminent men by their united zeal and abilities failed not to exalt together with their own fame that of their university linnaeus in teaching the diagnosis morborum had adopted the plan with some alteration of m sauvagess nosology of which we shall be led to give some account hereafter in the year      he published for the use of his students materia medica liber i de plantis digestus secundum genera loca nomina qualitates vires differentias durationes simplicia modos usus synonyma culturas praeparata potentias composita holm       o pp     the compendious method in which this work is executed and the several useful preliminary papers annexed render it a very useful and instructive manual to students in medicine a materia medica of the vegetable kingdom in which every simple was ascertained by so able a botanist as linnaeus was a very considerable acquisition to science in this volume are arranged     subjects and several are for the first time reduced to their proper genera such are the ipecacuanha pareira brava coculi indici and others the method pursued in this volume is as follows the author gives    his own specific character of the plant    c bauhines synonym or if the plant was unknown to him that of the first discoverer    the country where it is produced in the same line is expressed by a single epithet whether it be an herb shrub or tree whether it be annual biennial or perennial also whether it be indigenous or if not whether it thrives well by common cultivation in gardens or requires defense from the cold of the winter in sweden or whether it will not endure that climate    the swedish officinal name what part is in use or what preparation of it if any and the doses of each    the sensible quality of the plant whether bitter aromatic acid astringent etc whether fragrant foetid or inodorous whether gummy resinous or milky its reputed quality whether uncertain wellknown and approved or whether to be cautiously used whether chiefly used in physic or for culinary purposes    its reputed effects on the human body whether purging emetic diuretic etc    the diseases in which it is most frequently prescribed    the compound medicines into which it enters in the swedish dispensatory  at the end of the volume is an index morborum with the simples appropriated to each and an index virium adapted to a preceding classification founded on their qualities or effects either on the solids or fluids of the human body  in the year      was published the first volume of a collection of theses in  o under the title of amoenitates academicae seu dissertationes variae physicae medicae et botanicae this publication has been continued from time to time to the completion of the seventh volume in the year      holm these volumes as soon as published were constantly reprinted in germany and holland as these academical dissertations were sustained under linnaeus in his professorial character and were selected by himself they have been regarded as of equal authority nearly with his own writings and many of them do in a particular manner extend and exemplify diverse parts of his works the subjects having been pointed out by himself in many instances for that purpose for these reasons we shall in the course of this volume give a very brief account of the purport of each dissertation since they contain a great variety of curious intelligence on the subjects of physic and natural history every where digested in the most scientific taste  whilst linnaeus was meditating one of his capital performances which had long been expected and greatly wished for he was interrupted by a very long and painful fit of the gout which left him in a very weak and dispirited state and according to the intelligence that his friends gave of him nothing was thought to have contributed more to the restoration of his spirits than the seasonable acquisition at this juncture of a collection of rare and undescribed plants  upon the recovery of his health he published his book philosophia botanica in qua explicantur fundamenta botanica cum definitionibus partium exemplis terminorum observationibus rariorum adjectis figuris aeneis stockh et amst       o pp     tab    this must be considered as the institutions of the linnaean system of botany and is a work which none who wish to be acquainted with the sexual system can be without as it is the authors own comment on his fundamenta first published in      and which are comprised in     aphorisms divided into    chapters the authors original intention was to have explained all these aphorisms at large in the manner that had been done in the bibliotheca botanica classes plantarum sponsalia plantarum critica botanica and vires plantarum but he says his numerous avocations did not allow him requisite time  chapter   exhibits a systematical distribution of the principal botanical writers and is that part which is treated of at large in the bibliotheca  chapter   systemata a view of all the botanical systems being a compend of the classes plantarum but here brought down somewhat later so as to comprehend the general view of van royens hallers and wachendorfs  chapter   plantae explains the terms used in describing the different kinds of roots stalks and leaves of plants  chapter   fructificatio describes the parts of fructification and defines all the terms used respecting their number figure proportion situation and uses  chapter   relates to the sexes of plants a subject which is more copiously treated in a paper called sponsalia plantarum printed in the first volume of the amoenitates academicae  chapter   characteres rules and definitions for establishing the characters of classes orders and genera  chapter   nomina rules for rightly forming generical names and those of orders and classes  chapter   differentiae rules for establishing the specific characters of plants  chapter   varietates rules for distinguishing varieties among plants  chapter  0 synonyma rules relating to the right disposition of synonymical names in botanic writings  the four chapters last mentioned make the subject of the critica botanica in which work every aphorism is much more largely explained than in the present  chapter    adumbrationes rules for properly describing and naming the species and for giving their complete history in a scientific manner  chapter    vires relates to the virtues of plants as deducible from their agreement in their characters as of the same genus the same natural order or class the subject of this chapter is treated in a more comprehensive manner in the vires plantarum printed in the first volume of amoenitates academicae to give a few instances however as illustrations  the scammony mechoacan turbith and sea bindweed are all species of the genus convolvulus and all agree in possessing a purgative quality the mallow marshmallow and cottonbush are so many distinct genera under a natural order called columniferous and agree in being all mucilaginous of the umbelliferous plants such as grow in dry places are aromatic and considered as sudorifics and carminatives those growing in watery places on the contrary are mostly of a quality to be justly suspected and not a few of them quite noxious plants of the papilionaceous class are all excellent food for cattle the syngenesious commonly bitters the coniferous class all evergreens and resinous are considered as diuretics  ten explanatory plates are added to this volume on which are described the different leaves and their situations on the stalk etc different stalks roots flowers etc the first part of these plates relating to the leaves had been given introductory to the hortus cliffortianus some new terms in botany which have been invented since the publication of the philosophia may be found in a paper under the title of termini botanici in the  th volume of the amoenitates  in this work of linnaeus it is difficult to determine whether we ought most to admire the genius of its author in his inventive power or that exquisite scientific arrangement which he has given to the whole and which both together constitute this a most excellent performance  at the end of the volume we meet with several curious fragments such are    directions to botanic pupils    the method of constructing an herbarium    method of conducting botanical excursions    method of laying out a botanic garden    plan for naturalists in traveling and constructing their journal with an enumeration of all those subjects that demand their attention    idea of a complete botanist some of the principal botanists are here enumerated    a compend of the philosophy of

synonymis selectis locis natalibus secundum systema sexuale digestas tom ii holm  o      pp   00 and a second time in      pp      to give this work its utmost perfection had been the authors object for many years and to this all his other botanic productions are in some measure only preparatory especially the local catalogues as the rightly ascertaining the species is the great object of all method in this work linnaeus takes in every plant that had come sufficiently under his own inspection seldom admitting any on the authority of others and wheresoever he has done it the plant is distinguished by a proper mark the plan of this work is in general agreeable to that of all his other local catalogues no other part of the system being exemplified except the species and as it is entirely botanical none of the uses of the plants are here introduced every plant has its specific name constructed according to the rules established in the eighth part of the philosophia botanica with a reference to all or any of his own works in which it has been mentioned before and the synonym is given if it be different from the present then follow the synonyms of the best authors and constantly where the plant is at all rare or newlydiscovered there is a reference to the best figures the country in which the plant grows is then added and frequently a symbol expressive of its duration whether annual biennial or perennial  in this work for the first time the professor has given to each plant what he calls a trivial name that is a single epithet which may be expressive as far as possible of the essential specific difference among the species of the genus this however can take place but rarely in other instances it is expressive of some the most striking and obvious difference and not seldom it is a local term or the name of the first discoverer the latter method could it have taken place would have had the advantage of conveying somewhat like a chronological history of each plant and at the same time perpetuating due credit to the discoverer these trivial names are printed in the margin to catch the eye instantly which is a great advantage the invention of trivial names the hint of which was probably borrowed from rivini by assisting the memory has much promoted the knowledge of plants and must be considered as a capital improvement their use in speaking of plants and forming compendious catalogues has been acknowledged by every botanist since the introduction of them  in the preface the author gives an ample account of the assistances he received and of the pains he had taken to bring this work to its present state to this end he specifies the countries he had traveled over the many botanic gardens he had visited the various excellent herbaria that he had examined in sweden holland england and france the names of his pupils educated under him and their various peregrinations from all which he reaped great advantages as from these he received various new plants and finally he acknowledges the many liberal communications of seeds and specimens sent to him from all parts of the world by the first botanists of the time  as this work contains all the plants of the known world which had come to linnaeuss knowledge or rather inspection which at the publication of these volumes appear to have amounted to about   00 species all varieties excluded the professed botanist has only to regret that it could not have been extended by the author himself to a complete pinax and history of every plant therein described  in this year also linnaeus published museum tessinianum opera ill comitis c g tessin regis regnique senatoris etc etc collectum holm      fol pp  0 tab    this is a description of the cabinet of linnaeuss first patron and great friend count tessin at that time preceptor to the prince royal now king of sweden who had spared no expense in collecting a rich museum principally consisting of subjects in mineralogy and particucularly abounding in fossils of the figured or extraneous kind the work is in swedish and latin and the tables represent several scarce and very valuable figured fossils not to be seen elsewhere  the petrifactions or figured fossils in this work are arranged in four orders founded on the different modes of the formation of them    fossilia commonly so called shells corals

quo animalia rariora imprimis et exotica quadrupedia aves amphibia pisces insecta vermes describuntur et determinantur latin et suetice fol      pp     tab    this splendid volume is frequently referred to by our author in his systema on account of the figures of so many of the rarer serpents and fishes here engraven of the former there are    species and of the latter    specimens of which are all preserved in spirits in the royal museum in the palace of ulricksdahl  the fame which our author had now acquired by his systema naturae of which a sixth edition much enlarged had been published at stockholm in      in  o pp     with eight tables explanatory of the classes and orders and which was also republished by gronovius at leyden had brought as it were a conflux of every thing rare and valuable in every branch of nature from all parts of the globe into sweden the king and queen of sweden had their separate collections of rarities the former at ulricksdahl as has just been mentioned the latter very rich in exotic insects and shells procured at a great expense at the palace of drottningholm these our author was employed in arranging and describing besides these the museum of the royal academy of upsal had been augmented by a considerable donation from the king whilst hereditary prince in      by another from count gyllenborg the year before by a third from m grill an opulent citizen of stockholm the contents of these three collections are given in the first volume of the amoenitates academicae we mention them here only to show that linnaeus now began to enjoy ample resources in every branch of natural history at home besides that many ingenious men who had been educated under him were now dispersed into various quarters of the globe and that from their letters he received great intelligence and satisfaction seeds and specimens of plants were sent him from siberia by gmelin from america by dr mitchel and governor coldingham from england by mr collinson mr ellis as also from his friends in holland and various other parts of europe and thus it will be seen that he began scarcely to feel the disadvantages of his northern situation  we shall now also begin to see the professor in a more elevated rank and situation in life his reputation had already procured him honors from almost all the royal societies in europe into the imperial academy he had been very early received and distinguished according to the custom of that institution with a classic name having most aptly been called dioscorides secundus and in the year      he received this honor from the royal society of london and his own sovereign truly sensible of his merit and greatly esteeming his character and abilities favored him with a mark of his distinction and regard by creating him a knight of the polar star it was now no longer laudatur et alget his emoluments kept pace with his fame and honors his practice in his profession became lucrative and we find him soon after possessed of his country house and gardens at hammarby about five miles from upsal he had moreover received one of the most flattering testimonies of the extent and magnitude of his fame that perhaps was ever shown to any literary character the state of the nation which conferred it with all its circumstances duly considered this was an invitation to madrid from the king of spain there to preside as a naturalist with the offer of an annual pension for life of  000 pistoles letters of nobility and the perfect free exercise of his own religion an offer not readily parallelled in the history of modern times that he did not accept of it is certain having after the most perfect acknowledgments of the singular honor done him returned for answer that if he had any merits they were due to his own country  in the year      the royal academy of sciences at stockholm honored our professor with one of the first premiums agreeably to the will of count sparre who had decreed two gold medals of ten ducats value each to be annually given by the academy to the authors of such papers in the preceding years stockholm acts as should be adjudged most useful in promoting agriculture particularly and all branches of rural economy this medal bore on one side the arms of the count with this motto  superstes in scientiis amor frederici sparre  linnaeus obtained it in consequence of a paper de plantis quae alpium suecicarum indigenae magno rei oeconomicae et medicae emolumento fieri possint and the ultimate intention was to recommend these plants as adapted to culture in lapland this paper was inserted in the stockholm acts for      vol xv  linnaeus also obtained the praemium centum aureorum proposed by the imperial academy of sciences at petersburgh for the best paper written to establish or disprove by new arguments the doctrine of the sexes of plants on this occasion the professor wrote his disquisitio de quaestione ab acad imper scient petrop in annum      pro praemio proposita sexum plantarum argumentis et experimentis novis praeter adhuc jam cognita vel corroborare vel impugnare praemissa expositione historica et physica omnium plantae partium quae aliquid ad faecundationem et perfectionem seminis et fructus confer creduntur ab eadem academia die   sept    0 in conventu publico praemio ornata petrop    0  o pp     apart from all foregoing arguments facts and experiments brought in support of this question the professor has in this little tract sufficiently proved by a series of new facts that the dust of the antherae analogically called the male parts is absolutely necessary to be shed on the stigma or female part in order to render the seed fertile his theory of vegetation prefixed to this paper is explained more at large in the prolepsis plantarum printed in the  th volume of the amoenitates  it was if possible an additional glory to linnaeus to have merited this premium from the petersburgh academy inasmuch as a professor of that society a few years before had with more than common zeal although with a futility like that of the other antagonists of our author endeavored to overturn the whole linnaean system of botany by attempting to show that the doctrine of the sexes of plants had no foundation in nature and was unsupported by facts and experiments  the great character of linnaeus and that of his colleagues particularly of rosen in the medical departments and their united endeavors had very considerably raised the credit of the university of upsal as we have before observed it is certain that the number of students are at this time nearly double what they are said to have been in accounts written  0 and  0 years ago the emulation excited among the students amply rewarded those gentlemen for their pains by the vast harvest of useful information flowing in particularly on the subjects of natural history from their pupils now dispersed in every part of the world many of these young men after being properly grounded in the principles of physic had with an ardour which nothing but the strongest love of science could inspire voluntarily undertaken the most distant and perilous voyages supported by the munificence of particular patrons or societies to gratify their taste in the pursuits of natural history and other useful knowledge several of these young men perished from change of climate or various other causes and much of the fruit of their labor was lost with them such was the fate of ternstroem at pulicandor in      of hasselquist who went into egypt and palestine and died at smyrna in      of loefling who died in cumana in      of the first of these we have no remains the papers of hasselquist were redeemed by the queen of sweden and published by linnaeus under the title of iter palaestinum in      in  o and those of loefling under the title of iter hispanicum in      to each of which is prefixed a short account of the author we have also the fruit of kalms journey in n america and of the voyage of osbeck and toren who both went chaplains to swedish east india ships these are here mentioned particularly as they are all translated and published since in the english language we yet deplore the more recent fate of forskal and his unfortunate associates in arabia and the more so since his posthumous pieces published at copenhagen in      are sufficient to convince us that the fruit of that expedition would have been rich and large had it not been so unfortunately blasted  there were also several others who made less remote journies for the same purpose such were l montin who visited lulalapmark in      m koehler who traveled into the southern part of italy in      dr solander who visited pitholapmark and tornolapmark in      where he made several discoveries and brought back diverse rare plants and other subjects in natural history which had escaped the diligence of his great master d rolander who visited surinam and st eustatia in      a r martin who searched greenland in      as c alstroemer did the southern parts of europe in    0 we do not mention others who revisited the isle of gothland in      and    0 after linnaeuss own tour into that place  the travels of these gentlemen afforded great sources of information and furnished materials for our author that proved very favorable to the last editions of his systema naturae and species plantarum insomuch that we shall see him exemplifying in a much more perfect and detailed manner his system of nature  this work as far as respected the vegetable kingdom had been separately and largely exhibited as before mentioned in the genera plantarum and the species given in the several florae of our author and finally in the species plantarum as yet however although it had passed through nine editions little more had appeared in the animal kingdom than the generical characters with a single specific name insomuch that the ninth edition at leyden in      was contained in a small octavo of     pages this it must be observed notwithstanding was only a republication of the authors sixth edition in      the scheme therefore cannot be considered as perfected by the author until the publication of the  0th edition in      the first part of which relating to the animal kingdom makes a volume of     pages and the same part in the   th and last edition is augmented by the addition of new subjects to      pages this work therefore published in two volumes at stockholm in      and      is to be considered as having received the authors finishing hand as far as possible since he professes to describe only such animals as had fallen under his own inspection except in some instances where his dependence upon other authority rendered it justifiable the title of this enlarged edition runs thus  systema naturae per regna tria naturae secundum classes ordines genera et species cum characteribus differentiis synonymis locis holm      i      ii      iii  tom i the animal kingdom in this volume after a philosophical history of the animal kingdom in general our author proceeds to the establishment of the classical characters previous to which he presents us with the natural division of animals arising from their different internal structure an arrangement partly established by aristotle and of which our own great naturalist mr ray has made considerable use in the introductory part of his synopsis animalium by this division all the animal kingdom naturally falls into six classes as follow animals having the heart furnished with two ventricles and auricles  blood warm and red viviparous mammalia oviparous birds one ventricle and auricle  blood cold and red respiration voluntary amphibia breathing by gills fishes one ventricle without auricle  sanies cold and colorless antennated insects tentaculated vermes  he then gives the natural characters at large of each class taking in with the foregoing internal structure all the differences arising from the lungs or other organs of respiration as gills from the maxillae jaws or mandibles the organs of generation those of sensation the teguments or outward covering and the fulcra or legs wings etc our plan does not admit of introducing these at large  at the head of each class is given a concise and most instructive description of the classical character so methodically constructed as to include at the same time an explanation of all the terms appertaining to that class concluding with a general mention of the best authors thereon  after this our author proceeds to the establishment of the natural characters of each order of the class respectively these also we must omit as inconsistent with our compendious view of the system and more especially the latter classes of this kingdom where the subjects are so numerous but in the four first classes we propose to give the artificial generical characters as they stand at the head of each order  class i mammalia this class comprehends not only all the animals which we call quadrupeds the lizard genus or rather the reptiles pedati excepted but also the cetaceous order or whales cachalots and porpesses this arrangement of whales with quadrupeds which did not take place in the first editions of this work has not been relished by some very respectable zoologists who wrote before linnaeus but our author thinks himself fully justified on account of the agreement of these animals in the structure of the heart in the respiration by means of lungs in their having moveable eyelids ears in being viviparous in being furnished with teats and in other particulars by which they differ so materially from fishes as to more than balance that single agreement in living in the same element  the mammalia are divided by our author into seven orders the distinctions of which are in this artificial arrangement principally established on the difference in the number situation and form of the three kinds of teeth namely the primores or incisores called foreteeth or cutting teeth the laniarii or canini called dogteeth canine or lacerating teeth and the molares double teeth or grinders linnaeus notwithstanding does not entirely neglect the feet as will appear from his description of the natural characters of the orders as well as from the following systematic arrangement of this class    digitated foreteeth none  bruta   foreteeth two canine none glires   foreteeth four canine single primates   foreteeth      0 conical canine single ferae      hoofed foreteeth above and below

enumerate the genera adding to the latter only the abbreviated characters  i primates animals furnished with foreteeth or cutting teeth four above parallel two pectoral teats  ii bruta no foreteeth

may be offended at the idea of being ranked with the beasts that perish he nevertheless stands as an animal in the system of nature at the head of this order and as such is here described with his several varieties observable in the different quarters of the globe in a manner and with an accuracy peculiar to our author and which we may venture to say is no where else to be met with but man is not left by linnaeus to contemplate himself merely as such but he is led to the consideration of what he ought to be as an intelligent and moral being in a comment on the grecian sages dictate know thyself by the true application of which he cannot but be sufficiently elevated above every humiliating idea which can otherwise arise from such an association    simia ape canine teeth separate

and giving the rank of species to several that were considered by our author as varieties have extended the number of mammalia to     species  class ii aves birds these are divided by linnaeus into six orders the distinctions of which are chiefly taken from the beak but in some genera it has been necessary to call in the tongue nares or nostrils and in some instances the feet and other parts we

class of birds are deduced from a great variety of particulars in several as in the falcon genus the color of the cere or naked tunic that surrounds the basis of the beak and the color of the legs assist in distinguishing the species the color of the bird in general is subject to great variation in different countries as well as in the same country at different seasons in the year as is more particularly seen in the arctic regions not to mention that of the sexes in almost all kinds our author therefore does not trust to this wherever a more permanent mark can be found it must however be confessed that in too many instances it is necessary to trust entirely to this distinction howsoever unstable the form of the tail as it happens to be even cuneated or forked is an excellent and firm note in the parrot genus its length as shorter or longer than the body is of great service in others the color of the beak a naked or crested head contribute to form the note of distinction and in fine nature has stamped upon others some peculiarity which points them out immediately as the receptacle of the lower mandible in the pelican two long tailfeathers in the tropicbird the direction of the mandibles in the crossbeak etc among the common marks none more frequently occur than the differences of color in the quillfeathers and those of the tail this class comprehends upwards of   0

the reptiles order the specific characters of the testudo genus are deduced principally from the difference in the shells and the feet which in the turtles are pinniform and in the tortoises digitated in the lacerta genus from the tail head toes and various other parts and in the rana from the diversity in the make of the body and number of the claws on the fore or hinder feet  in the serpents order the specific distinctions have ever been matter of great difficulty with naturalists as they were commonly taken from the color which is subject to an almost infinite variation hence it has happened that seba depending on the colors alone has in the opinion of our author figured the boa constrictor or gigantic serpent ten times as so many distinct species and the coluber naga or hooded viper fourteen linnaeus at length discovered a much more certain and permanent note upon which his specific characters are solely founded it was first exemplified in the amphibia gyllenborgiana and he has since retained it in all his works sensible however that it is yet liable to failure this arises from the number of the small shields and scales or rings and rugae of the belly and tail and the proportion those numbers bear to each other in the different species for example in our common viper the shields of the belly are usually about     and the scales of the tail that is all below the anus about    or  0 the shields in our common snake about   0 and the scales about  0  in the nantes the specific characters are short but very various in the different genera as to the parts of the animal from which they are deduced in the petromyzon and raia from the mouth fins teeth etc in the latter very much from the body itself in the squalus from a variety of particulars in the acipenser from the cirri or beard and the dorsal shields or squamae in the balistes from the fins and tail in the ostracion from the different angulated form of the body in the tetrodon from differences in the body chiefly and in the remaining genera from the form of the body and the differences in the fins  class iv pisces fishes in the earlier editions of the systema naturae our author in the distribution of fishes had followed the method of his friend and fellow collegian artedi whose icthyology he had published during his residence in holland in      this method which took in the cetaceous order now among the mammalia and the nantes now referred to the amphibia was established on the structure or rather situation of the tails in the cetaceous order and in others on the difference in the gills and the rays of the fins whether cartilaginous or bony in the two last editions another disposition is attempted after having dismissed the cetaceous order to the mammalia and the chondropterygii or cartilaginous fishes and the branchiostegi to the nantes our author forms four orders of the bony fishes which respire by means of gills only from the situation of the ventral fins which he analogically considers as the feet of the animal according as they are placed either before under or behind the pectoral or gill fins or as in one order wanting the ventral fins  i apodes apodal

class by later discoveries among which those made by dr forskal in arabia are not the least as appears by his fragments lately published  great pains were taken by artedi and since by gronovius and our author to distinguish the species by the number of the rays in the fins and although from repeated observations they are found to agree in many species very remarkably yet in others they vary so much as not to establish a sufficient character at present in this system the specifical characters are taken from a great variety of particulars amongst which however the number of the rays in the fins is frequently the most distinctive and whether so or not it is subjoined to most species and usually as they have been observed by different authors the form of the tail the cirri or beard at the mouth the length of the jaw the spots and lines on the body etc all conspire in their turn to the same end  class v insecta insects no part of the system of nature has undergone a greater change than this class neither does our author stand more unrivalled than in the excellent arrangement he has given to this branch of natural history which before his time was nearly without method it comprehends    genera disposed into seven orders founded in most of them on the differences observable in the number and texture of the wings our intended brevity will not permit a detail of the genera in the succeeding parts of the system we must therefore now that we are descended to the inferior parts of the animal kingdom only give the definitions of the several orders with a few observations the first order is called  i coleoptera insects having the wings covered with two crustaceous cases divided by a longitudinal suture  this order is the most numerous it contains almost all those insects which go under the general name of beetles and includes upwards of  00 species ranked under  0 genera among these are the chafers stagbeetles leathereaters carrionbeetles tortoisebeetles ladyflies honeybeetles weevils muskbeetles glowworm springbeetles waterbeetles blisterbeetle rovebeetle earwig and several other genera  ii hemiptera halfwinged insects having the shells or cases semicrustaceous not divided by a straight suture but incumbent on each other in the margin the beak curved inwards  this order contains about   0 species under    genera among these are the cockroach camelcricket locusts and common crickets lanthornfly flealocust boatfly etc bug a numerous genus aphis or currantlouse cochinealinsect and others  iii lepidoptera insects with four wings imbricated or clothed with fine scales or feathers tongue spiral and coiled up body hairy  this order contains only three genera but the species are very numerous nearly  00 the butterflies hawkmoths and the moths or phalenae of the latter linnaeus enumerates   0 species this being the most beautiful tribe of insects has been much sought after and later entomologists have considerably increased this number  iv neuroptera insects with   naked transparent or reticulated wings tail in most kinds without a sting  upwards of  0 species in   genera among these are the dragonfly mayfly springfly pearlfly scorpionfly etc  v hymenoptera insects with   membranaceous wings excepting some few species which are destitute of wings females with the tail armed with a sting  this is a numerous order it contains   0 insects in  0 genera among these are the sawfly or tenthredo tailedwasp ichneumonfly ichneumonwasp wasp be ant and golden wallfly etc  vi diptera insects with two wings furnished also with a balance or club behind each wing  this order under  0 genera contains near   0 species among which are the gadflies gnats common fleshfly waspfly horsefly beefly and others  vii aptera insects without wings in either sex  this order contains   0 species under    genera and falls easily into three divisions    with   legs the sugarmite groundflea deathwatch louse common flea    with   to    legs the tickspiders scorpion crab kingcrab and millepede    with numerous legs the centipede and gallyworm  in forming the genera under each of these orders the antennae hold a principal rank and particularly in the coleoptera but the author does not trust to them alone the elytra or outward cases the head the rostrum or mouth the thorax and tail and indeed in almost every genus some or other of them are called in to assist in forming the character  in the hemiptera the rostrum gives a note of primary use but here the antennae wings and feet come in also  in the lepidoptera the antennae and wings form the character  in the neuroptera the mouth wings and tail  in the hymenoptera the mouth the wings and the sting  in the diptera the mouth or proboscis alone  in the aptera the eyes the tail and the number of the feet etc  class vi vermes the sixth and last class contains the vermes which are divided into five orders linnaeus very early adopted the new system of peysonnel jussieu and some others in introducing the corals and corallines into the animal kingdom under the names of lithophyta and zoophyta this system has had great light thrown upon it by the late excellent mr ellis in his history of corallines and several papers printed in the philosophical transactions  as this is by far the most anomalous of all the classes the characters of the orders are very various    intestina animals simple naked destitute of limbs  this order includes   genera among which are the guineaworm ascarides earthworm gourdworm leech etc it contains but    species  ii mollusca animals simple naked not included in a shell but furnished with limbs  this order includes    genera containing   0 species among these rank the common naked snail sea hare of rondeletius doris sea mouse nereis ascidia actinia or sea anemone tethys cuttlefish sea lungs or blubbers starfish and echinus called sea hedgehog and others  iii testacea animals generally of the foregoing order but included in a shell  this order takes in the whole tribe of shells consisting of upwards of  00 species under    genera and disposed in a method entirely new the three first genera are the multivalves the next fourteen bivalves and the remainder univalves  iv lithophyta composite animals affixed to and fabricating a fixed calcareous base called coral  this order contains    species under four genera the tubipora red tubular coral madrepores or brain stones millepores and another called cellepore  v zoophyta animal composite resembling a flower and springing from a vegetating stem  this order contains    genera of which nine are fixed and the other locomotive amongst the former rank the isis or red coral sea fan alcyonium sponge corallines etc among the latter the polype sea pens taenia furia and lastly the assemblage of chaotic or microscopical animalcula the species under this order are      the generical distinctions among the intestina arise from the diversity of the body of the animal almost solely  in the mollusca from the body and feelers called tentacula and from other parts  in the testacea the included animal the general differences between the shells themselves but principally the cardo or hinge in the bivalves and the aperture in the univalves furnish the generic note  in the lithophyta the inhabitant animal and the form of the coral itself and in the zoophyta the animal and the very different forms of the fabrifications lay a foundation for the generic notes  after having thus exhibited a view of the classes it remains that we give a general account of the method pursued in treating on each species to this end it must be observed that throughout the whole system the classical character that of the order and the generical note always make a part in the description of each species after these our author begins with his own specific name for the animal established upon the most essential difference observable between that and every other species of the genus and here it must be allowed that he has in general happily succeeded by giving in the space of two or three lines a distinction that more immediately points out the animal sought for than the long and labored descriptions of many foregoing authors if the specific name is the same that is adopted in any of his former writings he refers to it he has however in many parts of this enlarged edition formed new names to animals noticed in the former edition and in the fauna suecica where indeed the essential or specific distinction is the point in view this must frequently be the case so long as new species continue to come in for as the essential character of each species results from the most careful comparison of the whole genus the introduction of a new one must in many instances so clash with the old as to require perhaps a total alteration in every specific name of the genus  after his own specific name he gives the synonyms and page of the most reputed and authentic writers in each class and particularly refers to those who have best figured his subject then the locus natalis and in many instances more especially among the mammalia and aves a short but comprehensive history respecting the nature economy and uses of the animal to every animal the author has affixed his trivial name expressive most commonly of place where it is found of its color form or some quality or attribute descriptive as far as may be of the animal or in a great variety of cases where the subject has been well known by a single term he retains that as his trivial name to instance in the partridge and quail which both belong to his genus established under the name tetrao he therefore calls the former tetrao perdix and the latter tetrao coturnix  it has been objected to linnaeuss classification in various parts of his system that he has thrown together subjects too different in their general appearance and economy by keeping too closely to one character to instance particularly in the mammalia by confining himself to the teeth to this it may be answered in general that if only quadrupeds were to be classed no system needed to have be built as their number is so small but when it is recollected that all nature was under his eye and that therefore the subjects were almost infinite it became necessary to form the basis of every great division or class as far as possible on one simple foundation and perhaps it is the observance of this rule that has given linnaeuss system so greatly the advantage over all foregoing writers for as nature does not seem to have observed any system ours must be artificial and will ever have its anomalies as an artificial system therefore that must have the preference which will most readily lead to the subject under investigation in which case it is of small importance where it is placed and how far removed from others with which it seems to bear a similar and general appearance  we shall close this brief view of the arrangement of animals by exhibiting the number of subjects enumerated all of which are synonymed by the author in the   th edition of his system  mammalia     insects  0   birds     vermes      amphibia     various from the mantissae   0 fishes     total        with the first tome of the systema naturae is intimately connected a work of the professors published under the title of museum ludovicae ulricae reginae in quo animalia rariora exotica imprimis insecta et conchylia describuntur et determinantur prodromi instar editum holm       o pp   0 this was drawn up and published by order of the queen of sweden who had constructed a copious and rich cabinet of natural history at the palace of drottningholm the subjects of which as has been observed linnaeus had been appointed to arrange the great expense her majesty had bestowed in procuring particularly insects and fhells had given this collection an advantage that proved very favorable to our author by throwing in his way a multitude of fine and very expensive objects which otherwise probably he could have had no opportunity of describing and these were fortunately all collected before the publication of the enlarged editions of the system  in this work the exotic insects and shells only are introduced of the former     and of the latter     with twentyfive of the mollusca the insects chiefly consist of the large and beautiful lepidoptera and the shells abound with all their elegant varieties these are described at large with all that precision brevity and accurate arrangement of the several parts which every where manifests itself so happily in our authors writings both in entomology and conchology a new language is introduced and these descriptions may well stand as models for future writings  annexed to this work is the second part or rather only the prodromus of the museum adolphi frederici regis in quo animalia rariora imprimis et exotica aves amphibia pisces describuntur      pp   0 in this additional volume are described at large     subjects of the animal kingdom all belonging to the first four classes and all acquired since the publication of the first part in      throughout the whole system linnaeus has referred to these books for descriptions at large to all the exotics and nothing could be more acceptable to the critical zoologist than to see the plan of this volume perfected through the whole history of animals  tom ii the vegetable kingdom the second part of the systema naturae relating to vegetables in all the editions prior to the tenth was very compendiously exhibited the author having after his clavis classium only given the names of the genera with their essential or abbreviated characters without touching at all on specific distinctions which were reserved for the present enlarged edition of the system and for the species plantarum a work before spoken of this volume contains upwards of   0 pages and in the twelfth edition of      by the accession of new materials is enlarged to     it contains in a most compendious manner a view of the whole vegetable kingdom as far as the subjects thereof had come under our authors own inspection disposed according to that system of which linnaeus had been the inventor founded as to the classical part upon the sexes of plants a system now almost universally received it is in this branch of the study of nature that this great naturalist has so distinguished himself from him botany boasts a new era and haller one of the first writers of this age in the same line of science and who alone might dare to rival him has with a liberality of mind becoming a great man allowed this superiority to linnaeus  before we proceed to a particular account of this part of the system it may not be improper to premise some observations on methods of botany in general before our author wrote it is needless to urge the necessity of method in the study of nature as it is the very soul of science and amidst such a multitude of objects which the vegetable kingdom affords all attempts toward the acquisition of knowledge without it must end in uncertainty and confusion we have sufficient proofs of this in the writers upon plants before the invention of systems and see and deplore the want of them in the loss of many valuable articles not only in the materia medica but in the materia pictoria and tinctoria of the ancients articles the virtues and properties of which appear to have been well ascertained are now lost to us for want of a more scientific arrangement of the subjects and accuracy in the descriptions of them  botanic writers chose very different methods of arranging plants not only before but since the invention of systematic botany the alphabetic has been much followed especially in local catalogues some have disposed the plants according to the time of flowering as pauli in his quadripartitum botanicum published in      bester in the hortus eystettensis    0 and dillenius in the catalogus gissensis      others have arranged them according to the different places of their growth as the authors of the historia lugdunensis in      and some according to their virtues in medicine others again observing that numbers of vegetables agreed with each other in their general habit and appearance or had a certain harmony and proportion in the form and disposition of their roots leaves flowers or fruit in their particular mode of growing flowering or foliation saw that they naturally fell as it were into classes agreeable to such distinctions hence their division of trees into pomiferae pruniferae bacciferae nuciferae glandiferae etc of herbs into bulbosae siliquosaeumbelliferae verticillatae papilionaceae etc these were so many classes or orders which nature had so characterized that they could not escape their notice and could all the subjects of the vegetable kingdom be properly reduced to such combinations and the whole chain properly connected we should then see what is meant by the natural method that ultimum et desideratum of botany of which our author says however nec sperare fas est quod nostra aetas systema quoddam natural videre queat et vix seri nepotes nevertheless the best writers of the last century such were john and caspar bauhine endeavored to preserve the abovementioned arrangement although it was in a rude manner in this they were followed by our own countrymen gerard and parkinson but as they established no precise definitions to their classes so in their subdivisions or chapters they paid little or no regard to the minuter parts of distinction taken from the fructification hence nothing like generical notes can be discovered in their methods so that the only resource in finding many of their plants was to read over their long and tedious descriptions which after all were frequently insufficient to distinguish the plant sought for  that great naturalist conrade gesner who died in      in his  0th year appears to have been the first who thought with any precision of a method of classing plants from the flower or fruit but he only slightly touches thereon in his epistles he lived not to bring any thing to perfection in this way it was reserved for caesalpinus physician to pope clement viii to be the first author who arranged plants in a true systematic manner in his libri de plantis published in      in which he establishes the characters principally from the fruit it is wonderful that after his time though so many eminent botanists flourished among whom were the two bauhines no one ever thought of pursuing the plan he laid down until morison and ray who both published nearly together their separate systems founded also upon distinctions principally drawn from the fruit since their time others have labored to bring their systems to perfection as knaut in germany paul herman and boerhaave in holland and dillenius late professor at oxford had still farther perfected mr rays method as is evident from the arrangement he has given to the british plants in the third edition of that authors synopsis  several elegant systems have also been formed from the flower as the basis of the classical character in considering which both the regularity and irregularity as well as the number of the petals have been made the principal distinction rivini at leipsic in    0 was the first who took the flower as the foundation of his method as did ruppius in      but no one carried this method to such perfection as tournefort in      who forms his classical character from the figure of the flower and establishes his orders or subdivisions on the different situation of the fruit whether above or below the empalement or receptacle  besides these methods in which the authors have considered one part only either flower or fruit as the base of their systems several others have been constructed of late years in which vegetables have been arranged as far as possible according to what have been called the natural classes the foundations of which take in a numerous set of characters arising from a combination and agreement in the habit of the plants as well as their harmony in the essential parts of fructification among these that of van royen late professor at leyden is among the most elegant attempts toward this ultimum in botany this is exhibited in the prodromus florae leydensis    0 he is followed by gmelin in the flora sibirica      etc these authors as also l gerard in his flora galloprovincialis paris      preserve the natural generical characters of linnaeus almost entire through their systems and the latter writer has with some variations taken the orders of a natural method constructed by b jussieu for his classes haller also planned and brought to great perfection a method of this kind as is exhibited in his enumeratio stirpium helvetiae      and in the hortus gottingensis      which he has since still more elaborated in a work of infinite labor and merit the historia stirpium helvetiae   tom fol       linnaeus himself very early attempted a natural method but it is evident he thought there were too many links wanting in the chain to render it the readiest guide to botanical science since he soon deserted it although he continued to improve it to the last however he only reduced the genera into orders but did not venture so far as to form the classical part of a system on that plan the present learned and indefatigable professor dr hope at edinburgh whose zeal and success in cultivating and diffusing the principles of the linnaean system are well known has constructed perhaps the most elaborate attempt of this kind that the botanists have ever seen we join with many others in wishing that he may be enabled to give it all that perfection which may encourage him to present it to the public  methods have also been formed from the different species and arrangement of the calyx or cup of the flower in plants professor magnol of montpelier published in    0 on this plan and linnaeus himself in      but he did not pursue it  every method of arrangement has its advantage in some respect or other and it is surely rather to be regretted howsoever the flower may claim the preference that a method founded in the distinctions of the fruit should not also have as it were a secondary place in common use for as all artificial methods are only supposed to be so many succedanea to the natural one a due attention to each might tend to illustrate the natural classes to connect them and reduce the anomalies and so far pave the way to the accomplishment of that scheme which however will yet by many be considered as quite impracticable in botany  linnaeus was the first who constituted the stamina and pistils as the basis of an artificial method of arranging plants and he tells us in his classes plantarum he was led to this by considering the great importance of these parts in vegetation they alone are the essentials necessary to fructification all other parts except the anthera and stigma being wanting in some flowers and the present philosophy of botany regards the former as the male and the latter as the female organs of generation in plants as such indeed they must be considered analogically and in a philosophical view yet perhaps the linnaean system admirable as it is would not have been less acceptable had the classical terms been expressive only of number and situation without regard to the offices of the parts in framing the terms ludwig of leipsic who has endeavored to combine the systems of rivinus and linnaeus by taking his classes from the method of the former and his orders from that of the latter has avoided this mode of expression in substituting the terms monantherae monostylae etc etc  the author begins the new and enlarged edition of the systema vegetabilium of      by premising a compendious view of the philosophy of vegetation and then proceeds to what he calls delineatio plantae something analogous to what he had entitled in the editions prior to the  0th methodus demonstrandi vegetabilia here he introduces all the terms he makes use of in describing plants and by a methodical and apt disposition of them really explains them at the same time after this he gives the clavis et characteres classium and then comes to the system itself  the prerogative of any artificial system in botany is supposed to consist in its keeping together as much as possible the genera in what are called the natural classes or orders and thus so far approaching to the system of nature all artificial systems being founded on some or other or all the parts of fructification without regard to habit will be found in many instances to break the order of the natural classes and disjoin genera which nature seems to have classed the more simple and uniform the classical characters of any system are the more they are likely to interfere in this respect nevertheless it is pleasing to observe how well many of the natural classes are kept together in the linnaean system the characters of which enjoy the advantage of being very simple and easy to retain in the memory and of being founded on the parts of plants as little subject to variation as any whatever yet like all other methods it has its defects of which no one was more sensible than the author himself there are many instances of particular species that break through the generical and classical characters of the system itself but for these defects there is no other remedy at present than that which our author has applied in the volume under consideration and which ought ever in arrangements of this kind to be rigidly observed wherever these anomalies take place they are mentioned among the fictitious characters under the class and order to which the number of stamina or pistils entitle them to a place  the sexual system briefly is as follows  all known plants are divided into    classes the characters of which are established upon the number or different situation or arrangement of the stamina or male organs and the orders or subdivisions of these classes as far as possible on a similar number situation or arrangement of the pistils or female organs  the first twenty classes contain what the author calls hermaphrodite flowers or such as have the stamina and pistils both within the same cup or petals or standing on the same receptacle where those are wanting of these twenty the first ten classes proceed in an uninterrupted series from monandria to decandria the plants of each having as many stamina as the title expresses  the   th class is dodecandria as there are no plants yet discovered which have only eleven stamina  the   th icosandria such plants as have about  0 stamina or more but always arising from the calyx or corolla and not from the receptacle  the   th polyandria such as have from twenty to even a thousand stamina but always arising from the receptacle  the   th class didynamia such as have four stamina two long and two short the essential character of this class does not consist in the number of stamina otherwise the plants might be referred to the tetrandria class but in having two of the stamina shorter than the other one pistil only and an irregularlyshaped corolla  the   th tetradynamia plants with six stamina four long and two short  the   th monadelphia such as have the stamina not distinct at the base but united into one body  the   th diadelphia such as have the stamina united at the base into two bodies  the   th polyadelphia such as have the stamina united at the base into several bodies  the   th syngenesia such as have the antherae but not the filaments coalescing together so as to form a tube or cylinder through which the pistil is commonly transmitted  the  0th gynandria such as have the stamina springing from the pistil itself  the   st monoecia such as have separate male and female flowers on the same plant  the   d dioecia such as have separate male and female flowers on separate plants  the   d polygamia such as have constantly besides hermaphrodite flowers others either male or female on the same plant  the   th cryptogamia containing those plants the mode and organs of whose fructification are not yet sufficiently ascertained heretofore called imperfect plants  the secondary part of the system the orders or subdivisions of the foregoing classes are established on the number of the pistils or female parts through a considerable part of the system but in other parts from various characters thus  the arrangement from number is pursued no farther than through the first thirteen classes that is so long as the classical character uninterruptedly depends on the number of stamina so long the orders likewise depend on the number of pistils but when situation or different arrangement take place the orders are most commonly founded on other distinctions which we shall briefly specify  the   th class or didynamia is divided into gymnospermia and angiospermia the former having four naked seeds the latter having the seeds enclosed in a seedvessel  the   th tetradynamia has two orders according to the size and shape of the pod or shale siliculosa short and siliquosa long  the orders in the three next classes monadelphia diadelphia and polyadelphia are formed from the number of the stamina  those of the syngenesia class are six in five of which the plants are polygamiae and in the remaining one monogamiae and the differences in the orders of the former arise from the different structure or sex of the floscules constituting the whole flower  in the  0th class gynandria the arrangement of the orders arises from the number of the stamina as in the   th   th and   th classes  in the   st and   d classes the monoecia and dioecia the classical characters of the foregoing parts of the system are adopted as characters of the orders as far down as to the monoecia class itself thus the first order of those classes contains monandrous plants and the last gynandrous  the   d the polygamia class is divided into three orders as the plants are monoecious dioecious or trioecious  the   th and last class cryptogamia is divided into four orders containing the filices musci algae and fungi  some examples of plants throughout all the classes and orders of the

morels app palmae      genesis date coconut cabbagepalm the genera are established upon the assemblage of all the parts of fructification compared together according to their number figure proportion and situation of these we have spoken before as they constitute a large volume in octavo to which we refer  but besides these natural characters or genera at large our author has invented for brevitys sake two other kinds of characters which he calls factitious and essential the former serve to distinguish each genus from other genera of the same artificial order only by enumerating the most remarkable differences these greatly facilitate the labor of a young botanist the essential characters could they be rendered perfect are designed to distinguish the genera from each other in the natural orders but they are not complete as yet except in a few instances and possibly they exist but in a small number nevertheless they are attempted through the whole system to save the trouble of turning over the natural characters at large  as this volume was intended to contain all the plants hitherto known consequently the natural characters could not be introduced but the fictitious and essential ones are placed the former at the head of each class and the latter before each genus with each generical name the author refers to the number where it is exhibited at large in the last edition of the genera plantarum in      and to the page of the species plantarum of      where the species are detailed and the synonyms added as he gives in this volume only the specific name invented by himself  in forming the last branch of the system the specific names linnaeus has done more than all the writers on the subject had done before him and taken the utmost pains to fix them upon distinctions as permanent and invariable as possible this is indeed the ultimate object of all method and on this plan he has given new specific names to all the plants that have come to his knowledge names not taken as had been customary before from that of the discoverer the likeness of the plant to other species place of growth time of flowering its size the color of the flower or of the plant smell taste or virtues in medicine or any other such vague indefinite or mutable circumstance but from some remarkable difference in the root trunk stalk and particularly the leaf foliation ramification or some other abiding distinction  besides these specific names or descriptions linnaeus has invented and in all his works after the first edition of the species plantarum in      has applied what he calls trivial names to each plant consisting of a single adjunct to the generical name expressive if possible of some essential distinction of the species as for instance integrifolia laciniata erecta repens aquatica montana etc sometimes of the name of the inventor and where from the laws of his fundamenta botanica he has been obliged to change the generical name of a plant well known before and especially if it was an officinal one he frequently retains the old generical name as his trivial epithet thus as the pennyroyal or pulegium really belongs to the mentha genus according to his characters he therefore calls it mentha pulegium the horseradish known by the old name armoracia as it agrees with the cochlearia genus he calls cochlearia armoracia  the varieties of plants which for want of fixing true specific characters had almost increased the number of plants double what linnaeus thinks they really are in this work as in the species are totally excluded our author has indeed in the opinion of many of his contemporary botanists carried this matter too far in disallowing the name of species to many plants that are thought to have sufficiently permanent distinctions  to conclude the space of time elapsed since the publication of the genera and species plantarum together with the vast quantity of new materials acquired from all parts of the world enabled our author greatly to elaborate this last edition and to amend very many generical and specific characters as also to make many removes tending greatly to the advancement and perfection of his work among these removes many have taken place particularly in the monoecious dioecious and polygamous classes which is the less to be wondered at since observations have confirmed that there are plants of these classes which in their younger state have produced only male flowers afterward both male and female and at length only female  the species plantarum contains near seven thousand three hundred plants in this volume the number is augmented by the addition of new plants and such as were unknown by our author before to above seven thousand eight hundred  it is proper to remark that this second tome of the system was immediately preceded by mantissa plantarum generum editionis sextae et specierum editionis secundae holm      pp     in which are described as in the genera plantarum the natural characters at large of fortyfour genera newly constructed these are followed by an enumeration of upwards of four hundred and thirty new species with their synonyms as in the species plantarum all these plants are included in the volume of the system of which we have just given the account  tom iii the fossil kingdom we are now to accompany our author into the fossil kingdom in which though he very early gave a specimen of his method of classing he did not fully exemplify as in vegetables until the year      when the third tome of the   th edition of the systema was published containing the regnum lapideum this volume makes     pages and is concluded with a short appendix of some unnoticed or not well described animals and vegetables together with a general index of the authors own generical names throughout every part of the system distinguishing by a different type the subjects of the three kingdoms the whole amounting to    0 genera  in arranging fossils there have been various methods invented each of which have had their patrons and for different purposes each have their advantage some have founded the basis of their system on the figure color structure and other external and visible characters yet scarcely ever trusting solely to these they called in the aid of chemistry so far at least as the mineral acids would assist them others as the professed chemists and metallurgists have established their arrangement chiefly on chemical principles as more immediately leading to the origin of fossil bodies in general on which it must be acknowledged the best basis for a system must be built when we are happy enough to get sufficient light for this purpose and at present mineralogists throughout the world seem more intent on this view than ever and probably the due consideration and extension of the volcanic system will open new sources of information in this way  this volume begins with linnaeuss own theory of the origin of fossil bodies in general and their several combinations into those forms in which we meet with them in the body of the earth the methodical and abbreviated manner in which our author has here given his philosophy of fossil bodies renders it incapable of an abstract he then proceeds to give a synoptical or classical view of the several systems of arranging those bodies as they stand exhibited in the best authors on the subject beginning with bromelius who published in    0 and enumerates wallerius in      woltersdorf in      cartheuser in      justi      anomymus cronstedt in      and concludes with vogel in      to each of these he has subjoined short remarks relating to their methods and theory of fossil bodies and concludes this introductory part with an explanation of the terms of art used in his own work  in these termini artis our author with his usual precision has defined a set of terms equally new and curious which are principally adapted to and used in the ultimate and most difficult part of the system the specific characters they are happily framed to express all differences in the figures of fossil bodies in their crust or outward appearance their superficies their component particles or fibers in their texture whether plated fissile etc in their hardness or in their color the alterations they undergo by solution whether by acids or by fire  it has been doubted by some of the most respectable mineralogists whether we ought to descend below what are called generical distinctions in the fossil kingdom so infinitely do the subjects thereof vary and so imperceptible in general is that gradation by which they run into each other in the various combined forms in which they are found in the earth in the mean time some distinctions of this kind seem quite necessary in systems established principally on external characters those which have for their basis the elementary or constituent principles of bodies as analyzed may stand with propriety in the form of synoptical tables as exemplified in cronstedts mineralogy linnaeus and wallerius were among the first who attempted the arduous task of fixing the specific characters whether future mineralogists will adhere to and improve this part of the scheme time only must show  in all systems of the fossil kingdom writers have been more particularly embarrassed by the earths and stones especially when those have been more or less reduced to the state of ores by the admixture of metallic principles salts inflammables and metals generally falling more easily and almost naturally into their several classes or orders the chemical systematics and metallurgists begin usually with the earths considering them as the basis of stones linnaeus begins with the latter professing to take a middle way between the mere metallurgist and those who characterize from external appearance only he divides the whole regnum lapideum into three classes under the names of petrae minerae and fossilia each being subdivided into several orders the whole comprehending    genera we must only give a general account of his classical characters and those of the orders and enumerate the genera under each with some of the most distinguished species  class i petrae stones fossil bodies originating from a terrene principle by cohesion  simple as being destitute of saline inflammable and metallic

the organs of taste  under this order are arranged to the great offense of most mineralogists all the gems or precious stones notwithstanding their texture and insolubility as also many other lapidose chrystallized bodies to this our author tells us he was led by considering that all regular polyedrous figures or bodies in the mineral kingdom are the result of chrystallization which can only take place under requisite and certain degrees of fluidity and therefore whether they are saline or lapidose chrystals they must owe their figure to the same uniform principle operating on them in either case while in the fluid state hence from the similarity of the figure with the chrystals of nitre mountain crystal has a place in the same genus the topaz with the borax the diamond and ruby with alum linnaeus has given his reasons more at large in a paper published in the first volume of the amoenitates academicae and has since added chrystallos quod subjecerim salibus ne quemquam offendat mutet

several saline and other chrystallized bodies are subjoined accompanied by copious and methodical descriptions of the figures of each and references to these bodies as they occur in the work itself  genera morborum or classification of diseases we must now look backwards a few years to consider our author in another part of his professorial character it has been observed that after his establishment at upsal one of his departments as a professor was that of teaching the diagnosis morborum and to this end he drew up a system in which as in natural history all diseases were disposed into classes orders and genera founded on distinctions taken from the symptoms alone no regard being had either to remote or proximate causes before we proceed to a particular view of linnaeuss method of classing diseases it will be proper to premise that a nosology on this plan the great object of which is to fix pathognomonics to every disease had been long wished for by some writers of the first character in the profession such were baglivi boerhaave gorter gaubius and sydenham the latter of whom has thus expressed himself on this subject in the preface to his works expedit ut morbi omnes ad definitas ac certas species revocentur eadem prorsus diligentia ac  qua id factum videmus a botanicis scriptoribus in suis phytologiis yet amidst that almost infinite variety and complication of appearances which are seen in diseases the difficulty of obtaining sufficient distinctions by which the genus and species may be accurately discriminated must be allowed to be very great and possibly is in many instances unsurmountable hence some of the most eminent physicians have been led to reject all such arrangements as futile and impracticable this however has not deterred others from paying attention to the subject more especially some of those who from their province as professors are led to teach the rudiments of the art and to whom method in some form is absolutely necessary systematic writers had used various methods in the disposition of their subject some had chosen the alphabetic if that deserves the name of an arrangement others after the example of aretaeus and caelius aurelianus had divided diseases from their duration into acute and chronical some had preferred the anatomical order which as it presupposes a knowledge of the seat of the disease must not unfrequently prove fallacious sennertuss is an instance of this kind however the aitiological arrangement has been most followed by the best writers among the moderns such as hoffmann and boerhaave although perhaps not much less fallacious than the anatomical since it is in many instances founded on an hypothesis of the writer and though felix platerus in his praxis medica published in   0  had given an imperfect sketch of a nosology on the symptomatic plan yet no writer ventured to pursue his idea for more than a century after his time discouraged as it should seem by the difficulty of the attempt at length the late professor m sauvages of montpelier after communicating his scheme to boerhaave published in      in   mo the outlines of such a work under the title of nouvelles classes des maladies in which he professes to define diseases from their constant and evident symptoms only in the year      the author augmented his work by the addition of the species under each genus into   volumes in  vo sauvages may be considered as having spent his life in giving to this design a certain degree of perfection having enlarged it into   quarto volumes in which form it was published after his death in      a work it is to be presumed now in the hands of most physicians  it will easily be imagined that an arrangement of this kind was too congenial to linnaeus to be neglected by him in fact it appears that he very early corresponded with sauvages on this subject that he soon adopted it and framed a set of institutes under the title of genera morborum as a basis of his lectures in this department linnaeuss scheme was first published in a thesis in      but he had taught it in his class for ten years preceding that time in      he published it himself in a small quarto though we do not find that he ever enlarged it by the addition of the species  the symptomatic plan of arranging diseases has since been followed by some other professors of physic dr vogel of gottingen having published in      his definitiones generum morborum dr cullen also who at this time fills the practical chair at edinburgh with such deserved reputation has published a synopsis nosologiae methodicae and has made it the basis of his first lines of the practice of physic in      dr sagar a physician at iglaw in moravia published a systema morborum symtomaticum  vo vien pp     his work allowing for some alterations and additions may be accounted an useful abridgement of sauvagess the author all theory apart has described the species under every genus and subjoined the method of cure dr cullen by omitting many genera and reducing others to the rank of species only has so considerably abridged the whole as not to have retained more than half the number of genera that the foregoing writers enumerate and in this form he has published it annexed to those of the four abovementiond by which display of each their several merits may be compared and a judgment formed of the practicability and use of the scheme in general which it must be confessed affords a very ample field for cultivation yet from that reform which dr cullen has already made in various parts it is not perhaps too much to hope that it is capable of receiving a much higher degree of improvement in the hands of those whose genius and industry may prompt them to extend the design of these writers  of linnaeuss method we are led by our plan to exhibit a general view to which end although our prescribed brevity will not admit of giving his definitions at length yet it will be necessary to enumerate the names of all his genera since nothing short of a view of the whole collectively could enable the reader to form a just idea of the authors scheme under each class we shall observe wherein linnaeus differs materially from sauvages and note the alterations which dr cullen has made in the disposition of the same genera  linnaeus in the classification of diseases has pretty nearly retained the arrangement of m sauvages although he has altered his terms and constituted one more class with which he begins his method the exanthematic or eruptive fevers which in the systems of sauvages and dr cullen form only an order or subdivision of a class he has also changed the order of the classes and referred the vitia or local external disorders which are principally the objects of surgery to the end of his system in this he has been followed by the two succeeding nosologists dr vogel and dr cullen the classical distribution is however confessedly not the primary consideration that of fixing the generical character and determining what shall constitute the specifical being the first object of every system to this end a still farther reduction of the number of genera and species will probably not a little contribute  class i exanthematici fevers attended with eruptions on the skin   contagiosi contagious   morta vesiculary fever   pestis the plague   variola small pox   rubeola measles   petechia spotted fever   siphylis venereal disease   sporadici sporadic fevers not contagious   miliaria miliary fever   uredo nettle fever   aphtha aphthous fever   solitarii affecting a part of the body only  0 erysipelas st anthonys fire  in this class as the disease is complicated of fever and eruption the genus is defined from the nature of each to instance the variola or small pox is defined a disease attended with pustules of an erysipelatous suppurating escharotic kind at length drying off and leaving a cicatrix accompanied by a fever of the ardent and malignant kind with headache and pain of the loins the term pustula and the others in this class expressive of the different kinds of eruption have their definition in another part of the system such as appear in the morta are called phlyctenae in the pestis anthraces or bubones in the variola pustulae in the rubeola papulae in the petechia sudamina  this class constitutes the first order of dr sauvagess phlegmasiae and the third of dr cullens pyrexiae class in both these genera are preserved nearly alike except that the morta of linnaeus is the pemphigus of those authors and the petechia is considered by dr cullen as only a symptom  our author stands alone in bringing the syphilis into the febrile exanthematic class he thinks himself justified by considering it as attended in the advanced state at least by fever and eruptions it certainly however ranks better with the impetigines  class ii critici critical fevers   continentes continual fevers    diaria diary fever    synocha ardent fever    synochus malignant

remitting fevers  0 amphimerina continued quotidian    tritaeus continued tertian    tetartophya continued quartan    haemitritaea semitertian    hectica hectic fever  the genera of the continentes are determined from the different duration of each simply  those of the intermittentes from the duration of the intermissions  the exacerbantes supposed to be compounded of the two foregoing have their characters acordingly  our author allows the tertian to be the root of all the febres critici although he has in the foregoing division kept pretty close to dr sauvagess method in retaining the distinctions in this they are not followed by dr cullen who denies the existence of a continent fever and has greatly simplified this division having reduced all the critical fevers to six genera and allowing the hectic to be symptomatic only  class iii phlogistici inflammations   membranacei membranous inflammations    phrenitis of the meninges of the brain    paraphrenitis of the diaphragm    pleuritis the pleurisy    gastritis of the stomach    enteritis of the bowels  0 proctitis of the anus    cystitis of the bladder   parenchymatici visceral inflammations    sphacelismus of the brain    cynanche quinsey    peripneumonia of the lungs    hepatitis of the liver    splenitis of the spleen    nephritis of the kidneys    hysteritis of the uterus   musculori muscular or external inflammation    phlegmone inflammation of an external part  linnaeus defines the phlegmon to be a tense throbbing tumor or enlargement of a part accompanied by fever and attended with heat and redness this he considers as suggesting also the idea of all the foregoing internal inflammations  the generical character in the phlogistic class of our author does not arise wholly from the part affected supposed to be the seat of the disease but from the genus of the attending fever also thus he defines the hepatitis to be the amphimerina attended with a difficult respiration cough without expectoration hiccup and a sense of heat and tension in the right hypochondre the nephritis is a synochus attended with nausea hiccup eructation urine various costiveness burning lumbago and numbness down the thigh  in this class linnaeus has followed sauvages in dividing the diseases into membranacei and parenchymatici a division neglected by dr cullen from the difficulty of determining the seat of the inflammation  the phlegmone being external is ranked by sauvages among his vitia on the other hand dr cullen gives it the first place in his order phlegmasiae and has reduced thirteen genera of linnaeuss and twelve of sauvagess to the rank of species under the term phlogosis further accounting abscess pustule gangrene and sphacelus as effects only of phlogosis and therefore not entitled to the separate character of genera numerous instances of this kind afford a striking proof of the difficulties attending these arrangements in determining what distinctions shall take place between

not take into the characters of these genera the idea of fever and there are several of them used by him as auxiliary terms in the definition of other genera  dr sauvages has a class of five orders under the term dolores disposed in the anatomical method under which most of the foregoing genera are comprehended  dr cullen having no such class as the dolorosi is necessarily led to arrange these genera in different parts of his system but with him the greater number are either species only or symptoms he having admitted only three to the character of genera in his phlegmasia these are the ophthalmia arthritis or podagra and rheumatismus  class v mentales diseases in which the functions of the mind are disturbed   ideales those in which the judgment is principally affected    delirium

class which answers to the vesaniae of dr sauvages the genera stand nearly the same as in that authors arrangement  they constitute after great reduction the fourth order under the term vesaniae of the class neuroses in dr cullens system comprehending four genera  of the ideales of linnaeus dr cullen only ranks the amentia the mania and the melancholia as genera the delirium and paraphrosyne being symptomatic the demonia vesania and panophobia rank with melancholy under which he has also brought the erotomania and nostalgia from the pathetici of the remaining genera only the hypochondriasis and the hydrophobia are admitted as such the former in the adynamiae and the latter among the spasmi the syrigmus and phantasma are referred to the locales class and the somnambulismus to the oneirodynia in the order vesaniae the citta or pica the polydipsia satyriasis and bulimia belong also to the locales in the order dysorexiae it is justly doubted whether the tarantismus exists

sauvages and the two first orders the defectivi and soporosi with the comata and adynamiae of the class neuroses in dr cullens system  the three first genera of the defectivi dr cullen takes no notice of the three last he includes under his syncope as different degrees only of the same diminished power of the functions  among the soporosi of our author dr cullen ranks the carus and cataphora under the apoplexia and also considers the typhomania and lethargus as symptomatic of the same for the like reasons he accounts the paraplegia and hemiplegia as different degrees of the same disease including them all under paralysis  the privativi rank under the two first orders of dr cullens locales as far as he allows them to hold the character of genera the morosis and oblivio he refers to his amentia the scotomia he does not notice the cophosis he calls dysoecia the anorexia stands under his dyspepsia genus among the adynamiae the atonia as a species of palsy the amblyopia under amaurosis the cataracta under his caligo the anosmia ageustia aphonia anosexia adipsia and anaesthesia under their respective names separately and the atecnia under that of anaphrodisia  class vii

spastic contraction of the limbs with convulsions and pain  most of the diseases of this class stand in the corrseponding one of sauvages called spasmi except the borborygmus and the agrypnia the latter of which is referred to the anomalous vesaniae he also considers the sardiasis and stridor of linnaeus as species only of the trismos and the subsultus he calls carpologia  in dr cullens system the motorii of linnaeus make the third order of his neuroses called spasmi of the spastici he has the trismos hysteria and tetanos only as distinct genera under their respective terms the catochus he refers to the tetanos and the catalepsis is his apoplexia cataleptica the others are not noticed by him  of the agitatorii the tremor dr cullen accounts rather as a symptom of various disorders the beriberi which he had heretofore ranked with the paralysis he has omitted in the last edition of his synopsis the chorea is admitted as a genus and the hieranosos stands under the idiopathic convulsio the psellismus is removed to the locales class and of the remainder the palpitatio epilepsia and raphania only retain their place in his system under their respective names  class viii suppressorii affections and diseases arising from or attended with oppression of the organs and impeded excretions   suffocatorii diseases attended with a sense of suffocation     raucedo hoarseness

dyslochia suppression of the lochia   0 aglactatio defect of milk     sterilitas barrenness  under the genera of the suffocatorii our author has departed from his usual rule in having subjoined to each a note expressive of the intention of nature in exciting these affections thus to instance after defining suspirium to be a deep slow agitating inspiration he adds that the effect is that of expelling the blood from the lungs most of the suffocatorii have a place in sauvagess system among the anhelationes but the constrictorii are scattered in various parts of his system  dr cullen has not introduced into his system the lighter affections under the suffocatorii which seem to have been defined and explained by linnaeus principally to use them as auxiliaries in other parts of the work  in dr cullens system the raucedo has a place as symptomatic only under the catarrh and again in another part as a species of paraphonia the tussis is also received under the catarrh and the empyema is considered as a consequence of pleurisy or peripneumony the orthopnoea as a genus is not noticed by dr cullen the dyspnoea is admitted in the last edition which with the asthma are the only genera he receives from this order as he has made the ephialtes a species of his oncirodynia under the vesaniae in the class neuroses  in the constrictorii order the flatulentia of linnaeus comes under the dyspepsia of dr cullen and the obstipatio ischuria and dysmenorrhoea enter into the fourth order of the locales called epischeses the latter under the term amenorrhaea  class ix evacuatorii diseases attended with increased excretion and discharges   capitis of the head     otorrhoea purulent discharge from the ear     epiphora lachrymal flux     haemorrhagia bleeding of the nose     coryza mucous

galactitia overflowing of milk  0  sudor inordinate sweating  this class stands nearly the same as our author found it in sauvagess arrangement under the term fluxus except that linnaeus has introduced three or four genera not in that author such are the screatus vomica which is a species of sauvagess anacatharsis the ructus glus a species of his pyuria parturitio and mola he has also taken his orders from the anatomical division of the parts whereas sauvages divides them according to the nature of the discharge whether bloody or serous which must be allowed to be equivocal in many instances it has been objected that parturition is not a disease linnaeus however seems only to consider it as such when it proves laborious protracted or unnatural  dr cullen does not admit more than about a third part of the diseases of this class into his system he has the epiphora ptyalismus enuresis and gonorrhoea under their respective names in an order called apocenoses belonging to the class locales haemorrhagia is synonymous to his epistaxis coryza to his catarrhus under which he considers expectoratio as only symptomatic and vomica as the effect of pleurisy or peripneumony nausea and vomitus come under dyspepsia the iliaca under colica the cholerica coeliaca and lienteria as different species of diarrhoea leucorrhoea and abortus under menorrhagia stomacace haematemesis and haematuria as symptomatic only haemoptysis cholera and haemorrhois form distinct genera in both systems  class x deformes diseases occasioning external deformity of the body   emaciantes such as

greensickness     scorbutus scurvy     icterus jaundice     plethora redness of the skin from fullness of blood attended with dyspnoea  this class answers to the cachexiae of sauvages and dr cullen and most of the genera are admitted into the system of the latter under three corresponding orders also the marasmus is not distinguished by dr cullen from the atrophy the phthisis has been classed before as the consequence of haemoptysis the chlorosis stands in the adynamiae order in the class neuroses the graviditas cachexia and plethora have no place in dr cullens system  class xi vitia cutaneous external or palpable diseases the class which corresponds to this in the sauvagesian system stands first under the same term and is there professedly intended to contain such disorders as are more immediately the objects of surgery this character is not so strictly applicable to that of linnaeuss or of dr cullens locales since both these contain genera which come under the province of the physician independent of manual operation or assistance in all the systems it is the most comprehensive class the congruity of the orders will be noted in our progress through the class    humoralia diseases attended with vitiated or extravasated fluids     aridura wasting and withering of a part or limb     digitium dry whitlow     emphysema windy tumor     oedema watery tumor   0 sugillatio ecchymosis     inflammatio inflammation     abscessus abscess     gangraena gangrene     sphacelus mortification  in the genera of this order the appearance of the external part and that of the contained fluid conjointly form the character  in sauvages the aridura gangraena and sphacelus or necrosis belong to his class of cachexiae the digitium is a species of his paronychia and stands with the remaining genera of this order among the vitia  dr cullen neglects the aridura and digitium the emphysema is his pneumatosis the sugillatio his ecchymoma and the four remaining genera of linnaeus come under his phlogosis    dialytica solutions of continuity fractures wounds etc     fractura fracture and     luxatura dislocation of a bone     ruptura rupture of a tendon     contusura

this order nearly constitutes the seventh of the vitia class in sauvagess system called plagae and the seventh of the locales class in dr cullens under the name of dialyses under vulnus are comprehended the three succeeding genera also of linnaeuss the fractura constitutes a separate genus the luxatura belongs to the ectopiae order of dr cullens the profusio to the apocenoses the intertrigo and combustura to the phlogosis genus the remaining genera are not noticed in the cullenian system    exulcerationes ulcers purulent or ichorous solutions of continuity     ulcus a suppurated wound of a fleshy part   0 cacoethes a spreading superficial weeping ulcer     noma a deep escharotic cicatrizing ulcer     carcinoma cancer     ozaena an ulcer of the antrum highmori

animalcule lodged in the part     paronychia whitlow     pernio kibes   0 pressura phlegmon of the finger end from the effect of cold     arctura inflammation of the nail from curvature thereof  most of these genera rank with the plagae of dr sauvagess class the paronychia however comes in among the phymata and the pressura and arctura of linnaeus are species only of the paronychia as the pernio is of the erythema in the same system  the first six genera in this order are classed in dr cullens system under ulcus the caries is a distinct genus the arthocace paronychia and pernio rank under the phlogosis and the others are not noticed    scabies cutaneous diseases     lepra leprosy     tinea scald head     achor crusta lactea of authors     psora itch     lippitudo bleareyedness     serpigo

class under the orders phymata and efflorescentiae but the lepra tinea and psora are referred to the impetigines in the class cachexiae  the following are distinct genera in dr cullens system the lepra under the impetigines the tinea psora and herpes under the dialyses the bubo verruca and clavus form distinct genera in the same order with the phlyctena or hydatis being all referred to the tumores almost all the others rank under the phlogosis as different species of that genus lippitudo serpigo myrmecium and eschara have no place in the cullenian system  the characters of the genera in this order are well adapted to distinguish the different kinds of pustules and are of great use as auxiliary terms in defining other genera in different parts of the system    tumores tumors     aneurisma aneurism     varix varix     schirrus schirrus     struma struma     atheroma wen     anchylosis a stiff joint     ganglion tumor of a tendon     natta tumor rooted in a muscle     spinola spina bifida   0 exostosis bony tumor  the three first and the last of these genera stand in the corresponding class of the systems of sauvages and dr cullen under the same names linnaeuss struma is their scrofula and his spinola the hydrorachitis the atheroma is the lupia of dr cullen the ganglion is a condyloma of sauvages but stands in the cullenian system under linnaeuss term the natta is

among spasmodic diseases the gibber or gibbosites and the lordosis among the excrescentiae of the vitia class the nyctalopia and the two genera succeeding it as species of amblyopia in the class of debilitates as is the lagostoma as a species of psellismus the plica under the name of trichoma with the cachexiae and the trichiasis as a species of opthalmia  dr cullen receives only five of these genera the contractura strabismus the presbytia and myopia the two latter as species of his dysopia all under the locales class the plica under his genus trichoma among the impetigines in the

sauvagess system either among the maculae or efflorescentiae but he does not allow them all the rank of genera the cicatrix is a species of his leucoma as the morphaea and melasma are of his vitiligo and the vibex and sudamen of the ecchymoma the naevus stands under the same generic name in both but the lentigo of linnaeus is a species of sauvagess ephelis  dr cullen has not given a place to these genera in his system  our author has subjoined to this distribution of diseases a brief view of his theory of physic delivered in that terse concise and methodic manner so peculiar to himself and which as it appears to have been intended entirely for the use of his pupils nothing less than the authors own comment can do sufficient justice to we should not therefore have taken notice of it in our plan had it not been necessary in order to explain several papers hereafter to be mentioned in the amoenitates academicae briefly therefore the linnaean principles of physic suppose the human body to consist of a cerebrose medullary part of which the nerves are so many processes and which we call the nervous system and a cortical or vital part including the vascular system and contained fluids the former being the animated part or that in which the sentient moving principle peculiarly resides is considered as deriving its nourishment from the subtlest fluids of the vascular system and its energy from an electrical principle inhaled by the lungs farther this theory supposes the circulating fluids to be capable of being vitiated by principles which the author chooses to consider either as acescent or putrid ferments the former acting on the serum and being the exciting cause of critical fevers the latter on the blood properly or crassamentum and exciting phlogistic diseases the exanthematic class is supposed to be excited by some external causes which we call contagion and which hypothetically he proposes as being animalcula from the incessant attrition of the cortical or vascular system it requires perpetual reparation this is to be effected by an appropriate diet from an impropriate diet or regimen spring the diseases of this part of the system originally and more particularly these are to be remedied by sapid medicines as those of the medullary system are by olids hence arises the authors general division of all medicines as discoverable by their sensible qualities to the taste and smelling the sapids according to this theory acting peculiarly on the cortical part as the olids do immediately on the medullary or nervous system in order however to obtain a more complete idea of the effects of each of these general classes of medicines each must be viewed in its most simple state by which sapids will appear to be rather what we call nutritives and olids more strictly speaking medicines a table of of the several qualities of medicines acording to these two general divisions closes the genera morborum  in      linnaeus published a small piece under the title of clavis medicinae duplex exterior et interior holm  vo pp    this small tract may be considered as a syllabus of his lectures it is an enlarged view of the theory just mentioned connecting it with general pathology and the therapeutic part of physic in the latter part all simples are arranged in thirty orders according to their sensible qualities agreeably to the theory which is displayed more at large in two papers printed in the amoenitates academicae under the titles of sapores et odores medicamentorum  it appears from several parts of the writings of linnaeus that the dietetic part of physic had been an object to which he had paid much attention and he has explained himself in the following manner relating to it  in his meae deliciae in his plura collegi quam quod novi alius ullus  but whether our authors observations on this subject may hereafter be published we are yet to learn  in      was published linnaeuss last work being the continuation of the mantissa in which the work is carried on to     pages under the title of mantissa altera near one half of this volume comprehends additional new genera and species and the remaining part a variety of emendations with some considerable augmentation to the animal kingdom these will greatly enrich a future edition of his works and in the preface he has earnestly entreated succeeding editors to pay a proper regard to them  besides his separate works which we have now brought to a conclusion linnaeus wrote a great number of papers on the subjects of physic and natural history which were published in the acta literaria upsaliensia and in the stockholm acts the first of these works was begun by olaus celsius in    0 and continued to the year    0 and is in latin in   volumes quarto the latter publication is in the swedish language in the octavo form and has been continued ever since the establishment of the academy at stockholm in      by king adolphus many of these papers are superseded by the subsequent works of our author neither would it be within our plan to give a particular detail of them we are therefore only to subjoin a catalogue of these detached pieces and regret that it is not in our power to make it more complete or to add such if there be any as may have been given by linnaeus to foreign academies  in the acta upsaliensia are the following papers written by

is sufficient to preclude the expectation of any new performance if his advanced age had not of itself rendered it sufficiently improbable after that period  in the spring of the year      dr murray professor of physic and botany at gottingen a swede by birth who had been educated under linnaeus and had long enjoyed a great share of his confidence and esteem paid his preceptor a visit he found his faculties unimpaired and his ardor for the improvement of science as strong and vigorous as ever he speaks with great delight of the satisfaction he received from his company and in the contemplation and inspection of his museum at hammarby but regretted much to find that linnaeus had no farther thoughts of publishing a new edition of his system of nature purposing only to give a supplement however before dr murray left upsal he prevailed on him to promise that he would transmit to him his additional observations to the systema vegetabilium in order to enable him to give a complete edition of that work this the professor did and dr murray performed it in the year      very much to the satisfaction of all who pursue the linnaean method the manuscript additions communicated on this occasion by our author together with those collected from the several addenda and from the mantissae enabled dr murray to extend this volume to above one hundred pages beyond that of the   th edition published in       it appears that linnaeus upon the whole enjoyed a good constitution at times however he had been severely afflicted with an hemicrania and had not been exempted from the gout how much he suffered from this latter distemper we have before mentioned when treating on the philosophia botanica and notwithstanding the sound state in which dr murray left him we find that very soon after his memory became somewhat impaired the consciousness of this defect was said to have induced him to decline all thoughts of further publications and to transmit to dr murray such materials as were in readiness to complete future editions of his system  in the summer of      it was known here that his strength was declining apace and his infirmities in general much increased he being unable to take his usual walks in his garden without assistance at the latter end of the year he was seized with an apoplexy which left him paralytic and at the beginning of the year      he suffered another stroke which very much impaired his mental powers these attacks at his advanced stage of life showed that dissolution was not far off but the disease which was said to have been the more immediate cause of his death was an ulceration of the urinary bladder nevertheless he languished through the year and died on the   th of january      aged  0 years and   months  to the lovers of science it will not appear strange nor will it be unpleasant to hear that uncommon respect was shown to the memory of this great man we are told that on his death a general mourning took place at upsal and that his funeral procession was attended by the whole university as well professors as students and the pall supported by sixteen doctors of physic all of whom had been his pupils the king of sweden after the death of linnaeus ordered a medal to be struck of which one side exhibits linnaeuss bust and name and the other cybele in a dejected attitude holding in her left hand a key and surrounded with animals and growing plants with this legend  deam luctus angit amissi  and beneath  post obitum upsaliae die x jan mdcclxxviii rege jubente  the same generous monarch not only honored the royal academy of sciences with his presence when linnaeuss commemoration was held at stockholm but as a still higher tribute in his speech from the throne to the assembly of the states lamented swedens loss by his death nor was he honored only in his own country the present learned and worthy professor of botany at edinburgh not only pronounced an eulogium in honor of linnaeus before his students at the opening of his lectures in the spring of      but laid also the foundationstone of a monument to be raised to his memory which while it perpetuates the name and merits of linnaeus will do honor to the founder and it may be hoped prove the means of raising an emulation favorable to that science which this illustrious swede so highly dignified and improved this monument consists of a vase supported on a pedestal with this inscription linnaeo posuit j hope  the high reputation which this great man has long held among the naturalists throughout the world might readily perhaps preclude any encomium from our pen since to all lovers of natural science his name itself is eulogy and will doubtless very long be inseparable from the idea of his extraordinary merit might we nevertheless be indulged so far we hope the following brief estimate of his talents will be thought just and easily deduced from an impartial view of his writings  nature had in an eminent manner been liberal in the endowments of his mind he seems to have been possessed of a lively imagination corrected however by a strong judgment and guided by the laws of system add to these the most retentive memory an unremitting industry and the greatest perseverance in all his pursuits as is evident from that continued vigor with which he prosecuted the design that he appears to have formed so early in life of totally reforming and fabricating anew the whole science of natural history and this fabric he raised and gave to it a degree of perfection unknown before and had moreover the uncommon felicity of living to see his own structure rise above all others notwithstanding every discouragement its author at first labored under and the opposition it afterward met with neither has any writer more cautiously avoided that common error of building his own fame on the ruin of another mans he every where acknowledged the several merits of each authors system and no man appears to have been more sensible of the partial defects of his own those anomalies which had principally been the objects of criticism he well knew every artificial arrangement must abound with and having laid it down as a firm maxim that every system must finally rest on its intrinsic merit he willingly commits his own to the judgment of posterity perhaps there is no circumstance of linnaeuss life which shows him in a more dignified light than his conduct toward his opponents disavowing controversy and justly considering it as an unimportant and fruitless sacrifice of time he never replied to any numerous as they were at one season  to all who see the aid this extraordinary man has brought to natural science his talents must appear in a very illustrious point of view but more especially to those who from similarity of taste are qualified to see more distinctly the vast extent of his original design the greatness of his labor and the elaborate execution he has given to the whole he had a happy command of the latin tongue which is alone the language of science and no man ever applied it more successfully to his purposes or gave to description such copiousness united with that precision and conciseness which so eminently characterize his writings  in the mean time we are not to learn that it has been objected as derogatory to his learning in no small degree that he has introduced a number of terms not authorized by classical authority but granting this it ought to be recollected that linnaeus in the investigation of nature has discovered a multitude of relations which were entirely unknown to the ancients if therefore there be any force in the objection it should first be shown that the terms which he has introduced to express these relations are not fairly and analogically deduced from the language since it must surely be granted that linnaeus could not have spoken the language of natural history as it is known at this day in that of pliny or of any classical writer whatever  the ardor of linnaeuss inclinations to the study of nature from his earliest years and that uncommon application which he bestowed upon it gave him a most comprehensive view both of its pleasures and usefulness at the same time that it opened to him a wide field hitherto but little cultivated especially in his own country hence he was early led to regret that the study of natural history as a public institution had not made its way into the universities in many of which logical disputations and metaphysical theories had too long prevailed to the exclusion of more useful science availing himself therefore of the advantages which he derived from a large share of eloquence and an animated style he never failed to display in a lively and convincing manner the relation this study has to the public good to incite the great to countenance and protect it to encourage and allure youth into its pursuits by opening its manifold sources of pleasure to their view and showing them how greatly this agreeable employment would add in a variety of instances both to their comfort and emolument his extensive view of natural history as connected with almost all the arts of life did not allow him to confine these motives and incitements to those only who were designed for the practice of physic he also labored to inspire the great and opulent with a taste for this study and wished particularly that such as were devoted to an ecclesiastic life should share a portion of natural science not only as a means of sweetening their rural situation confined as many are perpetually to a country residence but as what would almost inevitably lead in a variety of instances to discoveries which only such situations could give rise to and which the learned in great cities could have no opportunities to make not to add that the mutual communication and enlargement of this kind of knowledge among people of equal rank in a country situation must prove one of the strongest bonds of union and friendship and contribute in a much higher degree than the usual perishing amusements of the age to the pleasures and advantages of society  linnaeus lived to enjoy the fruit of his own labor in an uncommon degree natural history raised itself in sweden under his culture to a state of perfection unknown elsewhere and was from thence disseminated through all europe his pupils dispersed themselves all over the globe and with their masters fame extended both science and their own more than this he lived to see the sovereigns of europe establish several public institutions in favor of this study and even professorships established in diverse universities for the same purpose which do honor to their founders and patrons and which have excited a curiosity for the science and a sense of its worth that cannot fail to further its progress and in time raise it to that rank which it is entitled to hold among the pursuits of mankind  were it in our power minutely to describe the person of our author in conformity to the custom of biographers it would be a matter of small moment as the endowments of his mind and his great talents have so superior a claim to attention in the commemorationspeech delivered by his friend dr baeck physician to the king of sweden linnaeuss stature is described as being diminutive his head large his look ardent piercing and apt to daunt the beholder his ear not sensible to music his temper quick his memory good though in the latter period of his life liable to fail him sometimes his knowledge of languages confined yet no interesting discovery escaped him in summer he used to sleep from ten to three oclock in winter from nine to six and instantly to cease from his labors when he found himself not well disposed for them he was an agreeable companion of quick sensibility but easily appeased those who would be gratified by forming an idea of his person may be acquainted that there are extant three halflength prints of linnaeus in his works two of these are in octavo and the other in a halfsheet or rather large quarto the first was prefixed to the leipsic edition of the systema naturae printed in      and represents linnaeus as we apprehend in about the fortieth year of his age another to the second edition of the species plantarum in      and the larger one to the sixth edition of the genera plantarum in      in the first and the last of these which are by much the better engravings he is figured in an undress resting upon a volume of the systema and holding in his hand a sprig of the linnaea a plant so called by dr gronovius in honor of his name in that of      he is represented in a full dress with the insignia of the order of the polar star at his breast and aurivilliuss inscription underneath hic ille est cui regna volens natura reclusit quamque ulli dederat plura videnda dedit   the academy of sciences at stockholm have at their own expense directed that an engraving of his portrait should be made at paris from an original picture by the famous swedish painter roslin there is a striking likeness also exhibited on a large medallion alantique of almost two feet in diameter by m larcheveque in england we have an elegant small medallion fabricated by those excellent artists mess wedgwood and bently it represents linnaeus in profile when far advanced in years the bust is white upon a lightblue ground and the linnaea placed at the breast this is said by all who knew the professor to bear the greatest likeness we regret that it is not in our power to describe the medals which were struck in honor of linnaeus by order of several noblemen of the first distinction in sweden particularly that by count tessins direction since that nobleman was among the first who discerned and patronized the merit of our author and ever bore to it the most public and honorable testimony this linnaeus has acknowledged in the warmest effusions of gratitude  it has been observed before that the professor married the daughter of dr more the provincial physician of dalekarlia soon after he settled at stockholm in      this lady survived him and he has left a son named charles and four daughters the younger linnaeus was demonstrator in the botanical garden at upsal so early as the year      having in that and the succeeding year published two decads of rare plants lately raised there accompanied with the figures not long after he was constituted joint professor in the botanical chair with his father and of late years entirely occupied that department since the death of his father we learn that he has obtained some of his employments particularly the professorship of the theory of physic and has resigned that of botany in favor of dr thunberg it has been said that he intends to publish a mantissa tertia which his father left nearly finished also several collections of plants which had been sent to linnaeus not long before his death from the cape of good hope and from several other parts of the world  elizabeth christina one of the daughters of our author made herself known to the learned world in      by a discovery which was published in the swedish acts of the same year it related to a curious and before quite unobserved appearance in the flowers of the indian cresses tropaeolum majus which she had perceived to emit spontaneously at certain intervals sparks like those of electricity or rather such as arise from a fulminating powder this was only visible in the dusk of the evenings and ceased when total darkness came on she had shown this singular appearance to her father and other philosophers particularly to mr wilcke a celebrated electrician who was inclined to believe that it was an electrical phenomenon  a brief account of the amoenitates academicae the collection known under this title consists of seven volumes in  vo and contains   0 theses it is supposed the first volume was not originally collected by linnaeus himself but he at least reprinted it very early and that he might not be defrauded of the advantage of these publications became the editor of all the succeeding volumes something has been said relating to this collection in the course of these memoirs to which we have only to add that we beg the reader to regard the following pages as little more than an enlarged table of contents intended only to excite a due attention to this part of linnaeuss works which the compiler presumes to be less known than it deserves and at the same time to entreat him to consider that it is impossible by means of any abridgment to give an adequate idea of that merit and excellent arrangement of the subjects in these volumes which cannot but render them an agreeable and useful miscellany and ornament to the library of every naturalist philosopher and physician  amoenitates academicae vol i holm      pp   0   betula nana l m klase      in this dissertation is exhibited a complete history

esteemed make a considerable part of the sustenance of the inhabitants great quantities are caught in the winter season and sent to different provinces before linnaeus made his lapland expedition this

object in all the oriental countries in this dissertation we are presented with a history of this genus of which the writer has enumerated    species linnaeus has however greatly reduced this number in his species plantarum since many are varieties effected by culture that part of the history of this tree which for many ages was so enigmatical and which nothing but the doctrine of the sexes of plants has completely cleared up namely the husbandry or caprification as it is called is more particularly worthy of attention not only as a singular phenomenon in itself but as it has furnished one of the most convincing proofs of the reality of the sexes of plants our limits will not allow us to detail this subject in brief it is this  it is now known that the flowers of the fig tree are situated within a pulpy receptacle which we call the fig or fruit of this tree of these receptacles in the wild fig tree some have male flowers only and others have male and female both distinct though placed in the same receptacle in the garden or cultivated fig these are found to contain only female flowers which are fecundated by means of a kind of gnat cynips psenes syst not     bred in the fruit of the wild fig trees which pierces that of the cultivated in order to deposit its eggs within at the same time diffusing within the receptacle the farina of the male flowers without this operation the fruit may ripen but no effective seeds are produced hence the garden fig can only be propagated by layers and cuttings in these countries where the wild fig is not known the process of thus ripening the fruit in the oriental countries is not left to nature but is managed with great art and different degrees of dexterity so as to reward the skilful husbandman with a much larger increase of fruit than would otherwise be produced a tree of the same size which in provence where caprification is not practiced may produce about    pounds of fruit will by that art in the grecian islands bring ten times that quantity    dissertatio de peloria d rudberg      a description with the figure of a very extraordinary variety of the common yellow toad flax antirrhinum linaria sp pl     which was found in several parts of sweden and since in germany and engaged the attention of the botanists very greatly at the time indeed its variation is uncommonly singular the flower instead of the ringent tetrandrous flower of the linaria with a single corniculated nectarium was found with a regular monopetalous pentandrous tube from the base of which proceeded five nectaria yet uncommon as this proved linnaeus discovered it to be no other than a monster or hybrid plant sprung from the linaria though it does not appear to this day that its origin on the other side has been sufficiently ascertained the habit of the plant and its sensible quality agree with those of the linaria    de coralliis balticis h fougt      in this tract the author after having traced the history of corals from the remotest period of natural history and considered the several theories that have at different times prevailed relating to the production of these bodies acquiesces in the modern one which ascribes their formation to polypes and which the late mr ellis and several other writers have much confirmed and illustrated he then gives a copious description of twenty species all found in the baltic of which an excellent engraving is subjoined these bodies are found in immense masses in some parts of this sea on the coast of gothland there are strata of corals extending through tracts of several miles    amphibia gyllenborgiana b r have      a detailed description of    species of animals all of the amphibia class which were presented by count gyllenborg to the university of upsal of which he was at that time chancellor and to which he had been a munificent patron having interested himself in procuring to be built and furnished an astronomical observatory in restoring to a state of usefulness the botanic garden which had been in ruins for many years in causing stoves to be erected and a house built for the demonstrator and finally in having presented to the university his own museum collected at a great expense and consisting of rare amphibia insects corals minerals and moreover of many elegant works of art  in this tract is exhibited the first specimen of linnaeuss method of zoological description at large as also the first attempt to form the specific character of the serpents order from the different number of the rings and scales of the body and tail taken conjointly former authors generally had recourse to color alone in distinguishing these animals which was found at length to be too unstable and had given rise to a most enormous multiplication of the species this mode of distinction has been since adopted by others and is retained in the systema naturae    plantae martinoburserianae r martin      j burser a most diligent disciple and friend of caspar bauhine and afterward professor of physic at sora in the kingdom of naples who had traveled almost all over europe and had particularly sought for rare plants in the alps had collected in these journeys an hortus siccus contained in    volumes which after various fates was given by m coijet to the university of upsal the purport of this tract is to illustrate the most rare plants contained in this collection and such particularly as were obscurely known to the collector and to add to these the specific names according to the principles of the linnaean method with this view   0 species

fancied resemblance of the cross which they perceived in the flower called passion flower and which soon held a distinguished rank in the european gardens m hallman after a chronological list of those writers who first exhibited the several species from peter ciltza and monardes down to dillenius describes at large    species and gives their several synonyms adding afterward a list of many which are dubious he subjoins the uses which the natives of america make of these plants principally borrowed from piso the whole is ornamented and rendered much more useful by a plate on which are engraven different views of the flower and a figure of the leaf of each species  the passion flower belongs to the gynandrous plants with five stamina and the number of species as they now stand in the system is augmented to    without mentioning two others described and figured as new by m jacquin who brought them from carthagena all the passion flowers yet known are natives of the warmer parts of america only and not found in any other parts of the globe    de anandria e z tursen      the history of a singular siberian plant which during the time of flowering was found not to open the calix and was called anandria by professor siegesbeck of petersburgh who had fancied that it was destitute of stamina and having declared himself a strenuous opposer of the sexual system thought by the instance of this plant to have overturned the whole doctrine of the sexes of plants having written a treatise in which he had asserted that the stamina did not constitute the essential parts of the plant and that the seed would become fertile without the influence of the pollen antherarum this plant is syngenesious and of that genus which we name coltsfoot it stands in the system under the name of tussilago anandria scapo unifloro subsquamoso erecto foliis lyratoovatis and subsequent observations proved that in a warmer situation than its native one the calix would open and show a radiated flower the controversy which was managed in behalf of linnaeus by dr gleditsch of berlin much extended the knowledge and favored the establishment of the linnaean system at that time unwillingly received by many of the older botanists   0 de acrostico j b heiligtag      a botanical dissertation on a genus of plants belonging to an extensive natural order placed in the cryptogamia class which we call ferns and which were known to former botanists by the name of epiphyllospermous plants since they chiefly produce their parts of fructification on the back of the leaf or frons after some general observations on the plants constituting this order which have also been called capillary plants and showing the place they hold and their characters in the several systems of ray morison tournefort and linnaeus the writer proceeds to an ample description of the species of acrostica of which he enumerates seventeen with their synonyms this genus is distinguished by having the fructification spread all over the surface of the leaf and the number of species in the last edition of the system is augmented to thirty they are mostly of american produce three only being european of which two are sparingly found in britain they are a singular set of plants and have much excited the attention of botanists a plate accompanies this tract on which five of the uncommon species are delineated     museum

doctrine of the sexes of plants is founded are referred to this dissertation as containing by fat the most clear comprehensive and yet copious view of that subject it is professedly a commentary upon the  th chapter of linnaeuss fundamenta or philosophia botanica from section     to   0 inclusive and contains    pages it is out of our plan to produce any detail of these arguments suffice it to say that although from the writings of theophrastus and pliny we learn that the ancients had some idea of an analogy in this respect between the animal and vegetable kingdom drawn perhaps principally from the artificial mode of foecundating the datetree yet so crude and erroneous were their ideas that in many instances they called those plants male or female which modern discoveries have taught us are exactly the reverse indeed it does not appear that any very precise ideas on this subject were established till late in the last century and were it a matter of importance to determine to whom applause is due for this discovery the english might perhaps with justice claim this honor and bestow it on sir thomas millington savilian professor who appears to have been the first that gave the hint to dr grew since whose time this doctrine has received so much light that we presume few people can now doubt the following position which briefly contains the whole of what is understood now by this analogy namely that the influence of the farina from the antherae of flowers upon the stigma is essentially necessary to give fertility to the seed if there are any who yet wish to see what arguments may be adduced against this doctrine they are referred to the anthologia of pontedera and to the late dr alstons dissertation on botany it has been before observed that linnaeus was honored with a premium from the royal academy of sciences at petersburgh for his excellent treatise on the sponsalia plantarum in which he is thought to have most irrefragably proved his position     nova

linnaeus published in          vires plantarum f hasselquist      practical physicians have wished and some have formed the idea that it is possible to deduce the virtues of plants from their agreement in similar characters of fructification in habit or agreement in natural orders or classes mr petiver long since was among the first that hazarded some reflections on this subject see philosophical transactions no     and lowthorps abridgment vol ii p  0  and the very eminent dr hoffmann has a professed dissertation on it in the fifth volume of his works p    it is the intention of the present paper written by this ingenious but unfortunate disciple of linnaeus to extend and illustrate the same idea by this commentary on the   th chapter of the philosophia botanica which contains the general doctrine of this attempt and an enumeration of those natural or artificial orders in botany which are supposed to illustrate and confirm the possibility of attaining this desirable end to mention a few instances of this agreement in character and qualities the stellated class in rays system are mostly diuretics the asperifoliae are chiefly demulcents the umbelliferous plants which grow in dry places are aromatics particularly the roots and seeds but if growing in wet situations usually partake more or less of a deleterious quality the icosandrous plants of linnaeus abound with pulpy and esculent fruits the polyandrous are many of them poisonous the syngenesious in frequent instances intense bitters etc it most not be concealed however that there are not wanting those who consider both the natural method in botany and the deduction of the virtues of simples from these congruities as the philosophers stone of the science notwithstanding which there is no attempt in the improvement of botany or its true application to the uses of physic which ought more strenuously and unremittingly to be pursued than that of bringing to all possible perfection the purpose of this dissertation     de chrystallorum generatione m kahler      in this tract is discussed at large that opinion which linnaeus early imbibed and which led him to ascribe to the operation of one and the same principle the regular polyedrous figure of all those bodies called chrystals acting upon them during their suspension in an aqueous menstruum and this he conceived to be equally the case whether these bodies are what we usually call saline or whether they are lapidose pyriticose or arsenical or finally whether they are such as are termed metallic salts hence arose his arrangement of figured spars selenite quartzose chrystals including all the gems under that genus of salt to which their agreement in figure entitled them to a place this opinion gave so much offense to mineralogists that most probably it rendered his system in the mineral kingdom much less acceptable than the other parts of that work had been in this paper lapidose chrystals only are considered many of which are figured and described and referred to the several salts with which they agree in figure linnaeuss idea on this subject has been lately taken up and pursued in a very extensive manner by m de rome de lisle in an essay printed at paris in      it must be confessed however that the greatest difficulties attend the solution of this matter how far the further consideration of the volcanic system which is gaining ground in the minds of some philosophers and mineralogists may elucidate the origin of certain figured bodies which are said to have a chrystalline or vitreous basis

whether in agriculture rural economy in general in the arts or in culinary uses it does not profess to deliver their medicinal qualities that not being a part of the plan the plants are enumerated in the order in which they are found in the flora suecica but no botanical distinctions or disquisitions are here introduced we have no work on this plan extant in england and are persuaded that something of this kind on a more extended scale written in the language of the country and adapted to common use could not fail to meet with a favorable reception and would certainly be highly beneficial not only by disclosing matter of real and instant information to many who are ignorant of the various applications that have already been made of plants which are daily neglected but by exciting a spirit of investigation in general would doubtless lead to new discoveries an economical flora or herbal is what we have never yet seen our works that bear the name of herbals treat on plants and trees as if their utility was alone confined to the purposes of physic and even here in a variety of instances attribute to them virtues which neither their sensible qualities have justified nor experience has ascertained  we have observed that this work is confined to the native plants of the country out of which as an instance of the variety of subjects that are here mentioned as objects of economy in various ways there are not less than three hundred that have a place in this catalogue     de curiositate naturali o soderberg      this concluding paper of the first volume is a discourse intended as an incitement to the study of natural history by a train of wellconnected arguments and observations drawn from that admirable display of wisdom and goodness manifest throughout all nature and from its dignity and importance as so immediately connected with utility to mankind from all which considerations the author thinks it entitled to one of the most distinguished ranks among the objects of human enquiry and that so far from being a frivolous pursuit it is in every view one of the worthiest employments of the human mind  amoenitates academicae vol ii      pp        oeconomia naturae j j biberg      it is impossible in an abstract to do any proper justice to this excellent production the design of which is entirely physicotheological and consequently its scope is various and extensive the writer first considers in general the structure of the earth its seas mountains etc and the effects of the change of seasons on all parts of its surface and on the elements the disposition of the fossil kingdom and the various origin of its several bodies with their gradual transmutation from whence in many instances arise their different denominations with us in the vegetable kingdom the various means by which the dissemination of seeds is effected thereby clothing in every climate the whole surface of the earth and conducing to the preservation of animals in the animal kingdom itself the extraordinary increase of some the paucity of others their means of preservation and their use even in their destruction to the general economy of nature all these positions he has illustrated and confirmed by apt examples and finally draws this conclusion  that all nature is most harmoniously arranged and adapted to produce upon the whole reciprocal good this paper is among those translated by mr stillingfleet   0 de taenia g dubois      at the time this treatise was written the subject had more than usually engaged the attention of the swedish naturalists and physicians and particularly of linnaeus and his colleague dr rosen the family of the latter having suffered much from this dangerous animal as appears by his treatise on the diseases of children lately rendered into english by dr sparmann  the author has here described and figured four species all of which are found in the intestines of animals chiefly in those of carnivorous quadrupeds and unhappily two of these kinds but more particularly the t solium too frequently infest the human body the specific differences of the taeniae arise from the number and situation of the mouths or suckers in each link of this compound animal the history of which has employed the pens of many ingenious men and is notwithstanding yet involved in considerable obscurity  the tapeworms most commonly infesting the human body are those described by linnaeus under the names of taenia solium and taenia vulgaris syst not p      both of which are not unfrequently found extended from the duodenum almost through the whole tract of the intestines much controversy has been spent in determining whether these animals have any part that is analogous to the brain or head in other animals our author affirms the contrary considering them as compound animals consisting as it were of a chain every link of which is a perfect animal furnished with a mouth and all its proper organs and capable when separated from its original chain of propagating its species as if by a vegetative power and independent of any oviparous or viviparous process in this idea he is opposed by dr tyson who has figured the head of the taenia solium in the philosophical transactions see no     and lowthrops abridgment vol iii p   0 as also by pallas in his elenchus zoophytorum and by some other authors the vermes cucurbitini or gourdworms of foregoing writers are now however allowed to be the descending or posterior links of the taenia solium and these according to linnaeus are again capable of extending themselves and producing another chain according to pallas and others these joints are pregnant with ova in either case the reason is at once seen why these noxious creatures are with such difficulty expelled from the human body linnaeus however does not deny that they are capable of propagation by ova too and says they are found though much smaller in muddy springs to which pallas with difficulty assents linnaeuss opinion however is confirmed by subsequent observations and indeed we cannot but observe that without allowing them to exist elsewhere than in the intestines of animals it is exceedingly difficult to account for the locality of the disease arising from these worms  we cannot enlarge on this treatise consistent with our plan it must be sufficient to observe that this dissertation besides being in itself highly satisfactory may be considered as an index also to those writers that are most worthy of being consulted on the same subject     lignum colubrinum j a darelius      this is a critical enquiry to determine the species of that drug called lignum colubrinum which it is said the indian ichneumon weesel or mungos viverra ichneumon b lin syst    first pointed out to the indians this wood the zeylanese use as an antidote to the poison of the hooded serpent or naja called also cobra de capello coluber naja syst     of which kaempfer has given so extensive an history as the most poisonous of all serpents darelius prefixes to his enquiry the history of both these animals of which too many mavelous things have been related he then examines into the pretensions of that drug which had usually been sold in europe under the name of lignum colubrinum see dales pharmacolog p     which is the strychnos colubrina spec plant     and rejects its claim inclining at length to bestow it on the plant described by kaempfer under the name of radix mungo p     this plant was received into the system among the pentandrous tribe under the name of ophiorrhiza mungos and is figured in the materia medica of our author the root is exhibited in india and in zeylon not only as an antidote against the venom of this serpent but against the bite of the mad dog as also in putrid fevers grimmius who lived long as a physician at columbo in zeylon professes to have made great use of it our author subjoins several preparations from this simple and from lockner presents us with the formula of the famous lapis de goa in which the mungos root stands as the first ingredient he concludes with an enquiry into the effects of the spurious drug of this name the result of which sufficiently agrees with what is related of the nux vomica to which genus it is referred according to the sexual system     radix senega j kiernander      as the terror of the naja is dispelled in asia by the ophiorrhiza so is that of the rattlesnake in america by the senega after premising the history of the rattlesnake crotalus horridus syst     chiefly borrowed from catesby dr kiernander gives a full botanical and medical history of this famous plant which for so long a time the indians concealed from the europeans the author then recites ten different vegetables of which the europeans during their endeavors to come at the true rattlesnake root tried the effects against this subtle venom some of these are said to have been not quite unavailing at length dr tennent discovered the secret and found the plant to be a species of milkwort which stands now in linnaeuss works under the name of polygala senega spec pl   0 and of this genus there are not fewer than    species known the description of the senega is accompanied by a figure of the plant the root which is the part alone used in medicine affords an acrimony on the palate perhaps unexampled in the whole materia medica the author gives the analysis of the root enumerates its effects as a sialagogue diuretic and expectorant the various preparations and their use in inflammatory diseases dropsy gout rheumatism in a disease which he mentions as endemic in virginia under the name of marasmus virginicus and finally as the great specific to the venom of the rattlesnake to which end the indians instantly chew it swallow the juice and apply the masticated root to the puncture the root of the polygala vulgaris which grows so plentifully in england appears from experiments to possess the qualities of the senega but in a far weaker degree     genesis calculi j o hagstrom      before dr hagstrom comes to the immediate consideration of the origin of the calculus of the urinary bladder he premifes some observations on calcareous substances in general and enumerates the several kinds of calculous concretions and their situations in the animal body such are the calcular urinae salivae pulmonum gastricus fellis and the calculus podagrae he then consisiders the component parts of that faex chyli or lixivium the urine and the changes to which it is liable in smell taste and color by the different ingesta under which article he mentions a singular fact of a gentleman who after having labored under an inveterate acidity at the stomach for which he had taken large quantities of chalk found his urine altered so as to have entirely a milky appearance in considering the immediate generation of the calculus he adopts the boerhaavian theory and ascribes it to chrystallization this leads him to consider all those circumstances which favor and accelerate this mode of concreting and to seek for somewhat analogous thereto in the human body as predisposing causes to this malady which he finds in atonia and the use of acid and fermented liquors he finishes the theory by some curious and apt reflections on the great analogy between this disorder and the gout and their transitions  in the therapeutic part notwithstanding all that had been written relating to the power of alkaline medicines in dissolving the connecting gluten and thus promoting the decomposition of the calculus the author does not allow them so much merit as has been attributed to them by many writers he is inclined to give more efficacy to bitters particularly as prophylactics from the idea of their striking more immediately at the atonia and adduces two examples communicated to him by the president linnaeus himself of the use of the essentia absinthii in this dreadful disease this disquisition concludes with an observation on a milkdiet in the stone and gout the efficacy of which he confirms by two welladapted cases which however agreeably to foregoing observations prove the necessity in the gout of adhering to the regimen when once adopted throughout life one of these affords a melancholy lesson of the danger of deserting it in the case of a french general who after twenty years freedom from the disease at the age of  0 died in consequence of a fit brought on by one plentiful meal of animal food     gemmae arborum p loefling      this gentleman who afterward at the recommendation of linnaeus obtained a pension as naturalist to the king of spain and died in his service in america has here given us a curious and elaborate disquisition on the buds of trees a part in vegetables which till this time had been less attentively examined than many others  gems or buds are small rounded parts made up of scales differently arranged situated commonly on the stem or branches of trees and containing in epitome the rudiments of either the future flower singly the leaves singly or both flower and leaves analogous to the flower and leafbearing gem which is the most common is a bulb placed at the root of many plants inasmuch as both contain a future perfect plant requiring only envelopement by the genial effect of heat these gems and bulbs are called by linnaeus hybernacula as enclosing the embryo during the winter and the former are almost confined to trees of the colder countries after a requisite account of the subject in general dr loefling exhibits a classification of the gems of  0  species of trees and shrubs founded on the different structure and situation of the various kinds in consequence of this arrangement the species of any of these trees is supposed to be capable of being discovered in the winter season and state of defoliation by the buds alone     pan suecus n l hesselgren      the originality and singular good tendency and design of this paper induced the writer of this volume several years ago to throw it into a form more immediately adapted to an english reader by referring to english authors and it was then laid before the public in the gentlemans magazine for the year      accompanied with some notes and general observations this has enabled him to annex it in a still more enlarged form to this volume     splachnum l montin    0 mr montin at the instance of linnaeus had made an expedition the preceding summer into lapland and amongst other natural productions had brought back this curious and uncommon moss and in this paper gives a complete botanical history of its genus called splachnum the first species of which singular for the elegant form of the heads had been first discovered by an englishman in nonway and communicated to mr petiver there are three others of which a less specious kind is not uncommon on our bogs in england  mr montin in this journey had an opportunity of confirming an opinion which linnaeus had before conceived relating to the cause of a most excruciating colic to which the laplanders are often subjected and which he describes very particularly in the flora lapponica p    when treating of the angelica which among other simples is used as a remedy mr montin thinks it clear that it arises from swallowing in their waters the gordius aquaticus a species of worm described in the fauna suecica no  0   well known to gesner and the older writers under the name of vitulus aquaticus and seta aquatica as being no thicker than a horse hair     semina muscorum p j bergius    0 dr bergius since professor of pharmacy and natural history at stockholm has in this tract thrown considerable light on the fructification of the second order of vegetables in the cryptogamia class much more however has been done since the time he wrote and it is now thought that the tribe of mosses have separate male and female flowers the former of which usually stand on long pedicles the latter are as yet in most genera very obscurely investigated and linnaeus himself appears to be doubtful whether the dust which we observe in the heads of mosses is the pollen antherarum or the seeds themselves     materia medica e regno animali k j sidren    0 this enumeration contains    subjects and is executed exactly on the plan of our authors materia medica e plantis of which we

at the expense of the empress of russia in investigating the natural history of that kingdom amongst these we may particularly remark that foetid plant called cimicifuga foetida syst not ii     so offensive and even poisonous to those insects from which it receives its name a decoction of this drastic herb is used in siberia as gmelin informs us flor sib iv p     with great success in dropsies  it is a curious remark which is suggested by our author that in journeying eastwards in kamtchatka the botanist sees his nearer approach toward north america by the habit of many of the plants and hence arose a presumptive proof of the vicinity of the two continents before real discoveries had confirmed the truth of it the author has given a list of several plants that are actually the same as are found in north america   0 sapor medicamentorum j rudberg      after having premised some general observations on all the ancient sects of physicians and felicitated the present age on the rejection of all hypotheses and opinions not supported by experiments and considered the general physiology of the human body dr roberg proceeds to his subject which may be regarded as a very instructive comment on the    d aphorism of the philosophia botanica sapida in fluida et solida agunt under which all vegetable simples are arranged into eleven classes founded on distinctions arising from their sensible qualities principally as they affect the taste as follows   sicca   aquosa   viscosa   salsa   acida   styptica   dulcia   pinguia   amara  0 acria    nauseosa under each of these heads respective simples are arranged and the comment is subjoined explaining the mode of their action and effects both on the solids and fluids and frequently specifying the particular diseases in which they are employed a set of apt corollaries are added and upon the whole this little tract is by no means unworthy the attention of medical students in general and especially of those who wish to comprehend the linnaean theory of physic  to this volume of the amoenitates are subjoined the three orations of linnaeus which as they make part of his own proper works have been spoken of in the foregoing pages of this volume  amoenitates academicae vol iii      pp        nova plantarum genera l j chenon      chiefly a description of new genera and species of plants brought from north america

superseded a plate is added on which are engraven seven of the rarer species     plantae hybridae j haartman      the subject of this paper is very intersting in botanic science and being as yet somewhat problematical has exercised the pens of several ingenious men but of none perhaps more successfully than that of the late dr gmelin in his sermo academicus de novorum vegetabilium ortu tubing      mr haartman allows the possibility of this origin or new creation of vegetables arising from the influence of the farina of one species upon the pistil of another either of the same or of a different genus thus producing what is called a hybrid plant instances of this admixture and production of monsters in the vegetable kingdom have been frequent but as in the animal kingdom they have not usually been found to perpetuate themselves by producing fertile seeds the general effect of culture and the immense number of species with which particularly many of the african genera abound such as the geranium erica mesembryanthemum etc very much favor this hypothesis a catalogue is given of    species of wellknown plants supposed to have originated in this manner specifying those also from which they are suspected to have sprung and a comparison is made between the several parts and habit of each with the corresponding hybrid offspring to show the probability of this origin another list of many other plants follows in which the traces are not so strongly marked among the english indigenous plants thought to have thus originated we mention the veronica hybrida or welsh speedwell which is believed to have arisen from the officinalis and the spicata as the sibthorpia europaea is from the golden saxifrage and marsh pennywort     obstacula medicinae j g beyersten      an enquiry into and a brief discussion of the causes that have hitherto impeded the progress of physic an ingenious and wellconducted plan and most laudable design which all those who wish well to the art would desire to see still farther illustrated by some such character as would command attention and give the subject that importance which it demands among other obstacles the writer mentions  the force of custom in directing prescription theories founded on hypotheses neglect of nosology too little attention to reputed poisons timid prescription too small doses ignorance of apothecaries in botany and the materia medica use of compound medicines ignorance of the natural classes of plants etc  all which positions are confirmed by suitable reflections and examples     plantae esculentae patriae j hiorth      a list of such native plants of sweden as have been or in some way or other may be objects of culinary use principally as aliments to which are added condiments and succedanea to several of those articles of exotic luxury which the opulent nations of europe import from distant parts of the world it is happily not an object of importance much less of necessity to consult such a catalogue in this nation but it would be matter of pleasure and surprise to many to see the great number of vegetables which in a country from its situation far from fertile may supply the want of bread the subjects of this tract amount to     many of which would demand a place in an economical herbal adapted to a much milder climate     euphorbia j wiman      a complete botanical history of one of the most extensive genera of plants several of which have a place in the materia medica which in the linnaean system stands in the dodecandrous class and furnishes greater instances of anomalies in the habit of the species than perhaps is elsewhere to be met with as it contains not only the euphorbium the esula and cataputia of the shops but also all the tithymali or spurges of authors fiftythree species are described in this dissertation and their synonyms delivered together with a general account of their uses in physic in the species plantarum this genus is augmented to the number of    kinds to which probably more might be added from burmans flora indica at this day the euphorbia are but little used internally scarcely ever their extreme acrimony and drastic powers being too unmanageable     materia medica e regno lapideo j lindhult      under    heads dr lindhult has comprised all the simples of the materia medica from the fossil kingdom digested exactly in the method observed by linnaeus himself in his separate publication of the vegetable materia medica     morbi ex hyeme s brodd      preceding the history of the diseases arising from winter cold in sweden dr brodd gives a general account of the effects of intense cold on the animals of the country in changing their color diminishing the size of the breed in various species and in lapland he thinks it is instanced in the human race itself the state of the atmosphere the production of meteors differences observable in the particles of the snow effects of various and additional degrees of cold on the ice of lakes etc extraordinary appearance of the aurora borealis prognostics of severe winters and signs of the approaching remissions of cold with other curious particulars  the diseases of the winter season in sweden are more particularly such as follow perniones or kibes unusually painful and untractable for the cure among other applications mentioned is the diluted marine acid recommended by linnaeus himself who had found it useful among the sailors when he was physician to the fleet but this cannot be used when the disease is advanced to its ulcerated state paronychia or whitlow of various kinds very frequent and not seldom attended with dangerous consequences congestio hyemalis a species of catarrh extremely common and the source of worse diiseases usually arising from sudden transitions from heat to cold and incautious exposure to the latter observations on this disorder from the iter westrogothicum of linnaeus coughs universal sometimes to the entire disturbance of all public assemblies pleurisies especially among the country people who indulge in strong liquors peripneumonies particularly considered as endemic with the inhabitants about the copper mines the tract

teaches that those different sensations excited in the organs of smell by different odours will lead to the explanation of the qualities inherent in such bodies and that from thence they may be classed and their general effects on the human body deduced after a train of general explanatory and physiological observations mr wablin introduces sir francis bacons contrast between youth and old age in order more clearly to illustrate which he does in a familiar but striking manner the effects of wine and spirituous liquors in their various and progressive operation on the nervous system from their first exhilarating effect in a moderate quantity to their intoxicating and fatal issue this he makes in some measure the basis of his reasoning on the effects of other odorous substances which he at length arranges into seven classes    aromatici cinnamon seeds of amomum etc   fragrantes saffron jasmin flowers etc   ambrosiaci musk musk crainsbill etc   alliacei garlic assa foetida etc   hircini herb robert stinking orach   tetri opium henbane corianders   nauseosi white and black hellebore tobacco the specific effects of each of these classes are then briefly explained and their

   mr adler who went as surgeon in a swedish east india ship to china in      first gives an account of those authors who have treated on the luminous appearance of the sea water in storms and in the current occasioned by the course of ships and then proceeds to inform us that it was not till the year      that this phenomenon was certainly discovered to be owing at least in many parts of the ocean to an inconceivable number of minute insects one of these is the subject of this paper and is completely described and a figure given as augmented by the microscope it is of the vermes class and the mollusca order and stands in the system under the name of nereis noctiluca p  0   being the first of eleven species there described its real length does not exceed the  th part of an inch  later writers have thrown more light on this discovery by exhibiting a great variety of these living phosphori   0 rhabarbarum s ziervogel      a botanical and medical history of the rheum undulatum sp pl     described here under the idea of its being the true rhubarb having been sent from russia as such by professor gerber to consul sprekelsen at hamburgh and by him introduced into many gardens the medical history therefore of this plant must be transferred to the rheum palmatum which is now generally believed to be the true rhubarb of which a description and figure may be seen in the phil trans

quantities of good rhubarb mr pennant has told us in his late tour that the duke of athol has produced it in great perfection and probably if particular interests did not militate against it the importation of this root might soon become unnecessary it is not wonderful that the former plant should have been taken for the true rhubarb as both grow in china and about the famous wall     cui bono c gedner      to what purpose are all the researches of the naturalist a question which only ignorance or incuriosity can dictate we will not pay our readers so ill a compliment as to suppose they need the conviction here referred to nevertheless if there are any who wish to see what reasons may be alleged by the naturalist against those who object the frivolousness and inutility of his researches they will most probably receive some satisfaction from an attentive consideration of this paper which is incapable of abridgment and may be properly read with the   th curicsitas naturalis

recommendable as containing a compendious view of every material argument that has been urged to prove the propriety and advantage of mothers nursing their infants at their own breast several observations on the diseases of children are interspersed and some local observations which lose their force in this country  this subject has been so ably discussed by several masterly pens in this kingdom that we shall only observe respecting the present tract that dr lindberg allows more force than some of our own writers to those arguments which admit of diseases and temperaments being transmissible from nurses to their fosterchildren     hospita insectorum flora j g forsskahl      the author of this paper begins by giving a general history of all the material writers on insects and the method in which they have treated the subject whether in relation to the metamorphoses and economy principally in the manner of swammerdam or by giving a detail of the species at large also as ray reaumur and de geer have done he then does due honor to the queen of sweden on account of the magnificent museum which her majesty had constructed at the palace of drottningholm which is very superb in insects shells corals and chrystals etc he next exhibits his plan it consists in arranging all such insects as are natives of sweden each under the plant on which it is found or on which it feeds the references being made to the fauna and flora suecica of linnaeus it would be highly acceptable to those who cultivate this branch of natural history to see this arrangement augmented by the numerous discoveries that have been made since the publication of this tract as it is a part of the history of insects not sufficiently attended to before and nothing would conduce more to extend and facilitate the knowledge of it or lead more effectually to the means of destroying the noxious species     miracula insectorum g e avelin      intended to awaken curiosity and excite attention to the study of insects by pointing out the extraordinary instincts and properties with which particular kinds are endued many of whose operations were inexplicable and frequently attributed to other causes  nothing exemplifies this truth more than the history of a minute insect or rather worm of which we have in this dissertation the first proper intelligence it is very curious and worthy of notice in finland bothnia and the northern provinces of sweden it was not unfrequently that people were seized with a pungent pain confined to a point in the hand or other exposed part of the body which presently increased to a most excruciating degree has sometimes been suddenly fatal this disorder was more particularly observed in finland especially about boggy and marshy places and always in autumn at length it was discovered that this pain instantly succeeded somewhat that dropped out of the air and in a moment penetrated and buried itself in the flesh the finlanders had tried variety of applications to no purpose until at length a poultice of curds or cheese was found the most effectual in easing the pain and the event confirmed that the insect was allured by this application to leave the flesh as on its removal this worm no longer than the sixth of an inch was found in it and thus the cause of this painful disease explained linnaeus himself once suffered from this animal the effect here spoken of but we owe the complete history of it and its place in the system to dr solander who gave it in to the royal academy of sciences at upsal this worm stands in the system under the name of furia infernalis p      but by what means this creature is raised into the air is as yet unknown     noxa insectorum m a baeckner      a curious and useful paper particularly specifying all those insects that are more immediately hurtful to animals and vegetables they are classed in eleven divisions according to the several subjects on which they prey or to which they bring devastation    such as are particularly offensive to man under this head the author seems inclined to favor that opinion which mr st andre and some other french physicians and philosophers have held in ascribing to acari the cause of many cutaneous and contagious diseases    such as are destructive within doors to furniture clothes grain etc among these is particularly mentioned the seed beetle bruchus pisi syst

herbs    to trees woods stove and greenhouse plants    to cornfieldsd pastures etc    to horses horned cattle and other animals etc  the subjects of these three last papers are of great importance in rural economy and would come with all possible propriety into an economical herbal that should specify in treating upon each plant the species of insect which inhabits or feeds on it     vernatio arborum h barck      a curious essay perhaps the first on the subject relating to the leafing of trees in sweden being the result of a variety of observations made at the request of linnaeus himself in almost all the provinces of that kingdom and intended to lead as if by the dictates of nature to the true time of committing the grain to the earth a table is exhibited showing at one view the days on which    species of trees all natives of sweden put forth their leaves in three successive years the same table shows also the day on which barley was sown and reaped in all the same provinces from another table it appears that at pitha which lies in about    degrees north from the average of    years there intervene    days between the sowing of barley and its harvest and at upsal in  0 degrees the average of six years turned out to be  0  days it is concluded upon the whole that in upland the leafing of the birchtree should direct the time for sowing barley but that different trees will best indicate the time in different places another curious observation follows from this paper that notwithstanding the difference in the number of days between the ripening of barley in lapland and in upland it will be found that the greater length of days in the former country gives a balance of sun equal to the greater number of days in the latter     incrementa botanices j biuur      a concise history of the rise fate and progress of botanic science from the first traces of it to the present time divided into four periods or epochs the first includes only the ancients by whom are understood aristotle theophrastus dioscorides and pliny who as compilers chiefly did little but deliver the tradition of the times and whose plants after the commentaries of a century cannot be known by their descriptions to this day so little had they extended their ideas to specific distinctions yet we must venerate their writings as the only remains of this science transmitted to our times the second period commences with the restoration of letters after the taking of constantinople by the turks beginning with brunfelsius and ending with the bauhines the third which is called the period of systematics is continued to the time of linnaeus who effected that great reformation in the whole science by which it is fixed as on a new basis the conclusion of this paper contains some information relating to the introduction of figures cut in wood for the old herbals whence it appears that plantin the famous printer of antwerp monopolized almost all the figures of this kind during his time and became the principal printer in his day for botanical books by such means norton the printer of gerards herbal procured from frankfort all the figures we see in his book which had before served for an edition of tabernamontanuss herbal in          demonstrationes plantarum j g hojer      intended principally for the use of those pupils who attended the botanical lectures in the upsal garden

double flowers and varieties being entirely excluded after the invention of trivial names this list is the first specimen of the use of them in forming compendious catalogues and is at once an evidence of the utility of them there is an observation in this paper which may appear somewhat paradoxical to some readers several of the plants that are natives of southern europe produced seeds

have been very useful at the time of its publication having been drawn up for the benefit of the apothecaries in sweden in consequence of some new regulations intended by the royal college of physicians under the presidentship of dr boeck and it was also highly acceptable to others as being probably the first list of the medicinal plants to which the linnaean synonyms had been accommodated

congenerous animals such as the wolf fox hyaena etc not only by the curvature of the tail which is usually to the left but by the disposition of the suturae velleris or ridges formed by the meeting of

animal agree eleven varieties of the dogkind are here specified after which the properties and uses together with the whole of the economy of this faithful animal are fully set forth and his diseases

knowledge of the natale solum the natural places of growth of plants is the true foundation on which the art of gardening successfully must be built the author laments that botanists and writers of florae have been too remiss in their observations of this kind whence numbers of exotic seeds and plants have failed to produce flowers or to perpetuate themselves in gardens he mentions a remarkable instance in the nitraria schoberi spec pl     which remained destitute of flowers for  0 years in the swedish gardens at length linnaeus rendered it fertile by means of salt scattered about the roots the knowledge of the stationes plantarum is also equally useful to the practical botanist in assisting his researches  every plant has its natural situation and soil in which alone it will thrive and out of which in many instances no care or culture will preserve it alive the knowledge of this axiom as far as respects indigenous plants is applicable to purposes of agriculture and with this view the author has given an arrangement of the swedish plants divided into six classes according to their several places of growth as follows   aquatics   alpine   woodplants   upland plants   mountainous   parasitic these are again subdivided the aquatics into marine maritime marsh bog plants etc after which follows the definition of the terms explaining the nature of these different soils and situations     flora anglica j o grufberg      at the time of the publication of this paper the linnaean system of botany had made but small progress in england to such however as had adopted it this must have been a very acceptable present as being the first arrangement in the linnaean method that had been given to the english plants as also the first of those compendious florae in which the newlyinvented trivial names had been exemplified and which have since been much used greatly to the emolument of the science  the author first discusses the utility of such local catalogues and of adhering to the trivial names he then briefly describes the climate of britain and its different soils and elevations as favoring the growth of particular plants enumerating some of those which are peculiar to england and in what way those of sweden differ from ours he says sweden abounds more in alpine upland and woodplants than england which excels in marine plants and such as affect a chalky soil of which latter sweden is almost destitute  having given due praise to the english botanists and particularly to mr ray he subjoins the catalogue in which there is a reference from each linnaean

inferior to the hortus malabaricus as to the engravings excels it in the history of the subjects there are nearly one thousand vegetables described in this work of which a great number were entirely new to the european botanists of this number upwards of seven hundred are engraved  the manuscript was  0 years in the possession of the dutch east india company and was rescued from oblivion by the interest and extraordinary zeal of the editor professor burman of amsterdam who with great industry and skill has also extricated the synonyms as far as possible and subjoined them to each description

the publication of an alphabetical index to these volumes with the linnaean synonyms together with a like one adapted to the hortus malabaricus  the pupils of the linnaean school much regretted that the herbarium amboinense had not been completed before the publication of linnaeuss species plantarum that the synonyms might have been introduced to remedy this defect was the intention of mr stickmans paper in which the subjects are arranged in the order of the original work with the linnaean name annexed to each and afterward as many as could be extricated are thrown into a flora according to the sexual system  it is to our neighbors the dutch that the botanists are obliged for two of the most valuable performances that are yet extant in the history of foreign vegetables this

  0 horticultura academica j g wollrath      this paper is intimately connected with no    the stationes plantarum it exhibits a compendious system of the principles of gardening particularly as applicable to botanical or academic gardens in the beginning it is laid down as an axiom that the whole depends on a perfect knowledge of the climate of each plant and the soil in which it flourishes in its own climate as a striking instance of the necessity of paying regard to proper soil and to induce curious people who transmit seeds and plants to europe to be more accurate in this particular the writer mentions that of the ricotia aegyptiaca spec pl p     which no management could bring to flower and fruit until linnaeus suggested mixing the argilla nilotica the clay of the nile with the earth in the pot and which very soon fully succeeded  the linnaean terms applicable to the several kinds of gardens are defined the heat of the different climates ascertained by celsiuss thermometer and the various soils and situations proper to each enumerated     chinensia lagerstromiana j l odhelius      at the time that linnaeuss great patron count tessin was chancellor to the king and president of the royal academy of sciences he obtained by the concurrence also of m lagerstrom then counselor of the chamber of commerce and director of the swedish east india company an order that each ship should be provided at the expense of the company with a naturalist wholly devoted to his proper pursuits to this institution we owe the discoveries made by ternstrom toren and osbeck and in consequence m lagerstrom who was himself a man of letters and a friend to science procured at his own expense a great number of natural curiosities from china and the east indies which he presented to the museum of the university at upsal among these particularly was a collection of the medicinal plants preserved in the apothecaries shops in china also a chinese herbal in    volumes in  vo of which

of its publication excited the attention of the curious throughout europe that nocturnal change to which certain plants are liable and which is here analogically called sleep is more particularly manifested in those vegetables that are furnished with pinnated leaves and of these the diadelphous class affords the greater number the change consists in the different position which the folioles or small leaves assume in the nightime from that which they exhibit by day slight notices of this faculty are met with in the ancients in this paper the observations have been extended so far as to take in upwards of  0 species which are here enumerated and divided into ten classes according to the differences observable in the position of the leaves during this sleeping state the late dr hill by a wellinstituted set of experiments fully confirmed the idea that this change was owing to the absence of light his experiments were made with the abrus precatorius or scarlet indian pea in which plant this change had been observed by prosper alpinus and in which it is remarkable  the novelty of this paper induced the author of this volume soon after its publication to give the substance of it an english dress and it was published in the gentlemans magazine for the year      p     to which the english reader who wishes for further information is referred     fungus melitensis j pfeiffer      this plant notwithstanding the name it bears is very far removed from the fungus tribe since it produces perfectly distinct flowers and belongs to the monandria order of the monoecious class and is called by linnaeus cynomorium coccineum sp pl      the maltese fungus is a parasitical plant singular in its form which is little more than that of a simple stalk about a fingers thickness and six or seven inches long and in its state of fructification the whole plant may be considered as an amentum or catkin it is found on the coast of barbary in sicily and sparingly in malta springing from the roots of trees and shrubs as does the asarum hypocistis with which it also agrees in its sensible qualities and effects and is much esteemed and used in the countries above mentioned as an astringent medicine the writer of this paper gives us from the acta bononiensia a detail of experiments made with this and several other subjects of the same class to determine their comparative astringent and antiseptic powers on the human blood from the result of which he tells us that the author was led to consider this simple as one of the safest and most powerful astringents     metamorphosis plantarum n e dahlberg      the subject of this paper will scarcely admit of an abridgment agreeable to our contracted plan in order the more clearly to understand what the author calls the metamorphosis plantarum he delivers in a brief way the linnaean doctrine of the physiology of plants which supposes that the flower is no other than the expansion or evolution of the trunk or stem in the following arrangement namely that the cortex or outer bark is ultimately spent in forming the perianthium or cup the liber or inner bark in forming the corolla or petal the lignum or woody part in forming the stamina or chives and the medulla or pithy part in forming the pistillum or pointal hence whatsoever causes can disturb the usual natural and regular expansion and evolution of these parts may be supposed to occasion great variety and changes in the appearance of plants and that such effects are brought about by change of climate different soil situation air culture and perhaps various other yet unknown causes is certain to these sources must be traced the varieties we observe in the leaves flowers and roots whether permanent as is the case in some instances or not this doctrine is here illustrated and confirmed by numerous examples and the young and inexperienced botanist is guarded against the delusion frequently occasioned by the operation of these causes which are very extensive in the vegetable creation     calendarium florae a m berger      the calendar of flora is intended to exhibit the progress of the seasons as they are manifsted by the times of the flowering of vegetables which in each species appears to be determined from some fixed law of nature and from the due observance of which after a sufficient course of experiments had been made the author thinks that the sowing of grain and many other branches of rural economy dependent on the seasons might in every country be better regulated than by the rules in common use the tables in this tract were formed from observations made on the common plants of sweden in the upsal garden in      this affair is also connected with the return and departure of migrating birds and furnishes many curious and useful hints but we do not enlarge as this thesis was translated and published with an english calendar of flora by the late mr stillingfleet to which we refer our readers for more ample satisfaction see also the vernatio arborum no    of this collection a paper strictly connected with the calendar of flora     flora alpina n n amann      the alps of europe produce a set of vegetables very different from and incapable of culture in the lower situations the author of this tract who was a native of one of the provinces bordering on the alps of lapland with a laudable zeal for the improvement of his country enquires what kinds of vegetables might be cultivated in those desert regions to the most advantage where so few thrive where shrubs scarcely ever attain even a moderate size and where a tree will hardly grow erect  to this end he first enumerates all the alpine parts of europe and gives a list of  00 plants peculiar to those situations he expresses a wish that at the royal or public expense a garden might be planted in the alps to determine with precision what exotic plants would bear introduction into lapland and concludes by pointing out some of the esculent and medicinal kinds as also some that are applicable to dyeing and other arts which he thinks might be cultivated to advantage in that northern region     flora palaestina b j strand      many commentators have employed themselves in determining the plants of the sacred writings among whom none are thought to have been more successful than the late learned professor olaus celsius in his hierobotanicon who was not only well qualified by his skill in the learned languages and particularly in the oriental but was himself also an excellent botanist he lamented that by a singular fate whilst the missionaries of the romish church had in various other parts of the world been very instrumental in improving natural science palaestine had been totally neglected hence he was doubly solicitous to recover the collection of his countryman hasselquist and much rejoiced that it was at last redeemed as he hoped a view of the subjects would throw great light on his favorite pursuit of illustrating the phytology of the scriptures hasselquist had particular instructions to attend to this point how well he performed this function is proved by the present flora which is chiefly drawn from his discoveries  this catalogue is compiled in the same compendious method as the other florae of these volumes after the generical only the trivial name being cited the author has also availed himself of other helps from those travelers whose skill in this part of knowledge was indisputable some plants he has introduced on the authority of rauwolf prosper alpinus shaw pocock and gronovius the whole number amounts to six hundred species mr strand has applied celsiuss names to his list wheresoever it was possible but the curious will regret that the learned author of the hierobotanicon

strength in the nervous system and from the second that strength in the vascular system must be derived in considering his first position he has in a concise manner thrown together a variety of arguments which he endeavors to confirm by the most respectable authorities to prove that various disorders are transmissible to the offspring also that independent of the specific disorders thus transmitted from the parent others arise in children from enervated and debauched progenitors to the first class he refers mania epilepsy gout stone and some others to the latter particularly the rickets in considering his second position he prescribes the appropriate regimen to the mother during pregnancy and for the nurse whom he would always suppose to be the mother and finally concludes with some forcible persuasives to young men not to defeat these desirable ends by a course of intemperance     specifica canadensium j von coelln      in the first chapter of this tract the writer after presenting us with a view of the progress of medical science through the several schools and sects of physicians and condemning that sarrago of compound medicines with which the practice of physic has been so long burdened considers the return to a more simple mode of prescribing as intimately connected with its improvement this leads him to his subject which is intended to exhibit and recommend to the notice of physicians a number of simples from the vegetable kingdom used by the natives of north america in the cure of their diseases some of which may be worth the notice of european physicians these may be considered as constituting the materia medica of the indians among whom as with other barbarous nations all that can be called physic depends entirely on the empirical application of simples nor can it be doubted that long experience has confirmed the efficacy of many to them  this catalogue is chiefly compiled from  artrams appendix coldens papers in the  from the

this writer after having pointed out the advantages and disadvantages of eating crude vegetables showing to what constitutions such food is adapted and having treated largely on the qualities of oil

avium c d ecmark      this paper is confessedly one of the most complete that has been published on this curious subject which is yet involved in considerable obscurity the cause of these migrations with respect to several birds and the places of their resort being yet unknown with respect to the greater number it cannot be doubted but that the facility of finding their appropriate food in distant countries in the different seasons and their security during incubation have the principal share in this part of their economy  mr ecmark observes that the greater number of migrating birds belong to the flatbilled order anseres particularly to the goose and merganser genera and to the waders grallae the former mostly breed in the extreme north where from the relation of linnaeus their number almost darkens the air and they are driven southward by the freezing of the lakes and rivers numbers also of the smallbilled birds passeres especially those with slender bills are of the migrating class the insectivorous retire southwards when our winter advances as others in that season visit us for the sake of berries  it is no small merit in mr ecmark that in this paper he brings together in one view more completely than any other writer had done all the known species of migrating birds whether exotic or indigenous to sweden he gives a list of all such as are mentioned in the writings of catesby klein and hasselquist but the most considerable part of his tract is employed in a methodical enumeration of the indigenous birds of sweden under each of which he mentions as fully as is yet possible the particular times of their several migrations the places whither they resort their food etc and intersperses many other remarks equally curious and satisfactory to those who wish for information in this part of natural history  amoenitates academicae vol v    0 pp        morbi expeditionis classicae      p bierchen      the author of this tract was physician to the fleet of observation which was fitted out in the beginning of the last war between england and france by the swedes to act in conjunction with the danes in the north sea the swedish squadron consisted of eight ships of the line besides frigates when m bierchen took his appointment in august he found not fewer than   00 men on the sick list and that the principal diseases were fluxes fevers and the scurvy the first were attended with great pain in the bowels extreme weakness fever and a very weak pulse the fevers were of that kind which has been called the upsal fever from its having been remarkably epidemical in that city and neighborhood this disease was evidently of that class which is called putrid and was much more acute in summer than in autumn it was attended with frequent and obstinate haemorrhages from the nose early in the disease a quiet kind of delirium trembling tongue twitching tendons deafness petechiae and vibices on the skin as the heat declined haemorrhages were not so much observed the disorder attacked with pain and lassitude of body vertigo and pain in the head cough and oppression of the breast and was afterward attended with cardialgia nausea vomiting turbid and sometimes in the decline bloody urine also great prostration of strength weak pulse and subsultus tendinum were symptoms of this fever and many were seized in the beginning with violent fluxes the scurvy seems to have been attended with no other than the usual symptoms  our author appears to have been very solicitous in his endeavors to find out the cause of the extreme prevalence of this disease in the fleet in the scurvy besides the use of salted meats he attributes much to the want of sufficient exercise on board the ships and confirms the observations of some other writers that the disease independent of regimen or diet decreased when the fleet was out at sea and consequently the ships more agitated by wind and waves and the men more employed and that it augmented when they were in a state of inaction in port he condemns the use of fat and lard as difficult of coction and favorable to the disease in the cure he recommends acids and says he used principally the vitriolic but above all he celebrates the praises of sourkrout for the efficacy of which he also cites the authority and experience of sir john pringle  he considers the fevers as arising from impeded perspiration cooperating with the effects of cold moist and foul air and in this expedition he thinks the insufficiency of proper clothing during the watches might not unfrequently be found a predisposing cause he is of opinion that the disease was contagious and says many were cured by the early exhibition of emetics in the general method of cure the practice laid down by our later writers in england was successfully pursued  the fluxes and dysenteric disorders he ascribes particularly to the prevalence of saline and putrid acrimony in the food of seamen aided by foul air and want of exercise and propagated at length by contagion too  our author concludes by suggesting that there are two causes of a general and permanent nature which predispose to these diseases in all naval expeditions these are impure air and a constant depression of spirits in seamen not hitherto sufficiently attended to and inducing a degree of real nostalgia he seems to be sufficiently aware of the importance of correcting the first and recommends strongly the use of ventilators to the other it is not easy to apply a remedy he informs us that both swedes and swiss find the greatest relief in the malady du pais next to their return home from strong exercise however he hints his wishes that the pay of the men was advanced as one of the best means of inspiring them with cheerfulness and hilarity necessary to counterbalance this evil at least in some degree  to conclude the subject of this paper has been so well treated by several later judicious writers amongst us that the english physician cannot expect to meet with much new matter in this dissertation but it is nevertheless very worthy the regard of all who wish to make themselves acquainted with the diseases of the navy     febris upsaliensis a bostrom      the fever here described which had been remarkably epidemical in diverse parts of sweden but particularly at upsal for several years before this time and which had by many been supposed to be a new distemper dr bostrom considers as of the remittent class and common in all other parts of europe he has determined its type to be that of the hemitritaea of linnaeus see genesis morb no    or the semitertian of authors in some years indeed he observes that it seemed to have changed its form was attended with petechiae and became contagious under which appearance it was named febris petechizans and febris nervosa when attended particularly with delirium and spasms in its milder state especially in the spring it assumed a regular quotidian or continued tertian type  in seeking the causes of the frequency of this fever in upsal particularly our author accedes to that opinion which attributes intermitting and exacerbating fevers to the effects of moist and foul air and thinks from the situation of the city of upsal the closeness of the streets and especially from the stagnating canals and waters that its prevalence in that city may fairly be referred to

expedition into the countries around the caspian sea for that purpose     exanthemata viva j c nyander      the origin of contagious diseases has exercised the pens of many ingenious physicians and various theories have been invented all of which are briefly recited in the beginning of this disquisition the author had been led by some singular circumstances to incline to that of kircher which ascribes them to animalcula and who has had many followers especially in france  he next proceeds to show the several analogies that subsist in the symptoms of contagious diseases and as animalcula have been demonstrated in the itch and as he thinks in the dysentery too so he tells us they have been seen in the measles by langius in the pestilence by kircher in the siphylis by hauptman in petechiae by sigler in the smallpox by lusitanus and porcellus as also in the serpigo and other cutaneous affections he then proceeds to adduce all that occurs in defense of this theory from the consideration of facts arising in the following diseases the itch dysentery hoopingcough smallpox measles plague and siphylis  in the itch the existence of the acarus siro syst p  0   is acknowledged and he thinks it not less certain that a species of this genus exists as the cause of dysenteries to this opinion the author was led by a singular fact that occurred to dr rolander during his residence in professor linnaeuss house he had been infested with the dysentery for some time and had been relieved twice by taking rhubarb but the disease recurred commonly at the end of about eight days he was the only one in the house thus affected and was put by the professor upon examining his egesta with a view to prove the truth of bartholines assertion who relates that he had seen the alvine dejections full of the most minute insects in this disease dr rolanders observation on his own state confirmed the fact and he afterward discovered that these animalcula were conveyed into his body in water received from a vessel made of juniper wood this acarus is described in the system p  0   our plan will not allow us to follow the author through the whole of his disquisition it must suffice to say that it is ingenious and well worthy the attention of all those who wish to be acquainted with the doctrine which it favors     transmutatio frumentorum b hornborg      the purport of this dissertation is to combat and abolish a longestablished vulgar error which nevertheless prevailed until the time of harvey among some men of considerable knowledge and even now still subsists among the vulgar in some parts of europe namely that one kind of grain was convertible by different soils into an inferior distinct and more useless species thus that wheat in an impoverished soil would change to rye this to barley barley into darnel this into bromegrass bromegrass into oats some of the ancients carried their belief farther supposing on the other hand that in fertile lands the reverse would take place as these ideas were repugnant to truth so they were in many cases unfriendly to improvement this author after having observed that among the romans the res rustica was held in such estimation that even the men of quality themselves disdained not to cultivate agriculture laments that in modern times it is too much neglected by the great he therefore urges gentlemen to pursue the history and philosophy of vegetables through the whole extent of them as the foundation of practical improvements with this view he refers them to the many excellent papers thereon contained in this collection and from the physiology of plants the consideration of the mechanism of them and particularly that of the parts of fructification he shows the futility of the opinion which he had undertaken to confute and particularly levels his arguments against that part of it which has gained the most belief and remained longest in the minds of his countrymen and the peasants that oats are mutable into rye  no notice is taken in this dissertation of the secale cornutum or ergot which with other vitiated grain has been supposed to occasion the necrosis ustilaginea vide sauvagess nosolog

exhibited a list of vegetables that are eaten in a crude state as sallads the present is intended to show the change which has taken place since the time of the ancients in the choice of vegetable aliments by substituting instead of what were then used a number of more bland agreeable and nutritive plants  in this review of the alteration which this part of the culinary system has undergone the author under each article gives a comparative sketch of the qualities of each and shows the superiority of the modern substitute to mention some of the most material  the acorns and nuts of the primitive days have given way to all the variety of sweeter farinaceous seeds and roots  to the malvaceous tribe of plants so much used by the greeks and romans has succeeded the more grateful spinach and to the blite the garden orach  the rough borage is supplanted by the acescent sorrel and asparagus has banished a number of roots recorded by the roman writers under the name of bulbs though at this day it is not easy to determine the several species  our author however thinks that the parsnip has undeservedly usurped the place of the skirret  the bean of the ancients improperly so called being the roots as well as other parts of the nymphaea nelumbo sp pl   0 or indian water lilly is superseded by the kidneybean  the garden rocket brassica eruca sp pl     eaten with and as an antidote against the chilling lettuce is banished by the more agreeable cress and tarragon the apium by the meliorated cellery the pompion and others of the cucurbitaceous tribe by the melon and the sumach berries by the fragrant nutmeg  the silphium or succus cyrenaicus which the romans purchased from persia and india at a great price and is thought by some to have been the asa foetida of the present time is no longer used in preference to the alliaceous tribe  to turn from the vegetable to some of the animal substitutes we may mention the carp among fishes as having excluded a great number held in high estimation in ancient rome  the change of oil for butter of honey for sugar of mulsa liquors made of wine water and honey for the exquisite wines of modern times and that of the ancient zyihus for the improved malt liquors of this day are all recited not to mention also the calida of the roman taverns analogous to our bewitching tea and coffee     spigelia anthelmia j g colliander      a botanical and medical history of the indian pink or wormgrass which has been so much used and so greatly celebrated for expelling worms from the human body  dr colliander does more than barely treat of the plant having enumerated the several kinds of worms infesting the human species the ascaris vermicularis and lumbricoides syst p      the lumbricus terrestris g ib and the taenia syst      he then gives a distinct account of the symptoms that indicate their presence in the human body and the diseases which they too frequently occasion then follows a distinct catalogue of all the supposed anthelminthics from the vegetable and mineral classes and before he comes to the history of the plant in question he recites the several simples which have been considered as specifics among these we may note particularly the fern mentioned by dioscorides as anthelminthic and lately published in france as such at the expense of the king  the history of the spigelia with a figure annexed is then delivered at large nearly as it stands in brownes history of jamaica and in the essays and observations physical and literary by dr lining vol i p      the success of this remedy among the negroes and indians introduced it into practice dr brown administered it in decoction the north american physicians give the powder of the root on which occasion we may observe that subsequent observations have proved the south american and north american spigelia to differ in specie the former is figured in brown and the latter in the essays abovementioned vol iii p     see their botanical distinctions also linn syst not ed xiii p         medicamenta graveolentia j t fagraeus      it is a postulatum in the philosophy of linnaeus that the qualities of medicines are in a general way to be determined by their effect on the organs of taste and smelling and further that the sapida or those which more sensibly strike the taste than the smell do principally operate on the vascular and vital system and that the olida or those which more sensibly strike the organs of smelling operate on the medullary or nervous system the sapor medicamentorum of this collection no  0 may be considered as a comment on the first part of this general distribution of medicines distinguished by the term sapida and the present thesis as an explanation of a large division of the olida here called graveolentia from their strong and ungrateful smell  the combinations of sapids and olids are innumerable but that simples strictly of the latter kind do in a sudden and extraordinary manner exert their influence on the nerves is certain though our author contents himself with the fact without enquiring whether the functions of the nerves are performed by means of animal spirits by vibration the medium of electricity or by any other way and from the graveolentia which are the subject of his thesis he justly observes that we derive some of the most powerful remedies of these he gives a catalogue dividing them into three classes   subinsipid   acrid   bitter each of which is subdivided into two orders as the subjects differ in degrees of strength the subinsipid contains chiefly the narcotics the acrid several of the purging and fetid roots the fetid gums and carminative seeds the bitter contains others of the purging roots and leaves and some of the bitter herbs under each the author specifies in technical terms very briefly the quality and the diseases to which it has been appropriated  he then presents us with a concise but very instructive theory of the operation of this division of the olida leaving to the consideration of others the suaveolentia after which follows a general pathology of those diseases which are remedied by the graveolentia  in treating on the use of external applications dr fagraeus appears to be dissatisfied with the common theory of repellents which are usually drawn from the styptic class and thinks that the first class of graveolentia the narcotics which he supposes to induce a relaxation or temporary palsy in an inflamed part more effectually promote a return of the stagnating and accumulating fluids into the circulation than any styptics can possibly effect and are therefore more justly entitled to that term     arboretum sueticum d d pontin         frutetum suecicum d m virgander      the design of these papers nearly coincides with that of the flora

botanical descriptions are given the name only by which they stand in the linnaean system being introduced the provinces in which they are most plentifully found the soil in which they best thrive their times of leafing flowering and ripening their fruit their duration the best methods of sowing or propagating each and their uses as applicable to the arts but particularly in rural economy are concisely and distinctly treated of  at the end of the arboretum are subjoined some general rules to secure the propagation and growth of trees and at the conclusion of the frutetum the author has pointed out the proper kinds of shrubs for all sorts of hedges adapted to different situations and soils     pandora insectorum e o rydbeck      mr rydbeck pursues the plan of the hospita insectorum no    the completion of which cannot but be subservient to the art of gardening agriculture and the economy of cattle in a variety of instances and is even necessary to facilitate the enquiries of the entomologist  the author in his preliminary sections presents his reader with a history of the metamorphosis of insects from the worm or maggot through that of the chrysalis to the perfect state when it comes out in its full beauty and performs all the functions of its being  the catalogue as that of the hospita exhibits a list of the vegetables of sweden arranged in the sexual method and under each is given the insect which it nourishes it has this advantage beyond the former thesis that the insects are better defined by the more complete addition of the trivial names taken from the enlarged edition of the system of nature which had been published in the interval of these two papers it is accompanied with a plate containing near  0 of the more rare species with references to the numbers in the tenth edition of the system   0 senium salomoneum j pilgren      a paraphrase and comment on solomons description of old age which has so frequently employed the pen both of medical and theological critics with the readers leave this may be called a physiological and pathological explanation of the text not that the author has failed to intersperse suitable moral reflections solomons allusions are probably too obscure at this distance of time to admit of uncontroverted explanation the present attempt must be allowed to be an ingenious one and worthy of the regard of those who wish to turn their attention to this subject     auctores botanici a loo      we are here presented with an alphabetical catalogue of botanic writers amounting to upwards of   0 on the following plan  after the name of the writer follows the time of his birth his rank or profession the period in which he flourished commonly taken from the date of his first publication the title of which is given in brief and lastly the year of his death the catalogue takes in some authors yet living  such as have been eminently conspicuous for their merit are in this list denoted by an asterisk affixed to the name after the alphabetic catalogue other arrangements of the fame authors take place in one particularly they are arranged according to the countries of which they were natives the catalogue

too many who travel are deficient we are presented with the complete method of keeping a journal on the most extensive scale pointing out whatsoever is worthy of observation it is not easy to conceive a plan of instruction on this head more perfectly described in which the traveller will not only find his memory much assisted by having proper objects of inquiry suggested to him whether in nature or art but the method of arranging them also greatly facilitated  one part of his advice is of the utmost importance without the due and regular observance of which nothing will effectually be done nulla

the colors they yield and the methods of extracting them in this materia tinctoria occur many of the indigenous plants of england not commonly known to be possessed of any coloring quality and though their use at present may be superseded by the facility of procuring better from abroad yet these nevertheless remain fit objects of inquiry with the encouragers of arts the catalogue consists of  00

horehound lycopus europaeus    animalia composita a back      under the term animalia composita are comprehended the two last orders of the class of vermes making the last links in the chain of animal nature and thus connecting it with the vegetable kingdom these in opposition to those of the three foregoing orders of the same class which live simple and separate from each other are called compound animals as being connected together by one common base or support either in the form of irregular or rudelybranched stony masses of a calcareous nature as the lithophyta or corals or as fixed to one common stalk more or less branched as the zoophyta or corallines and some others  in order to give a more perfect idea of the nature of these animals the author holds forth the general analogy between animals and vegetables principally to show that the former are not like the latter endowed with that multiplicative power of propagating themselves without the particular energy and exertion of the generative function whereas the animalia composita seem to unite these powers since they not only appear to propagate by eggs or viva soboles but also by progressive extension and ramification  the animals of the lithophyta like the testacea fabricate their own base of calcareous matter forming the whole mass into tubes each ending on the surface in pores or cells according to their specific difference where alone the animal seems to dwell and extending these habitations progressively in the manner of vegetables leaving the base at length to perish  the animals of the zoophyta containing the corallines etc particularly the fixed ones approach much nearer than the foregoing to vegetables both in their texture and form in general arising as if from a root and forming a stem and branches which are beset at the extremities and articulations with the animals or polypes appearing by the help of glasses like so many flowers  since this tract was written the subject has received much farther illustration from the discoveries of the late mr ellis     flora capensis c h wannman      in the time of the romans it was a trite proverb that africa was the land of wonders and it still remains true as in these days it affords both in the animal and vegetable kingdoms some of the most stupendous and singular productions of nature from the first discovery of the cape of good hope from whence europe has chiefly been furnished with the plants of africa their uncommon aspect so very different from those of europe has attracted the notice not only of naturalists but of all mankind and as the mildness of that climate allowed of their cultivation here they soon became favorites in the english gardens  some of the first cape of good hope plants that were brought to europe we owe to j heurnius who sent them to his brother a professor at leyden and they are figured in bodeus a stapels theophrastus p     among these were the indian reed canna indica the haemanthus coccineus stapelia the aletris uvaria and a few others but the first botanist who visited the cape was paul herman he collected  00 species then unknown in europe after him h b oldenland a dane and j hartog a dutchman both made collections of african plants which at length falling into the hands of the present able professor of botany at amsterdam dr john burman he published engravings of ten decads of the more rare kinds from these materials chiefly the present flora is composed according to the usual plan with the trivial names only  among the plants of the cape there are    genera peculiar to that part of the world several of which excel all others in the number of species as well as in their uncommon and superb appearance the vast number of species under the same genus so frequently met with in that country strongly favors the idea of the perpetual new origin of plants and that many which elsewhere are only hybrid there propagate and become permanent but caffraria beyond all other countries abounds with extensive genera of plants the succulent kinds particularly cover the sandy soil where nothing but the fact could convince us that vegetation would in any degree succeed such are the figmarygolds mesembryanthema aloes purslanes etc among the others we are astonished with the variety of the heaths ericae gerania protaeae and gnaphalia  since the publication of m wannmans thesis great discoveries in botany have been made in southern africa by thunberg and sparmann and by mr masson and we have reason to expect a complete account of the plants of that country from dr laurence burman son of professor j burman who has already given us a compendious list of them in his flora indica     flora jamaicensis c g sandmark      the author begins his flora with a general account of the geography of the island and its produce specifying particularly some of the most useful articles thence imported as guaiacum fustic ebony logwood brasiletto mahogany indigo sugar coffee cotton pimento and ginger he then subjoins an account of the two principal works from which his catalogue is compiled these are sir hans sloanes history and dr brownes the former of these writers appears to have been the first naturalist who visited that island and he brought back with him  00 species of plants the latter is said to have made a collection amounting to   00 which after the publication of his history he presented to linnaeus as dr brown followed the linnaean system his book is referred to in this flora     pugillus jamaicensium plantarum g elmgren      a description of one hundred and thirty species of the more rare among the foregoing plants made from dr brownes collection which was in the hands of professor linnaeus     nomenclatura plantarum b berzelius      contains the vernacular names of the genera of plants particularly of european and garden kinds in italian french english dutch and german placed in columns opposed to the latin name it would have been an acquisition to have had the plan of this paper extended much farther so as to have included not only the name of the genus but that by which each species is known in the several countries a thing too much neglected by almost all writers of local catalogues although highly necessary to render them more extensively useful nay farther even the provincial names if possible should be collected as they are frequently very different for the same plant linnaeus in his flora suecica is almost the first and only one who has taken due notice of and supplied this deficiency there is extant on this subject the index plantarum polyglottus of mentzelius published in      but the writer of this nomenclator found it insufficient to his purpose neither indeed can the plan be completed otherwise than by the united endeavors of botanists throughout the world     aer habitabilis j v siefvert      the comprehensive nature of the subject and the concise manner in which the history of the air is treated in this dissertation render it impossible to give a proper abstract in our confined plan this element is here considered in all the various changes to which it is subject its properties under the different and opposite alterations discussed its effects on the earth in the various quarters of the globe and its influence on the health and economy of life and manners of the inhabitants    with respect to its heat and cold in the different quarters of the earth of these the general result is given according to the computation of the swedish thermometer or celsiuss in which 0 is the point of congelation and  00 that of boiling water five degrees in this being equal to nine of farenheits    its dryness and moisture and the general effects of those qualities pointed out the torpid state of the inhabitants of hot countries during summer heat in those countries defoliates trees as cold does in temperate climes    its gravity and the different degrees and effects of it considered    the effects of the different winds and their salutary and pernicious tendencies that of calms also in the isle of st thomas there is a dead calm for two months during which the worst diseases prevail

intelligent reader may not meet with much new matter in this tract yet he will see facts so well illustrated by pertinent observations that we may venture to pronounce this short history and philosophy of this element a useful paper and well worth attention   00 sus scrofa j lindh      a complete natural history of the hog as it appears particularly in its cultured and tame state in which

this animal an object of merchandise  amoenitates academicae vol vi      pp      0  generatio ambigena c l ramstrom      the author begins his subject with a concise view of the ancient and modern theories relating to this obscure affair he observes that the ancient doctrine of equivocal generation prevailed in general until harvey exploded it and taught that every animal is generated ex ovo and that his system may now be considered as including a double hypothesis first that taught by himself which supposes the entire rudiments of the future foetus to be present in the ovum and only waiting for animation from the vivifying principle or aura genitalis masculina the other that of the seminal animalcule entering into the ovum according to the theory arising from lewenhoecks microscopical discoveries we have before observed that linnaeus very early forsook lewenhoecks theory in consequence of attending lieberkuhns demonstrations the argument of the present hypothesis tends to show that both sexes are equally efficient in this work leaning however to the following opinion that the external form as well as the specific energy of the vital functions are principally derived from the male parent this is partly the opinion also of the very eminent dr haller phys     our intended brevity does not allow us to pursue our author through all his arguments in behalf of his hypothesis we must rest satisfied with observing that after drawing a physiological analogy between vegetables and animals he thinks it evident that in both the male is most commonly conspicuous in the external form and this he illustrates by several examples of hybrid species in both the vegetable and animal kingdom   0  politia naturae h c d wilcke    0 intended to display that perfect order and just subordination of all the several parts of nature by which they are rendered mutually subservient to the conservation of each other and of the whole and which collectively considered our author not unaptly has named the police of nature  this physicotheological design is pursued nearly on the same plan as that of the oeconomia naturae no    by exhibiting    a general view of the fossil kingdom as constituting the surface of the globe and as disposed into land and water hills mountains valleys etc    that innumerable variety of vegetables with which the surface of the earth is clothed and adorned as adapted to the different soils climates and elevations and again as affording nutriment to animals of various kinds    in the animal kingdom a general view of their relations to each other and the proportion they bear in the scale through the several classes from the vermes up to the highest and most perfect in which are considered their specific uses in the general economy

nutrition and due proportion of each in the grand fcheme of nature and providence   0  theses medicae j c d schreber    0 in this dissertation dr schreber delivers a brief view of the linnaean doctrine relating to the anatomy and physiology of plants in which he endeavors to sustain the following theses  that all plants consist of a medullary and cortical substance in the former of which is manifested the life of the plant and through which it is perpetuated either by seeds or buds which are considered as the ultimate extension of this part the cortical part is considered as the organ of nutrition to the whole  that as in a number of certain species of plants which in artificial systems form a genus we see a similar proportion and agreement of the parts of fructification howsoever different the external form of the whole plant and as we not unfrequently see hybrid plants produced he therefore proposes it as a matter worthy of speculation whether originally all the species have not been produced in the same way by the various admixtures of the farina from this power in the medullary part of perpetuating itself and modifying the whole internal structure the author also deduces the similar qualities which are commonly found in plants of the same genus as manifested by the taste and smell   0  flora belgica c f rosenthal    0 a linnaean flora of the indigenous plants

caudatus of bontius said to exist in java and nicobar of which travelers have related strange stories the author describes this animal on the authority and testimony of koping a swede who asserts that

different as the plants of the cape are from those of europe many of the latter nevertheless thrive well in that climate the author has prefixed a list of  0 kinds which occurred in looking over this

greens and accetaria or sallads eaten crude  our author commends parsnips in preference to turnips and carrots as being less flatulent and more nutritive he condemns the use of mushrooms says the disk

coleopterous order with filiform antennae and distinguished from the other genera by the rounded thorax and gibbous inflexed head the species in common use is found all over europe more or less on the privet the ash and the elder but there are also three others endued with the same vesicating acrimony two of which are european and the other common all over the east and particularly in china where it is used in the shops and there are many reasons mentioned by our author to prove that this last the meloe cichorii syst   0 is the true cantharis of dioscorides  after a copious natural history of the insect our author gives the form of several vesicating plasters and prescribes the places and mode of application in his last chapter which is professedly medical he treats on the internal and external use of cantharides principally considering how far they are safe and useful as diuretics when administered internally under this head he introduces a case which furnishes a caution against the use of them as aphrodisiacs after premising some general observations on the action and use of blisters he concludes by enumerating all those diseases in which they are salutary and those in which they are particularly contraindicated in england where it is thought the use of blisters is better ascertained than in some other nations the intelligent physician will not expect to meet with much new matter on this subject   0  diaeta acidularis e vigelius      it is not surprising that in a country abounding with iron chalybeate waters should be frequent in fact these acidulae are so in sweden and their efficacy has been known and much extolled in that country as our author observes from the most ancient times he thinks the inhabitants of those northern climes were led to the frequent use of the acidulae by long experience of the salutary effects of them as diuretics and tonics in remedying the inconveniences arising from a long winters diet of salted meats which disposed the constitution to scorbutic cachectic and dropsical disorders the later physicians of sweden have regulated the use and confirmed the good effects of them and mr vigelius in this dissertation has in a concise elegant and perspicuous manner prescribed the regimen adapted to such as enter upon a course of these waters digested under the six wellknown heads of the nonnaturals    0 potus coffeae h

on this shrub all of whom he enumerates by name with the date of their writings from      to kalms treatise in       coffee originally the produce of arabia felix where the best is now most successfully cultivated is called by the egyptians bon and is first mentioned by the arabians about the year  00 our author says it was brought into europe about the year      and that the first public coffeehouse was set up at marseilles in      the shrub itself was introduced into the european gardens about the year    0 by means of seeds procured from arabia by governor van hoorn of batavia who also first cultivated it in america at surinam  we are next presented with the classical generical and specific character of this plant to which succeeds a copious list of synonyms and the description at large as it stands in the hortus cliffortianus the culture of the shrub the preparation of the berry the different times and modes of drinking this liquor which custom has established in the various nations and the succedanea to this berry are then discussed among the latter are mentioned pease beans beechnuts almonds maiz wheat and the seeds of the sunflower helianthus annuus vide gouan flor monsp p     of these he prefers almonds but he observes that they dispose to flatulency much more than coffee  in speaking of the qualities and virtues of coffee our author thinks it should rather be classed with medicines than considered as a nutritive article in diet he appears to be no friend to its frequent and indiscriminate use he thinks it destroys rather than creates appetite that it occasions watchfulness and promotes flatulence and indigestion instead of relieving them as is generally believed that it debilitates the nerves and occasions tremblings on this occasion he thinks it worth enquiry whether it may not contribute to those sudden deaths which are frequent at stockholm about the winter solstice as they have been observed to happen to such as were inordinate drinkers of this liquor that it is antiaphrodisiac he says is generally allowed and he illustrates and confirms this quality by a pleasant tale from oleariuss travels that it weakens the sight is noxious to melancholic hypochondriacal and hysterical people that it promotes hemorrhages of all kinds and that a free indulgence in the use of this liquor cannot be safe except to the corpulent  considered as a medicine from its heating quality it is forbidden in fevers from its stimulating and drying quality allowed by all physicians is deduced its usefulness in corpulency and in the leucorrhaea it has been considered as an anthelminthic but its ill effects on the tender habits of children more than balance any good ones in that way in soporose affections in phlegmatic and corpulent habits our author allows its use and from its known effect in promoting hemorrhages it must be considered as an emmenagogue that headachs are frequently relieved by coffee is confirmed by daily experience and our author relates that linnaeus himself found it singularly useful in taking off a cardialgia with which he was affected at the time he was physician to the fleet in    0 and which he attributed to the effluvia of the hospital as it constantly succeeded his morning visits to the sick      inebriantia o r alander      inebriants are almost universally derived from

medicine of homer commonly called nepenthes and the spells by which medea and circe produced their enchantments he then in a most striking and lively manner introduces a fable to illustrate the effects of intoxicating liquors on the human frame and passions and after having shown when they may be safely allowed concludes with cautions and exhortations against the abuse of them      morsura

syst     gigantic serpent of the east indies and its capacity of ingorging large animals of the fascinating power of the rattle snake with which also he says the coluber berus syst     or viper is in some degree endued the author describes the mechanism of the jaw and the venomous apparatus in serpents and these are illustrated with a figure he then gives an abstract of redis experiments and discusses the theory of the operation of the virus in the explication of which he inclines to that of the mechanical theorists in attributing the effects rather to an almost instantaneous alteration induced in the fluids than to its immediate action on the nervous system the symptoms ensuing the puncture of the various species are then described those from the viper particularly and those of the

inefficacy he then comes to discuss the three noted antidotes of europe asia and america which are regarded as specifics against the venom of the most dangerous kinds in the respective quarters of the globe such are oil of olives against the viper of europe the ophiorrhiza mungos against the naja of asia vide no    of this collection and the senega against the rattle snake of america there is nevertheless a small venomous viper coluber chersea syst p     in sweden against the bite of which the oil of olives failed to produce its usual good effects and the patient died the author mentions a

secret of this kind in the west indies      termini botanici j elmgren      this paper is incapable of abridgment it is a methodical arrangement and complete explanation of all the terms amounting to     used in describing plants according to the linnaean method of botany somewhat of the same kind was begun in the hortus cliffortianus and is also prefixed to the enlarged editions of the system these terms also necessarily occur and are explained in our authors philosophia botanica in this paper the whole is amplified improved and methodised in so excellent a manner that no one who would gain precise ideas on the subject would wish to be without it      planta alstromeria j p falk      this plant is of american origin and belongs to the hexandrous class and monogynous order of the system there are three species the two first of which were described and figured by pere feuillee in peru who ranked them with the hemerocallis or day lily linnaeus received the seeds of this singular and beautiful plant from cadiz by means of c alstromer son of a gentleman of that name counselor of the college of commerce in sweden and finding it a new genus gave it his name the species here so completely described and figured is the alstromeria pelegrina sp pl     the virtues of this species are not ascertained but the sensible qualities of the root rank it with the sarsaparilla and it appears by feuillees account that there is a third species in chili which the natives use as a substitute for the above plant and linnaeus has hence given it the trivial name of salsilla      nectaria florum b m hall      dulci distendunt nectare cellas virgil georg iv     hence linnaeus gave the term nectarium to a particular gland or repository which in most plants contains the honey this part in flowers had been but little noticed before linnaeus raised it to importance and in his system it affords an excellent mark of distinction in diverse genera and species  our author premises some short observations relating to the glands of plants in various classes which are mostly situated on the leaves or petioles he then proceeds to the direct design of his tract which is to point out the several kinds of nectaria in flowers and to specify the different situation of this part in different classes orders or genera it is therefore an instructive paper to those who would attain a more complete idea of this singular and heretofore neglected part the use of which however is as yet imperfectly ascertained      fundamentum fructificationis j m graberg      having briefly stated the improvement of botany and defined it as a science m graberg proceeds to the explanation of his term under the word fructification he includes not merely the corolla pericarpium and semina simply considered as tournefort had done but also the calyx nectarium stamina and pistilla all these parts therefore constitute the organs of fructification and on which the foundation of all true system must be laid he then briefly traces the rise of system from gesner through the improvements of caesalpinus columna morison and tournefort down to linnaeus who by defining as above the parts of fructification first laid the basis of true generical distinctions he then inlarges on specifical distinctions and shows what constitutes varieties in plants he proceeds to consider the generation of hybrid plants concerning which he favors the opinion laid down in the generatio ambigena no  0  of this collection that the internal structure or parts of fructification in hybrid plants resemble the impregnated plant and the habit or external parts that which furnished the farina foecundans a singular instance of this kind is brought from the verbascum genus finally he proposes a question whether all the species may not have sprung from one original in each genus by hybrid impregnations he thinks the contemplation of the numerous species under many african and american genera adds weight to his hypothesis  on the whole this paper abounds with curious matter for speculation on this subject and is highly worthy the regard of those who would enter more minutely into the knowledge of botany      reformatio botanices j m reftelius      we are here presented with a very entertaining history of the rise progress and present improved state of botany to this end it is divided into three epochs   under the founders of the science after the restoration of letters   under the systematics and   under the auspices of the great swedish botanist    among the restorers of botany brunsfelsius tragus gesner fuchsius and cordus stand foremost in the list they may be said to close with caspar bauhine who by his incomparable pinax in which he collected all their synonyms into one work gave use to their writings and improvement to the study which otherwise it could not have acquired    bauhine having laid this foundation the knowledge of plants made a rapid progress in the seventeenth century and received vast addition from the discoveries of cornutus marcgrave and piso in america from those of herman rheede and commelin in asia from sloane plukenet petiver and sherard from tournefort and plumier during which period also it was reduced to system from the hints of gesner first by caesalpinus and afterward more successfully by morison ray and tournefort    this author dates the epoch of reformation from the first publication by linnaeus in      and then collects together into one view the improvement it has received from the labors of this great man he enumerates the several disciples of linnaeus who assisted him by their travels into foreign parts adds a list of those writers that have followed his method and closes with a sketch of what is yet wanting to give further perfection to the science      prolepsis plantarum h ulmark    0 the theory of vegetation built by malpighi and grew on the anatomy of plants and that of hales and others drawn from what may be called their physiology has not been followed in the linnaean school linnaeus early conceived the idea of an analogy between plants and animals and speaks of vegetables also as consisting of a medullary and cortical substance in the former of which the proper life and principle of vegetation resides and by which alone it is propagated considering the latter as the organs of nourishment to the former this idea seems also to have led him to adopt the opinion of caesalpinus relating to the evolution of these two parts in the order which is mentioned in the   th thesis namely that the cortex or outer bark is ultimately spent in forming the perianthium or cup of the flower besides which it must be observed that the leaves are produced from the cortical substance only the liber or inner bark in the corolla or petals the lignum or woody part in the stamina or chives and the medulla or pithy part in the pistillum and seed  principally to confirm and illustrate these data is the design of this thesis which in fact is a comment on a part of the   th section of the introduction to the second tome of the system p   containing a concise view of this doctrine before the author proceeds to his immediate subject he recapitulates with the forementioned some other principles relating to the life and organization of vegetables and then endeavors to prove by appearances observable in plants that this arrangement of parts and this evolution actually exists as this cannot be so aptly illustrated in annual and other plants on account of the tender texture and quick growth the author endeavors to exemplify it from observations made on the budbearing trees in which he observes that the full evolution of the parts from the origin of the bud to the expansion of the flower as the final act of vegetation in each is a progressive work the accomplishment of which requires five or six years and that it takes place in the following order that the leaves which are unconnected with the medullary substance and derive their origin from the cortical are the produce of the first year and in plants and trees that are furnished with bracte or floral leaves that such are the issue of the second year and the perianthium or cup of the flower of the third the petals of the fourth the stamina of the fifth and the pistil etc of the sixth our author endeavors to sustain this theory by a number of facts and observations tending to corroborate the doctrine advanced in this dissertation      fructus esculenti j salberg      the design of the plantae esculentae no    acetaria no    and the macellum olitorium no  0  is in this paper pursued and extended to the esculent fruits which are here enumerated to the number of     and their nature and uses briefly pointed out to which end they are disposed into six classes as follow   berries   plumbs   pomaceous fruits   podded fruits   grain   nuts     0 prolepsis plantarum j j ferber      mr ferber who is probably the same person that has published physicogeographical travels into italy endeavors in this paper as mr ulmark has done to illustrate and confirm the theory of vegetation received in the upsal school  he first treats on the food of plants which without entering into any subtle disquisitions relating to its elementary principles and composition is defined to be the watery tincture of the soil received by the roots and transmitted to the medullary by the vascular part of the cortical substance he establishes it as a fact that too great an afflux of nutriment thrown into the cortical part retards the fructification by compressing the medullary he thinks this is proved by the state of luxuriant plants in general and by the effects of depriving them of this superfluity on which head he quotes the experiments of mr fitzgerald recorded in the philos transact vol lii p    as confirming the truth of the theory here advanced  after having established the cortical part as the organ and deposit of nutriment he proceeds to show that heat alone excites to action and vigor the life or protrusive and expansive force of the medullary part which is ever spent in propagating the plant by forming buds bulbs or seed as its final and most perfect issue and that this intention of nature succeeds in a proportion equal to the degree of nutriment afforded by the cortical to that of the heat administered to the medullary part respectively  in the second chapter m ferber treats on the origin and evolution of buds in which he accedes to the doctrine of the progressive perfection of them mentioned in the dissertation just reviewed  the last chapter is appropriated to the involution of plants in the seed buds and bulbs in which he asserts that in the seeds of the nymphaea nelumbo the very leaves of the future plant are visible in bulbs the rudiment of the next years plant is also conspicuous in like manner buds contain the perfect plant although the evolution in these requires a longer process  those who would attain a complete idea of the theory of vegetation advanced in the works of our author are referred more particularly to the following papers in the amoenitates academicae no    gemmatio arborum    metamorphosis plantarum  0  generatio ambigena       0 prolepsis plantarum and to the introduction to the vegetable system  it may be observed that there is a set of experiments made by m mustel printed in the phil trans vol lxiii p     which seem to favor the theory of vegetation here advanced as far at least as relates to the cortical substance being the deposit of nutriment and the effect of warmth on the expansive and protrusive force of the medullary yet it must be allowed that too many difficulties attend every theory on this obscurc subject      centuria insectorum b johansson      insects were scarcely noticed before the time of conrad gesner whose comprehensive mind extended over the whole field of nature he together with mouffet and aldrovand may be said to have laid the foundation of entomological science to these succeeded another set of writers who were principally employed in investigating the economy and surprising metamorphoses of insects such were geodart lister swammerdam and reaumur to whom may be added madam merian who took a voyage to surinam with the sole view of gratifying a taste for this branch of natural history  nevertheless after all the researches of these ingenious persons and the labors of our excellent mr ray a defect of system rendered this subject the most difficult to study of any part of natural knowledge and it will easily be granted that the true era of this science commences with linnaeus who very early turned his attention to it and has established that method which has been since universally followed and by which the history of these minuter animals has been greatly extended  the present catalogue contains the description of an hundred rare and mostly undescribed species sent to linnaeus from carolina pensylvania surinam and java  as all these zoological descriptions are supplemental to and illustrative of the authors systema naturae they yet retain their value and cannot be superseded but by a general history of animals on the same plan      lignum quassiae c m blom      the quassia amara spec plant p     and p      or bitter ash as it is called in the west indies is a tree of the decandrous class the root of which was brought into use first at surinam by a negro named quassi who revealed its virtues the medicine was known but the species and true history was long undefined till at length a branch of the tree with the flower and fruit was sent to linnaeus from surinam the root is the part used and appears to be the most pure and intense of all bitters at surinam it has acquired a high character in curing the intermitting exacerbating and malignant fevers so endemial to that country and this as the author asserts in cases where the quinquina has failed it is given in any form but most commonly in an aqueous infusion in the proportion of one dram to a pint the dose of which is one ounce  the history of this drug is accompanied with a figure of the leaf and parts of fructification three cases of its good effects from trials made in sweden are inserted and which are not confined to fevers only  there is a confirmation of its virtues in febrile

is defined in the genera morborum of our author to be a spastic contraction of the limbs or joints attended with convulsions and excruciating periodical pains the author gives a full description of this disease from the two most capital swedish writers on the subject he had seen it himself and observes that it had frequently been epidemical in that country moreover that some physicians had thought it a new distemper he has however traced it in the writings of a numerous set of authors from the year      to      by which it appears to have been common to other parts of europe  this dreadful distemper sometimes held the sick for three or four weeks and those who perished generally sunk under a diarrhoea or died in convulsions valerian castor camphor and antispasmodics of the like kind appear to have been the most beneficial remedies  he next brings together in one view the hypotheses of the various authors relating to the cause of this malady some of whom suppose it owing to a certain constitution of the air others to vitiated grain darnel or the secale cornutum which were all rejected as unsatisfactory by dr e rosen one of the last and most intelligent writers on the subject our author says that in sweden it always commenced in autumn was frequent only among the lower order of people and consequent upon eating bread made of the new corn hence he sought for its origin in impure admixtures with the grain and finally his own hypothesis attributes it to the seeds of the raphanus raphanistrum sp plant p     or charlock and hence the name given to the disease the dissertation closes with a figure and botanical description of the plant  the hand of a master is no where more visible than in the scientific manner observed by dr rothman in drawing up the history of this disease and it may be proposed as a model in its kind      genera morborum j schroder      of this arrangement of diseases as it stands in linnaeuss own publication made in the year      a

helping digestion increasing perspiration and promoting all the excretions in due time and proportion in procuring the most refreshing sleep and in valetudinary habits particularly subduing that fruitful source of disease acidities in the first passages  he then enumerates those diseases in which exercise is to be considered in a medicinal view in hypochondriac cases habitual debility languid appetite obstructions of the viscera consumptions asthma and in various diseases from laxity its use has been indispensable  in speaking of the hemicrania he relates that linnaeus himself had been subject to violent paroxysms of that kind which usually held him    hours with intervals rarely of little more than a week and that these fits were excited by very slight causes even such as the drinking only a spoonful of wine and that after trying ineffectually various remedies the professor attributed the restoration of his health to the use of daily morning exercise after drinking a large draught of pure water a case is also related of one who from his infancy to his   th year had never been free from ascarides but he entirely got rid of them by taking a journey on horseback as far as

this the author points out those diseases in which the mode of bloodletting by means of leeches has been preferred to others previous to this however he quotes zacutus lusitanus for a case where the leech during its application made its way into the rectum and takes occasion to recommend in any similar instance the immediate injection of salt water and thinks it would be equally efficacious in

prosper alpinus says he saw the plant growing in a cultivated state in gardens near cairo but it is now doubtful whether that he saw was the true species though of the same genus we owe the full discovery of the shrub which yields it to dr forskal one of those unfortunate gentlemen who were sent to arabia felix on the expedition planned by professor michaelis which did so much honor to the late frederick v of denmark he saw it growing plentifully in that country particularly about medina and transmitted a branch to linnaeus in      it is now known to be a plant of the monogynous order

subject to dangerous and sometimes lingering diseases which frequently shorten the period of their lives miners hewers of freestone workers of metals painters and various others are notorious instances of this truth but as our author observes they are not the only sufferers in this way inasmuch as a too close application to any business or profession will ever be attended with insalutary effects in this concise view of the diseases of tradesmen the author professes to have made all possible use of ramazzinis work on the subject but he has extended that authors catalogue and availed himself of subsequent observations from various authors and interspersed several of his own in brief by confining his view through the several employments of mankind to the immediate operation of causes and their effects he has rendered this tract at the same time agreeable instructive and interesting      lepra j uddman      the distemper here described has been long endemial in norway and in several parts of sweden particularly on the eastern coast of the bothnian gulf and in finland also in the islands of oeland and gothland so long since as the year      a pesthouse was erected in the parish of croneby for the reception of the sick of that neighborhood our author defines the lepra from linnaeuss genera morborum as a distemper showing itself in pustules throwing off dry scales or scurf attended with moveable discolored nodes in the flesh and rhagades or dry fissures on the skin no     whether the distemper he undertakes to give the history of be the same with the lepra arabum or alexandrina the javanensis and the americana of all which he has given the characters he does not absolutely determine as he inclines to think it a disease various in its appearance being a native of bothnia he had frequent opportunities of inspecting it and describes it under the following appearances in that country  it showed itself in tubercles or nodes fixed in the fleshy parts in the forehead cheeks arms hands and thighs these were indolent moveable with the finger and of a livid hue there were also tubercles of a livid or sometimes brownishyellow cast in the mouth palate fauces and about the root of the tongue ulcers in the nostrils tumors or thickenings of the edges of the outer ears thick lips feet and hands enlarged and inflamed and in some ulcers or rather fissures on the skin creeping broad and deep with callous edges bleeding from slight pressure or handling but destitute of pain as were all the nodes and tubercles as far as the author ever observed but he says they were inclined to itch round their bases  we cannot pursue our author through his enquiries into all the hypotheses relating to the cause of this disorder howsoever ingenious it must suffice to observe that he favors the theory of exanthematic animalcula and from the frequency of this disorder on the seacoast where the inhabitants live much upon fish and particularly herrings which abound with the gordius marinus syst  0   or sea hairworm adduces a train of arguments to show that this distemper probably originates from these worms  in the cure he descants upon the viperbroth of the ancients and remarks that the famed viper of the east is a different serpent from ours he next treats on the inefficacy of mercurials as vermifuges and quotes dr scopoli as observing that no people are more troubled with worms than those that work in the quicksilvermines of carniola at length against this obstinate and formidable malady dr uddman informs us that dr russels method of cure which consists in giving large quantities of seawater assisted by the other part of the process to which were joined frictions with warm and acrid oils had been attended with more success than any other      fundamenta ornithologica a p backman      to all lovers of ornithology this must have been an acceptable morsel as containing the rudiments of the science according to the linnaean method and a full explanation of the terms therein employed it is divided into four parts in the first the author gives a brief history of ornithologists amongst whom he places belon and gesner as the first authors worth attention descending to aldrovandus marcgrave willoughby and ray before any thing like system was introduced to these succeed rudbeck whose collection of paintings yet unpublished are in the hands of m de geer albin catesby and edwards the last of whom from his unwearied diligence and the opportunities that his situation at london afforded him had excelled all others to these must be added m brissons publication of reaumurs collection as also klein brunniche and barrere  in the second part the anatomical structure and external form of this order of animals are described first the form in general then the particular parts explaining under each the terms used in describing them and in forming the generical and specific characters this part is illustrated with a plate which has been copied into several succeeding works on this subject  the third treats on the history of birds respecting their habitations migrations incubation and the whole of their natural economy to which is subjoined the method of constructing scientific descriptions and generical characters  the fourth exhibits a general view of the use of birds in the police of nature in diet and their utility to man and here we cannot but note the chavaria of jacquin a species of the parra syst p   0 which is trained by the indians in the neighborhood of carthagena who breed large flocks of poultry that stray in the woods to defend them against the numerous birds of prey no one of which will dare to encounter this bird it is never known to desert the flock and returns every evening to roost our author touches on the prognostics of birds in presaging weather so well understood by seamen and finally as beautiful and pleasurable objects to man      fundamenta entomologiae a j bladh      the knowledge of insects may be said to be the last branch of natural history that raised its head notwithstanding which it has of late attained a high degree of perfection nor can it be too much to attribute this to the excellent arrangement of linnaeus under whose auspices it has extended itself beyond all other parts of zoology  the plan of this paper is exactly that of the foregoing and will amply satisfy those who wish to enter on the study of insects in his first chapter mr bladh gives a chronological list of    writers on the subject beginning with mouffet who published in      and ending with schaeffer in      but the substance of this dissertation has been translated and published in english by mr curtis so that any further account of this work is now superseded      fundamenta agrostographiae h gahn      m gahn professes to have undertaken this tract partly with a view to aid the good designs of those societies which to the honor of their founders have been established in several parts of europe for the advancement of agriculture with which the subject of this paper is intimately connected  in this large natural class of plants called gramina are comprehended also the cerealia or grain and including all that are hitherto known do not amount in the system of our author to fewer than   0 species in that of others to many more such a number of plants so nearly alike in their habit as these must require numerous subdivisions and nice distinctions to discriminate each species to effect this is the intention of this tract in which after some curious preliminary observations relating to the station and uses that nature seems to have assigned to some particular species and a list of the common grasses classed according to their native places the author presents us with an historical account of the principal writers who have treated separately on this class exhibiting under each a brief view of their systems of classification these are c bauhine rudbeck ray and above all scheuchzer who with incredible labor has described all the species to these might be added several other writers who have also illustrated this branch of botany particularly morison and haller then follows the description of the natural character and habit of a plant of this class intended to convey a full explanation of the terms referring to two explanatory plates on which is engraven a flower of each genus  various have been the methods invented to class this tribe our author here gives them a new disposition entirely independent on the sexual system established on the figure and number of the valves composing the glume or calix and those of the flower classed under two general heads as they grow either in the form of spikes or panicles  in all natural classes the distinctions of the genera depend on minute differences which require very nice discriminations the author therefore proceeds to point these out in several instances of this tribe he has also added the exceptions that arise under the several genera in various species an imperfection that attends all systems he concludes with a full explanation of his tables which are better adapted to convey to a learner a true idea of this class than any that we are yet acquainted with since schrebers tables are not adapted to common use in england      varietas ciborum a f wedenberg      the immense variety in food which custom necessity and luxury have introduced is here in a concise way displayed the simplicity of some nations whether arising from penury or from climate the apician luxury of others and the various effects of the culinary art are also briefly pointed out then follows a division of aliments into classes thus   watery   dry   pinguious   styptic   acid   bitter   viscous   salt   sweet  0 acrid under each are subjoined summary observations relating to the effects of a regimen in which any of these classes form the prevailing part and to its tendency in producing particular diseases the author then speaks on the great power of custom on the habit and concludes with inculcating the ne quid nimis an axiom of much higher importance than any of those nice discriminations relating to the wholesome and unwholesome which so often perplex the minds and disturb the peace of many wellmeaning people      fervidorum et gelidorum usus c ribe      dr ribe fixes the heat of the human body between    and    of the celsian thermometer and pronounces all foods and drinks which arise to  0 to be fervid he considers the constant and daily use of hot aliments as an abuse that calls for the strictest animadversion and shows by the effects of them on the solids of the human body their tendency to produce a variety of chronical diseases which he here specifies man is the only animal accustomed to hot foods and is almost alone affected with carious teeth hence he takes occasion to condemn in a forcible manner the custom of drinking hot tea coffee and chocolate and dissuade his countrymen from the practice of eating hot bread boiled rice puddings and other like foods to which perhaps from the severity of the climate the swedes are more addicted than some other nations he does not however conclude this part without pointing out those cases where tepid and even fervid liquors are both allowable and beneficial such are some fevers several of the spasmodic diseases and those resulting from rigidity of the fibers  in the second part the author reprobates the use of iced creams jellies and drinks and dissuades especially from a sort of food unknown among us though frequent in sweden this is congealed oysters the pernicious quality of these he endeavors to prove by several cases he is also not less decisive in condemning a kind of iced maltliquor drunk in sweden in the summer months observations on the diseases occasioned by the abuses of all these and a recital of the advantages of simply cool liquors conclude this dissertation      potus theae p c tillaeus      at the time of its publication this treatise had perhaps the merit of being the most complete history of this shrub occasioned by the lucky incident of its arriving safe in a vegetating state in sweden through the care and skill of capt ekeberg who is said to be the first that succeeded in the several attempts that had been made to introduce it into europe linnaeus had suggested the putting the seeds into earth just as the ship left china and the success confirmed the propriety of his method  tea is now known to be the leaves of a plant of the monogynous order belonging to the polyandrous class the flower of which is succeeded by a tricoccous capsule the writer describes the shrub at large gives all the synonyms and mentions those authors who have given figures of it among these kaempfers is the only exact one it was long believed that there was but one species but the green tea is now said to be the produce of another which differs from the bohea in having nine petals in the flower whereas the bohea has but six it is not known to grow spontaneously elsewhere than in japan and china in which latter kingdom it is cultivated in all the provinces from canton to pekin  mr tilley delivers the mode of preparing the leaves of which we have a diffuse and most exact account by kaempfer who having resided two years in japan was enabled to give the most complete information the origin of the use of tea in those countries is too remote to be ascertained and commerce has now extended its use to almost every corner of the globe the high price of tea at its first introduction induced many physicians to think of a substitute and it is well known that simon pauli thought the myrica gale sp pl p      to be the shrub itself other succedanea are mentioned also by our author such as the leaves of the prunus spinosa sp pl     sloe tree origanum vulgar sp pl     wild marjorum rubus arcticus sp pl  0  arctic bramble veronica officinalis sp pl    male speedwell veronica chamaedrys sp pl    wild germander chenopodium ambrosioides sp pl   0 mexican sweet blite capraria biflora sp pl     sweetweed or goatweed   to this part of our authors treatise may be added the wellknown sophistication of tea practiced by the smugglers in some of the southern parts of this kingdom who have reduced to a regular process the management of the leaves of the ash and elder particularly which when prepared is called smouch and mixed as is said in the proportion of one third with the ordinary teas to what an extent the trade in this sophisticated tea had been carried to the detriment of the trees may be imagined when the reader is informed that an act of parliament has lately been obtained to prohibit it under very severe penalties but to return to our author  he next considers the sensible qualities of tea its fragrant odor and styptic taste and from its place in the system botanically considered with respect to the natural orders he thinks it highly probable that what kaempfer relates of its narcotic quality when green is consonant to truth and from similar instances he proves that this quality may readily be thrown off by that degree of heat which the sudden exsiccation of the leaves require  in discussing the virtues of tea he observes that the chinese recommend the use of it in all lethargic diseases but condemn it in ophthalmies colics and palsies from kalm he tells us the indians of north america knew not the inconveniences of carious teeth debilitated stomachs nor the women difficult labors until the introduction of tea among them that the physicians at hamburgh amsterdam etc attribute the frequency of the leucorrhaea among the women of condition to their indulgence in this liquor and further that boerhaave ascribed to the sipping hot tea a schirrosity in the glands of the oesophagus which he met with on dissection and which he thought a disease not known to the ancients  the author subjoins some observations on the important and extensive influence of tea in a mercantile view and as an article of luxury and concludes with the history of the introduction of the living plant into europe as above mentioned hinting also at the possibility of naturalizing it in other countries a plate of the bohea tea shrub is annexed      potus chocolatae a hoffman      we are now come to the last and what our author thinks the most salubrious of the three elegant articles of luxury that the moderns have acquired by the discovery of the east and west indies chocolate is the produce of an american intertropical tree flowering twice in a year and singular in producing its fruit from the body or trunk and not from the branches it belongs to the pentandrous order of the polyadelphous class and is distinguished by the name of theobroma cacao foliis integerrimis sp pl   00  we are presented with three methods of preparing chocolate as practiced by the indians by the spaniards and by others as follow the indians to one pound of the roasted nuts put half a pound of sugar dissolved in rose water and half a pound of flour of mays or indian corn the spaniards to six pounds of the nut add three and an half of sugar seven pods of vanillas one pound and an half of flour of indian corn half a pound of cinnamon six cloves one dram of capsicum and whatsoever is thought requisite of the roucounut to improve the color together with ambergrease or musk to impart an agreeable scent in the other and more common way to seventeen pounds of nuts are added ten pounds of sugar twentyeight pods of vanillas one dram of ambergrease and six ounces of cinnamon  the vanillas are the pods silled with minute seeds from a parasitical climbing plant described under the name of epidendrum vanilla sp pl      belonging to the gynandrous class with the orchides and like them reputed an aphrodisiac spices are added to give pungency and mitigate the oleaginous quality of the nut  having detailed the history of the nut the author considers chocolate as an aliment and in a medicinal view he recommends it in emaciating diseases both as aliment and medicine and next very strenuously in hypochondriacal cases and in confirmation adduces that of cardinal richelieu who he says was restored to health by living on chocolate he is not less copious on its good effects against the hemorrhoids in aid of which he relates a singular case communicated to him by the president himself      spiritus frumenti p bergius      the arabians have the credit of inventing the alembic and the distillation of ardent spirits which they are said to have used principally if not at first entirely as solvents only to extract the virtues of simples and exhibit them in the form of tinctures our author observes from raymond lilly that they were unknown in europe at the commencement of the   th century but the distillation of spirit from fermented grain is attributed to arnoldus de villa nova about the year      soon after this time brandy was made in sicily first from spoiled grapes and very early became an article of great commerce at venice  having enumerated the properties of this inflammable fluid from boerhaaves chemistry and described a method of preparing the grain for distillation as practiced in sweden which is different from ours the author discusses the salutary effects of spirits medicinally taken as analeptic diuretic cordial and stomachic under all which heads he lays down apposite rules for their use diluted with coffee he recommends brandy as a diuretic in calculous cases he much prefers it to wine as a preservative against contagious dysenteries and asserts that this was clearly proved among the seamen of the swedish fleet in the expedition of      he then considers the imprudent use of it and from its power in coagulating the fluids and indurating the solids deduces its effects in producing inflammatory fevers consumptions dropsy jaundice hemorrhoids tremors phrensy etc and concludes with some welldigested observations on the general abuse of fermented liquors and upon their influence on society both in a political and moral view    0 menthae usus c g laurin      mint is one of those vegetables which have retained their character in medicine from the earliest ages it having been used by the greeks and romans england above all other countries abounds with plants of this genus of which there are not less than eleven species mentioned by the english botanists as indigenous the pulegium which is a true species of mint being included  in the natural orders of botany mint is among the verticillated plants which are in general supposed to have resolvent and nervine qualities and from these powers arise the good effects usually ascribed to this plant in a variety of disorders here particularly specified      purgantia indigena p strandman      after some preliminary observations relating to the opinions of the empirical and dogmatic sects in medicine as connected with his subject and some encomiums on the institution of hospitals as affording a field of observation and experiment to the physician which private practice does not allow the writer presents us with a catalogue of such vegetables as are endued with a purgative quality confining his tract to such as are either indigenous or easily cultivated in the gardens of sweden under each he mentions the place

observed the distinction that he has made between the cortical and medullary or in other words the vascular and nervous systems of the human body the present dissertation is a comment on the first part of the clavis relating to the diseases of the vascular system dr bergman traces the immediate effects both upon the solids and fluids of any excess or defect in the air nourishment motion and rest sleep and watching excretions and retentions the passions as being more immediately connected with the medullary or nervous system do not belong to his scheme having discussed the ill consequences of these errors to the constitution and remarked the diseases originating from thence he turns to the consideration of the old canon that diseases are cured by their contraries and agreeably to the theory of his master that such as spring from these errors are principally the objects of dietetic medicine and are to be cured by sapids he produces the several classes of aquosa sicca acida amara pinguia styptica dulcia acria mucosa salsa and shows their power in preventing and curing diseases concluding his tract with the distinction between the rational and empirical physician  in mentioning the scurvy and the effects of salted meat he relates a memorable instance of an arthritic patient who after taking in one summer   00 boles of mrs stephenss medicine became in the highest degree afflicted with the genuine scurvy which he thinks might fairly be attributed to the quantity of alkaline salt contained in that medicine      usus muscorum a h berlin      the uses of this class of vegetables in wellcultivated countries and in benign climates can be but little known in the northern regions they are conspicuous the writer after having mentioned those botanists who have particularly attended to this class and given due praise to the matchless work of dillenius on the subject displays the particular advantages of mosses in the general economy of nature for instance the terrestrial liverworts lay the first foundation of soil on barren rocks as the sphagnum and many other bog mosses do in marshy and boggy places in human economy nothing is more remarkable than the utility of the reindeer moss in the arctic regions many of the liverworts are ingredients in dyeing and several mosses have their place in medicine among which particularly may be mentioned the lichen islandicus sp pl      iceland or eryngoleaved liverwort of the virtues of which in consumptions dr scopoli has written a distinct treatise published in the annus   dus historiconaturalis lips       the reader will find a paper written by the author of this volume on the uses of this order of plants in the philosophical transactions for the year      vol l p               mundus invisibilis j c roos      the subjects of this thesis have been much agitated of late years by the philosophical literati who have been skilled in the use of microscopes it turns principally on the discoveries of the baron munkhausen relating to the smut of wheat and barley and to the dust of the lycoperda or puffballs agarics and other fungi which he has asserted to be no other than the ova of animalcula from whence had arisen a doubt whether mushrooms should be ranked with vegetables or animals linnaeus adopted though with great hesitation the barons opinion as appears from his systema not p      but his sentiments on this subject after the experiments made by our late mr ellis who at his request instituted a course professedly to determine this point do not appear the result of mr elliss enquiry proved the negative as may be seen by his papers published in the phil trans vol lix p     and gent magazine for      p     much curious matter on this subject occurs in mr rooss paper but we conclude with an important fact related from the barons book who recommends the seed wheat to be washed in a lie made of lime and sea salt by which practice for twenty years he had secured his crop from smut although his neighbors around him had sometimes lost a third part of theirs in the latter part of the thesis the author descants on exanthematic animalcula and appears to favor that hypothesis heartily confessing however the difficulties that occur and concluding with a string of doubts proposed by way of queries relating to this abstruse point      usus historiae naturalis m aphonin      this ingenious discourse written by a young russian nobleman a student at upsal is one of the most entertaining and bestdigested papers on the subject that this collection affords and cannot fail to carry conviction with it it is divided into two parts in the first he displays the necessity of a knowledge of natural history at large in leading the way to improvements in all branches of agriculture and in gardening the utility especially of being acquainted with the indigenous plants of the country an object greatly neglected and which if more attended to must lead as he endeavors to show to the improvement of woods hedges the culture of barren ground wet meadows to the extirpation of hurtful plants and the better adapting pastures to the several kinds of cattle to illustrate this latter position he mentions a memorable fact related by linnaeus in the iter scanicum of a number of goats which were perishing in an island that abounded with the reed bent grass agrostis arundinacea a plant on which horses feed with avidity and thrive greatly thus also on the other hand goats will riot and fatten on the meadow sweet filipendula ulmaria whilst horses and horned cattle especially when they are young will not touch it  the second part abounds with curious observations concerning the economy of domesticated animals in treating on which he points out both the most nutritive and noxious herbs to each species descending afterward to domestic fowls and the inferior parts of the animal creation which are more particularly the objects of husbandmen a plate is added on which is engraven together with a rare species of henbane the actaea cimicifuga sp pl     famous in russia and tartary beyond all other things for expelling bugs and some other noxious insects      necessitas historiae naturalis rossiae a de karamyschew      this paper is also written by a russian nobleman and is intended to excite his countrymen to a diligent cultivation of the study of natural history as a science eminently beneficial to a rising people to this purpose he endeavors to raise their emulation by showing the progress it has made in the eastern nations of europe displaying its beneficial influences and by exhibiting the vast field which the empire of russia affords he then gives some biographical anecdotes of those who have improved the natural history of that country under the patronage and command of their sovereigns from the time of peter the first such were messerchmidius buxbaum gmelin the last of whom sojourned in siberia from      to      krascheninnikow martin steller amman and others he then recites from the museum petropolitanum a list of zoological subjects for further investigation which although natives of russia and siberia are yet very imperfectly known he endeavors to persuade his countrymen to the culture of a number of useful vegetables by presenting them with a long catalogue of exotics that have been in some sort naturalized at abo in finland under the care of professor kalm his tract concludes with a list of plants which are natives of siberia extracted from the mss of heinzellmann gerber lerche and schober all which mss were in the hands of linnaeus a figure of a specious siberian plant accompanies this tract it is the fumaria spectabilis sp pl p          rariora norwegiae h tonning      the pen of a learned ingenious and skilful naturalist is visible in this agreeable specimen of natural history the writer first traces the origin of the science among the danes whose monarchs have lately been its celebrated patrons among the principal modern writers stands gunner the late bishop of dronthem who to the highest merit in his sacred profession also added an exquisite taste for natural history and a consummate knowledge in that science as his writings fully testify neither is mr j strom forgotten who published in      a natural history of sondmore in the diocese of bergen after this literary introduction the principal intention of the writer is to exhibit lists of the more rare subjects of nature especially such as are not common in sweden agreeably to this design we have a catalogue of the peculiar plants of norway the alpine some other rare species and particularly of the fuci or sea wracks with which the coast of norway abounds also a list from the dronthem act tom ii of all the american fruits which are thrown on the norway shore every year and which have raised much speculation among the curious to account for their transmission so particularly to that part of europe the author asks the solution of this difficulty from the learned inasmuch as they are sometimes found in no inconsiderable quantity and so recent as to germinate upon being properly secured from the climate these fruits are usually the cassia fistula anacardium or cushew nuts cucurbitae lagenariae bottle gourds pods of the mimosa scandens sp pl p   0  called cocoons in the west indies pods of the piscidia erythrina called dogwood tree by sloane and coconuts  the author next pursues his catalogue through all the classes of animals using only the linnaean trivial names and referring to the fauna suecica to gunner and to strom it may be observed that the latter writer thinks that what deceived the fishermen and by their means bishop pontoppidan under the appearance of a serpent of the extraordinary length described in his history of norway was no other than a string of sturgeon which at the stated time of the year follow each other in a line in immense numbers with only their backs above water which might suggest the idea of the waving motion of a serpent  the remaining part of the tract chiefly respects the medicinal plants and the diseases of the country an account of some vegetable productions which form an article of commerce being exported in considerable quantities among which are reckoned the cloudberry rubus chamaemorus sp pl  0  and the lichen islandicus mentioned in the account of the usus muscorum no     then follows a list of medicines easily obtained or such as are in use among the country people among these the good effects of the linnaea borealis sp pl   0 in rheumatic disorders are well known and much celebrated he relates on the authority of the president himself that two men who had been confined to their bed for several months by ischiatic pains were cured in three days by a strong decoction of it its operation appears to have been of the sedative kind since the patients were thrown into a sleep which lasted sixteen or twenty hours he confirms the opinion of the lepra arising from the hair worm as mentioned in no     of this collection and has some observations relating to the colica lapponum described in m montins thesis no    the dissertation closes with the description of an african plant called by linnaeus gunnera in honor of the bishop of dronthem    0 iter in chinam a sparrman      we presume this is the same person who afterward made the voyage round the world with dr forster in capt cooks ship and has since traveled over a large tract of country in southern africa in pursuit of those gratifications which his zeal for natural history enabled him to enjoy the present voyage which was begun dec         and finished july         was made with capt ekeberg who has been mentioned as having first introduced the tea shrub into sweden this epitome of the voyage consists of little more than an enumeration of those subjects of natural history which occurred to the journalist both at land and at sea for as he makes use of the trivial names all descriptions are superseded except that in the notes some of those imperfectly known are more amply detailed  observations tending to show the utility of botanical knowledge in relation to agriculture and the feeding of cattle accompanied with a translation of linnaeuss pan suecus accommodated to the english plants with references to authors and to figures of the plants the science of botany certainly holds its most dignified station when subservient to medicine but its utility does not terminate in this alone though it has too long been considered as having no other connection this notwithstanding is but a partial nay even an injurious idea of it for nothing has more retarded its usefulness than this contracted notion it has a relation in a variety of ways to many other arts and sciences among which may be mentioned the art of painting and dying but of all others agriculture certainly claims the strictest relation some of its most important branches being greatly dependent upon it and others from an happy application of it being perhaps capable of further emolument the subsequent paper it is presumed will in some measure illustrate this truth but howsoever great the real dignity and importance of this art yet it must be allowed that it has not been cultivated sufficiently on scientific principles nor advanced in equal proportion with other branches of knowledge it is not many years since dr home observed that virgil and columella old as they are remained almost the only writers worth consulting upon this subject the writings of mr heart dr a hunter lord kaims mr young and of many others since published in our own nation we hope have superseded dr homes remark and from that laudable spirit now diffusing among us throughout great britain for the improvement of arts and sciences under the protection of our public institutions we may expect to see every branch of agriculture studied as it deserves and attended with that success which commonly results from the right application of knowledge to the purposes of human life on the continent the swedes are making large and daily progress in the improvement of this branch of economics in france mr du hamel has rendered himself conspicuous by his writings on this subject and in various parts of europe societies have been formed with a professed view to this end we cannot help mentioning with peculiar pleasure that of padua over which dr arduin presides who by the munificence of the venetian state has a garden allotted for the cultivation of such vegetables as they wish to subject to experiments in agriculture dyeing and other arts a noble institution and worthy of imitation  amidst that almost infinite variety of vegetables with which the beneficent hand of nature has replenished our earth those which go under the general name of grasses form the principal food of our cattle next to these among the natural classes of plants none are more acceptable than the diadelphous or leguminous herbs of this class is the clover so much cultivated in england the saint foin or cockshead and the lucern or medicfodder in france besides these our horses horned cattle sheep etc will all in their turn eat with equal pleasure and some with more avidity a great variety of other vegetables numerous instances occur where one species of animals will feed greedily upon those herbs which others refuse to touch and will even almost famish rather than eat some plants are highly noxious and even poisonous to certain kinds of animals while they are eaten by others without the least subsequent ill effect to instance the cicuta virosa or longleaved water hemlock the most virulent plant which grows spontaneously in england but happily is not common is fatal to cows when through scarcity of food they are obliged to eat it yet sheep and horses feed on it with impunity and goats even greedily devour it   videre licet pinguescere saepe cicuta barbigeras pecudes homini quae est acre venenum lucr facts of this kind must in some measure have been obvious to the most incurious of mankind even in the earliest ages the first race of shepherds had daily instances among their flocks of the selection and refusal of particular herbs and subsequent observations must have multiplied and confirmed them but they were still only known in the general and no experiments had been instituted to ascertain the precise species thus eaten or rejected the facts are at this time undeniable it is well known that flagflowers houndstongue henbane mullein nightshade hemlock several docks arsmart agrimony celandine several crowfoots marsh marigold horehound figwort many thistles fern and other plants are commonly neglected by our horses and horned cattle and stand untouched even in pastures where it might be expected that necessity should constrain them to eat any thing these are but a few out of many instances there are more than is commonly imagined and it was desirable in consequence of these observations that a course of experiments should be instituted to elucidate this instinct in that part especially of the brute creation which is so immediately subservient to mankind the utility of such experiments must be evident as they must necessarily lay the foundation of farther improvements in the economy of cattle the intelligent husbandman would by this means have it in his power to rid his pastures of noxious and useless plants and give room for the salubrious ones  in this view of the affair it will be seen that physicians are not the only persons who may study botany to advantage many others would find not only a fund of pleasure from this study but numberless other advantages resulting from the knowledge of the plants of their own country in the instance before us science has opened the way and surely it is not too much to say that it evidently points to greater improvements in one of the most important branches of agriculture as it relates to the economy of cattle more than this ought not to be expected from its aid it is to the intelligent grazier and the gentleman well versed in the knowledge of the indigenous plants fraught with careful observation and practiced in the economy of cattle that the rest must be owing nothing but the want of this knowledge in such gentlemen as reside in the country chiefly can deprive us of the benefit which might otherwise accrue from reducing it into practice the eradicating from pastures poisonous and useless weeds would be but one although indeed no mean one among many other advantages further than this the husbandman would be better enabled to suit his several sorts of cattle to the different pastures in his possession more to their benefit and consequently his own even in marshy grounds where it is a difficult undertaking to mend the soil the growth of many plants might be encouraged and the seeds of others sown which are highly acceptable to different kinds of cattle by degrees too we should undoubtedly be led to the cultivation of other vegetables besides clover as fodder and the foregoing observations imply that this might be done in soils and situations where that would not thrive our hay would in consequence be much improved for although cattle will eat those herbs among hay which they reject while green and growing yet it does not follow that all are in their dried state equally nutritive and wholesome the benefits in fine which would arise from a diligent and general pursuit of these hints would undoubtedly be various and extensive and many more in all probability in a course of years than can at present be thought of  agreeably to these ideas a beginning has been made under the auspices of our celebrated author whose attempt was truly laudable and worthy of himself to this end it is indeed certainly the province of the botanist to make the plants of his own country the principal objects of his attention this has been eminently the case with linnaeus and his country will continue to reap the fruit of his labors the result of these experiments may be seen in a paper called pan suecus printed in the second volume of the amoenitates academicae the substance of which so far as the experiments were made with plants common to this country will be exhibited in the subsequent pages  linnaeus conceived the first design of this institution from observations made in his dalekarlian journey which has been mentioned in the course of the preceding pages he observed that his horses left untouched among other plants meadowsweet great wild valerian lilly of the valley angelica rosebay willow herb marsh cinquefoil mountain crowfoot cranesbill globe crowfoot and various shrubs it was not till several years after that these experiments were instituted in which a number of his pupils were engaged eight or nine of whom he mentions by name and he had himself a large share in directing and conducting them more than two thousand experiments were tried upon the horned cattle goats sheep horses and hogs many were repeated ten and some twenty times with the sole view of determining what vegetables these several animals would eat or reject it is easy to see that numberless difficulties must arise in the prosecution of this scheme and that imperfection in a variety of instances must at last attend their greatest accuracy in the mean time care was taken as far as circumstances would admit that the experiments were made as unexceptionably as possible and it must be concluded that the result upon the whole is true as they have a real foundation in those unerring laws of instinct to which nature has subjected the whole brute creation the plants were all fresh gathered not bruised in collecting nor offered to the cattle when they were either almost famished or glutted with variety nor yet in the springtime when many of them greedily devour almost any vegetable they can get sometimes such as are fatal to them and which at other times they will not touch the plants were also in many examples offered to several individuals of the same species  these trials were made only with the indigenous plants of sweden which are at least three fourths the same as ours in england the plants growing spontaneously in sweden exclusive of the mosses and funguses amount to about  00 species of such a number in every country many must be very rare it is not therefore to be expected that all these could be brought to trial some although plentiful in one part of the country would be very sparingly found in another from the result it appeared that the horned cattle eat of the plants which were offered to them only     species and that they rejected     the goats of     kinds refusing     the sheep of     refusing     the horses of     species refusing     and of those which were offered to swine they eat    kinds and refused      the pa suecus it may be presumed is but in few hands at least of such whom the subject most concerns it is written in latin and put into the most compendious form imaginable by inserting only the trivial names of the plants and referring to the number in the flora suecica where the synonyms are given in this form it is almost useless to persons unacquainted with linnaeuss writings and from an english reader is entirely hid it appeared of importance enough to be thrown into an english dress to which end it was necessary to give it a form different from the original  so far as the trials were made with plants which are common to both countries the result may be seen in the following pages and they amount to no very inconsiderable number being taken nearly in the order in which they stood in the original paper so the sexual system is of course preserved yet perhaps a more apt disposition of them might have been given by arranging them according to their usual places of growth  in order to render it more generally intelligible and acceptable the english name of the plant is first given then the linnaean generical and trivial name by which it may instantly be found either in linnaeuss own works or in mr hudsons flora anglica to these follow three columns the first contains the reference to the page in dr hills british herbal which it may be presumed is in many hands and which has now superseded in a great measure the herbals of gerard and perkinson being better accommodated to the purposes of botanic intelligence and furnished also with figures the second column refers to the page in rays synopsis of british plants where the synonyms of the two bauhines and those of gerard and parkinson are quoted by this means the reader is very compendiously directed to a variety of authors on each plant for the sake of

the original by numerical characters which it will be necessary to illustrate there is a column retained for every species of animals with which the experiments were made in sweden for although goats are not so commonly kept with us as in that country yet it will at least be matter of entertainment if not of utility to see what choice of vegetables they will make  when this figure   is made use of
