tracts mathematical an philosophical  by charles hutton ll d  f r s of land and edinb memb of the society of sciences of holland and professor of mathematics in the royal military academy woolwich  london printed for g g j and j robinson paternoster row  mdcclxxxvi  to his grace charles duke of richmond lennox and aubigny etc etc etc master general of the ordnance under whose auspices the experiments in gunnery were made  these tracts are respectfully inscribed by  his graces most humble and most obedient servant the author  preface the author presumes to lay the following tracts before the public with the greater confidence as he hopes these productions of his leisure will be found to bear a due relation to the engagements of his official duty  the preference given of late even among professed philosophers to studies of a less abstract kind has too frequently diverted the pursuits of mathematicians into paths less suited to their talents from the desire of a vain and fleeting popularity instead of the more laudable ambition of making real improvements in the sciences which they had professed to cultivate the humble consciousness which the author has ever entertained of the limits of his own abilities has he hopes preserved him from this common and pernicious vanity however solicitous to extend and diversify his own acquirements he can only hope to add and that a little to the public stock of knowledge in those parts of science to which his early habits and subsequent occupations have led him peculiarly to consecreate his studies  the very honorable distinction paid to the author by the royal society for his former experiments in gunnery as well as their general indulgence to his attempts in other mathematical subjects would perhaps have given an obvious destination to these papers had he not thought their publication in a collective form better adapted from the connection of their subject to extend their utility  the first six tracts in this volume will be found to have an obvious connection in respect to their subject having all of them a tendency either to illustrate the history or improve the theory of that species of mathematical quantities called series the particular subjects of these tracts are sufficiently discussed in the introduction to each of them respectively to render any previous detail unnecessary in this place the author hopes however they will be thought to have some claim to the merit of invention and that their utility will be readily recognized by those who are conversant in these subjects  the seventh and eighth tracts are rather detached in their nature relating to subjects purely geometrical it is hoped however that the former of them being an investigation of some new and curious properties of the sphere and cone which have always been a fruitful and favorite source of exercise to geometricians will be both acceptable and useful to those who are engaged in similar speculations the latter problem concerning the geometrical division of a circle having hitherto been deemed impracticable the solution of it is here given it is presumed for the first time  the largest and in the authors opinion the most important of these tracts is the ninth or last the main purpose of which is altogether practical though founded in a very subtle and complex theory  though the late excellent mr robins first showed the importance of this theory and invented a very curious mechanical apparatus for the experiments which he made to verify it the author is persuaded that none have been hitherto made with cannon balls so completely as those here related and described and that these are the first from which the data for determining the resistance of the medium can be accurately derived it has been the authors great object next to the accuracy of the experiments and the full and precise description of them to simplify the theorems deduced from them or from the theory itself of which an example may be found in the new rule given for the velocity of the ball and it is presumed that the table of the corresponding data namely of the dimensions and elevation of the gun and the range velocity and time of slight of the ball is now so accurately framed and so perspicuous that the several cases of gunnery may be very certainly and easily referred to it and rules of practice adapted to the common purposes of the artillerist may be very readily formed upon these principles  mathematical tracts etc tract i a dissertation on the nature and value of infinite series   about five years since i discovered a very general and easy method of valuing series whose terms are alternately positive and negative which equally applies to such series whether they be converging or diverging or their terms all equal together with several other properties relating to certain series and as we shall have occasion to deliver some of those matters in the course of these tracts i shall take this opportunity of premising a few ideas and remarks on the nature and valuation of some of the classes of series which form the object of those communications this is done with a view to obviate any misconceptions that might perhaps be made concerning the idea annexed to the term value of such series in those intended tracts and the sense in which it is there always to be understood which is the more necessary as many controversies have been warmly agitated concerning these matters not only of late by some of our own countrymen but also by others among the ablest mathematicians in europe at different periods in the course of the present century and all this it seems through the want of specifying in what sense the term value or sum was to be understood in their dissertations and in this discourse i shall follow in a great measure the sentiments and manner of the late famous l euler contained in a similar memoir of his in the fifth volume of the new petersburgh commentaries adding and intermixing here and there other remarks and observations of my own    by a converging series i mean such a one whose terms continually decrease and by a diverging series that whose terms continually increase so that a series whose terms neither increase nor decrease but are all equal as they neither converge nor diverge may be called a neutral series as a  a  a  a  etc now converging series being supposed infinitely continued may have their terms decreasing to o as a limit as the series       etc or only decreasing to some finite magnitude as a limit as the series                 etc which tends continually to   as a limit so in like manner diverging series may have their terms tending to a limit that is either finite or infinitely great thus the terms             etc diverge to infinity but the diverging terms     etc only to the finite magnitude   hence then as the ultimate terms of series which do not converge to o by supposing them continued in infinitum may be either finite or infinite there will be two kinds of such series each of which will be farther divided into two species according as the terms shall either be all affected with the same sign or have alternately the signs  and  we shall therefore have altogether four species of series which do not converge to o an example of each of which may be as here follows i                   etc i          etc ii                   etc ii          etc iii                   etc iii                     etc iv                   etc iv                     etc     now concerning the sums of these species of series there have been great dissensions among mathematicians some affirming that they can be expressed by a certain sum while others deny it in the first place however it is evident that the sums of such series as come under the first of these species will be really infinitely great since by actually collecting the terms we can arrive at a sum greater than any proposed number whatever and hence there can be no doubt but that the sums of this species of series may be exhibited by expressions of this kind a 0 it is concerning the other species therefore that mathematicians have chiefly differed and the arguments which both sides allege in defense of their opinions have been endued with such force that neither party could hitherto be brought to yield to the other    as to the second species the famous leibnitz was one of the first who treated of this series                   etc and he concluded the sum of it to  relying upon the following cogent reasons and first that this series arises by resolving the fraction    a into the series    a  a   a   a   a   etc by continual division in the usual way and taking the value of a equal to unity secondly for more confirmation and for persuading such as are not accustomed to calculations he reasons in the following manner if the series terminate any where and if the number of the terms be even then its value will be  0 but if the number of terms be odd the value of the series will be    but because the series proceeds in infinitum and that the number of the terms cannot be reckoned either odd or even we may conclude that the sum is neither  0 nor    but that it must obtain a certain middle value equidifferent from both and which is therefore  and thus he adds nature adheres to the universal law of justice giving no partial preference to either side    against these arguments the adverse party make use of such objections as the following first that the fraction    a is not equal to the infinite series    a  a   a   etc unless a be a fraction less than unity for if the division be any where broken off and the quotient of the remainder be added the cause of the paralogism will be manifest for we shall then have  and that although the number n should be made infinite yet the supplemental fraction  ought not to be omitted unless it should become evanescent which happens only in those cases in which a is less than   and the terms of the series converge to 0 but that in other cases there ought always to be included this kind of supplement  and although it be affected with the dubious sign  namely  or  according as n shall be an even or an odd number yet if n be infinite it may not therefore be omitted under the pretense that an infinite number is neither odd nor even and that there is no reason why the one sign should be used rather than the other for it is absurd to suppose that there can be any integer number even although it be infinite which is neither odd nor even    but this objection is rejected by those who attribute determinate sums to diverging series because it considers an infinite number as a determinate number and therefore either odd or even when it is really indeterminate for that it is contrary to the very idea of a series said to proceed in infinitum to conceive any term of it as the last although infinite and that therefore the objection abovementioned of the supplement to be added or subtracted naturally falls of itself therefore since an infinite series never terminates we never can arrive at the place where that supplement must be joined and therefore that the supplement not only may but indeed ought to be neglected because there is no place found for it  and these arguments adduced either for or against the sums of such series as above hold also in the fourth species which is not otherwise embarrassed with any further doubts peculiar to itself    but those who dispute against the sums of such series think they have the firmest hold in the third species for although the terms of these series continually increase and that by actually collecting the terms we can arrive at a sum greater than any assignable number which is the very definition of infinity yet the patrons of the sums are forced to admit in this species series whose sums are not only finite but even negative or less than nothing for since the fraction    a by evolving it by division becomes    a  a   a   a   etc we should have                          etc                         etc which their adversaries not undeservedly hold to be absurd since by the addition of affirmative numbers we can never obtain a negative sum and hence they urge that there is the greater necessity for including the beforementioned supplement additive since by taking it in it is evident that                 n   n    although n should be an infinite number    the defenders therefore of the sums of such series in order to reconcile this striking paradox more subtle perhaps than true make a distinction between negative quantities for they argue that while some are less than nothing there are others greater than infinite or above infinity namely that the one value of   ought to be understood when it is conceived to arise from the subtraction of a greater number a    from a less a but the other value when it is found equal to the series             etc and arising from the division of the number   by   for that in the former case it is less than nothing but in the latter greater than infinite for the more confirmation they bring this example of fractions     0          etc which evidently increasing in the leading terms it is inferred will continually increase and hence they conclude that    is greater than  0 and    greater than    and so on and therefore as    is expressed by   and  0 by or infinity   will be greater than and much more will  be greater than and thus they ingeniously enough repelled that apparent absurdity by itself    but although this distinction seemed to be ingeniously devised it gave but little satisfaction to the adversaries and besides it seemed to affect the truth of the rules of algebra for if the two values of   namely      and    be really different from each other as we may not confound them the certainty and the use of the rules which we follow in making calculations would be quite done away which would be a greater absurdity than that for whose sake the distinction was devised but if          as the rules of algebra require for by multiplication  the matter in debate is not settled since the quantity   to which the series             etc is made equal is less than nothing and therefore the same difficulty still remains in the mean time however it seems but agreeable to truth to say that the same quantities which are below nothing may be taken as above infinite for we know not only from algebra but from geometry also that there are two ways by which quantities pass from positive to negative the one through the cipher or nothing and the other through infinity and besides that quantities either by increasing or decreasing from the cipher return again and revert to the same term o so that quantities more than infinite are the same with quantities less than nothing like as quantities less than infinite agree with quantities greater than nothing   0 but farther those who deny the truth of the sums that have been assigned to diverging series not only omit to assign other values for the sums but even set themselves utterly to oppose all sums belonging to such series as things merely imaginary for a converging series as suppose this       etc will admit of a sum    because the more terms of this series we actually add the nearer we come to the number   but in diverging series the case is quite different for the more terms we add the more do the sums which are produced differ from one another neither do they ever tend to any certain determinate value hence they conclude that no idea of a sum can be applied to diverging series and that the labor of those persons who employ themselves in investigating the sums of such series is manifestly useless and indeed contrary to the very principles of analysis     but notwithstanding this seemingly real difference yet neither party could ever convict the other of any error whenever the use of series of this kind has occurred in analysis and for this good reason that neither party is in an error but that the whole difference consists in words only for if in any calculation i arrive at this series             etc and that i substitute instead of it i shall surely not thereby commit any error which however i should certainly incur if i substitute any other number instead of that series and hence there remains no doubt but that the series             etc and the fraction are equivalent quantities and that the one may always be substituted instead of the other without error so that the whole matter in dispute seems to be reduced to this only namely whether the fraction can be properly called the sum of the series             etc now if any persons should obstinately deny this since they will not however venture to deny the fraction to be equivalent to the series it is greatly to be feared they will fall into mere quarrelling about words     but perhaps the whole dispute will easily be compromised by carefully attending to what follows whenever in analysis we arrive at a complex function or expression either fractional or transcendental it is usual to convert it into a convenient series to which the remaining calculus may be more easily applied and hence the occasion and rise of infinite series so far only then do infinite series take place in analytics as they arise from the evolution of some finite expression and therefore instead of an infinite series in any calculus we may substitute that formula from whose evolution it arose and hence for performing calculations with more ease or more benefit like as rules are usually given for converting into infinite series such finite expressions as are endued with less proper forms so on the other hand those rules are to be esteemed not less useful by the help of which we may investigate the finite expression from which a proposed infinite series would result if that finite expression should be evolved by the proper rules and since this expression may always without error be substituted instead of the infinite series they must necessarily be of the same value and hence no infinite series can be proposed but a finite expression may at the same time be conceived as equivalent to it     if therefore we only so far change the received notion of a sum as to say that the sum of any series is the finite expression by the evolution of which that series may be produced all the difficulties which have been agitated on both sides vanish of themselves for first that expression by whose evolution a converging series is produced exhibits at the same time its sum in the common acceptance of the term neither if the series should be divergent could the investigation be deemed at all more absurd or less proper namely the searching out a finite expression which being evolved according to the rules of algebra shall produce that series and since that expression may be substituted in the calculation instead of this series there can be no doubt but that it is equal to it which being the case we need not necessarily deviate from the usual mode of speaking but might be permitted to call that expression also the sum which is equal to any series whatever provided however that in series whose terms do not converge to o we do not connect that notion with this idea of a sum namely that the more terms of the series are actually collected the nearer we must approach to the value of the sum     but if any person shall still think it improper to apply the term sum to the finite expressions by whose evolution all series in general are produced it will make no difference in the nature of the thing and instead of the word sum for such finite expression he may use the term value or perhaps the term radix would be as proper as any other that could be employed for this purpose as the series may justly be considered as issuing or growing out of it like as a plant springs from its root or from its seed the choice of terms being in a great measure arbitrary every person is at liberty to employ them in whatever sense he may think fit or proper for the purpose in hand provided always that he fix and determine the sense in which he understands or employs them and as i consider any series and the finite expression by whose evolution that series may be produced as no more than two different ways of expressing one and the same thing whether that finite expression be called the sum or value or radix of the series so in the following paper and in some others which may perhaps hereafter be produced it is in this sense i desire to be understood when searching out the value of series namely that the object of my enquiry is the radix by whose evolution the series may be produced or else an approximation to the value of it in decimal numbers etc  royal military acad woolwich may         tract ii a new method for the valuation of numeral infinite series whose terms are alternately  plus and  minus by taking continual arithmetical means between the successive sums and their means article   the remarkable difference between the facility which mathematicians have found in their endeavors to determine the values of infinite series whose terms are alternately affirmative and negative and the difficulty of doing the same thing with respect to those series whose terms are all affirmative is one of those striking appearances in science which we can hardly persuade ourselves is true even after we have seen many proofs of it and which serve to put us ever after on our guard not to trust to our first notions or conjectures on these subjects till we have brought them to the test of demonstration for at first sight it is very natural to imagine that those infinite series whose terms are all affirmative or added to the first term must be much simpler in their nature and much easier to be summed than those whose terms are alternately affirmative and negative which nevertheless we find upon examination to be directly contrary to the truth the methods of finding the sums of the latter series being numerous and easy and also very general whereas those that have been hitherto discovered for the summation of the former series are few and difficult and confined to series whose terms are generated from each other according to some particular laws instead of extending as the other methods do to all sorts of series whose terms are connected together by addition by whatever law their terms are formed of this remarkable difference between these two sorts of series the new method of finding the sums of those whose terms are alternately positive and negative which is the subject of the present paper will afford us a striking instance as it possesses the happy qualities of simplicity ease perspicuity and universality in a great degree and yet as the essence of it consists in the alternation of the signs  and  by which the terms are connected with the first term it is of no use in the summation of those other series whose terms are all connected with each other by the sign     this method so easy and general is in short simply this beginning at the first term a of the series a  b  c  d  e  f  etc which is to be summed compute several successive values of it by taking in successively more and more terms one term being taken in at a time so that the first value of the series shall be its first term a or even o or nothing may begin the series of sums the next value shall be its first two terms a  b reduced to one number its next value shall be the first three terms a  b  c reduced to one number its next value shall be the first four terms a  b  c  d reduced also to one number and so on this it is evident may be done by means of the easy arithmetical operation of addition and subtraction and then having found a sufficient number of successive values of the series more or less as the case may require interpose between these values a set of arithmetical mean quantities or proportionals and between these arithmetical means interpose a second set of arithmetical mean quantities and between those arithmetical means of the second set interpose a third set of arithmetical mean quantities and so on as far as you please by this process we soon find either the true value of the series proposed when it has a determinate rational value or otherwise we obtain several sets of values approximating nearer and nearer to the sum of the series both in the columns and in the lines either horizontal or obliquely descending or ascending namely both of the several sets of means themselves and the sets or series formed of any of their corresponding terms as of all their first terms of their second terms of their third terms etc or of their last terms of their penultimate terms of their antepenultimate terms etc and if between any of these latter sets consisting of the like or corresponding terms of the former sets of arithmetical means we again interpose new sets of arithmetical means as we did at first with the successive sums we shall obtain other sets of approximating terms having the same properties as the former and thus we may repeat the process as often as we please which will be found very useful in the more difficult diverging series as we shall see hereafter for this method being derived only from the circumstance of the alternation of the signs of the terms  and  it is therefore not confined to converging series alone but is equally applicable both to diverging series and to neutral series by which last name i shall take the liberty to distinguish those series whose terms are all of the same constant magnitude namely the application is equally the same for all the three following sorts of series viz converging         etc diverging                   etc neutral                   etc as is demonstrated in what follows and exemplified in a variety of instances  it must be noted however that by the value of the series i always mean such radix or finite expression as by evolution would produce the series in question according to the sense i have stated in the former paper on this subject or an approximate value of such radix and which radix as it may be substituted instead of the series in any operation i call the value of the series    it is an obvious and wellknown property of infinite series with alternate signs that when we seek their value by collecting their terms one after another we obtain a series of successive sums which approach continually nearer and nearer to the true value of the proposed series when it is a converging one or one whose terms always decrease by some regular law but in a diverging series or one whose terms as continually increase those successive sums diverge always more and more from the true value of the series and from the circumstance of the alternate change of the signs it is also a property of those successive sums that when the last term which is included in the collection is a positive one then the sum obtained is too great or exceeds the truth but when the last collected term is negative then the sum is too little or below the truth so that in both the converging and diverging series the first term alone being positive exceeds the truth the second sum or the sum of the first two terms is below the truth the third sum or the sum of three terms is above the truth the fourth sum or the sum of four terms is below the truth and so on the sum of any even number of terms being below the true value of the series and the sum of any odd number above it all which is generally known and evident from the nature and form of the series so of the series a  b  c  d  e  f  etc the first sum a is too great the second sum a  b too little the third sum a  b  c too great and so on as in the following table where s is the true value of the series and o is placed before the collected sums to complete the series being the value when no terms are included successive sums s is greater than o s is less than a s is greater than a  b s is less than a  b  c s is greater than a  b  c  d s is less than a  b  c  d  e etc etc    hence the value of every alternate series s is positive and less than the first term a the series being always supposed to begin with a positive term a and consequently if the signs of all the terms be changed or if the series begin with a negative term the value s will still be the same but negative or the sign of the sum will be changed and the value become  s   a  b  c  d  etc also because the successive sums in a converging series always approach nearer and nearer to the true value while they recede always farther and farther from it in a diverging series it follows that in a neutral series a  a  a  a  etc which holds a middle place between the two former the successive sums o a o a o a etc will neither converge nor diverge but will be always at the same distance from the value of the proposed series a  a  a  a  etc and consequently that value will always be  a which holds every where the middle place between o and a    now with respect to a converging series a  b  c  d  etc because o is below and a above s the value of the series but a nearer than o to the value s it follows that s lies between a and a and that a is less than s and so nearer to s than o is in like manner because a is above and a  b below the value s but a  b nearer to that value than a is it follows that s lies between a and a  b and that the arithmetical mean a  b is something above the value of s but nearer to that value than a is and thus the same reasoning holding in every following pair of successive sums the arithmetical means between them will form another series of terms which are like those sums alternately less and greater than the value of the proposed series but approximating nearer to that value than the several successive sums do as every term of those means is nearer to the value s than the corresponding preceding term in the sums is and like as the successive sums form a progression approaching always nearer and nearer to the value of the series so in like manner their arithmetical means form another progression coming nearer and nearer to the same value and each term of the progression of means nearer than each term of the successive sums hence then we have the two following series namely of successive sums and their arithmetical means in which each step approaches nearer to the value of s than the former the latter progression being however nearer than the former and the terms or steps of each alternately below and above the value s of the series a  b  c  d  etc successive sums arithmetical means o a a a  b a  b a  b  c a  b  c a  b  c  d a  b  c  d a  b  c  d  e a  b  c  d  e a  b  c  d  e  f etc etc where the mark placed before any step signifies that it is too little or below the value s of the converging series a  b  c  d  etc and the mark signifies the contrary or too great and hence a or half the first term of such a converging series is less than s the value of the series    and since these two progressions possess the same properties but only the terms of the latter nearer to the truth than the former for the very same reasons as before the means between the terms of these first arithmetical means will form a third progression whose terms will approach still nearer to the value of s than the second progression or the first means and the means of these second means will approach nearer than the said second means do and so on continually every succeeding order of arithmetical means approaching nearer to the value of s than the former so that the following columns of sums and means will be each nearer to the value of s than the former viz suc sums  st means  d means  d means  th means 0 a    a b    a  b c     a   b cc d   a a  b  a    b c  a    b  c d  a     b   c  d e  a b a  b  c  a  b    c d  a  b    c  d e  a  b     c   d  e f  a  b  c a  b  c  d  a  b  c    d c  a  b  c  etc a b etc a b c d a betc a betc a betc a b etc where every column consists of a set of quantities approaching still nearer and nearer to the value of s the terms of each column being alternately below and above that value and each succeeding column approaching nearer than the preceding one also every line formed of all the first terms all the second terms all the third terms etc of the columns forms also a progression whose terms continually approximate to the value of s and each line nearer or quicker than the former but differing from the columns or vertical progressions in this namely that whereas the terms in the columns are alternately below and above the value of s those in each line are all on one side of the value s namely either all below or all above it and the lines alternately too little and too great namely all the expressions in the first line too little all those in the second line too great those in the third line too little and so on every odd line being too little and every even line too great    hence the expressions 0 a    a b    a  b c     a   b  c a      a   b   c  d e   etc are continual approximations to the value s of the converging series a  b  c  d  e  etc and are all below the truth but we can easily express all these several theorems by one general formula for since it is evident by the construction that whilst the denominator in any one of them is some power  n of   or      the numeral coefficients of a b c etc the terms in the numerator are found by subtracting all the terms except the last term one after another from the said power  n or  which is     n  n  n    n  n    etc namely the coefficient of a equal to all the terms  n minus the first term   that of b equal to all except the first two terms    n that of c equal to all except the first three and so on till the coefficient of the last term be    the last term of the power it follows that the general expression for the several theorems or the general approximate value of the converging series a  b  c  d  etc will be  continued till the terms vanish and the series break off n being equal to o or any integer number or this general formula may be expressed by this series  where a b c etc denote the coefficients of the several preceding terms and this expression which is always too little is the nearer to the true value of the series a  b  c  d  etc as the number n is taken greater always excepting however those cases in which the theorem is accurately true when n is some certain finite number also with any value of n the formula is nearer to the truth as the terms a b c etc of the proposed series are nearer to equality so that the slower the proposed series converges the more accurate is the formula and the sooner does it afford a near value of that series which is a very favorable circumstance as it is in cases of very slow convergency that approximating formulae are chiefly wanted and like as the formula approaches nearer to the truth as the terms of the series approach to an equality so when the terms become quite equal as in a neutral series the formula becomes quite accurate and always gives the same value a for s or the series whatever integer number be taken for n and farther when the proposed series from being converging passes through neutrality when its terms are equal and becomes diverging the formula will still hold good only it will then be alternately too great and too little as long as the series diverges as we shall presently show more fully so that in general the value s of the series a  b  c  d  etc whether it be converging diverging or neutral is less than the first term a when the series converges the value is above a when it diverges it is below a and when neutral it is equal to a    take now the series of the first terms of the several orders of arithmetical means which form the progression of continual approximating formulae being each nearer to the value of the series a  b  c  d  etc than the former and place them in a column one under another then take the differences between every two adjacent formulae and place in another column by the side of the former as here below approx formulae differences a  a b    a b  a  b c    a  b c  a  b  c d      a   b  c d   a  b  c  d e      a   b   c  d e   etc etc from which it appears that this series of differences consists of the very same quantities which form the first terms of all the orders of differences of the terms of the proposed series a  b  c  d  etc when taken as usual in the differential method and because the first of the above differences added to the first formula gives the second formula and the second difference added to the second formula gives the third formula and so on therefore the first formula with all the differences added will give the last formula consequently our general formula  which approaches to the value of the series a  b  c  d  etc is also equivalent to or reduces to this form  which it is evident agrees with the famous differential series and this coincidence might be sufficient to establish the truth of our method though we had not given other more direct proof of it hence it appears then that our theorem is of the same degree of accuracy or convergency as the differential theorem but admits of more direct and easy application as the terms themselves are used without the previous trouble of taking the several orders of differences and our method will be rendered general for literal as well as numeral series by supposing a b c etc to represent not barely the coefficients of the terms but the whole terms both the numeral and the literal part of them however as the chief use of my method is to obtain the numeral value of series when a literal series is to be so summed it is to be made numeral by substituting the numeral values of the letters instead of them it is farther evident that we might easily derive our method of arithmetical means from the above differential series by beginning with it and receding back to our theorems by a counter process to that above given    having in art         completed the investigations for the first or converging form of series the first four articles being introductory to both forms in common we may now proceed to the diverging form of series for which we shall find the same method of arithmetical means and the same general formula as for the converging series as well as the mode of investigation used in art   et seq only changing sometimes greater for less or less for greater thus then reasoning from the table of successive sums in art   in which s is alternately above and below the expressions o a a  b a  b  c etc because o is below and a above the value s of the series a  b  c  d  etc but o nearer than a to that value it follows that s lies between o and a and that a is greater than s but nearer to s than a is in like manner because a is above and a  b below the value s but a nearer to that value than a  b is it follows that s lies between a and a  b and that the arithmetical mean a  b is below s but that it is nearer to s than a  b is and thus the same reasoning holding in every pair of successive sums the arithmetical means between them will form another series of terms which are alternately greater and less than s the value of the proposed series but here greater and less in the contrary way to what they were for the converging series namely those steps greater here which were less there and less here which before were greater and this first set of arithmetical means will either converge to the value of s or will at least diverge less from it than the progression of successive sums again the same reasoning still holding good by taking the arithmetical means of those first means another set is found which will either converge or else diverge less than the former and so on as far as we please every new operation gradually checking the first or greatest divergency till a number of the first terms of a set converge sufficiently fast to afford a near value of s the proposed series   0 or by taking the first terms of all the orders of means we find the same set of theorems namely  etc or in general  which will be alternately above and below s the value of the series till the divergency is overcome then this series which consists of the first terms of the several orders of means may be treated as the successive sums taking several orders of means of these again after which the first terms of these last orders may be treated again in the same manner and so on as far as we please or the series of second terms or third terms etc or sometimes the terms ascending obliquely may be treated in the same manner to advantage and with a little practice and inspection of the several series whether vertical or horizontal or oblique for they all tend to the detection of the same value s we shall soon learn to distinguish whereabouts the required quantity s is and which of the series will soonest approximate to it     to exemplify now this method we shall take a few series of both sorts and find their value sometimes by actually going through the operations of taking the several orders of arithmetical means and at other times by using some one of the theorems  etc at once and to render the use of these theorems still easier we shall here subjoin the following table where the first line consisting of the powers of   contains the denominators of the theorems in their order and the figures in their perpendicular columns below them are the coefficients of the several terms in the numerators of the theorems namely the upper figure next below the power of   the coefficient of a the next below that of b the third that of c etc                             0                                       0                             0    0    0                             0

in the first horizontal line next below the line of the powers of   are those powers diminished each by unity the numbers in the next horizontal line are made from the numbers in the first by subtracting from each the index of that power of   which stands above it and for the rest of the table the formation of it is obvious from this principle which reigns through the whole that every number in it is the sum of two others namely of the next to it on the left in the same horizontal line and the next above that in the same vertical column so that the whole table is formed from a few of its initial numbers by easy operations of addition  in converging series it will be farther useful first to collect a few of the initial terms into one sum and then apply our method to the following terms which will be sooner valued because they will converge slower     for the first example let us take the very slowly converging series         etc which is known to express the hyp log of   which is           here a    b  c  d  etc and the value as found by theorem the  st  d  d  th  0th and  0th will be thus  st a      d   d   th   0th   0th  where it is evident that every theorem gives always a nearer value than the former the  0th theorem gives the value true to the  th figure and the  0th theorem to the  th figure the operation for the  0th and  0th theorems will be easily performed by dividing mentally the numbers in their respective columns in the table of coefficients in art    by the ordinate numbers             etc placing the quotients of the alternate terms below each other then adding each up and dividing the difference of the sums continually five or ten times successively by the number   after the manner as here placed below where the operation is set down for both of them    for the  0th theorem     for the  0th theorem   again to perform the operation by taking the successive sums and the arithmetical means let the terms etc be reduced to decimal numbers by dividing the common numerator   by the denominators       etc or rather by taking these out of the table at the end of my miscellanea mathematica published in      which contains a table of the square roots and reciprocals of all the numbers             etc to  000 and which is of great use in such calculations as these then the operation will stand thus  here after collecting the first twelve terms i begin at the bottom and ascending upwards take a very few arithmetical means between the successive sums placing them on the right of them it being unnecessary to take the means of the whole as any part of them will do the business but the lower ones in a converging series best because they are nearer the value sought and approach sooner to it i then take the means of the first means and the means of these again and so on till the value is obtained as near as may be necessary in this process we soon distinguish whereabouts the value lies the limits or means which are alternately above and below it gradually contracting and approaching toward each other and when the means are reduced to a single one and it is found necessary to get the value more exactly i then go back to the columns of successive sums and find another first mean either next below or above those before found and continue it through the  d  d etc means which makes now a duplicate in the last column of means and the mean between them gives another single mean of the next order and so on as far as we see it necessary by such a gradual progress we use no more terms nor labor than is quite requisite for the degree of accuracy required  or after having collected the sum of any number of terms we may apply any of the formulae to the following terms so having as above found       for the sum of the first    terms and calling the next or   th term0       a the   th term0        b the next0     etc  c and so on then the  d theorem   a b  gives0      which added to       the sum of the first    terms gives   0   the value of the series true in three places of figures and the  d theorem  gives0      for the following terms and which added to       the sum of the first    terms gives       the value of the series true in five places and so on     for a second example let us take the slowly converging series                         etc which is   hyp log of              then   here after the  d column of means the first four figures      which are common are omitted to save room and the trouble of writing them so often down and in the last three columns the process is repeated with the last three figures of each number and the last of these     joined to the first four give         for the value of the series proposed and the same value is also obtained by the theorems used as in the former example     for the third example let us take the converging series                   etc which is         etc or of the circumference of the circle whose diameter is   here a    b  c  etc then turning the terms into decimals and proceeding with the successive sums and means as before we obtain the  th mean true within a unit in the  th place as here below      to find the value of the converging series  which occurs in the expression for determining the time of a bodys descent down the arc of a circle  the first terms of this series i find ready computed by mr baron maseres pa     philos trans      these being arranged under one another and the sums collected etc as before give       for the value of that series being only   too little in the last figure       to find the value of                etc consisting of the reciprocals of the natural series of square numbers  the last mean       is true in the last figure the more accurate value of the series              etc being      0 etc     let the diverging series     etc be proposed where the terms are the reciprocals of those in art       here the successive sums are alternately  and  as well as the terms themselves of the proposed series but all the arithmetical means are positive the numbers in each column of means are alternately too great and too little but so as visibly to approach toward each other the same mutual approximation is visible in all the oblique lines from left to right so that there is a general and mutual tendency in all the columns and in all the lines to the limit of the value of the series but with this difference that all the numbers in any line descending obliquely from left to right are on one side of the limit and those in the next line in the same direction all on the other side the one line having its numbers all too great while those in the next line are all too little but on the contrary the lines which ascend from below obliquely toward the right have their numbers alternately too great and too little after the manner of those in the columns but approximating quicker than those in the columns so that after having continued the columns of arithmetical means to any convenient extent we may then select the terms in the last or any other line obliquely ascending from left to right or rather beginning with the last found mean on the right and descending toward the left then arrange those terms below one another in a column and take their continual arithmetical means like as was done with the first successive sums to such extent as the case may require and if neither these new columns nor the oblique lines approach near enough to each other a new set may be formed from one of their oblique lines which has its terms alternately too great and too little and thus we may proceed as far as we please these repetitions will be more necessary in treating series which diverge more and having here once for all described the properties attending the series with the method of repetition we shall only have to refer to them as occasion shall offer in the present instance the last two or three means vary or differ so little that the limit may be concluded to lie nearly in the middle between them and therefore the mean between the two last     and   0 namely     may be concluded to be very near the truth in the last three figures for as to the first three figures     i dropped the repetition of them after the first three columns of means both to save space and the trouble of writing them so often over again so that the value of the series in question may be concluded to be       very nearly which is    the hyp log of   or   less than its reciprocal series in art        take the diverging series                            0  etc here first using some of the formulae we have by the  st a       d   d   th   th  etc   or thus taking the several orders of means etc    here the successive sums are alternately  and  but the arithmetical means are all  after the second column of means the first two figures    are omitted being common and in the last three columns the first three figures     which are common are omitted toward the end all the numbers both oblique and vertical approach so near together that we may conclude that the last three figures 0   are all true and these being joined to the first three     we have   0   for the value of the series which is otherwise found        0     etc     let us take the diverging series                     etc or                   etc or                   etc    after the second column of means the first four figures      are omitted being common to all the following columns to these annexing the last three figures     of the last mean we have         for the sum of the series which we otherwise know is equal to     hyp log of   see simp dissert ex   p    and     and the same value might be obtained by means of the formulae using them as before   0 taking the diverging series                etc the method of means gives us   where the second and every succeeding column of means gives for the value of the series proposed  in like manner using the theorems the first gives but the second third fourth etc give each of them the same value thus a      etc      taking the series                      etc whose terms consist of the squares of the natural series of numbers we have by the arithmetical means   where it is only in the second column of means that the divergency is counteracted after that the third and all the other orders of means give o for the value of the series              etc  the same thing takes place on using the formulae for a      where the third and all after it give the same value 0     taking the geometrical series of terms             etc then   here the lower parts of all the columns of means from the cipher 0 downwards consist of the same series of terms                              etc and the other part of the columns from the cipher upwards as well as each line of oblique means parallel to and above the line of ciphers forms a series of terms       n    n alternately above and below the value of the series and approaching continually nearer and nearer to it and which when infinitely continued or when n is infinite the term becomes for the value of the geometrical series                 etc  and the same set of terms would be given by each of the formulae     take the geometrical series                  etc then  here the column of successive sums and every second column of the arithmetical means below the o consists of the same series of terms           0  etc whilst all the other columns of means consist of this other set of terms         etc also the first oblique line of means 0 0 0 etc consists of the terms and 0 alternately which are all at equal distance from the value of the series proposed                  etc as indeed are the terms of all the other oblique descending lines and the mean between every two terms gives for that value and the same terms would be given by the formulae namely alternately and 0  and thus the value of any geometrical series whose ratio or second term is r will be found to be     r     finally let there be taken the hypergeometrical series                   0  etc       a    b    c    d    e  etc which difficult series has been honored by a very considerable memoir written upon the valuation of it by the late famous l euler in the new petersburg commentaries vol v where the value of it is at length determined to be        etc  to simplify this series let us omit the first two terms       0 which will not alter the value and divide the remaining terms by   and the quotients will give            0    0     0  etc which being half the proposed series ought to have for its value the half of       etc namely       nearly  now ranging the terms in a column and taking the sums and means as usual we have  where it is evident that the diverging is somewhat diminished but not quite counteracted in the columns and oblique descending lines from beginning to end as the terms in those directions still increase though not quite so fast as the original series and that the signs of the same terms are alternately  and  while those of the terms in the other lines obliquely ascending from left to right are alternately one line all  and another line all  and these terms continually decreasing the terms in the oblique descending lines being alternately too great and too little are the fittest to proceed with again take therefore any one of those lines as suppose the first and ranging it vertically take the means as before and they will approach nearer to the value of the series thus  here the same approximation in the lines and columns toward the value of the series is observable again only in a higher degree also the terms in the columns and oblique descending lines are again alternately too great and too little but now within narrower limits and the signs of the terms are more of them positive also the terms in each oblique ascending line are still either all above or all below the value of the series and that alternately one line after another as before but the descending lines will again be the fittest to use because the terms in each are alternately above and below the value sought taking therefore again the first of these oblique descending lines treat it as before and we shall obtain sets of terms approaching still nearer to the value thus  here the approach to an equality among all the lines and columns is still more visible and the deviations restricted within narrower limits the terms in the oblique ascending lines still on one side of the value and gradually increasing while the columns and the oblique descending lines for the most part have their terms alternately too great and too little as is evident from their alternately becoming greater and less than each other and from an inspection of the whole it is easy to pronounce that the first three figures of the number sought will be     taking therefore the last sour terms of the first descending line and proceeding as before we have   and finally taking the lowest ascending line because it has most the appearance of being alternately too great and too little proceed with it as before thus  where the numbers in the lines and columns gradually approach nearer together till the last mean is true to the nearest unit in the last figure giving us       for the value of the proposed hypergeometrical series            0    0     0   0  0  etc  and in like manner are we to proceed with any other series whose terms have alternate signs  royal military acad woolwich may    0 postscript since the foregoing method was discovered and made known to several friends two passages have been offered to my consideration which i shall here mention in justice to their authors sir isaac newton and the late learned mr euler  the first of these is in sir isaacs letter to mr oldenburg dated october         and may be seen in collinss commercium epistolicum p     the last paragraph near the bottom of the page namely per seriem leibnitii etiam si ultimo loco dimidium termini adjiciatur and alia quaedam similia artificia adhibeantur potest computum produci ad multas figuras the series here alluded to is                   etc denoting the area of the circle whose diameter is   and sir isaac here directs to add in half the last term after having collected all the foregoing as the means of obtaining the sum a little exacter and this indeed is equivalent to taking one arithmetical mean between two successive sums but it does not reach the idea contained in my method it appears also both by the other words and alia quaedam similia artificia adhibeantur contained in the above extract and by these alias arts adhibuissem a little higher up in the same page     that sir isaac newton had several other contrivances for obtaining the sums of slowly converging series but what they were it may perhaps be now impossible to determine  the other is a passage in the novi comment petropol tom v p     where mr euler gives an instance of taking one set of arithmetical means between a series of quantities which are gradually too little and too great to obtain a nearer value of the sum of a series in question but neither does this reach the idea contained in my method however i have thought it but justice to the characters of these two eminent men to make this mention of their ideas which have some relation to my own though unknown to me at the time of my discovery    tract iii a method of summing the series a  bx  cx   dx   ex   etc when it converges very slowly namely when x is nearly equal to   and the coefficients a b c d etc decrease very slowly the signs of all the terms being positive  art   when we have occasion to find the sum of such series as that abovementioned having the coefficients a b c d etc of the terms decreasing very slowly and the converging quantity x pretty large we can neither find the sum by collecting the terms together on account of the immense number of them which it would be necessary to collect neither can it be summed by means of the differential series because the powers of the quantity x  x will then diverge faster than the differential coefficients converge in such case then we must have recourse to some other method of transforming it into another series which shall converge faster the following is a method by which the proposed series is changed into another which converges so much the quicker as the original series is slower    the method is thus assume a d the given series a  bx  cx   dx   etc then shall  which by actual division is  consequently a  divided by this series will be equal to the series proposed and this new series will be very easily summed in comparison with the original one because all the coefficients after the second term are evidently very small and indeed they are so much the smaller and fitter for summation by how much the coefficients of the original series are nearer to equality so that when these a b c d etc are quite equal then the third fourth etc coefficients of the new series become equal to nothing and the sum accurately equal to  which we also know to be true from other principles    although the first two terms a  bx of the new series be very great in comparison with each of the following terms yet these latter may not always be small enough to be entirely rejected where much accuracy is required in the summation and in such case it will be necessary to collect a great number of them to obtain their sum pretty near the truth because their rate of converging is but small it being indeed pretty much like to the rate of the original series but only the terms each to each are much smaller and that commonly in a degree to the hundredth or thousandth part    the resemblance of this new series however beginning with the third term to the original one in the law of progression intimates to us that it will be best to sum it in the very same manner as the former hence then putting a  c  b  a b  d    bc a  b  a  c  e    bd c  a    b  c a   b  a  etc and consequently the proposed series a  bx  cx   etc   by taking the sum of the series a  b x  c x   etc by the very same theorem as before the sum s of the original series will then be expressed thus  where the series in the last denominator having again the same properties with the former one will have its first two terms very large in respect of the following terms but these first two terms a  bx are themselves very small in comparison with the first two a  bx of the former series and therefore much more are the third fourth etc terms of this last denominator very small in comparison with the same a  bx for which reason they may now perhaps be small enough to be neglected    but if these last terms be still thought too large to be omitted then find the sum of them by the very same theorem and thus proceed by repeating the operation in the same manner till the required degree of accuracy is obtained which it is evident will happen after a small number of repetitions because that in each new denominator the third fourth etc terms are commonly depressed in the scale of numbers two or three places lower than the first and second terms are and the general theorem denoting the sum s when the process is continually repeated will be this     but the general denominator d in the fraction a d which is assumed for the value of s or a  bx  cx   etc may be otherwise found as below from which the general law of the values of the coefficients will be rendered visible assume s or a  bx  cx   etc or  then shall  hence by equating the coefficients of the like terms to nothing we obtain the following general values a  c  bb a     etc where the values of the coefficients are the same in effect as before found but here the law of their continuation is manifest    to exemplify now the use of this method let it be proposed to sum the very slow series x  x   x   x   x   x   etc when x    0   which denotes the hyperbolic log of    x or in this case of  0  now it will be proper in the first place to collect a few of the first terms together and then apply the theorem to the remaining terms which by being nearer to an equality than the terms are near the beginning of the series will be fitter to receive the application of the theorem thus to collect the first    terms no powers of x the first    terms found by dividing x x  x  etc by the numbers       etc         0                  0      0     0          0               0              0     0   0  0          0   0  0       0        0 0

 the third gives  the fourth gives  or when the terms in the numerators are squared it is  or by omitting a proper number of ciphers it is   i have written an unknown quantity z after the last denominator to represent the small quantity to be subtracted from the last denominator     now rejecting the small quantity z and beginning at the last fraction to calculate their values will be as here ranged in the first annexed column   placing z below them for the next unknown fraction divide then every fraction by the next below it placing the quotients or ratios in the next column then take the quotients or ratios of these and so on till the last ratio  which from the nature of the series of the first terms of every column must be less than the next preceding one     consequently z must be less than    x      or less than   but from the nature of the series in the vertical row or column of first ratios     z must be less than    and consequently z must be greater than       or greater than   since then z is less than   and greater than   it is probable that the mean value   is near the truth and accordingly taking   for z or rather    as z appears to be nearer   than   and taking the continual ratios as placed along the last line of the table their values are found to accord very well with the next preceding numbers both in the columns and oblique rows  hence using 0   for z in the denominator     z of the last fraction of the general expression and computing from the bottom upwards through the whole the quotients or values of the fractions in the inverted order will be       0                000 of which the last must be nearly the value of the series          x      x   etc when x    then this value       of the series being multiplied by x   or              gives        for the sum of all the terms of the original series after the first    terms to which therefore the sum of the first    terms or    0      being added we have   0       for the sum of the original series x  x   x   x   etc which value is true within about   in the  th place of figures the more accurate value being   0    0  etc or the hyp log of  0  tract iv the investigation of certain easy and general rules for extracting any root of a given number   the roots of given numbers are commonly to be found with much ease and expedition by means of logarithms when the indices of such roots are simple numbers and the roots are not required to a great number of figures and the square or cubic roots of numbers to a good practical degree of accuracy may be obtained almost by inspection by means of my tables of squares and cubes published by order of the commissioners of longitude in the year      but when the indices of such roots are certain complex or irrational numbers or when the roots are required to be found to a great many places of figures it is necessary to make use of certain approximating rules by means of the ordinary arithmetical computations such rules as are here alluded to have only been discovered since the great improvements in the modern algebra and the persons who have best succeeded in their enquiries after such rules have been successively sir isaac newton mr raphson m de lagney and dr halley who have shown that the investigation of such theorems is also useful in discovering rules for approximating to the roots of all sorts of affected algebraical equations to which the former rules for the roots of all simple equations bear a considerable affinity it is presumed that the following short tract contains some advantages over any other method that has hitherto been given both as to the ease and universality of the conclusions and the general way in which the investigations are made for here a theorem is discovered which although it be general for all roots whatever is at the same time very accurate and so simple and easy to use and to keep in mind that nothing more so can be desired or hoped for and farther that instead of searching out rules severally for each root one after another our investigation is at once for any indefinite possible root by whatever quantity the index is expressed whether fractional or irrational or simple or compound    in every theorem or rule here investigated let n be the given number whose root is sought n the index of that root a its nearest rational root or an the nearest rational power to n whether greater or less x the remaining part of the root sought which may be either positive or negative namely positive when n is greater than an otherwise negative hence then the given number n is  and the required root   a  x    now for the first rule expand the quantity  by the binomial theorem so shall we have  subtract an from both sides so shall  divide by  so shall  or  here on account of the smallness of the quantity x in respect of a all the terms of this series after the first term will be very small and may therefore be neglected without much error which gives us  for a near value of x being only a small matter too great and consequently  is nearly  n  n the root sought and this may be accounted the first theorem    again let the equation  be multitiplied by n    and an added to each side so shall we have  for a divisor also multiply the sides of the same equation by a and subtract an    from each so shall we have  for a dividend divide now this dividend by the divisor so shall  which will be nearly equal to x for the same reason as before and this expression is nearly as much too little as the former expression was too great consequently by adding a we have a  x or n  n nearly  for a second theorem and which is nearly as much in defect as the former was in excess    now because the two foregoing theorems differ from the truth by nearly equal small quantities if we add together the two numerators and the two denominators of the foregoing two fractional expressions namely  and  the sums will be the numerator and denominator of a new fraction which will be much nearer than either of the former the fraction so found is  which will be very nearly equal to n  n or a  x the root sought for by division it is found to be equal to a  x   n    n    x  a   etc where the term is wanting which contains the square of x and the following terms are very small and this is the third theorem    a fourth theorem might be found by taking the arithmetical mean between the first and second which would be  which will be nearly of the same value though not so simple as the third theorem for this arithmetical mean is found equal to a  x   n    n    x  a   etc    but the third theorem may be investigated in a more general way thus assume a quantity of this form  with coefficients p and q to be determined from the process the other letters n a n representing the same things as before then divide the numerator by the denominator and make the quotient equal to a  x so shall the comparison of the coefficients determine the relation between p and q required thus   then dividing the former of these by the latter we have  or  then by equating the corresponding terms we obtain these three equations   a p q p q n    n    qn p q  0   from which we find p q p q    n and p q n    n    so that by substituting n    and n    or any quantities proportional to them for p and q we shall have  for the value of the assumed quantity  which is supposed nearly equal to a  x the required root of the quantity n    now this third theorem  which is general for roots whatever be the value of n and whether an be greater or less than n includes all the rational formulas of de lagney and halley which were separately investigated by them and yet this general formula is perfectly simple and easy to apply and easier kept in mind than any one of the said particular formulas for in words at length it is simply this to n    times n add n    times an and to n    times n add n    times an then the former sum multiplied by a and divided by the latter sum will give the root n  n nearly or as the latter sum is to the former sum so is a the assumed root to the required root nearly where it is to be observed that an may be taken either greater or less than n and that the nearer it is to it the better    by substituting for n in the general theorem severally the numbers         etc we shall obtain the following particular theorems as adapted for the  d  d  th  th etc roots namely for the  d or square root   d or cube root   th root   th root   th root   th root     0 to exemplify now our formula let it be first required to extract the square root of     here n      n    the nearest square is     whose root is     hence   n  a     x                and n    a          x           then as                x                     0    etc  again to approach still nearer substitute this last found root   x       for a the values of the other letters remaining as before we have a      x                    then  n  a     x                      0        n    a         x                0        hence      0        0     x       or             x     0     x     0    the root of     very exact which being brought into decimals would be true to about  0 places of figures     for a second example let it be proposed to double the cube or to find the cube root of the number    here n    n    the nearest root a    also a     hence   n  a           and n    a           then as                the first approximation again take a     and consequently a         hence  n  a                   and n    a        0          then as         or as               x             0           for the cube root of   which is true in the last figure  and by taking     0  for the value of a and repeating the process a great many more figures may be found     for a third example let it be required to find the  th root of    here n    n    the nearest root a     hence   n    a           and   n    a           then as                for the first approximation  again taking a     we have   n    a              0            0    n    a         0    0            0  then as                     x                x                                   etc for the  th root of   and is true in the last figure     to find the  th root of      here n      n    the nearest root a    also a        hence   n    a    0                   and   n    a               0        then as                               for the root very exact by one operation being true to the nearest unit in the last figure     to find the    th root of  0  or the amount of   pound for   day at   per cent per annum compound interest  here n   0  n      a    the nearest root hence     n      a       and     n      a       then as                                 000      the root sought very exact at one operation     let it be required to find the value of the quantity  or   now this may be done two ways either by finding the power or    root of     at once or else by finding the  d or cubic root of     and then squaring the result  by the first way  here it is easy to see that a is nearly    because             some small fraction hence to find nearly the square root of    or    the nearest power to which is     a  in this case hence   n  a     x          0  and n    a         x      0  then as  0   0  or as           x                 nearly  then having n      n     a    and a          nearly it will be    n  a       x      x             0  and n     a    x         x             0  hence as                                    0 0    for the value of the quantity sought nearly by this way  again by the other method in finding first the value of  or the cube root of     it is evident that   is the nearest integer root being the cube root of    a   hence   n  a               and n    a                then as               or     nearly then taking    for a we have   n  a                0     and n    a                 0     hence as  0    0   or as  nearly consequently the square of this or  will be       x            0 0      0       0     0     0 0  0 the quantity sought more nearly being true in the last figure  tract v a new method of finding in finite and general terms near values of the roots of equations of this form  namely having the terms alternately plus and minus   the following is one method more to be added to the many we are already possessed of for determining the roots of the higher equations by means of it we readily find a root which is sometimes accurate and when not so it is at least near the truth and that by an easy finite formula which is general for all equations of the above form and of the same dimension provided that root be a real one this is of use for depressing the equation down to lower dimensions and thence for finding all the roots one after another when the formula gives the root sufficiently exact and when not it serves as a ready means of obtaining a near value of a root by which to commence an approximation still nearer by the previously known methods of newton or halley or others this method is farther useful in elucidating the nature of equations and certain properties of numbers as will appear in some of the following articles we have already easy methods for finding the roots of simple and quadratic equations i shall therefore begin with the cubic equation and treat of each order of equations separately in ascending gradually to the higher dimensions    let then the cubic equation x   px   qx  r  o be proposed assume the root x  a either accurately or approximately as it may happen so that x  a  o accurately or nearly raise this x  a  o to the third power the same dimension with the proposed equation so shall x     a x     a  x  a   o but the proposed equation is x   p x   q x  r  o therefore the one of these is equal to the other but the first term  x  of each is the same and hence if we assume the second terms equal between themselves it will follow that the sum of the two remaining terms will also be equal and give a simple equation by which the value of x is determined thus   a x  being  px  or a  p we shall have   a  x  a   qx  r and hence  by substituting p the value of a instead of it    now this value of x here found will be the middle root of the proposed cubic equation for because a is assumed nearly or accurately equal to x and also equal to p therefore x is  p nearly or accurately that is of the sum of the three roots to which the coefficient p of the second term of the equation is always equal and thus being a medium among the three roots it will be either nearly or accurately equal to the middle root of the proposed equation when that root is a real one    now this value of x will always be the middle root accurately whenever the three roots are in arithmetical progression otherwise only approximately for when the three roots are in arithmetical progression p or of their sum it is well known is equal to the middle term or root in the other cases therefore the abovefound value of x is only near the middle root    when the roots are in arithmetical progression because the middle term or root is then  p and also  therefore  or  an equation expressing the general relation of p q and r where p is the sum of any three terms in arithmetical progression q the sum of their three rectangles and r the product of all the three for in any equation the coefficient p of the second term is the sum of the roots the coefficient q of the third term is the sum of the rectangles of the roots and the coefficient r of the fourth term is the sum of the solids of the roots which in the case of the cubic equation is only one  thus if the roots or arithmetical terms be       here p             q    x      x      x                r    x   x      then   p     x         and  also    to illustrate now the rule  by some examples let us in the first place take the equation x     x      x     0 here p    q     and r    consequently  this being substituted for x in the given equation makes all the terms to vanish and therefore it is an exact root and the roots will be in arithmetical progression dividing therefore the given equation by x     0 the quotient is x     x     0 the roots of which quadratic equation are   and   the other two roots of the proposed equation x     x      x     0    if the equation be x      x       x        0 we shall have p     q      and r       then  then substituting       for x in the proposed equation the negative terms are sound to exceed the positive terms by   thereby showing that       is very near but something above the middle root and that therefore the roots are not in arithmetical progression it is therefore probable that    may be the true value of the root and on trial it is found to succeed  then dividing x      x       x       by x     the quotient is x     x       0 the roots of which quadratic equation are   and    the two other roots of the proposed equation    if the equation be x     x     x     0 we shall have p    q    and r    then  this value of x being substituted for it in the proposed equation causes all the terms to vanish as it ought thereby showing that   is the middle root and that the roots are in arithmetical progression  accordingly dividing the given quantity x     x     x    by x    the quotient is x    x     0 a quadratic equation whose roots are      and      the two other roots of the equation proposed    if the equation be x     x     x     0 we shall have p    q    and r    then  from which one might guess the root ought to be   and which being tried is found to succeed  but without such trial we may make use of this value       or     nearly and approximate with it in the common way  having found the middle root to be   divide the given quantity x     x     x    by x    and the quotient is x     x     0 the roots of which are      and      the two other roots as in the last article   0 if the equation be x     x      x      0 we shall have p    q     and r     then  or   nearly then trying   for x it is found to succeed and dividing x     x      x     by x    the quotient is x    x     0 a quadratic equation whose roots are      and      the two other roots of the proposed equation which are both impossible or imaginary     if the equation be x     x      x      0 we shall have p    q     and r     then  which being substituted for x it is found to answer the sum of the terms coming out  0 therefore the roots are in arithmetical progression and accordingly by dividing x     x      x     by x    the quotient is x     x     0 the roots of which quadratic equation are      and      the two other roots of the proposed equation and the common difference of the three roots is       but if the equation be x     x      x      0 we shall have p    q     and r     then  which being substituted for x in the proposed equation the sum of the terms differs very widely from the truth thereby showing that the middle root of the equation is an imaginary one as it is indeed the three roots being   and      and          in art   the value of x was determined by assuming the second terms of the two equations equal to each other but a like near value might be determined by assuming either the two third terms or the two sourth terms equal  thus the equations being x     ax     a  x  a   0 x   px   qx  r  0 if we assume the third terms   a  x and qx equal or a  q the sums of the second and fourth terms will be equal namely   ax   a   px   r and hence we find  by substituting q the value of a instead of it  and if we assume the fourth terms equal namely a   r or   r then the sums of the second and third terms will be equal namely   ax    a   px  q and hence  by substituting r instead of a and either of these two formulas will give nearly the same value of the root as the first formula at least when the roots do not differ very greatly from one another  but if they differ very much among themselves the first formula will not be so accurate as these two others because that in them the roots were more complexly mixed together for the second formula is drawn from the coefficient of the third term which is the sum of all the rectangles of the roots and the third formula is drawn from the coefficient of the last term which is equal to the continual product of all the roots while the first formula is drawn from the coefficient of the second term which is simply the sum of the roots and indeed the last theorem is commonly the nearest of all so that when we suspect the roots to be very wide of each other let either the second or third be used  thus in the equation x      x      x   0  0 whose three roots are     and  0 here p     q     r   0 and by the  st theor  nearly  d theor  nearly  d theor  nearly where the two latter are much nearer the middle root   than the first and the mean between these two is       which is very near to that root and this is commonly the case the one being nearly as much too great as the other is too little     to proceed now in like manner to the biquadratic equation which is of this general form x   px   qx   rx  s  0  assume the root x  a or x  a  0 and raise this equation x  a  0 to the fourth power or the same height with the proposed equation which will give x     ax     a  x     a  x  a   0 but the proposed equation is x   px   qx   rx  s  0 therefore these two are equal to each other now if we assume the second terms equal namely   a  p or a  p then the sums of the three remaining terms will also be equal namely  and hence  or  by substituting p instead of a then resolving this quadratic equation we find its roots to be thus  or if we put a     p     q b  p      r c  p       s the two roots will be      it is evident that the same property is to be understood here as for the cubic equation in art   namely that the two roots above found are the middle roots of the four which belong to the biquadratic equation when those roots are real ones for otherwise the formulae are of no use but however those roots will not be accurate when the sum of the two middle roots of the proposed equation is equal to the sum of the greatest and least roots or when the four roots are in arithmetical progression because that in this case p the assumed value of a is neither of the middle roots exactly but only a mean between them     to exemplify this formula  let the proposed equation be x      x      x      x   0  0 then a     p     q      x       x                0 b  p      r          x                   0 c  p       s           x  0   0      0  0   0    hence  nearly or   and   nearly or nearly   and   whose sum is   and trying   and   they are both found to answer and therefore they are the two middle roots  then  by which dividing the given equation x      x      x      x   0  0 the quotient is x     x     0 the roots of which quadratic equation are   and   and which therefore are the greatest and least roots of the equation proposed     if the equation be x      x      x      x      0 then a     p     q      x       x                  b  p      r          x                     c  p       s           x      0               0 hence  and      or   and   nearly both of which answer on trial and therefore   and   are the two middle roots  then  by which dividing the given quantity x      x      x      x      0 the quotient is x     x     0 the roots of which quadratic equation are   and   which therefore are the greatest and least roots of the equation proposed     if the equation be x     x      x      x     0 we have a     p     q     x       x          0     b  p      r         x                   c  p       s          x      0             hence  or nearly   and   both which are found on trial to answer and therefore   and   are the two middle roots sought  then  by which dividing the given equation x     x      x      x     0 the quotient is x     x     0 the roots of which quadratic equation are      and      and which therefore are the greatest and least roots of the proposed equation     but if the equation be x     x    0 x      x      0 we have a     p     q     x      x  0         0    b  p      r         x                  c  p       s          x                     hence  an imaginary quantity showing that the two middle roots are imaginary and therefore the formula is of no use in this case the four roots being             and     0 and thus in other examples the two middle roots will be found when they are rational or a near value when irrational which in this case will serve for the foundation of a nearer approximation to be made in the usual way  we might also find another formula for the biquadratic equation by assuming the last terms as equal to each other for then the sum of the  d  d and  th terms of each would be equal and would form another quadratic equation whose roots would be nearly the two middle roots of the biquadratic proposed     or a root of the biquadratic equation may easily be found by assuming it equal to the product of two squares as  for comparing the terms of this with the terms of the equation proposed in this manner namely making the second terms equal then the third terms equal and lastly the sums of the fourth and fifth terms equal these equations will determine a near value of x by a simple equation for those equations are    then the values of ab and a  b found from the first and second of these equations and substituted in the third this gives  a general formula for one of the roots of the biquadratic equation x   px   qx   rx  s  0     to exemplify now this sormula let us take the same equation as in art    namely x      x      x      x      0 the roots of which were there found to be       and   then by our last formula we shall have  or nearly   which is the least root     again in the equation x     x      x     x      0 whose roots are          and      we have  nearly which is nearly a mean between the two least roots   and      or nearly     but if the equation be x     x    0 x      x      0 which has impossible roots the four roots being             and   we shall have  nearly which is of no use in this case of imaginary roots     this formula will also sometimes fail when the roots are all real as if the equation be x      x      x      x   0  0 the roots of which are       and   for here  which is of no use     for equations of higher dimensions as the  th the  th the  th etc we might in imitation of this last method combine other forms of quantities together thus for the  th power we might compare it either with  or with  or with  or with  and so for the other powers  tract vi of the binomial theorem with a demonstration of the truth of it in the general case of fractional exponents   it is well known that this famous theorem is called binomial because it contains a proposition of a quantity consisting of two terms as a radix to be expanded in a series of equal value it is also called emphatically the newtonian theorem or newtons binomial theorem because he has commonly been reputed the author of it as he was indeed for the case of fractional exponents which is the most general of all and includes all the other particular cases of powers or divisions etc    the binomial as proposed in its general form was by newton thus expressed  where p is the first term of the binomial q the quotient of the second term divided by the first and consequently pq is the second term itself or pq may represent all the terms of a multinomial after the first term and consequently q the quotient of all those terms except the first term divided by that first term and may be either positive or negative also m n represents the exponent of the binomial and may denote any quantity integral or fractional positive or negative rational or surd when the exponent is integral the denominator n is equal to   and the quantity then in this form  denotes a binomial to be raised to some power the series for which was fully determined before newtons time as i have shown in the historical introduction to my mathematical tables lately published when the exponent is fractional m and n may be any quantities whatever m denoting the index of some power to which the binomial is to be raised and n the index of the root to be extracted of that power and to this case it was first extended and applied by newton when the exponent is negative the reciprocal of the same quantity is meant as  is equal to     now when the radical binomial is expanded in an equivalent series it is asserted that it will be in this general form namely  where the law of the progression is visible and the quantities p m n q include their signs  or  the terms of the series being all positive when q is positive and alternately positive and negative when q is negative independent however of the effect of the coefficients made up of m and n also a b c d etc in the latter form denote each preceding term this latter form is the easier in practice when we want to collect the sum of the terms of a series but the former is the fitter for showing the law of the progression of the terms    the truth of this series was not demonstrated by newton but only inferred by way of induction since his time however several attempts have been made to demonstrate it with various success and in various ways of which however those are justly preferred which proceed by pure algebra and without the help of fluxions and such has been esteemed the difficulty of proving the general case independent of the doctrine of fluxions that many eminent mathematicians to this day account the demonstration not fully accomplished and still a thing greatly to be desired such a demonstration i think i have effected but before i deliver it it may not be improper to premise somewhat of the history of this theorem its rise progress extension and demonstrations    till very lately the prevailing opinion has been that the theorem was not only invented by newton but first of all by him that is in that state of perfection in which the terms of the series for any assigned power whatever can be found independently of the terms of the preceding powers namely the second term from the first the third term from the second the fourth term from the third and so on by a general rule upon this point i have already given an opinion in the history to my logarithms above cited and i shall here enlarge somewhat farther on the same head  that newton invented it himself i make no doubt but that he was not the first inventor is at least as certain it was described by briggs in his trigonometria britannica long before newton was born not indeed for fractional exponents for that was the application of newton but for any integral power whatever and that by the general law of the terms as laid down by newton independent of the terms of the powers preceding that which is required for as to the generation of the coefficients of the terms of one power from those of the preceding powers successively one after another it was remarked by vieta oughtred and many others and was not unknown to much more early writers on arithmetic and algebra as will be manifest by a slight inspection of their works as well as the gradual advance the property made both in extent and perspicuity under the hands of the successive masters in arithmetic every one adding somewhat more toward the perfection of it    now the knowledge of this property of the coefficients of the terms in the powers of a binomial is at least as old as the practice of the extraction of roots for this property was both the foundation the principle and the means of those extractions and as the writers on arithmetic became acquainted with the nature of the coefficients in powers still higher just so much higher did they extend the extraction of roots still making use of this property at first it seems they were only acquainted with the nature of the square which consists of these three terms       and accordingly extracted the square roots of numbers by means of them but went no farther the nature of the cube next presented itself which consists of these four terms         and by means of these they extracted the cubic roots of numbers in the same manner as we do at present and this was the extent of their extractions in the time of lucas de burgo an italian who from    0 to   00 wrote several tracts on arithmetic containing the sum of what was then known of this science which chiefly consisted in the doctrine of the proportions of numbers the nature of figurate numbers and the extraction of roots as far as the cubic root inclusively    it was not long however before the nature of the coefficients of all the higher powers became known and tables formed for constructing them indefinitely for in the year      came out at norimberg an excellent treatise of arithmetic and algebra by michael stifelius a german divine and an honest but a weak disciple of luther in this work arithmetica integra of stifelius are contained several curious things some of which have been ascribed to a much later date he here treats pretty fully and ably of progressional and figurate numbers and in particular of the following table for constructing both them and the coefficients of the terms of all powers of a binomial which has been so often used since his time for these and other purposes and which more than a century after was by pascal otherwise called the arithmetical triangle and who only mentioned some additional properties of the table                0  0       0                     0                  0      0   0                 0                 0                                                     00   00   00           0            00   00                 0   0    0       00      0     0          0    0                      0 stifelius here observes that the horizontal lines of this table furnish the coefficients of the terms of the correspondent powers of a binomial and teaches how to use them in extracting the roots of all powers whatever and after him the same table was used for the same purpose by cardan and stevin and the other writers on arithmetic i suspect however that the nature of this table was known much earlier than the time of stifelius at least so far as regards the progressions of figurate numbers a doctrine amply treated of by nicomachus who lived according to some before euclid but not till long after him according to others and whose work on arithmetic was published at paris in      and which it is supposed was chiefly copied in the treatise on the same subject by boethius but i have never seen either of these two works though indeed cardan seems to ascribe the invention of the table to stifelius but i suppose that is only to be understood of its application to the extraction of roots see cardans opus novum de proportionibus where he quotes it and extracts the table and its use from stifeliuss book cardan also at page     et seq of the same work makes use of a like table to find the number of variations of things or conjugations as he calls them    the contemplation of this table has probably been attended with the invention and extension of some of our most curious discoveries in mathematics both in regard to the powers of a binomial with the consequent extraction of roots the doctrine of angular sections by vieta and the differential method by briggs and others for one or two of the powers or sections being once known the table would be of excellent use in discovering and constructing the rest and accordingly we find this table used on many occasions by stifelius cardan stevin vieta briggs oughtred mercator pascal etc etc    on this occasion i cannot help mentioning the ample manner in which i see stifelius at fol    et seq of the same book treats of the nature and use of logarithms though not under the same name but under the idea of a series of arithmeticals adapted to a series of geometricals he there explains all their uses such as that the addition of them answers to the multiplication of their geometricals subtraction to division multiplication of exponents to involution and dividing of exponents to evolution and he exemplifies the use of them in cases of the ruleofthree and in finding mean proportionals between given terms and such like exactly as is done in logarithms so that he seems to have been in the full possession of the idea of logarithms and wanted only the necessity of troublesome calculations to induce him to make a table of such numbers   0 but although the nature and construction of this table namely of figurate numbers was thus early known and employed in the raising of powers and extracting of roots yet it was only by raising the numbers one from another by continual additions and then taking them from the table for use when wanted till briggs first pointed out the way of raising any horizontal line in the foregoing table by itself without any of the preceding lines and thus teaching to raise the terms of any power of a binomial independent of any other powers and so gave the substance of the binomial series in words wanting only the notation in symbols as i have shown at large at page    of the historical introduction to my mathematical tables     whatever was known however of this matter related only to pure or integral powers no one before newton having thought of extracting roots by infinite series he happily discovered that by considering powers and roots in a continued series roots being as powers having fractional exponents the same binomial series would equally serve for them all whether the index should be fractional or integral or the series be finite or infinite     the truth of this method however was long known only by trial in particular cases and by induction from analogy nor does it appear that even newton himself ever attempted any direct proof of it but various demonstrations of this theorem have been since given by the more modern mathematicians of which some are by means of the doctrine of fluxions and others more legally from the pure principles of algebra only some of which i shall here give a short account of     one of the first was mr james bernoulli his demonstration is among several other curious things contained in his little work called ars conjectandi which has been improperly omitted in the collection of his works published by his nephew nicholas bernoulli this is a strict demonstration of the binomial theorem in the case of integral and affirmative powers and is to this effect supposing the theorem to be true in any one power as for instance in the cube it must be true in the next higher power which he demonstrates but it is true in the cube in the fourth fifth sixth and seventh powers as will easily appear by trial that is by actually raising those powers by continual multiplications therefore it is true in all higher powers all this he shows in a regular and legitimate manner from the principles of multiplication and without the help of fluxions but he could not extend his proof to the other cases of the binomial theorem in which the powers are fractional and this demonstration has been copied by mr john stewart in his commentary on sir isaac newtons quadrature of curves to which he has added from the principles of fluxions a demonstration of the other case for roots or fractional exponents     in no   0 of the philosophical transactions for the year      is given a theorem by mr de moivre in imitation of the binomial theorem which is extended to any number of terms and thence called the multinomial theorem which is a general expression in a series for raising any multinomial quantity to any power his demonstration of the truth of this theorem is independent of the truth of the binomial theorem and contains in it a demonstration of the binomial theorem as a subordinate proposition or particular case of the other more general theorem and this demonstration may be considered as a legitimate one for pure powers founded on the principles of multiplication that is on the doctrine of combinations and permutations and it proves that the law of the continuation of the terms must be the same in the terms not computed or not set down as in those that are written down     the ingenious mr landen has given an investigation of the binomial theorem in his discourse concerning the residual analysis printed in      and in the residual analysis itself printed in      the investigation is deduced from this lemma namely if m and n be any integers and q  v x then is  which theorem is made the principal basis of his residual analysis  the investigation is this the binomial proposed being  assume it equal to the following series    ax  bx   cx  etc with indeterminate coefficients then for the same reason as  will  then by subtraction  and dividing both sides by x  y and by the lemma we have  then as this equation must hold true whatever be the value of y take y  x and it will become  consequently multiplying by    x we have  or its equal by the assumption viz   then by comparing the homologous terms the value of the coefficients a b c etc are deduced for as many terms as you compare  and a large account is given of this investigation by the learned dr hales in his analysis equationum lately published at dublin  mr landen then contrasts this investigation with that by the method of fluxions which is as follows assume as before  take the fluxion of each side and we have  divide by x or take it    so shall   then multiply by    x and so on as above in the other way     besides the above which are the principal demonstrations and investigations that have been given of this important theorem i have been shown an ingenious attempt of mr baron maseres to demonstrate this theorem in the case of roots or fractional exponents by the help of de moivres multinomial theorem but not being quite satisfied with his own demonstration as not expressing the law of continuation of the terms which are not actually set down he was pleased to urge me to attempt a more complete and satisfactory demonstration of the general case of roots or fractional exponents and he farther proposed it in this form namely that if q be the coefficient of one of the terms of the series which is equal to  and p the coefficient of the next preceding term and r the coefficient of the next followlowing term then if q be  to prove that r will be  this he observed would be quite perfect and satisfactory as it would include all the terms of the series as well those that are omitted as those that are actually set down and i was in my demonstration to suppose if i pleased the truth of the binomial and multinomial theorems for integral powers as truths that had been previously and perfectly proved  in consequence i sent him soon after the substance of the following demonstration with which he was quite satisfied and which i now proceed to explain at large     now the binomial integral is  where a b c etc denote the whole coefficients of the  d  d  th etc terms over which they are placed and in which the law is this namely if p q r be the coefficients of any three terms in succession and if g b p  q then is  as is evident and which it is granted has been proved     and the binomial fractional is  in which the law is this namely if p q r be the coefficients of three terms in succession and if g b p  q then is  which is the property to be proved     again the multinomial integral is   etc or if we put a b c d etc for the coefficients of the  d  d  th  th etc terms the last series by substitution will be transformed into this form    0 now to find the series in art    assume the proposed binomial equal to a series with indeterminate coefficients as  then raise each side to the n power so shall  but it is granted that the multinomial raised to any integral power is proved and known to be as in the last art  it follows then that if this last series be equal to    x by equating the homologous coefficients all the terms after the second must vanish or all the coefficients b c d etc after the second term must be each  0 writing therefore in this series 0 for each of the letters b c d etc it will become of this more simple form  put now each of the coefficients after the second term  0 and we shall have these equations     etc the resolution of which equations gives the following values of the assumed indeterminate coefficients namely  etc which coefficients are according to the law proposed namely when g h p  q then g n h n q  r q e d     also by equating the second coefficients namely    a  na we find a    n this being written for a in the above values of b c d etc will give the proper series for the binomial in question namely   of the form of the assumed series    in the demonstrations or investigations of the truth of the binomial theorem the but or object has always been the law of the coefficients of the terms the form of the series as to the powers of x having never been disputed but taken for granted either as incapable of receiving a demonstration or as too evident to need one but since the demonstration of the law of the coefficients has been accomplished in which the main if not the only difficulty was supposed to consist we have extended our researches still farther and have even doubted or queried the very form of the terms themselves namely    a x  b x   c x   d x   etc increasing by the regular integral series of the powers of x as assumed to denote the quantity  or the n root of    x and in consequence of these scruples i have been required by a learned friend to vindicate the propriety of that assumption which i think is effectually done as follows     to prove then that any root of the binomial    x can be represented by a series of this form    x  x   x   x  etc where the coefficients are omitted our attention being now employed only on the powers of x let the series representing the value of  be    a  b  c  d  etc where a b c etc now represent the whole of the  d  d  th etc terms both their coefficients and the powers of x whatever they may be only increasing from the less to the greater because they increase in the terms    x of the given binomial itself and in which the first term must evidently be   the same as in the given binomial  raise now  and its equivalent series    a  b  c  etc both to the n power by the multinomial theorem and we shall have as before  then equate the corresponding terms and we have the first term       again the second term of the series n  a must be equal to the second term x of the binomial for none of the other terms of the series are equipollent or contain the same power of x with the term n  a not any of the terms a  a  a  etc for they are double triple quadruple etc in power to a nor yet any of the terms containing b c d etc because by the supposition they contain all different and increasing powers it follows therefore that n  a makes up the whole value of the second term x of the given binomial consequently the second term a of the assumed series contains only the first power of x and the whole value of that term a is    nx  but all the other equipollent terms of the expanded series must be equal to nothing which is the general value of the terms after the second of the given quantity    x or    x  0  0  0  etc our business is therefore to find the several orders of equipollent terms of the expanded series and these i say will be as i have arranged them above in which b is equipollent with a  c with a  d with a  and so on  now that b is equipollent with a  is thus proved the value of the third term is 0 but  is a part of the third term and it is only a part of that term otherwise  would be  0 which it is evident cannot happen in every value of n as it ought for indeed it happens only when n is    some other quantity then must be equipollent with n   n   a  and must be joined with it to make up the whole third term equal to 0 now that supplemental quantity can be no other than n b for all the other following terms are evidently plupollent than b it follows therefore that b is equipollent with a  and contains the second power of x or that  and consequently   again the fourth term must be  0 but the quantities n   n    n   a   n   n   ab are equipollent and make up part of that fourth term they are equipollent or a  equipollent with ab because a  and b are equipollent and they do not constitute the whole of that term for if they did then would n   n    n   a   n   n   ab be  0 in all values of n or n   a   b  0 but it has been just shown above that n   a   b  0 it would therefore follow that n   would be  n   a circumstance which can only happen where n    instead of taking place for every value of n some other quantity must therefore be joined with these to make up the whole of the fourth term and this supplemental quantity can be no other than n  c because all the other following quantities are evidently plupollent than a  or ab it follows therefore that c is equipollent with a  and therefore contains the  d power of x and the whole value of c is   and the process is the same for all the other following terms thus then we have proved the law of the whole series both with respect to the coefficients of its terms and to the powers of the letter x  tract vii of the common sections of the sphere and cone together with the demonstration of some other new properties of the sphere which are similar to certain known properties of the circle the study of the mathematical sciences is useful and profitable not only on account of the benefit derivable from them to the affairs of mankind in general but are most eminently so for the pleasure and delight the human mind feels in the discovery and contemplation of the endless number of truths that are continually presenting themselves to our view these meditations are of a sublimity far above all others whether they be purely intellectual or whether they respect the nature and properties of material objects they methodise strengthen and extend the reasoning faculties in the most eminent degree and so fit the mind the better for understanding and improving every other science but above all they furnish us with the purest and most permanent delight from the contemplation of truths peculiarly certain and immutable and from the beautiful analogy which reigns through all the objects of similar inquiry in the mathematical sciences the discovery often accidental of a plain and simple property is but the harbinger of a thousand others of the most sublime and beautiful nature to which we are gradually led delighted from the more simple to the more compound and general till the mind becomes quite enraptured at the full blaze of light bursting upon it from all directions  of these very pleasing subjects the striking analogy that prevails among the properties of geometrical figures or figured extension is not one of the least here we often find that a plain and obvious property of one of the simplest figures leads us to and forms only a particular case of a property in some other figure less simple afterward this again turns out to be no more than a particular case of another still more general and so on till at last we often trace the tendency to end in a general property of all figures whatever  the few properties which make a part of this paper constitute a small specimen of the analogy and even identity of some of the more remarkable properties of the circle with those of the sphere to which are added some properties of the lines of section and of contact between the sphere and cone both which may be farther extended as occasions may offer like as all of these properties have occurred from the circumstance mentioned near the end of the paper of considering the inner surface of a hollow spherical vessel as viewed by an eye or as illuminated by rays from a given point  proposition i all the tangents are equal which are drawn from a given point without a sphere to the surface of the sphere quite around  demons for let pt be any tangent from the given point p and draw pc to the center c and join tc also let cta be a great circle of the sphere in the plane of the triangle tpc then cp and ct as well as the angle t which is right eucl iii    being constant in every position of the tangent or of the point of contact t the square of pt will be every where equal to the difference of the squares of the constant lines cp ct and therefore constant and consequently the line or tangent pt itself of a constant length in every position quite round the surface of the sphere  diagram  prop ii if a tangent be drawn to a sphere and a radius be drawn from the center to the point of contact it will be perpendicular to the tangent and a perpendicular to the tangent will pass through the center  demons for let pt be the tangent tc the radius and cta a great circle of the sphere in the plane of the triangle tpc as in the foregoing proposition then pt touching the circle in the point t the radius tc is perpendicular to the tangent pt by eucl iii        prop iii if any line or chord be drawn in a sphere its extremes terminating in the circumference then a perpendicular drawn to it from the center will bisect it and if the line drawn from the center bisect it it is perpendicular to it  demons for a plane may pass through the given line and the center of the sphere and the section of that plane with the sphere will be a great circle theodos i   of which the given line will be a chord therefore eucl iii   the perpendicular bisects the chord and the bisecting line is perpendicular  corol a line drawn from the center of the sphere to the center of any lesser circle or circular section is perpendicular to the plane of that circle for by the proposition it is perpendicular to all the diameters of that circle  prop iv if from a given point a right line be drawn in any position through a sphere cutting its surface always in two points the rectangle contained under the whole line and the external part that is the rectangle contained by the two distances between the given point and the two points where the line meets the surface of the sphere will always be of the same constant magnitude namely equal to the square of the tangent drawn from the same given point  demons let p be the given point and ab the two points in which the line pab meets the surface of the sphere through pab and the center let a plane cut the sphere in the great circle tab to which draw the tangent pt then the rectangle papb is equal to the square of pt eucl iii    but pt and consequently its square is constant by prop   therefore the rectangle papb which is always equal to this square is every where of the same constant magnitude  diagram  prop v if any two lines intersect each other within a sphere and be terminated at the surface on both sides the rectangle of the parts of the one line will be equal to the rectangle of the parts of the other and universally the rectangles of the two parts of all lines passing through the point of intersection are all of the same magnitude  demons through any one of the lines as ab conceive a plane to be drawn through the center c of the sphere cutting the sphere in the great circle abd and draw its diameter dcpf through the point of intersection p of all the lines then the rectangle appb is equal to the rectangle dppf eucl iii     diagram  again through any other of the intersecting lines gh and the center conceive another plane to pass cutting the sphere in another great circle dgfh then because the points c and p are in this latter plane the line cp and consequently the whole diameter dcpf is in the same plane and therefore it is a diameter of the circle dgfh of which gph is a chord therefore again the rectangle gpph is equal to the rectangle dppf eucl iii     consequently all the rectangles appb gpph etc are equal being each equal to the constant rectangle dppf  corol the great circles passing through all the lines or chords which intersect in the point p will all intersect in the common diameter dpf  prop vi if a sphere be placed within a cone so as to touch it in two points then shall the outside of the sphere and the inside of the cone mutually touch quite around and the line of contact will be a circle  demons let v be the vertex of the cone c the center of the sphere t one of the two points of contact and tv a side of the cone draw ct cv then tvc is a triangle rightangled at t prop   in like manner t being another point of contact and ct being drawn the triangle tvc will be rightangled at t these two triangles then tvc tvc having the two sides ct tv equal to the two ct tv prop   and the included angle t equal to the included angle t will be equal in all respects eucl i   and consequently have the angle tvc equal to the angle tvc  diagram  again let fall the perpendiculars tp tp then the two triangles tvp tvp having the two angles tvp and tpv equal to the two tvp and tpv and the side tv equal to the side tv prop   will be equal in all respects eucl i    consequently tp is equal to tp and up equal to up hence pt pt are radii of a little circle of the sphere whose plane is perpendicular to the line cv and its circumference every where equidistant from the point c or v this circle is therefore a circular section both of the sphere and of the cone and is therefore the line of their mutual contact also cv is the axis of the cone  corol   the axis of a cone when produced passes through the center of the inscribed sphere  corol   hence also every cone circumscribing a sphere so that their surfaces touch quite around is a right cone nor can any scalene or oblique cone touch a sphere in that manner  prop vii the two common sections of the surfaces of a sphere and a right cone are the circumferences of circles if the axis of the cone pass through the center of the sphere  demons let v be the vertex of the cone c the center of the sphere and s one point of the less or nearer section draw the lines cs cv then in the triangle csv the two sides cs cv and the included angle scv are constant for all positions of the side us and therefore the side us is of a constant length for all positions and is consequently the side of a right cone having a circular base therefore the locus of all the points s is the circumference of a circle perpendicular to the axis cv that is the common section of the surfaces of the sphere and cone is that circumference  diagram  in the same manner it is proved that if a be any point in the farther or greater section and ca be drawn then va is constant for all positions and therefore as before is the side of a cone cut off by a circular section whose plane is perpendicular to the axis  and these circles being both perpendicular to the axis are parallel to each other or they are parallel because they are both circular sections of the cone  corol   hence sa  sa because va  va and us  us  corol   all the intercepted equal parts sa sa etc are equally distant from the center for all the sides of the triangle sca are constant and therefore the perpendicular cp is constant also and thus all the equal right lines or chords in a sphere are equally distant from the center  corol   the sections are not circles and therefore not in planes if the axis pass not through the center for then some of the points of section are farther from the vertex than others  prop viii of the two common sections of a sphere and an oblique cone if the one be a circle the other will be a circle also  demons let saas and asva be sections of the sphere and cone made by a common plane passing through the axes of the cone and the sphere also ss aa the diameters of the two sections now by the supposition one of these as aa is the diameter of a circle but the angle vss  the angle vaa eucl i    and iii    therefore ss cuts the cone in subcontrary position to aa and consequently if a plane pass through ss and perpendicular to the plane ava its section with the oblique cone will be a circle whose diameter is the line ss apol i   but the section of the same plane and the sphere is also a circle whose diameter is the same line ss theod i   consequently the circumference of the same circle whose diameter is ss is in the surface both of the cone and sphere and therefore that circle is the common section of the cone and sphere  diagram  in like manner if the one section be a circle whose diameter is sa the other section will be a circle whose diameter is sa  corol   hence if the one section be not a circle neither of them is a circle and consequently they are not in planes for the section of a sphere by a plane is a circle  corol   when the sections of a sphere and oblique cone are circles the axis of the cone does not pass through the center of the sphere except when one of the sections is a great circle or passes through the center for the axis passes through the center of the base but not perpendicularly whereas a line drawn from the center of the sphere to the center of the base is perpendicular to the base by cor to prop    corol   hence if the inside of a bowl which is a hemisphere or any segment of the sphere be viewed by an eye not situated in the axis produced which is perpendicular to the section or brim the lower or extreme part of the internal surface which is visible will be bounded by a circle of the sphere and the part of the surface seen by the eye will be included between the said circle and the border or brim which it intersects in two points for the eye is in the place of the vertex of the cone and the rays from the eye to the brim of the bowl and thence continued from the nearer part of the brim to the opposite internal surface form the sides of the cone which by the proposition will form a circular arc on the said internal surface because the brim which is the one section is a circle  and hence the place of the eye being given the quantity of internal surface that can be seen may be easily determined for the distance and height of the eye with respect to the brim will give the greatest distance of the section below the brim together with its magnitude and inclination to the plane of the brim which being known common menfuration furnishes us with the measure of the surface included between them thus if ab be the diameter in the vertical plane passing through the eye at e also afb the

every point in the circumference of a circle lines be drawn to a given point e out of the plane of the circle so that the rectangle contained under the parts between the point e and the circle and between the same point e and some other point f may always be of a certain given magnitude then the locus of all the points f will also be a circle cutting the former circle in the two points where the lines drawn from the given point e to the several points in the circumference of the first circle change from the unequal to the concave side of the circumference and the constant quantity to which the rectangle of the parts is always equal is equal to the square of the line drawn from the given point e to either of the said two points of intersection  and thus the loci of the extremes of all such lines are circles  prop ix prob to place a given sphere and a given oblique cone in such positions that their mutual sections shall be circles  let v be the vertex vb the least side and vd

the substance of the above propositions was drawn up several years ago and mr bonnycastle and mr george sanderson have this day shown me the solution of a question in the london magazine for april      in which a similar section of a sphere with a cone is proved to be a circle and which i had never seen before nor do i know of any other writings on the same subject  july         tract viii of the geometrical division of circles and ellipses into any number of parts and in any proposed ratios art   in the year      was published a pamphlet in octavo with this title a dissertation on the geometrical analysis of the ancients with a collection of theorems and problems without solutions for the exercise of young students this pamphlet was anonymous it was however well known to myself and several other persons that the author of it was the late mr john lawson b d rector of swanscombe in kent an ingenious and learned geometrician and what is still more estimable a most worthy and good man one in whose heart was found no guile and whose pure integrity joined to the most amiable simplicity of manners and sweetness of temper gained him the affection and respect of all who had the happiness to be acquainted with him his collection of problems in that pamphlet concluded with this singular one to divide a circle into any number of parts which shall be as well equal in area as in circumference  n b this may seem a paradox however it may be effected in a manner strictly geometrical the solution of this seeming paradox he reserved to himself as far as i know i fell upon the discovery however soon after and other persons might do the same my resolution of it was published in an account which i gave of the pamphlet in the critical review for      vol xl and which the author informed me was on the same principle as his own this account is in page    of that volume and in the following words    we have no doubt but that our mathematical readers will agree with us in allowing the truth of the authors remark concerning the seeming paradox of this problem because there is no geometrical method of dividing the circumference of a circle into any proposed number of parts taken at pleasure and it does not readily appear that there can be any othermethod of resolving the problem than by drawing radii to the points of equal division in the circumference however another method there is and that strictly geometrical which is as follows  divide the diameter ab of the given circle into as many equal parts as the circle itself is to be divided into at the points c d e etc then on the diameters ac ad ae etc as also on be bd bc etc describe semicircles as in the annexed figure and they will divide the whole circle as required  diagram  for the several diameters being in arithmetical progression of which the common difference is equal to the least of them and the diameters of circles being as their circumferences these will also be in arithmetical progression but in such a progression the sum of the extremes is equal to the sum of each two terms equally distant from them therefore the sum of the circumferences on ac and cb is equal to the sum of those on ad and db and of those on ae and eb etc and each sum equal to the semicircumference of the given circle on the diameter ab therefore all the parts have equal perimeters and each is equal to the circumference of the proposed circle which satisfies one of the conditions in the problem  again the same diameters being as the numbers         etc and the areas of circles being as the squares of their diameters the semicircles will be as the numbers          etc and consequently the differences between all the adjacent semicircles are as the terms of the arithmetical progression         etc and here again the sums of the extremes and of every two equidistant means make up the several equal parts of the circle which is the other condition    but this subject admits of a more geometrical form and is capable of being rendered very general and extensive and is moreover very fruitful in curious consequences for first in whatever ratio the whole diameter is divided whether into equal or unequal parts and whatever be the number of the parts the perimeters of the spaces will still be equal for since circumferences of circles are always as their diameters and because ab and ad  db and ac  cb are all equal therefore the semicircumferences c and b  d and a  e are all equal and constant whatever be the ratio of the parts ad dc cb of the diameter we shall presently find too that the spaces tv rs and pq will be universally as the same parts ad dc cb of the diameter  diagram    the semicircles having been described as before mentioned erect ce perpendicular to ab and join be then i say the circle on the diameter be will be equal to the space pq for join ae now the space p  semicircle on ab  semicircle on ac but the semicir on ab  semicir on ae  semicir on be and the semicir on ac  semicir on ae  semicir on ce theref semic ab  semic ac  semic be  semicir ce that is the space p is  semic be  semicir ce to each of these add the space q or the semicircle on bc then p  q  semic be  semic ce  semic bc that is p  q  double the semic be or  the whole circle on be    in like manner the two spaces pq and rs together or the whole space pqrs is equal to the circle on the diameter bf and therefore the space rs alone is equal to the difference or the circle on bf minus the circle on be    but circles being as the squares of their diameters be  bf  and these again being as the parts or lines bc bd therefore the spaces pq pqrs rs tv are respectively as the lines bc bd cd ad and if bc be equal to cd then will pq be equal to rs as in the first or simplest case    hence to find a circle equal to the space rs where the points d and c are taken at random from either end of the diameter as a take ag equal to dc erect gh perpendicular to ab and join ah then the circle on ah will be equal to the space rs for the space pq the space rs bc cd or ag that is as be  ah  the squares of the diameters or as the circle on be to the circle on ah but the circle on be is equal to the space pq and therefore the circle on ah is equal to the space rs    hence to divide a circle in this manner into any number of parts that shall be in any ratios to one another divide the diameter into as many parts at the points d c etc and in the same ratios as those proposed then on the several distances of these points from the two ends a and b as diameters describe the alternate semicircles on the different sides of the whole diameter ab and they will divide the whole circle in the manner proposed that is the spaces tv rs pq will be as the lines ad dc cb    but these properties are not confined to the circle alone but are to be found also in the ellipse as the genus of which the circle is only a species for if the annexed figure be an ellipse described on the axis ab the area of which is in like manner divided by similar semiellipses described on ad ac bc bd as axes all the semiperimeters f ae bd c will be equal to one another for the same reason as before in art   namely because the peripheries of ellipses are as their diameters and the same property would still hold good if ab were any other diameter of the ellipse instead of the axis describing upon the parts of it semiellipses which shall be similar to those into which the diameter ab divides the given ellipse  diagram   0 and if a circle be described about the ellipse on the diameter ab and lines be drawn similar to those in the second figure then by a process the very same as in art   et seq substituting only semiellipse for semicircle it is found that the space pq is equal to the similar ellipse on the diameter be pqrs is equal to the similar ellipse on the diameter bf rs is equal to the similar ellipse on the diameter ah or to the difference of the ellipses on bf and be also the elliptic spaces pq pqrs rs tv are respectively as the lines bc bd dc ad the same ratio as the circular spaces and hence an ellipse is divided into any number of parts in any assigned ratios in the same manner as the circle is divided namely dividing the axis or any diameter in the same manner and on the parts describing similar semiellipses  tract ix new experiments in artillery for determining the force of fired gunpowder the initial velocity of cannon balls the ranges of pieces of cannon at different elevations the resistance of the air to projectiles the effect of different lengths of cannon and of different quantities of powder etc etc sect   at woolwich in the year      in conjunction with some able officers of the royal regiment of artillery and other ingenious gentlemen i first instituted a course of experiments on fired gunpowder and cannon balls my account of them was presented to the royal society who honored it with the gift of the annual gold medal and printed it in the philosophical transactions for the year      the object of those experiments was the determination of the actual velocities with which balls are impelled from given pieces of cannon when fired with given charges of powder they were made according to the method invented by the very ingenious mr robins and described in his treatise on the new principles of gunnery of which an account was printed in the philosophical transactions for the year      before the discoveries and inventions of that gentleman very little progress had been made in the true theory of military projectiles his book however contained such important discoveries that it was soon translated into several of the languages on the continent and the late samous mr l euler honored it with a very learned and extensive commentary in his translation of it into the german language that part of mr robinss book has always been much admired which relates to the experimental method of ascertaining the actual velocities of shot and in imitation of which but on a large scale those experiments were made which were described in my paper experiments in the manner of mr robins were generally repeated by his commentators and others with universal satisfaction the method being so just in theory so simple in practice and altogether so ingenious that it immediately gave the fullest conviction of its excellence and the eminent abilities of the inventor the use which our author made of his invention was to obtain the real velocities of bullets experimentally that he might compare them with those which he had computed a priori from a new theory of gunnery which he had invented in order to verify the principles on which it was founded the success was fully answerable to his expectations and left no doubt of the truth of his theory at least when applied to such pieces and bullets as he had used these however were but small being only musket balls of about an ounce weight for on account of the great size of the machinery necessary for such experiments mr robins and other ingenious gentlemen have not ventured to extend their practice beyond bullets of that kind but contented themselves with ardently wishing for experiments to be made in a similar manner with balls of a larger sort by the experiments described in my paper therefore i endeavored in some degree to supply that defect having used cannon balls of above twenty times the size or from one pound to near three pounds weight those are the only experiments that i know of which have been made in that way with cannon balls although the conclusions to be deduced from such a course are of the greatest importance in those parts of natural philosophy which are connected with the effects of fired gunpowder nor do i know of any other practical method besides that above of ascertaining the initial velocities of military projectiles within any tolerable degree of the truth except that of the recoil of the gun hung on an axis in the same manner as the pendulum which was also first pointed out and used by mr robins and which has lately been practiced also by benjamin thompson esquire in his very ingenious and accurate set of experiments with musket balls described in his paper in the philosophical transactions for the year      the knowledge of this velocity is of the greatest consequence in gunnery by means of it together with the law of the resistance of the medium every thing is determinable which relates to that business for as i remarked in the paper abovementioned on my first experiments it gives us the law relative to the different quantities of powder to the different weights of balls and to the different lengths and sizes of guns and it is also an excellent method of trying the strength of different sorts of powder beside these there does not seem to be any thing wanting to answer every inquiry that can be made concerning the flight and ranges of shot except the effects arising from the resistance of the medium    in that course of experiments were compared the effects of different quantities of powder from two to eight ounces the effects of different weights of shot and the effects of different sizes of shot or different degrees of windage which is the difference between the diameter of the shot and the diameter of the bore all of which were found to observe certain regular and constant laws as far as the experiments were carried and at the end of each days experiments the deductions and conclusions were made and the reasons clearly pointed out why some cases of velocity differ from others as they properly and regularly ought to do so that i am surprised how they could be misunderstood by mr templehof captain in the prussian artillery when speaking of the irregularities in such experiments he says page     of le bombardier prussien printed at berlin      la meme chose arriva a mr hutton il la trouva de     pieds and le jour suivant de     pieds tout les circonstances etant dailleurs egales which last words show that mr t had either misunderstood or had not read the reason which is a very sufficient one for this remarkable difference it is expressly remarked in page    of my paper in the philosophical transactions that all the circumstances were not the same but that the one ball was much smaller than the other and that it had the less degree of velocity     feet because of the greater loss of the elastic fluid by the windage in the case of the smaller ball on the contrary the velocities in those experiments were even more uniform and similar thancould be expected in such large machinery and in a first attempt of the kind too and from the whole the following important conclusions were fairly drawn and stated viz    and first it is made evident by these experiments that powder fires almost instantaneously seeing that almost the whole of the charge fires though the time be much diminished    the velocities communicated to shot of the same weight with different quantities of powder are nearly in the subduplicate ratio of those quantities a very small variation in defect taking place when the quantities of powder become great    and when shot of different weights are fired with the same quantity of powder the velocities communicated to them are nearly in the reciprocal subduplicate ratio of their weights    so that universally shot which are of different weights and impelled by the firing of different quantities of powder acquire velocities which are directly as the square roots of the quantities of powder and inversely as the square roots of the weights of the shot nearly    it would therefore be a great improvement in artillery to make use of shot of a long form or of heavier matter for thus the momentum of a shot when fired with the same weight of powder would be increased in the ratio of the square root of the weight of the shot    it would also be an improvement to diminish the windage for by so doing one third or more of the quantity of powder might be saved    when the improvements mentioned in the last two articles are considered as both taking place it is evident that about half the quantity of powder might be saved which is a very considerable object but important as this saving may be it seems to be still exceeded by that of the guns for thus a small gun may be made to have the effect and execution of one of two or three times its size in the present way by discharging a long shot of two or three times the weight of its natural ball or round shot and thus a small ship might discharge shot as heavy as those of the greatest now made use of  finally as the above experiments exhibit the regulations with regard to the weight of powder and balls when fired from the same piece of ordnance so by making similar experiments with a gun varied in its length by cutting off from it a certain part before each course of experiments the effects and general rules for the different lengths of guns may be certainly determined by them in short the principles on which these experiments were made are so fruitful in consequences that in conjunction with the effects of the resistance of the medium they seem to be sufficient for answering all the inquiries of the speculative philosopher as well as those of the practical artillerist    such then was the state of the first set of experiments with cannon balls in the year      and such were the probable advantages to be derived from them i do not however know that any use has hitherto been made of them by authority for the public service unless perhaps we are to except the instance of carronades a species of ordnance which has since been invented and in some degree adopted in the public service for in this instance the proprietors of those pieces by availing themselves of the circumstances of large balls and very small windage with small charges of powder have been able to produce very considerable and useful effects with those light pieces at a very small expense or perhaps those experiments were too much limited and of too private a nature to merit a more general notice be that however as it may the present additional course which is to make the subject of this tract will have very great advantages over the former both in point of extent variety improvements in machinery and in authority his grace the duke of richmond the present mastergeneral of the ordnance in his indefatigable endeavors for the good of the public service was pleased to order this extensive course of experiments and to give directions for providing guns and machinery and every thing complete and fitting for the proper execution of them    this course of experiments has been carried on under the direction of major blomefield inspector of artillery an officer of great professional merit and whose ingenious contrivances in the machinery do him great credit it has been our employment for three successive summers namely those of the years           and      and indeed it might be continued still much longer either by extending it to more objects or to more repetitions of experiments for the same object    the objects of this course have been various but the principal articles of it as follows   the velocities with which balls are projected by equal charges of powder from pieces of the same weight and calibre but of different lengths   the velocities with different charges of powder the weight and length of the gun being the same   the greatest velocity due to the different lengths of guns to be obtained by increasing the charge as far as the resistance of the piece is capable of sustaining   the effect of varying the weight of the piece every thing else being the same   the penetration of balls into blocks of wood   the ranges and times of flight of balls to compare them with their initial velocities for determining the resistance of the medium   the effect of wads of different degrees of ramming or compressing the charge of different degrees of windage of different positions of the vent of chambers and trunnions and every other circumstance necessary to be known for the improvement of artillery   of the nature of the experiment and of the machinery used in it   the effects of most of the circumstances last mentioned are determined by the actual velocity with which the ball is projected from the mouth of the piece therefore the primary object of the experiments is to discover that velocity in all cases and especially in such as usually occur in the common practice of artillery this velocity is very great from one thousand to two thousand feet or more in a second of time for conveniently estimating so great a velocity the first thing necessary is to reduce it in some known proportion to a small one which we may conceive to be effected in this manner suppose the ball projected with a great velocity to strike some very heavy body such as a large block of wood from which it will not rebound so that after the stroke they may both proceed forward together with a common velocity by this means it is obvious that the original velocity of the ball may be reduced in any proportion or to any slow velocity which may conveniently be measured by making the body struck to be sufficiently large for it is well known that the common velocity with which the ball and the block of wood would move on together after the stroke bears to the original velocity of the ball before the stroke the same ratio which the weight of the ball has to that of the ball and block together thus then velocities of one thousand feet in a second are easily reduced to those of two or three feet only which small velocity being measured by any convenient means let the number denoting it be increased in the ratio of the weight of the ball to the weight of the ball and block together and the original velocity of the ball itself will thereby be obtained    now this reduced velocity is rendered easy to be measured by a very simple and curious contrivance of mr robins which is this the block of wood which is struck by the ball instead of being left at liberty to move straight forward in the direction of the motion of the ball is suspended like the weight of the vibrating pendulum of a clock by a strong iron stem having a horizontal axis at the top on the ends of which it vibrates freely when struck by the ball the consequence of this simple contrivance is evident this large ballistic pendulum after being struck by the ball will be penetrated by it to a small depth and it will then swing round its axis describing an arch which will be greater or less according to the force of the blow struck and from the magnitude of the arch described by the vibrating pendulum the velocity of any point of the pendulum can be easily computed for a body acquires the same velocity by falling from the same height whether it descend perpendicularly down or otherwise therefore having given the length of the arc described by the center of oscillation and its radius the versed sine becomes known which is the height perpendicularly descended by that point of the pendulum the height descended being thus known the velocity acquired in falling through that height becomes known also from the common rules for the descent of bodies by the force of gravity and the velocity of this center thus obtained is to be esteemed the velocity of the whole pendulum itself which being now given that of the ball before the stroke becomes known from the given weights of the ball and pendulum thus then the determination of the very great velocity of the ball is reduced to the mensuration of the magnitude of the arch described by the pendulum in consequence of the blow struck    now this arch may be determined in various ways in the following experiments it was ascertained by measuring the length of its chord which is the most useful line about it for making the calculation by and this chord was measured sometimes by means of a piece of tape or narrow ribbon the one end of which was fastened to the bottom of the pendulum and the rest of it made to slide through a small machine contrived for the purpose and sometimes it was measured by the trace of the fine point of a stylette in the bottom of the pendulum made in an arch concentric with the axis and covered with a composition of a proper consistence which will be particularly described hereafter    another similar method of measuring the great velocity of the ball is by observing the arch of recoil of the gun when it is hung also after the manner of a pendulum for by loading the gun with adventitious weight it may be made so heavy as to swing any convenient extent of arch we please which arch it is evident will be greater or less according to the velocity of the ball or force of the inslamed powder since action and reaction are equal and contrary that is the velocity of the ball will be greater than the velocity of the center of oscillation of the gun in the same proportion as the weight of the gun exceeds the weight of the ball and therefore if the velocity of the center of oscillation of the gun be computed from the chord of the arc described by it in the recoil the velocity of the ball will be found by this proportion namely as the weight of the ball is to the weight of the gun so is the velocity of the gun to the velocity of the ball that is if the weight of powder had no effect on the recoil   0 this description may suffice to convey a general idea of the nature and principles of the experiment for determining the velocity with which a ball is projected by any charge of powder from a piece of ordnance but it is to be observed that besides the center of oscillation and the weights of the ball and pendulum or gun the effect of the blow depends also on the place of the center of gravity in the pendulum or gun and that of the point struck or the place where the force is exerted for it is evident that the arch of vibration will be greater or less according to the situation of these two points also it will therefore be necessary now to give a more particular description of the machinery and of the methods of finding the aforesaid requisites and then we shall investigate our general rules for determining the velocity of the ball in all cases from them and the chord of the arch of vibration either of the pendulum or gun  of the guns powder balls and machinery employed in these experiments    five very fine brass onepounder guns were cast and prepared in woolwich warren for these experiments and bored as true as possible the common diameter of their bore being   inches and   00 parts of an inch these five guns are exactly represented in plate   with the scale of their dimensions by which they were drawn three of these namely no       are nearly of the same weight but of the respective lengths of     0 and  0 calibers in order to ascertain the effect of different lengths of bore with the same weight of gun powder and ball the other two no   and   were heavier and of  0 calibers in length to obtain the effects of the longest pieces no   was more expressly to show the effect of different lengths of the same gun and for this purpose it was to be fired a sufficient number of rounds with its whole length and then to be successively diminished by sawing off it   or    inches at a time till it should be all cut away firing a number of rounds with it at each length and for the convenience of suspending this gun near its center of gravity for all the different lengths of it a long thin slip was cast with it extending along the under side of it from the breech to almost the middle of its length by perforating this slip through with holes immediately under the center of gravity for each length after being cut a bolt was to pass through the hole on which the gun might be suspended the other guns were slung by their trunnions  the exact weight and dimensions of all these guns are exhibited in the following table  length of the diameter at the diam of the bore weight no of the gun piece in bore in breech muzzle calib inch calib inch inch inch

were to be slung by their trunnions to observe the relation between the velocity of the ball and the arch of recoil described by the gun vibrating on an axis certain leaden weights were cast to fit on very exactly about the trunnions of the gun to render it so heavy as that the arch of recoil might not be inconveniently great these consisted first of central pieces to fit the trunnions and then over them cylindrical rings of different sizes both turned to fit exactly the whole being held firmly together by iron bolts put into holes bored through all the pieces these were also of different sizes so as to bring all the guns exactly up to the same weight the whole weight of each together with     lb weight of iron about the stem and machine by which the gun was slung was     lb with which weight most of the experiments were made notice being always taken when any alteration was made in the weights as well as in the other circumstances the common weight of     lb is made up of the different guns and leads and the common weight of iron as below no guns leads iron total     0                         0                                                        0                 these were the weights at first but soon after the braces or strengthening rods of the gun frame were made longer and thicker which added    lb to their weights and then the whole weight of each was     lb     in these experiments the velocity of the ball by which the force of the powder is determined was to be measured both by the ballistic pendulum into which the ball was fired and by the arch of recoil of the gun which was hung on an axis by an iron stem after the same manner as the pendulum itself and the arcs vibrated in both cases measured in the same way plates    and     contain general representations of the machinery of both namely a side view and a front view of each as they hung by their stem and axis on the wooden supports in plate    fig   is the sideview of the pendulum and fig   the sideview of the gun as slung in their frames and in plate     fig   and   are the frontviews of the same     in fig   of both plates a is the pendulous block of wood into which the balls are fired strongly bound with thick bars of iron and hung by a strong iron stem which is connected by an axis at top the whole being firmly braced together by crossing diagonal rods of iron the cylindrical ends of the axis both in the gun and pendulum were at first placed to turn upon smooth flat plateiron surfaces having perpendicular pins put in before and behind the sides of the axis to keep it in its place and prevent it from slipping backwards and forwards but this method being attended with too much friction the ends of the axis were supported and made to roll upon curved pieces having the convexity upwards and the pins before and behind the axis set so as not quite to touch it which left a small degree of play to the axis and made the friction less than before but still farther to diminish the friction the lower side of the ends of the axis was sharpened off a little something like the axis of a scale beam and made to turn in hollow grooves which were rounded down at both ends and standing higher in the middle like the curvature of a bent cylinder by which means the edge of the axis touched the grooves not in a line but in one point only when it vibrated with very great freedom having an almost imperceptible degree of friction the several times and occasions when these and other improvements were introduced and used will be more particularly noticed in the journal of the experiments     at first the chord of the arc of vibration and recoil was measured by means of a prepared narrow tape divided into inches and tenths as before a new contrivance of machinery was however made for it from the bottom of the pendulum or gunframe proceeded a tongue of iron which was raised or lowered by means of a screw at b this was cloven at the bottom c to receive the end of the tape and the lips then pinched together by a screw which held the tape fast immediately below this the tape was passed between two slips of iron which could be brought to any degree of nearness by two screws these pieces were made to slide vertically up and down a groove in a heavy block of wood and fixed at any height by a screw d one of these latter pieces was extended out a considerable length to prevent the tape from getting over its ends and entangling in the returns of the vibrations the extent of tape drawn out in a vibration it is evident is the chord of the arc described and counted in inches and tenths to the radius measured from the middle of the axis to the bottom of the tongue     this method however was found to be attended with much trouble and many inconveniences as well as doubts and uncertainty sometimes for which reasons we afterward changed this method of measuring the chord of vibration for another which answered much better in every respect this consisted in a block of wood having its upper surface of formed into a circular arc whose center was in the middle of the axis and consequently its radius equal to the length from the axis to the upper surface of the block in the middle of this arch was made a shallow groove of   or   inches broad running along the middle through the whole length of the arch this groove was filled with a composition of softsoap and wax of about the consistence of honey or a little firmer and its upper side smoothed off even with the general surface of the broad arch a sharp spear or stylette then proceeded from the bottom of the pendulum or gunframe and so low as just to enter and scratch along the surface of the composition in the groove without having any sensible effect in retarding the motion of the body the trace remaining the extent of it could easily be measured this measurement was effected in the following manner  a line of chords was laid down upon the upper surface of the wooden arch on each side of the groove and the divisions marked with lines on a ground of white paint the edge of a straight ruler being then laid across by the corresponding divisions just to touch the farthest extent of the trace in the composition gave the length of the chord as marked on the arch to make the computations by the rule for the velocity easier the divisions on the chords were made exact thousandth parts of the radius which saved the trouble of dividing by the radius at every operation the manner in which i constructed this line of chords on the face of the arch was this the radius was made just  0 feet i therefore prepared a smooth and straight deal rod upon which i set off  0 feet i then divided each foot into  0 equal parts and each of these into  0 parts again by which means the whole rod or radius was divided into  000 equal parts being  00th parts of a foot i then transferred the divisions of the rod to the face of the arch in this manner namely the first division of the rod was applied to the side of the arch at the beginning of it and made to turn round there as a center then in that position the rod when turned vertically round that point always touched the side of the arch and the divisions of it were marked on the edge of the arch successively as they came into a coincidence with it     in fig   plate    g shows the leaden weights placed about the trunnions h a screw for raising or depressing the breech of the gun by means of the piece   embracing the cascable and moveable along the perpendicular arm kl to suit the different lengths of guns and held to it by a screw passing through the slit made along it  the machines and operations for finding the ranges will be described hereafter  of the centers of gravity and oscillation    it being necessary to know the position of the centers of gravity and oscillation without which the velocity cannot be computed these were commonly determined every day as follows  the center of gravity was found by one or both of these two methods first a triangular prism of iron ab being placed on the ground with one edge upwards the pendulum or gunframe was laid across it and moved backward or forward on the stem or block as the case required till the two parts exactly balanced each other in a horizontal position then as it lay the distance was measured from the middle of the axis to the part which rested on the edge of the prism or the place of the center of gravity which is the distance g of that center below the axis  diagram     the other method is this the ends of the axis being supported on fixed uprights and a chord fastened to the lower end of the block or of the gun frame and passed over a pulley at p different weights w were fastened to the other end of it till the body was brought to a horizontal position then taking also the whole weight of the body and its length from the axis to the bottom where the chord was fixed the place of the center of gravity is found by this proportion as p the weight of the pendulum is to w the appended weight so is d the whole length from the axis to the chord to dw  p the distance from the axis to the center of gravity either of these two methods gave the place of the center of gravity sufficiently exact but the agreement of the results of both of them was still more satisfactory   0 to find the center of oscillation the ballistic pendulum or the gun was hung up by its axis in its place and then made to vibrate in small arcs for   minute or   or   or  0 minutes the more the better as determined either by a half second pendulum or a stop watch or a peculiar timepiece measuring the time to  0th parts of a second and the number of vibrations performed in that time carefully counted having thus obtained the time answering to a certain number of vibrations the center of oscillation is easily found for if n denote the number of vibrations made in s seconds and l the length of the second pendulum then it is well known that n  s  l s l  n  the distance from the axis of motion to the center of oscillation and here if s be  0 seconds or one minute and n the number of vibrations performed in   minute as found by dividing the whole number of vibrations actually performed by the whole number of minutes then is n   0  l   00 l nn the distance to the center of oscillation but by the best observations on the vibration of pendulums it is found that l     inches is the length of the second pendulum for the latitude of london or of woolwich and therefore  or   0  0 nn  0 will be the distance in inches or         nn in feet of the center of oscillation below the axis and by this rule the place of that center was found for each day of the experiments  of the rule for computing the velocity of the ball    having described the methods of obtaining the necessary dimensions and weights i proceed now to the investigation of the theorem by which the velocity of the ball is to be computed and first by means of the pendulum  the several weights and measures being found let b denote the weight of the ball p the weight of the pendulum g the distance to its center of gravity o the distance to its center of oscillation i the distance to the point of impact or point struck c the chord of the arch described by the pendulum r its radius or distance to the tape or arch v the initial or original velocity of the ball  then from the nature of oscillatory motion bii will express the sum of the forces of the ball acting at the distance i from the axis and pgo the sum of the forces of the pendulum and consequently pgo  bii the sum for both the ball and pendulum together and if each be multiplied by its velocity biiv will be the quantity of motion of the ball and  pgo  bii x z the quantity for the pendulum and ball together where z is the velocity of the point of impact but these quantities of motion before and after the blow must be equal to each other therefore  pgo  bii x z  biiv and consequently z  biiv pgo bii is the velocity of the point of impact now because of the accession of the ball to the pendulum the place of the center of oscillation will be changed and the distance y of the new or compound center of oscillation will be found by dividing pgo  bii the sum of the forces by pg  by the sum of the momenta that is y  pgo bii pg by is the distance of the new or compound center of oscillation below the axis then because biiv pgo bii is the velocity of the point whose distance is i by similar figures we shall have this proportion as i pgo bii pg by or y biiv pgo bii biv pg by the velocity of this compound center of oscillation  again by the property of the circle   r c c cc  r which will be the versed sine of the described arc to the chord c and radius r and hence by similar figures r y or pgo bii pg by cc  r cc  rr x pgo bii pg by the corresponding versed sine to the radius y or the versed sine of the arc described by the compound center of oscillation which call v then because the velocity lost in ascending through the circular arc or gained in descending through the same is equal to the velocity acquired in descending freely by gravity through its versed sine or perpendicular height therefore the velocity of this center of oscillation will also be equal to the velocity generated by gravity in descending through the space v or cc  rr x pgo bii pg by but the space described by gravity in one second of time in the latitude of london is   0  feet and the velocity generated in that time      therefore by the nature of free descents   0  v            c r pgo bii pg by the velocity of the same center of oscillation as deduced from the chord of the arc which is actually described  having thus obtained two different expressions for the velocity of this center independent of each other let an equation be made of them and it will express the relation of the several quantities in the question thus then we have biv pg by        c r pgo bii pg by and from this equation we get  the true expression for the original velocity of the ball the moment before it strikes the pendulum and this theorem agrees with those of messrs euler and antoni and also with that of mr robins nearly for the same purpose when his rule is corrected by the paragraph which was by mistake omitted in his book when first published which correction he himself gave in a paper in the philosophical transactions for april      and where he informs us that all the velocities of balls mentioned in his book except the first only were computed by the corrected rule though the editor of his works published in      has inadvertently neglected this correction and printed his book without taking any notice of it and that remark had m euler observed it might have saved him the trouble of many of his animadversions on mr robinss work     but this theorem may be reduced to a form much more simple and fit for use and yet be sufficiently near the truth thus let the root of the compound factor  pgo  bii x  pg  by be extracted and it will be equal to  pg  by  o i 0 x 0 within the  00000th part of the true value in such cases as commonly happen in practice but since by  o i 0 in our experiments is usually but about the  00th or  00th or  00th part of pg and since by differs from by  o i 0 only by about the  00th part of itself therefore pg  by is within the  0000th part of pg  by  o i 0 consequently v        c  pg by bir o very nearly or farther if g be written for i in the last term by then finally v        gc  p b bir o which is an easy theorem to be used on all occasions and being within the  000th part of the true quantity it will always give the velocity true within less than half a foot even in the cases of the greatest velocity where it must be observed that c g i r may be taken in any measures either feet or inches etc provided they be but all of the same kind but o must be in feet because the theorem is adapted to feet     as the balls remain in the pendulum during the time of making one whole set of experiments both its weight and the position of the centers of gravity and oscillation will be changed by the addition of each ball which is lodged in the wood and therefore p g o must be corrected after every shot in the theorem for determining the velocity v now the succeeding value of p is always p  b or p is to be corrected by the continual addition of b and the succeeding value of g is  or g  i g p b nearly or g is corrected by adding always i g p b to the next preceding value of g and lastly o is to be corrected by taking for its new values successively  or by adding always  or i o p b nearly to the preceding value of o so that the three corrections are made by adding always b to the value of p i g p x b to the value of g i o p x b to the value of o that is when b is very small in respect of p     but as the distance of the center of oscillation o whose square root is concerned in the theorem for the velocity v is found from the number of vibrations n performed by the pendulum it will be better to substitute in that theorem the value of o in terms of n now by art  0 the value of o is        nn feet and consequently o   0      n which value of o being substituted for it in the theorem v        gc x p b bir o it becomes v        gc x p b birn or   000   x p b birn gc the simplest and easiest formula for the velocity of the ball in feet where c g i r may be taken in any one and the same measure either all inches or all feet or any other measure     it will be necessary here to add a correction for n instead of that for o in art    now the correction for o being  and the value of n       o inches the correction for n will be  by substituting the value of o instead of it which correction is negative or to be subtracted from the former value of n the corrections for p and g being b and  as in art    which are both additive but the signs of these quantities must be changed when b is negative     before we quit this rule it may be necessary here to advert to three or four circumstances which may seem to cause some small error in the initial velocity as determined by the formula in art    these are the friction on the axis the resistance of the air to the back of the pendulum the time which the ball employs in penetrating the wood of the pendulum and the resistance of the air to the ball in its passage between the gun and the pendulum  as to the first of these namely the friction on the axis by which the extent of its vibration is somewhat diminished it may be observed that the effect of this cause can never amount to a quantity considerable enough to be brought into account in our experiments for besides that care was taken to render this friction as small as possible the effect of the small part which does remain is nearly balanced by the effect it has on the number n of vibrations performed in a minute for the friction on the axis will a little retard its motion and cause its vibrations to be slower and sewer so that c the length of a vibration and n the number of vibrations being both diminished by this cause nearly in an equal degree and c being a multiplier and n a divisor in our formula it is evident that the effect of the friction in the one case operates against that in the other and that the difference of the two is the real disturbing cause and which therefore is either equal to nothing or very nearly so     the second cause of error is the resistance of the air against the back of the pendulum by which its motion is somewhat impeded this resistance hinders the pendulum from vibrating so far and describing so large an arch as it would do if there was no such resistance therefore the chord of the arc which is actually described and measured is less than it really ought to be and consequently the velocity of the ball which is proportional to that chord will be less than the real velocity of the ball at the moment it strikes the pendulum and although the pendulum be very heavy and its motion but slow and consequently the resistance of the air against it very small it will yet be proper to investigate the real effect of it that we may be sure whether it may safely be neglected or not  in order to this let the annexed figure represent the back of the pendulum moving on its axis and put p  weight of the pendulum a  de its breadth r  ab the distance to the bottom e  ac the distance to the top x  af any variable distance g  distance of the center of gravity o  distance of the center of oscillation v  velocity of the center of oscillation in any part of the vibration h    0  feet the descent of gravity in   second c  the chord of the arc actually described by the center of oscillation and c  the chord which would be described by it if the air had no resistance  diagram  then o x v vx o the velocity of the point f of the pendulum and   h  h v  x  o  v  x   ho  the height descended by gravity to generate the velocity vx o now the resistance of the air to the line dfe is equal to the pressure of a column of air upon it whose height is the same v  x   ho  and therefore that pressure or weight is nav  x   ho  where n is the specific gravity or weight of one cubic measure of air or n        0lb     lb hence then nav  x  x  ho  is the pressure on deed and nav  x  x  ho  the momentum of the pressure on the same de or the fluxion of the momentum on the block of the pendulum and the correct fluent gives  for the momentum of the air on the whole pendulum supposing that on the stem ac to be nothing as it is nearly both on account of its narrowness and the diminution of the momentum of the particles by their nearness to the axis put now a  the compound coefficient  so shall a v  denote the momentum of the air on the back of the pendulum  but the motion of the pendulum is also obstructed by its own weight as well as by the resistance of the air and that weight acts as if it were all concentered in the center of gravity whose distance below the axis is g therefore pg is its momentum in its natural or vertical direction and pgs its momentum perpendicular to the motion of the pendulum when s is the sine of the angle which it makes at any time with the vertical position to the radius   hence pgs  a v  is the momentum of both the resistances together namely that of the pressure of the air and of the weight of the pendulum and consequently pgsa v  pg  s  a  pg v  is the real retarding force to the motion of the pendulum at the center of oscillation which force call f  now if z denote the arc described by the center of oscillation when its velocity is v or z o the arc whose fine is s we shall have  and by the doctrine of forces   but cc  o is the versed sine or height of the whole arc whose chord is c and  is the versed sine or height of the part whose sine is os therefore  is their difference or the height of the remaining part and is nearly equal to the height due to the velocity v therefore  nearly then by substituting this for v  in the value of vv we have  and the fluents give  where q is a constant quantity by which the fluent is to be corrected now substituting v  for v  and o for s their corresponding values at the commencement of motion the above fluent becomes v     ho  q from which the former subtracted gives  and when v  o or the pendulum is at the full extent of its ascent then  at which point os is the sine of the whole arc whose chord is c and consequently   but the value of s being commonly small in respect of c o we shall have these following values nearly true namely   z  os  os  and   o  c   o  z  os   c  s  o    o  c    o s  which values by substitution give v     hc  o     h  oa  pq  c  s  o    o  c    o s   but c   o is the versed sine or height to the chord c and v     h  c   o    hc  o the square of the velocity due to that height therefore   hc  o    hc  o     h  oa  pq  c  s  o    o  c    o s  and c   c     hoa  pq  c  s     o  c    s  or c   c     ha  pq  c    c   o  and c  c    c  ha    pq nearly or substituting for a c  c  nac    pg  r  c  o   c    nac   pg  r  e  o  so that the chord of the arc which is actually described is to that which would be described if the air had no resistance as   is to    nac   pg  r  e  o  and therefore nac   pg  r  e  o  is the part of the chord and consequently of the velocity lost by means of the resistance of the air and the proportion is the same for the chords described by the lowest point or any other point of the pendulum     now to give an example in numbers of this effect of the resistance of the air the ordinary mean values of the literal quantities are as here below namely therefore p   00 nac     0  a  z r       pg    000 e    r      0 g    e        o    r   e        n      o        c    nac   pg  r  e  o         so that the part of the chord or velocity lost by this cause namely the resistance of the air on the back of the pendulum is but about the       or about the   000 part of the whole and therefore this effect scarcely ever amounts to so much as half a foot being indeed about of a foot when the velocity of the ball is  000 feet when it is  000 when it is   00 and so on in proportion to the whole velocity of the ball  and even this small effect may be supposed to be balanced by the method of determining the center of oscillation or the number of vibrations made in a second so that the number of oscillations and the chord of the arc described being both diminished by the resistance of the air and the one of these quantities being a multiplier and the other a divisor in the formula for the velocity the one of those small effects will nearly balance the other much in the same way as the effects of the first cause or the friction on the axis so that these effects may both of them be safely neglected as in no case amounting to any sensible quantity  in the beginning of this investigation it is supposed that the resistance of the medium is equal to the weight of a column of the medium whose base is the moving surface and its altitude equal to that from whence a heavy body must fall to acquire the velocity of that surface but some philosophers think the altitude should be only one half of that and consequently the pressure only one half which would render the resistance still less considerable but if the altitude and resistance were even double of that above found it might be still safely neglected     the third seeming cause of error in our rule is the time in which the ball communicates its motion to the pendulum or the time employed in the penetration the principle on which the rule is founded supposes the momentum of the ball to be communicated in an instant but this is not accurately the case because this force is communicated during the time in which the ball makes the penetration and although that time be evidently very small scarcely amounting to the  00th part of a second it will be proper to enquire what effect that circumstance may have on the truth of our theorem or on the velocity of the ball as computed by it  in order to this let the notation employed in art    be supposed here and let abc be a sideview of the pendulum moved out of the vertical position ad by the perpendicular blow of the ball against the point d or c also let x  dc the space moved by the point of impact c z  cb the depth penetrated by the ball v  velocity of the ball at b u  velocity of the point c of the pendulum and r  the uniform resisting force of the wood   diagram  then is r b the retarding force of the ball which is constant again as the motion of the pendulum arises from the resisting force r of the wood ri will be its momentum and as the sum of the forces in the pendulum was found to be  pgo the accelerating force of the point c will be rii pgo which force is constant also but in the action of forces that are constant the time t is equal to the velocity divided by the force and by   h or   x   0  feet and the space is equal to the square of the velocity divided by the force and by   h consequently t  pgou  hiir x  pgouu  hiir and t   bv    hr x  z   bvv    hr or by correc t  b  hr x  v  v x  z  b  hr x  v   v  the two values of the time t being equated we obtain pgou  bii v  v or pgou  biiv  biiv  and when v  u or the action of the ball on the pendulum ceases this equation becomes pgou  biiu  biiv and hence u  biiv pgo bii is the greatest velocity of the point c at the instant when the ball has penetrated to the greatest depth and ceases to urge the pendulum farther so that this velocity is the same whatever the resisting force of the wood is and therefore to whatever depth the ball penetrates and the same as if the wood were perfectly hard or the ball made no penetration at all and this velocity of the point of impact also agrees with that which was found in art    so that the velocity communicated to the point of impact is the same whether the impulse is made in an instant or in some small portion of time and hence in the usual case of a penetration because the block will have moved some small distance before it has attained its greatest velocity it might at first view seem as if it would swing or rise higher than when that velocity is communicated in an instant or when the pendulum is yet in its vertical position and so might describe a longer chord and show a greater velocity of the ball than it ought but on the other hand it must be considered that in the small part of its swing which the pendulum has made before the penetration is completed or has attained its greatest velocity just as much velocity will be lost by the opposing gravity or weight of the pendulum as if it had set out from the vertical position with the said greatest velocity and therefore the real velocity at that height will be the same in both cases hence then it may safely be concluded that the circumstance of the balls penetration causes no alteration in the velocity of it as computed by our formula and as it was before found that no sensible error is incurred by the two first circumstances namely the friction on the axis and the resistance of the air to the back of the pendulum we may be well assured that our formula brings out the true velocity with which the ball strikes the pendulum without any sensible error     since biiv pgo bii denotes the greatest velocity which the point c of the pendulum acquires by the stroke dividing by i we shall have biv pgo bii for the angular velocity of the pendulum or that of a radius   from which it appears that the vibration will be very small when i or the distance ad is small and also when i is very great and if we take this expression a maximum and make its fluxion  0 i only being variable we shall obtain pgo  bii and i  pgo b for the distance of the center of percussion or the point where the ball must strike so as to cause the greatest vibration in the pendulum which point in this case is neither the center of gravity nor the center of oscillation but will be at a great distance below the axis when p is great respect of b as in the case of our experiments in which p is  00 or  00 times b   0 it may not be improper here by the way to enquire a little into the time of the penetration its extent or depth and the measure of the resisting force of the wood  it was found above that x  pgouu  hiir and x  z  b  hr x  v   v  now substituting in these biiv pgo bii the greatest value of u for u and v we have   the latter of these being the greatest depth penetrated by the ball into the wood and the former the distance moved by the point c of the pendulum at the instant when the penetration is completed both of which it is evident are directly as the square of the original velocity of the ball and inversely as the resisting force of the wood the other quantities remaining constant  hence also it appears that other things remaining the penetration will be less as i is greater or as the point of impact is farther below the axis it is farther evident that the penetration will diminish as the sum of the forces pgo diminishes  now for an example in numbers a ball fired with a velocity of   00 feet per second has been found to penetrate about    inches into a block of sound dry elm when the dimensions of the pendulum were as below p    0 lb the ball being cast iron g     inches or   feet its diameter     inches o     inches or   feet and its weight       or      lb i   0 inches or   feet and the value of z is    inch or    feet  here the value of v is   00 and z     inches or    feet hence  nearly which is the value of r for a ball of that size and weight or the resistance in this instance is   000 times the force of gravity hence also  part of a foot or     part of an inch is the space moved by the point c of the pendulum when the penetration is completed  also  part of a second is the time of completing the penetration of    inches deep     upon the whole then it appears that our rule will give without sensible error the true velocity with which the ball strikes the pendulum but this is not however the same velocity with which the ball issues from the mouth of the gun which will indeed be something greater than the former on account of the resistance of the air which the ball passes through in its way from the gun to the pendulum and although this space of air be but small and although the elastic fluid of the powder pursue and urge the ball for some distance without the mouth of the piece and so in some degree counteract the resistance of the air yet it will be proper to enquire into the effect of this resistance as it will probably cause a difference between the velocity of the ball as computed from the vibration of the pendulum and the vibration of the gun which difference will by the bye be no bad way of measuring the resistance of the air especially if the gun be placed at a good distance from the pendulum for the vibration of the gun will measure the velocity with which the ball issues from the mouth of it and the vibration of the pendulum the velocity with which it is struck by the ball     to find therefore the resistance of the air against the ball in any case it is first to be considered that the resistance to a plane moving perpendicularly through a fluid at rest is equal to the weight or pressure of a column of the fluid whose altitude is the height through which the body must fall by the force of gravity to acquire the velocity with which it moves through the fluid the base of the column being equal to the plane so that if a denote the area of the plane v the velocity n the specific gravity of the fluid and h    0  feet the altitude due to the velocity v being vv  h the whole resistance or motive force m will be a x n x vv  h  anvv  h  now if d denote the diameter of the ball and k      then shall a  kd  be a great circle of the ball and consequently  the motive force on the surface of a circle equal to a great circle of the ball  but the resistance on the hemispherical surface of the ball is only one half of that on the flat circle of the same diameter therefore  is the motive force on the ball and if w denote its weight  will be equal to f the retarding force  since kd  is the magnitude of the sphere if n denote its density or specific gravity its weight w will be  kd  n consequently the retarding force f or m  w will be   but by the laws of forces vv    hfx    nvv  dn x and v w    n  dn x   ex where x is the space passed over putting e    n  dn and making the value negative because the velocity v is decreasing and the correct fluent of this is log v  log v or log v  w  ex where v is the first or greatest velocity of projection or if a be             etc the number whose hyperbolic logarithm is   then is v  v  aex and hence the velocity v  v  aex  vaex so that the first velocity is to the last velocity as aex to   and the velocity lost by the resistance of the medium is aex    v or aex aex v     now to adapt this to the case of our balls which weighed on a medium    ounces when the diameter was     inches we shall have      x      the magnitude of the ball and as   cubic foot or      cubic inches of water weighs  000 ounces therefore  is the specific gravity of the iron ball which is very justly something less than the usual specific gravity of solid cast iron on account of the small air bubble which is in all cast metal balls also the mean specific gravity of air is00   which is the value of n hence   now the common distance of the face of the pendulum from the trunnions of all the guns was    feet and the distance of the muzzles of the four guns was nearly    for the  st or shortest gun    for the  d    for the  d and    for the  th but as the elastic fluid pursues and urges the ball for a few feet after it is out of the gun it may be supposed to counterbalance the resistance of the air for a few feet the number of which cannot be certainly known and therefore we shall suppose    feet to be the common distance for each of the guns which the ball passes through before it reach the pendulum hence then the distance x     and consequently ex                  then aex    0  0       nearly that is the ball loses nearly the   d part of its last velocity or the   th part of its first velocity in passing from the gun to the pendulum by the resistance of the air or the velocity at the mouth of the gun is to the velocity at the pendulum as    to    so that the greater diminished by its   th part gives the less and the less increased by its   d part gives the greater but if the resistance to such swift velocities as ours be about three times as great as that above computed from the nature of perfect and infinitely compressed fluids as mr robins thinks he has found it to be then shall the velocity at the gun lose its   th part and the greater velocity will be to the less as    to    this however is a circumstance to be discovered from our experiments or otherwise  of the velocity of the ball as found from the recoil of the gun    it has been said by more than one writer on this subject that the effect of the inflamed power on the recoil of the gun is the same whether it be charged with a ball or fired by itself alone that is that the excess of the recoil when charged with a ball over the recoil when fired without a ball is exactly that which is due to the motion and resistance of the ball and this they say they have found from repeated experiments now supposing those experiments to be accurate and the deductions from them justly drawn yet as they have been made only with small balls and small charges of powder it may still be doubted whether the same law will hold good when applied to such cannon balls and large charges of powder as those used in our present experiments which is a circumstance that remains to be determined from the results of them and this determination will be easily made by comparing the velocity of the ball as computed from this law with that which is computed from the vibration of the ballistic pendulum for if the law hold good in such cases as these then the velocity of the ball as deduced from the vibration of the gun will exceed that which is deduced from the vibration of the pendulum by as much as the velocity is diminished by the resistance of the air between the gun and the pendulum     taking this for granted then in the mean time namely that the effect of the charge of powder on the recoil of the gun is the same either with or without a ball it will be proper here to investigate a formula for computing the velocity of the ball from the recoil of the gun now upon the foregoing principle if the chord of vibration be found for any charge without a ball and then for the same charge with a ball the difference of those chords will be equal to the chord which is due to the motion of the ball this follows from the property of a circle and a body descending along it namely that the velocity is always as the chord of the arc described in a semivibration  let then c denote this difference of the two chords that is c  the chord of arc due to the balls velocity g  weight of the gun and iron stem etc b  weight of the ball g  distance of center of gravity of g o  distance of its center of oscillation n  its no of oscillations per minute i  distance of the guns axis or point of impact r  radius of arc or chord c v  velocity of the ball v  velocity of the gun or of the axis of its bore  then because biiv is the sum of the momenta of the ball and ggov the sum of the momenta of the gun and because action and reaction are equal these two must be equal to each other that is biiv  g gov but because v is the velocity of the distance i therefore by similar figures i o v dv  i the velocity of the center of oscillation and because the velocity of this center is equal to the velocity generated by gravity in descending perpendicularly through the height or versed sine of the arc described by it and because   r c c cc  r  versed sine to radius r and r o cc  r cco  rr  verse sine to radius o therefore h cco  rr   h c r   ho the velocity of the center of oscillation as deduced from the chord c of the arc described where h    0  feet which velocity was before found  ov  i  therefore ov  i  c r   ho or ov  ci r   ho then this value of ov being substituted in the first equation biiv  g gov we have biiv  g gci r   ho and hence the velocity v  g gc bir   ho       g gc bir o being the formula by which the velocity of the ball will be found in terms of the distance of the center of oscillation and the other quantities which is exactly similar to the formula for the same velocity by means of the pendulum in art    using only g or the weight of the gun for p  b or the sum of the weights of the ball and pendulum  and if instead of o be substituted its value        nn or  0      n from art  0 it becomes v        x g gc birn or    000   x g gc birn the formula for the velocity of the ball in terms of the number of vibrations which the gun will make in one minute and the other quantities     farther as the quantities g g b i r n commonly remain the same the velocity will be directly as the chord c so that if we assume a case in which the chord shall be   and call its corresponding velocity u then shall v  cu or the velocity corresponding to any other chord c will be found by multiplying that chord c by the first velocity u answering to the chord    now by the following experiments the usual values of those literal quantities were as follows viz g      g   0   b   0   sometimes a little more or less i       r   000 n   00 for the gun no   but the  00th part more for no   and the  00th part less for no   and the  00th part less for no    then writing these values in the theorem instead of the letters it becomes v       c so that the number      multiplied by the difference between two chords described with any charge the one with and the other without a ball will give the velocity of the ball when the dimensions are as stated above and when the values of any of the letters vary from these it is but increasing or diminishing that product in the same proportion according as the letter belongs to the numerator or denominator in the general formula   000   x ggc birn when such variations happen they will be mentioned in each days experiments and farther when only the values of g g i n are as before specified the same formula will become       x c br  but note that these rules are adapted to the gun no   only therefore for no   we must subtract the  00th part and add the  00th part for no   and add the  00th part for no    of the experiments    we shall now proceed to state the circumstances of the experiments for each day separately as they happened by this means showing all the processes for each set of experiments with the failure or success of every trial and mode of operation and from which also any person may recompute all the results and otherwise combine and draw conclusions from them as occasion may require making but a very few cursory remarks on each days experiments to explain them when necessary and reserving the chief philosophical deductions to be drawn and stated together after the close of the experiments in a more connected and methodical way  the machinery having been made as perfect as the circumstances would permit  0 barrels of government powder were procured all by the best maker and numbered from   to  0 a great number of iron balls were also cast on purpose very round and their accidental asperities ground off they were a little varied in their size and weight but most of them almost equal to the diameter of the bore so as to have but little windage the powder was uniformly mixed and every day exactly weighed off by the same careful man and put up in very thin flannel bags of a size just to fit the bore of the gun a thread was tied round close by the powder after being shaken down and the flannel cut off close by the thread so as to leave as short a neck as possible to the bag the charge of powder was pushed gently down to the lower or breech end of the bore and the same quantity of powder always made to occupy nearly the same extent by means of the divisions of inches and tenths marked on the ramrod the ball was then put in without using any wads and set close to the charge of powder and kept in its place by a fine thread crossed two or three times about it which by its friction gave it a hold of the sides of the bore as the windage was very small the gun was directed point blank or horizontal and perpendicular to the face of the pendulum block    feet distant from the trunnions and was well wiped and cleaned out after each discharge which was made by piercing the bottom of the charge through the vent and firing it by means of a small tube an account was kept of the barometer and thermometer placed within a house adjoining and shaded from the sun  the machinery having been all prepared and set up in a convenient place in woolwich warren major

as also the comparative strength of the different barrels of powder by firing several charges of it without balls or wads out of the  0 barrels of powder were selected the   which had been found to be most uniform and nearest alike by the different eprouvettes at purfleet which were no                 of which the first two only were tried this day as below the gun was the short one no   and weighed this day with leaden weights and iron stem  0  lb the distance of the tape by which the chord of its recoil was measured was not taken and it was probably a little more than the usual length

charges were in flannel bags except no    and    of    oz each for want of bags large enough provided to put it in each charge was rammed with two or three slight strokes a considerable quantity of the powder of no    was blown out unfired many of the grains were found on the ground and on the top of the pendulum block and many were found sticking in the face of it by the force of these striking it and by the blast of the powder or motion of the air the pendulum was observed visibly to vibrate a little but the measuring tape had not been put to it this was therefore now added to measure the vibration by and to try to what degree the pendulum would be affected by the explosion of the powder the   feet amusette was suspended and pointed opposite the center of the pendulum for the last   rounds the pendulum was accordingly observed to move with the   ounces but more with the    ounces as appears at the bottom of the last column of the table above the pendulum being thus much affected we were convinced of the necessity of making a paper screen to place between the gun and the pendulum which we accordingly did and used it in the whole course of experiments at least in the larger charges at the last charge which was    ounces of loose powder much sewer grains were blown out than with the like charge at no    with the short gun the recoil at no    is evidently less than it ought to be owing to the quantity of unfired powder that was blown out it is remarkable that the recoil of the two guns with the same charge both for   ounces and   ounces are nearly in the reciprocal ratio of the weights of the guns a small excess only over that proportion taking place in favor of the long gun as due to its superior length the recoils are each visibly in a higher proportion than the charges of powder for in the last four experiments the charges of          ounces are in the continued proportion of   to   which their recoils     0          are all in a higher ratio than that of   to   for dividing the  d by the  st the  d by the  d and the  th by the  d the three successive quotients are   0         which are all above the double ratio but approximating however toward it as the charge is increased and farther if we divide these quotients successively one by another the two new ratios or quotients will be nearly equal so that ranging those recoils in a column under each other and their two successive orders of ratios in the adjacent columns we shall have in one view the law which they observe as here below where they always tend to equality       0       0                      again if we take successive differences between the same recoils and between these differences and then between the second differences and so on thus              0                      the columns as well as the lines ascending obliquely from left to right have their numbers approaching and at length ending in the ratio of   to   the same as the quantities of powder   0 friday june         from    till   oclock the air moist with small rain at intervals  the gun no   was mounted and loaded with all the leaden weights it was charged with the following quantities of powder sometimes with a ball and sometimes without one as denoted by the cipher o in the columns of weight and diameter of ball the radius to the tape was  as these experiments were made only to discover if the leaden weights would render the gun sufficiently heavy that the recoil might not be too large with the high charges of powder and ball the pendulum block was removed to let the balls enter and lodge in the bank which was behind it  here again it appears that the recoils without balls are always in a greater ratio than the charges of powder it also appears that the recoils when balls are employed are nearly in the ratio of the quantities of powder when the charges are small but gradually decreasing more and more below that ratio as the charge of powder is increased and if we subtract each recoil without a ball from the corresponding recoil no powder balls rceoil sort with diameter with oz inches oz dr inches        0 0           0 0           0 0           0 0             0 0

that those differences increase as far as to the charge of   ounces and then decrease again  there must have been some mistake in the  0th round as the recoil which is      inches is greater than can well be expected with that charge of powder probably the tape had entangled and been drawn farther out in the return of the gun from the recoil     monday june         we went with the workmen and took the weight and dimensions of the several parts of the machinery both of the pendulum with its stem and of the guns with their frame or iron stem and the leaden weights to fit on about the

column of this table are the values of the letter g in the formula for the velocity by means of the recoil of the gun this letter may always be supposed to have the value  0   inches as the two last numbers of the column differ from it but0  only or about the   00 part of the whole inducing an error of only about half a foot in the velocity of the ball  the values of g in this last column of the table were computed in the following manner  suppose the centers of gravity of the stem gun and leads to be all reduced to the line of the stem at connecting the axis and center of the trunnions t in which they are situated very nearly diagram so that g be the center of gravity of the stem c be the center of gravity of the gun t be the center of gravity of the leads also the numbers on the right hand side of these points namely      and   0  and  0  are the measured distances below the axis at a and the numbers on the left hand side namely       0 and     are the weights of the bodies belonging to those centers of gravity then from the property of the center of gravity we shall have these operations  where d is the center of gravity of the bodies at the points c and t or of the gun and leads and e the center of gravity of the two bodies placed at the points g and d or of all the three bodies at the points g c t that is e is the compound center of gravity for both gun iron and leads in one mass and the some operation is to be repeated for the other guns     it may here be also remarked that the mean number of vibrations per minute for every gun weighing in all    lb taken among the actual vibrations of each day is for no   no   no   no    0   00         which number must be used as the true value of n in the formula for the velocity of the ball by means of the recoil of the gun the number of the guns vibrations was commonly tried every day and they were found to vary but little and among them all the numbers abovementioned are the arithmetical mediums    moreover the mean numbers for the pendulum among all the daily measurements of its weight center of gravity and oscillations per minute are thus weight g n   0lb      0   of the great number of these measures that were taken the variations among them would be sometimes in excess and sometimes in defect and therefore the above numbers which are the means among the whole as long as the iron work remains the same will probably be very near the truth and by using always these with proportional alterations in g and n for any alteration in the weight p the computations of the velocity of the ball will be made by a rule that is uniform and not subject at least to accidental single errors when the weight of the pendulum varies by the wood alone of the block or the straps about it the alteration is to be made at the center of the block which is exactly     inches below the axis that is in that case the value of i is     in the formula  or the correction for g and in  the correction of n but when the alteration of the weight p arises from the balls and plugs lodged in the same block then the value of i in those corrections is the medium among the distances of the point struck and when the iron work is altered the middle of the place altered gives the value of i in the same theorems  in these corrections too p denotes   0 g     n  0  and b the difference between   0 and any other given weight of the pendulum which value of b will be negative when this weight is below   0 otherwise positive so that p  b is always equal to this weight of pendulum  and if these values of p g n be substituted for them in those corrections they will become  or i    p b the correction for g and  the correction for n  and farther when i      the same become    b  0 b or        0 p the correction for g and b       b or          p   the correction for n as adapted to an alteration at the center of the pendulum  and in that case g          0 p is the new value of g and n              p   is the new value of n but those corrections will have contrary signs when b is negative as well as the second term in each of the denominators     monday june  0      from   a m to   p m the air clear dry

weight of the pendulum to complete the numbers for the values of p in the  th column and from these numbers the correspondent values of g and n in the next two columns are computed by their proper corrections in art    and    after which the velocities contained in the last column are computed by the formula in art    and the medium among all these velocities as well as that of the recoils of

which probably has occasioned the irregularities in the recoils of this day  the pendulum continued hanging still it is suspected that its vibrations are not to be strictly depended on with the high

experiments in      the experiments of         wednesday july    etc      in the course of last years operations we experienced several inconveniences from some parts of our apparatus which we determined to remedy if possible these regarded chiefly the timepieces the axes of vibration and the method of measuring by the tape for measuring the time of a certain number of vibrations we united the use of a second stop watch with a simple halfsecond pendulum made of a leaden bullet suspended by a silken thread which did not always agree together again the axes of the gun and pendulum frames were not found to be so devoid of friction as might be wished but above all the chief cause of dissatisfaction was the method of measuring the extent of the vibrations by means of the tape which was notwithstanding all possible care and precaution still subject to much irregularity by being wetted by rain or blown aside by the wind or otherwise entangled which rendered the measurements doubtful and irregular  the preceding part of this year therefore was employed in correcting these and other smaller imperfections in the apparatus to our timepieces we added a peculiar one which measures time to  0th parts of a second  next by a happy contrivance the friction of the axes was almost entirely taken off this was effected by means of sockets of a peculiar construction for the axes to work in first imagine the half of a short cylinder of   or   inches long cut lengthways through the axis and of a diameter a very little more than the ends of the axis that are intended to work in it if this were all it is evident that the axis in vibrating would touch this socket in one line only because their diameters were unequal next imagine the inside of this socket to be gradually ground down toward each end from nothing in the middle so that the inside resembled a tube having its two ends bent downwards and rising highest in the middle then it is evident that the axis will touch the socket in this one middle point only and farther the under sides of the axis itself were ground a little to bring the undermost line to an edge something like the pivots of a scale beam the consequence was that the friction was not sensible in a great number of vibrations and hereafter we commonly made the gun and pendulum vibrate for just  0 minutes and divided the counted number of vibrations by  0 for the mean number per minute  and for measuring the arcs of vibration more certainly and accurately we have constructed a strong wooden circular arch of about   feet in length cut out to a radius of just  0 feet this arch is divided into chords of equal parts each the  000th part of the radius or    00th parts of an inch as before described in art    this arch being placed  0 feet below and concentric with the axis and the groove in the middle of it filled with the soft composition of soap and wax the stylette or small sharp spear traces in the groove the extent of the vibration and the corresponding divisions on each side of the groove show the length of the chord vibrated and as these chords are in  000th parts of the radius the value of r in the theorem for the velocity of the ball will be  000 for all the following experiments and then that theorem will become v       x p b bin gc by the pendulum and v       x g gc bin by the recoil of the gun or v        x c  b or     x c  b by the gun no   when we substitute the values of g g i n specified in art    and farther when b   0   it is v     c  the apparatus having been prepared we employed the three days july    july    and august   in hanging it up and in weighing measuring and adjusting all the parts and trying them by firing a few rounds with powder only the   rounds fired on the first of those days of   ounces each with the gun no   weighing     lb gave    at the first round and at each of the other three    divisions on the measuring arc for the recoil of the gun     wednesday august

 we began this day with the weight of the gun and its iron frame only without any of the leaden weights then the one set of weights was put on at no  0 and the other at no    this was done to try the effects of different weights of gun on the velocity of the ball experimentally to correct a common error which had been adopted from time immemorial by professional men namely that heavier guns caeteris paribus give the greater velocities the erroneousness of which opinion is proved by the experiments of this and some of the following days and it is needless to prove a priori to scientific men that the difference in the effects cannot be rendered sensible by any measurements which we can make of the velocity  the pendulum was the block of last year with a new core and a facing of sheet lead its weight taken this morning was     lb  the plugs weighed   ounces to    inches on an average which proportion may always be used in future at least till another be mentioned  the  th no is doubtful and is omitted in the medium  the   th was with powder only like the first six and the   th was without ball having only a wad made of junk weighing  0z  0dr this made a small impression of about half an inch deep in the face of the pendulum and rebounded back and it struck the pendulum at more than   inches above the line of direction  note the center of the pendulum as before is at     inches below the axis and the value of i for the mean distance of the points struck is      by comparing together the first   rounds which are all with the same weight of gun we find that the mean proportion of the recoil with the different charges without balls is as follows   oz   oz   oz            the recoils being rather in a higher proportion than the charge of powder  if we compare the mean of the first   with   oz of powder and     lb weight of gun with the mean of july    with   oz of powder and     lb weight of gun we shall obtain as follows charge  0z  0z weight of gun     lb     lb recoil       so that in this instance the less charge gives a recoil in proportion to the greater charge a little above the direct ratio of the weight of powder and inverse ratio of the weight of the gun for that ratio or   x     to   x     is as    to     if we compare no   with the mean of july    which are both with   oz of powder they will stand thus weight of gun         recoil        which shows that in this instance the same charge gives more than double the recoil to half the weight of the gun  lastly if we compare the means of each pair of velocities with the several weights of gun we shall have as follows        0  mean with     lb with of gun   0    0  mean with     lb with of gun           mean with   0 lb with of gun           mean with   0 lb with of gun    0   0  mean

of ramming the charge of powder with the effect of wads placed in different positions sometimes the powder was only set up without being compressed and sometimes it was rammed with a different number of strokes and pushed with various degrees of force but no sensible difference was produced in the velocity the wads which were of   inches length firmly made of junk or ropeyarn and made large to be with difficulty pushed into the gun were diversely placed and varied in number being sometimes introduced between the powder and ball and sometimes over both but no effect was perceived from them on the velocity of the ball this being indifferently the same either with one wad or two or none at all the reason of which is probably because the balls had very little windage at the last two numbers two wads were used in most of the others only one weighing on an average about   oz   dr  when balls were used with the wads it was common for them both to enter the pendulum by the same hole but it is remarkable that when the wads were discharged without balls they commonly struck wide of the line of the gun by   or   inches and indifferently either too high or too low or to the right or left and sometimes they flew in pieces before they struck the block  the velocities of the ball in these experiments are not computed as the effects of the blow from the ball and the wad are compounded together and that in an unknown degree as the wad sometimes slies in pieces and sometimes not or strikes the pendulum with diverse degrees of force at different times and also sometimes the wads enter the pendulum and sometimes they rebound from it     tuesday august  0      from    till   the weather thick and cloudy no powder weight of vibration of point struck plugs values of veloc ball ball wad

this day was the effect of windage with low balls and the effect of wads both high and low ones the wads struck variously either above or below or with the ball the two wads in the last round were made of welltwisted twine and firmly bound they struck the pendulum very hard blows the other wads were of junk and did not strike so hard  here the balls being smaller and consequently the windage more the vibrations are much smaller although wads were used so that it seems the wads do not prevent the escape of the inflamed powder by the windage nor make any sensible alteration in the velocity of the ball  the velocities are not computed for the same reason as specified in the last days experiments     the pendulum block had not been altered since the last days experiments but the iron stays of the stem had been changed for others that are stronger and which weigh  0 lb more than the old ones did and this additional  0 lb of iron must be added to the weight of the pendulum and new theorems must be made out for determining the change in the center of gravity and the number of vibrations per minute now this rod of uniform thickness reached from the lower side of the axis to within    inches of the top of the block consequently its length was     inches and its middle point or center of gravity was at     inches below the middle of the axis of vibration and this number     will be the value of i in the theorem  for the place of the new center of gravity where the value of b is  0 which theorem gives g       0         for the center of gravity  and the same values of i and b substituted in the theorem  give n   0  0    0   for the number of oscillations  hence then in this new state of the pendulum the value of g is      and the value of n  0   corresponding to the value   0 of p or weight of the pendulum that is p g n   0       0   are the new radical corresponding values of p g n and these values being substituted in the two general theorems namely  and  they become  and  or  nearly which are the theorems to be used now and hereafter for the values of g and n and where the distance of the center of oscillation answering to the number  0   is     the value

when weighed at first on the   th of july seemingly with as much care as now was     lb to this add    lb weight of balls and plugs lodged in it and  0 lb of iron added on the  th of august and they make together     lb from this take    lb for the diminution of the leaden facing of the pendulum by the balls striking and piercing it and there will remain only     lb which the pendulum ought to weigh and which is   lb less than it is actually found to weigh i cannot imagine any cause to which this difference of weight may be attributed as it is contrary to the effect heretofore experienced the pendulum having always been found to lose in weight by hanging up unless it arise from the moisture imbibed by the block in the    days it was up and during all or the most part of which time it was very rainy weather and the pendulum hung uncovered and the probability of this will be heightened by considering that the block had lain by all the preceding winter and till after midsummer this year under cover in the carpenters shop a circumstance which would make it very dry and so render it apt to imbibe moisture from the continually foggy atmosphere and rain which have taken place ever since it was exposed this increase of weight then being   lb in the    days or nearly half a pound per day i have thought it safest to divide equally among all the days by adding half a pound for each day it hung up from the beginning of this year to the end of this days experiments  the object of this course was again to search out the maximum of the guns charge but it is not a good set of

of which were as follows weight of the pendulum      p theref to its center of gravity       g and its vibrations per minute  0 0  n  the new stayrods of the gunframe weigh    lb more than the old ones so that now lb the weight of iron in the frame is  0  weight of gun and iron together     weight of gun iron and leads      g  by this additional    lb weight of iron the values of g and n or the center of gravity and number of oscillations will be altered which will cause an alteration in our theorem v       x g gc bin by which the velocity of the ball is determined from the recoil of the gun in art    the values of those two letters were at art    and    found to be g   0   and n   00 for the gun no   but the former will now become something less and the latter something greater  now the old and new iron stayrods were nearly of equal thickness but the old rods extended only    inches and the new ones    inches below the axis the difference is    and the half difference or    added to the old length    gives    inches below the axis where the middle or center of gravity of the additional length is situated the weight of which part is    lb but the center of gravity was found to be  0   below the axis when the whole weight was     lb here the difference of the two distances or the distance between the two weights    and     being    inches and the sum of the weights     we shall have           0   the change of the distance of the center of gravity which being subtracted from  0   leaves     for the distance of the new compound center of gravity  also the correction of the value of n will be determined by the usual formula  in which b     i      n   00 p      and g   0   which values being used in that formula give 0  for the correction of n to which add  00 and we shall have  0  for the new value of n or number of oscillations per minute for the gun no   and consequently  0  for no   and  00 for no   and     for no   hence then the new values for the gun no   are thus g g n i r          0        000  then using these values of g g n i r in the formula v    000   x g gc birn abovementioned it becomes v   0    x c  b for the velocity by the recoil of the gun where b is the weight of the ball and c the difference between the chords of recoil with and without a ball  and when b   0   lb     oz    dr the same theorem is v     c for the gun no   and every

uniformly observable with the decrease of weight in the ball and that in a very considerable degree instead of increasing which it ought to do if the windage were the same or the balls had the same diameter and that in the reciprocal subduplicate ratio of the weight of the ball now that ratio is the ratio of    to    or of    to        therefore as                     the velocity the least ball would have had if its diameter had been equal to the heaviest but its velocity was actually no more than      and therefore the difference     or    of the whole or    of the experimented velocity is the velocity lost by the difference of windage although this difference was only   0 of an inch or   0 of the caliber which is no more than the usual windage allowed in service but the force or inflamed powder lost by the same cause will be    or a double part of the velocity because the velocity is as the square of the force or quantity of powder hence then in charges with   ounces of powder and a windage of   0 of the caliber    of the charge is lost or nearly a mean between and  and if the computation be made in like manner for the above charges of   ounces of powder it will be found that the part of the charge lost by the same windage will be in the case of   ounces     of the whole which is still more than the part though somewhat less than in the case of   ounces the reason of which is that the ball is sooner out of the gun with the   oz charge and so the fluid has less time to escape in     thursday september         to try the effect of firing the charge of

difference about    lb is for waste of the leaden facing and the rest    lb is probably by evaporation and as the time the pendulum has hung up is    days the rate of evaporation is about    of a

former years being not so regular as might be wished we have again undertaken to repeat some of them and to add still more to the stock already obtained that the mediums upon the whole may be tolerably exact the great number of repetitions counteracting the unavoidable small irregularities and deviations from the truth in experiments instituted upon so large a scale for this purpose we begin with the gun no   and use charges of   ounces of powder and have formed the resolution of firing every shot into a fresh and sound part of the block of wood and changing the block very frequently before it become too much battered that the penetration of the ball and the force of the blow may be obtained with the greater degree of accuracy  it is also proposed to procure some good ranges to compare them with the initial velocities made under the same circumstances from the comparison of which we may estimate the effects of the resistance of the air and so lay a foundation for a new theory of gunnery it is rather difficult to obtain with accuracy such long ranges as our initial velocities would produce being from   mile to   miles when the projection is made at an angle of    degrees for in such long ranges our small balls cannot be seen when they fall to the ground we were obliged therefore to have recourse to the water in which the fall of the ball can be much better perceived because the plunge of the ball in the water breaking the surface and throwing it up makes the place visible at a great distance but then another difficulty occurs how to obtain exactly the distance of the fall or length of the range as the mark made in the surface of the water is visible but for a moment this difficulty however our situation at woolwich close by the river thames enabled us to overcome as well as afforded us a good length of range for at our situation in the warren the river makes a remarkable turn and forms below us the part called the gallions reach a map of which is here given in plate iv in this map a denotes the point where the guns were placed being the convicts wharf which is so called because it is there that the convicts or felons condemned to work on the river thames land their gravel and upon which they usually labor from this point we have a convenient range of about a mile and a half toward b in the county of essex where there is a private or merchants powder magazine the buildings near c consist of the academy and a noble range of storehouses and from this point we should have had a still longer and more convenient range had not our view from hence been interrupted by four large hulks which lie for the use of the convicts in the river opposite the part between this point and the point a having found this convenient situation for our operations we made an exact survey and map of the two sides of the river both ways beyond the extent of the ranges and fixed on convenient stations at d and e on the south side and f and g on the north side of the river to place two parties of observers who might mark the place where each ball should fall in the water as well as note down the time employed by the ball in flying through the air from the visible discharge of the gun to the plunge of the ball in the water the method of determining the place of the fall was this two parties of observers consisting of three or four steady and intelligent young gentlemen in each party having taken their stands at d and f or e and g according to the expected length of the range carefully watched the discharge of every ball from the gun at a then tracing it as it were through the air by the loud whizzing noise it made in its slight their eye was prepared and directed gradually toward the place of the fall which they seldom missed of observing then immediately on perceiving the plunge some of them noted the time of flight by a good stop watch while others observed some remarkable land object on the opposite coast and directly in a line with the place in the water where the ball fell this done they directed the telescope or sights of an instrument such as a theodolite or plain table to that object and noted the position of it this being done by each party of observers and the line of position from each station drawn on the plan afterward at leisure the intersection of those lines gave very exactly the place of the fall and consequently its distance from the gun in this manner then were determined all the ranges and times of flight registered in the following experiments those places being left blank where the observation was either doubtful or not made at all the times of flight were also sometimes observed at the gun itself where the plunge of the ball could often be perceived  in this map of the river in plate iv the dotted line on each side of the river denotes low water mark the first black line next without it denotes high water mark and the other or outermost line is the land bank which has been raised in former ages from greenwich for many miles below and with immense labor to prevent the waters of the river from overflowing the adjacent fields which it would do every tide as they lie low and are otherwise very marshy     wednesday august         employed this day in making part of the survey by the side of the river for forming the map and fixing the stations proper for the parties of observers to occupy in watching the fall of the balls in the river and for other purposes  we weighed and measured the pendulum which had been prepared in a very complete manner and with stronger bands than before it weighed just     lb and by a mean of several times balancing and vibrating we found    inches to be the distance of the center of gravity below the axis and  00  the number of oscillations per minute  after executing part of the survey by the side of the river we fired a few balls upon the water from the convicts or proof wharf to try whereabouts they will fall and thereby to judge of the proper places for the observers to be stationed at the gun was no   with   ounces of powder and was tried at different elevations when the gun was elevated at    degrees the balls ranged much too far going beyond the stretch of the river and falling on the coast of essex below the point b but at    degrees elevation the balls ranged to a very convenient distance namely a little more than a mile and their fall in the water could be very well seen from the side of the river nearly opposite the place of the fall and sometimes from the gun itself  upon this occasion i took out with me and employed the first class of gentlemen cadets belonging to the royal military academy namely messieurs bartlett rowley de butts bryce wm fenwick pilkington edridge and watkins who have gone through the science of fluxions and have applied it to several important considerations in natural philosophy those gentlemen i have voluntarily offered and undertaken to introduce to the practice of these interesting experiments with the application of the theory of them which they have before studied under my care for although it be not my academy duty i am desirous of doing this for their benefit and as much as possible to assist the eager and diligent studies of so learned and amiable a class of young gentlemen who as well as the whole body of students now in the upper academy form the best set of young men i ever knew in my life nay i did not think it even possible in our state of society in this country for such a number of gentlemen to exist together in the constant daily habits of so much regularity and good manners their behavior being indeed perfectly exemplary and the pure effect of true philosophical principles arising from a rational conviction of the propriety of a regular good conduct which is such as would do honor to the purest and most perfect state of society that ever existed in the world and i have no hesitation in predicting the great honor and future services which will doubtless be rendered to the state by such eminent instances of virtue and abilities     thursday september        went out again with the same class of eight young gentlemen to complete the survey of the river side the weather changed to rain after we were out which continued the whole time and to such a degree as to wet us entirely through all our clothes yet

distance as formerly or about    feet and each ball into a fresh part of the wood both to obtain the force of the blow the more accurately and to take the penetration of the ball in the solid wood which we did every time by pushing in a wire to touch the hinder part of the ball these penetrations are various according as the part struck was more or less compact and they are rather larger than was expected the medium of all being      0 although the block of elm as the carpenters assured us was sound dry and wellseasoned wood the penetrations are set down in the last column and are for the

more than its weight at first so that it has neither lost weight by evaporation nor gained by imbibing moisture owing probably to the circumstance of being covered by the painted canvas  all the apparatus was in good order and the experiments all very accurately made  at the beginning of these experiments the values of p g n being p      g     n   00  if these values be substituted in the two

other times of flight could not be observed the medium range is      feet or      yards the last two balls went close over the heads and fell just beyond the lower party of observers at e yet notwithstanding their imminent danger they gallantly resolved to keep their ground if any more rounds should be fired not knowing immediately that we intended not firing any more at that time these two rounds were probably deslected thus a little from their course by the usual causes of deviation and perhaps the two former rounds had been still farther deflected and thrown on the land as the observers saw nothing of them but the gun was pointed in a direction rather nearer this south side of the river     thursday september        from    to   the weather close and warm rather hazy

same strength as before and which by comparing these three ranges with those of last year appears to be now somewhat stronger so that these ranges and times it may be presumed are too great in respect of those of last year they are also evidently very irregular owing perhaps to the inequalities of the balls which were only the remaining outcasts from the whole stock we first began with having been rejected either from their lightness or from the irregularities of their surfaces and sometimes indeed the ranges and times here set down were not very accurately obtained the mediums of all except those marked doubtful are placed at the bottom  a summary of the experiments with philosophical remarks and deductions  0  we have now got through this long threeyears course of experiments and have detailed them in so minute and circumstantial a manner as to enable every person fully to comprehend and make his own use of them without subjecting him to the dissatisfaction of having mediums and results forced upon him unaccompanied with the fair and regular means of assuring himself both of their justice and propriety we are now therefore to make some use of these experiments by pointing out the philosophical laws and deductions that flow from them and making such other remarks as may be suggested by the various circumstances of them or that may be useful for improving or farther extending experiments attended with such important consequences in natural philosophy and for these beneficial purposes it will first be necessary to bring the mediums and results together into an abstract or one comprehensive point of view to form as it were the sure and regular foundation for the future structure we hope to be able to raise upon them  of the length of the charge  0  and first we shall deduce the lengths or heights of the charge of powder for every two ounces in weight or the part of the bore of the gun which every charge occupies a thing very necessary both to show the part of the bore occupied by the charge corresponding to the greatest or any other velocity of the ball as also to compute a priori from theory the velocity due to every charge of powder now the length of the charge was taken at every experiment by means of the divisions of inches and tenths marked on the rammer and the mediums of most of them are specified for each day in the preceding account of the experiments and those mediums of each day are here in the following table collected and ranged in columns each under its respective weight at top extending from   to  0 ounces          0              0                        0                                   0                                                                                    0         0             0       0               0   0                                                                                            0             0              0        0      0               0           0             0                   0                                      0             and in the lowest line are set down the means among all the former means or numbers in each column the numbers in which last line of means are found by adding into one sum the numbers in each column and dividing that sum by the number of those parts and thus we have obtained the mediums of the mediums for each day which must be very near the truth but to find how near they are to the truth and to correct them let these be collected and ranged as in the second column of the following table of the heights of charges or column of irregular with irregular regular oz means diffs diffs means                                                                          0                                  0                        0            0            0        0   0           means then take the differences between each of these and place them in the  d column or irregular differences which would have been all equal if the mediums had been regular find then a medium among these unequal differences by dividing their sum by the number of them and it will be found to be     which set in the  th column of regular or equal differences then as the numbers in the  d column the nearest to this mean     are the differences between     and  0 ounces by supposing     to be the true length of the   ounce charge i form all the others from it by adding and subtracting continually the mean or common difference     and place them in the last column which will therefore consist of the true regular length of each charge including both the powder and the neck of the flannel bag which contained it  how much of each space was really occupied by the neck of the bag may be thus sound the first number     is the length of the charge of   ounces including the neck and the common difference     is the real length of   ounces of powder in the bore therefore subtracting this number from the former the remainder 0   is the mean length of the bore which was occupied by the neck of the bag in every charge and therefore taking this number from each of those in the last column the remainders will show the real length of bore occupied by the powder alone in each of the charges  of the recoil without balls  0  next let us consider the quantity of recoil or extent of the vibration of each gun for every charge of powder and first without balls now as these recoils were measured sometimes to one radius and sometimes to another it will be proper to reduce them all to a common radius as well as to a common weight of gun when it happens to vary in weight in the first years experiments the radius was various and the chords of recoil were always taken in inches but in those of the second and third years the radius was constantly  0 feet or   0 inches which was divided into  000 equal parts and the chords of vibration measured in thousandth parts of the radius each part being    00 of an inch it will therefore be convenient to reduce the recoils of the first year to the same radius and parts as those of the other two years which may be done as follows let r  any radius of the first year in inches and c  a corresponding chord of recoil taken in inches and parts  then r   0 c   0 c r the chord corresponding to the radius   0 and measured in inches and   0  000   0 c r  000 c r the same chord as expressed in thousandth parts of   0 inches  hence then to reduce any chord of recoil in the first year multiply it by  000 and divide the product by its own radius in inches so shall the quotient be the corresponding chord answering to the radius   0 inches and expressed in thousandth parts of that radius   0  by the foregoing rule then having reduced all the chords of recoil to the radius  0 feet and denoted them in thousandth parts of that radius the mediums of every days experiments collected and arranged will be as below  table of recoils without balls charge of powder oz

no inches inches recoils without balls    0    0                  0    0    00                      0 0                          0                          the recoils being estimated in parts of which the radius is  000 and the common weight of the gun with its frame and leaden weights being     lb also the distance of the center of gravity below the axis and the number of vibrations per minute as set down in the  d and  d columns of the tablet above   0  from the view and consideration of these numbers various observations easily arise as first that by observing the four columns or vertical rows it appears that the recoil of the gun and consequently the force of the powder upon it always increases as the length of the gun increases and that in a manner tolerably regular as far as the charge of   ounces but after that the increase is faster thus between the shortest bore of    inches long and the longest of  0 inches the increase in the velocity of recoil with   ounces of powder is from    to    or about the part with   ounces of powder it is from    to    or the    part and with   ounces of powder it is from     to     or the   0 part but with    ounces of powder the increase is from   0 to     or the part and this increase of recoil is chiefly if not entirely to be ascribed to the longer time the fluid of the inflamed powder acts upon the gun in passing through the greater length of bore at least as far as to the charge of   ounces but the extraordinary increase in the case of    ounces seems to be partly owing to that and partly to some of the powder in this high charge being blown out unfired from the short gun and from this circumstance i would infer that the whole of the charge of   ounces without ball is fired before it issues from the mouth of the short gun that is before the fluid expands through a space of    inches of bore and hence if the velocity of the fluid were known we could assign the time within which all the powder is fired if for instance the mean velocity of the fluid were only  000 feet in a second though it is probably much more the time would be only about the   0th part of a second in which the   ounces would be all inflamed  the foregoing are the rates of increase in the chord of recoil or in the velocity of the gun which is proportional to it it must be remarked however that the increase in the force of the powder will be about double of that of the recoil because the force is as the square of the velocity so that from the shortest gun to the longest the increase in the force of the powder with     or   ounces is about or from   to   and with    ounces of powder the force is almost as   to   or the increase almost one half of the less force   0  again if we contemplate the numbers on each horizontal line that is the recoils of each gun separately with the several charges of       and    ounces of powder we shall find that in each of them the recoil increases from the beginning to a certain part in a greater ratio than the constant ratio   to   of the powder increases and afterward in a less ratio than that of the powder that the ratio of the recoils in every gun is greatest at first or with the least charges of powder that the ratio continually decreases as the charge increases that the ratio at first is greatest with the shortest gun and so gradually less and less all the way to the longest but that however the ratio in the shorter guns decrease faster than in the longer and so as to come sooner to the ratio of   to   in the shorter guns than in the longer and after that the ratios in the short guns with the same charge are less than in the long ones all these properties will perhaps appear still plainer by arranging together the several ratios for each no of gun as here below ratios for the gun powder no   no   no   no                             0                    0   0     means               0 where each column of ratios is found by dividing the recoils successively by each other from the beginning namely the recoil of   oz by that of   the recoil of   oz by that of   and the recoil of   oz by that of   also the first and second lines rather decrease but the  d rather increases and the last or that of means also rather increases  and if we divide the first ratios in the last table but one successively by each other the  d by the  st and the  d by the  d and then again these last ratios or quotients by each other and so on we shall obtain the several orders of ratios for each gun as follows observing uniform laws no   no   no   no

  ounces of powder the  d the first ratios or the ratios of the recoils the  d contains the  d ratios or the ratios of the first ratios and the last column contains the  d ratios or the ratios of the  d ratios  or perhaps for some purposes it will serve better to set the same table in the following form where the vertical columns are changed into horizontal lines no   no   no   no               0

duplicate in this gun the recoils appear to be all rather low in respect of the others but more especially that with the charge of   oz of powder which is evidently much more defective than the rest and requires an increase of about   to make it uniform with the others and which increase it would probably have received from future experiments had there been any repetitions of it augmenting therefore only that number by   all the orders of means will be tolerably regular and stand as below for the most usual charges of powder namely       and    ounces gun powder no          recoils with

from the several vertical columns of this tablet of means we discover that the recoils increase always as the length of the gun increases but that in the  th or longest gun the increase is less in proportion than in the others and from the horizontal lines we perceive that the recoil always increases as the charge of powder increases and that in a manner tolerably regular and also in continued geometrical proportion when the charges of powder are so but the common ratio in the former progression being only about of that in the latter for if the mediums for each gun be divided by each other namely the  d by the  st the  d by the  d and the  th by the  d the quotients or ratios will come out as in the following tablet powder ratios for the gun no   no   no   no

the different guns with the same weights of powder rather increase in the first and third line but decrease in the second and again rather increase in the last which are the mediums of the three ratios in each column and which mean ratios are rather more than of   the common ratio of the weights of powder which are          ounces  and if we divide the numbers or ratios in each column continually by each other and their quotients by each other again the whole continued series or columns of ratios for each gun will be as here below no   no   no   no    0        0

0         00  0   of the mean velocity of the ball from the recoil of the gun iii having determined the mean recoil of the guns both with and without balls for the charges of          ounces we can now assign the mean velocity of the ball for each gun and charge from the recoils if as robins has asserted the force of the powder upon the gun be the same whether it is fired with a ball or without one for if that property be generally true then the velocity of the ball must be proportional to the difference of the chords of recoil with and without a ball and that difference being multiplied by a certain constant number will give the velocity of the ball itself as we have before shown  now if c denote the difference of those chords b the weight of the ball g the weight of the gun g the distance to its center of gravity i the distance to the axis of the bore and n the number of oscillations the gun would make in a minute then we have found in art    that      x g gc bin will express the velocity of the ball and that when g      g   0   i       and n   0 which are the medium values of those letters then the same theorem becomes     x c  b for the velocity of the ball and farther when the mean value of b is  0   or    oz    dr the same theorem for the velocity becomes barely       c subtracting however the  00th part in the gun no   and adding in the other three guns as follows namely the  000th part in no    00th part in no    00th part in no     therefore if each of the recoils without balls in the last table of art  0  be taken from the corresponding recoils in art  0  and the remainders be multiplied by       making the additions and subtractions abovementioned we shall have the corresponding velocities of the ball by this method and a synopsis of the whole for each gun and charge will be as in the following table charges   oz   oz   oz    oz gun no recoil diff veloc of ball recoil diff veloc of ball recoil diff veloc of ball recoil diff veloc of ball

with the velocities computed from the vibration of the pendulum  of the velocity of the ball as computed from the pendulum and gun     the four following tables contain the mediums of the velocities of the balls as computed for each day for all the principal charges of powder and for each gun separately one table being allotted for each in these tables all the mediums are arranged in a continued series in the chronological order as they occurred and accompanied with all the circumstances necessary to be known thus forming a fund or collection of elements from which other arrangements and principles are to be deduced  each table consists of ten columns the first column contains the dates the next three the state of the weather and air namely the  d column the hygrometer or state of the air as to dryness and moisture the  d the barometer and the  th the thermometer both which last instruments it must be observed were always placed in the shade and within the house while the experiments were made in the open air where it was commonly much hotter than the degree shown by the thermometer the  th column contains the weight of the charge of powder the  th and  th the weight and diameter of the ball the  th and  th the velocity of the ball the former as computed from the vibration of the pendulum and the latter from the recoil of the gun and finally the  0th column contains the difference between these two velocities which is marked with the negative sign  when the velocity by the gun is the less of the two  daily mediums of experiments with the gun no   date

and diameter of ball it will now then be proper to collect together all the repetitions of the same charge or weight of powder and to take the mediums of all those mediums to serve as fixed radical numbers or established degrees of velocity adapted to all the various charges of powder and length of gun and for this purpose i shall reduce the numbers of these tables all to one common weight and diameter of ball namely to the weight    oz    dr and the diameter     inches which are the numbers that most commonly occur and this reduction will be very well deduced from the experiments of september         when several trials were made with diverse weights and diameters of ball and with both   oz and   oz of powder the results of which accord very well together in the experiments of that day it was found that with the   oz charges    of the whole velocity is lost by the difference of   0 of an inch in the diameter of the ball and with the   oz charge     of the velocity is lost by the same difference of windage but the quantity of inflamed fluid which escapes will be nearly as the difference between the area of the circle of the bore and the great circle of the ball or the force will be as the square of the balls diameter and the velocity we know is as the square root of the force and therefore the velocity is as the diameter of the ball and the difference in the velocity as the difference of the diameter or as the windage hence if w denote any difference of windage in parts of an inch or difference between     and the diameter of any ball and   m the part of the experimented velocity lost by   0 of an inch difference of windage then shall   0 w   m  0 w m which last term will show what part of the experimented velocity is lost by the increase of windage denoted by  0 by this rule then i reduce all the velocities to what they would have been had the diameter of the ball been always     it is to be noted however that the value of m will vary with the charge of powder with   ounces of powder it was found that   m was    of the whole velocity or of the experimented velocity but with   oz of powder   m was found to be     of the whole or     of the experimented velocity we shall not be far from the truth therefore if we take the following values of   m to the several corresponding charges of powder that is as far as    oz in the guns no   and   and then returning backwards again as the powder is increased above    oz by   oz at a time but in the gun no   to continue only to    oz and then return backwards again for all above    oz and for the gun no   to continue only to    oz and then return backwards for all above that charge  powder value of   m                         0            0                                          such then is the reduction of the velocity on account of the windage and as to that for the different weights of the ball we know that the velocity varies in the reciprocal subduplicate ratio of the weight and according to this rule the numbers were corrected on account of the different weights of ball after these reductions then are made the numbers in the foregoing tables arranged under their respective charges of powder will be as here below for a ball of     diameter and weighing    oz    dr  mean velocities of balls for all the guns with several charges of powder reduced to a ball of

however of a sufficient number of each sort there are some small irregularities among the final mediums which may be corrected for the most part by adding or subtracting   or   feet as they are sometimes too little and sometimes too great and these small deviations will be very easily discovered by dividing the mediums by each other namely each of the velocities for       etc ounces of powder by that for   ounces for we know from the principles of forces and other experiments that the velocities will be nearly as the square roots of the quantities of powder that is while the length of the charge does not much shorten the length of the bore before the ball but gradually deviating from that proportion more and more as the charge of powder is increased in length because the force has gradually a less distance and time to act upon the ball in now by dividing the quantities of powder       etc by   the quotients       etc show the ratios of the charges and the roots of these numbers namely            000 etc show the ratios which the velocities would have to each other nearly if the empty part of the bore was always of the same length but as the vacant part always decreases as the charge increases the ratios of the velocities may be expected to fall short of those above and the sooner and the more so as the gun is shorter accordingly on trial we find the ratios hold pretty well even in the shortest gun as far as to the  oz charge but in the  oz charge it falls about     or     part below the true ratio being     instead of   in the longer guns the proportions hold out gradually longer and the deviations are always less and less thus in the  d gun the ratio for the  oz charge is about      in the  d it is      and in the  th gun it is      or   very nearly and so for other charges correcting then some of the mediums by means of this property the more accurate radical medium velocities for each gun with the several charges of       and   ounces of powder will be as here below powder gun no   no   no   no   ratio veloc dif      ratio veloc dif      ratio veloc dif      ratio veloc dif          0       0   0   0       0  00      0   00

large characters in the middle column on the left hand in a small character is the ratio which is found by dividing each velocity by the first the law of which ratios has been mentioned above and on the right hand are the columns of first and second differences the first being the difference between each two succeeding numbers and the second the differences of those differences  or for some purposes it may be more convenient to rangethe velocities etc as here below gun no   oz   oz   oz   oz     0    0   00         0    0    0     0  0    0               0    0              0      0

before were horizontal and where the law both of the ratios and differences is evident we also hence perceive how for each charge the velocity of the ball is continually increased as the gun is longer  and these velocities may be considered as standard radical numbers here deposited and ready to be applied to any purpose in which the consideration of the velocity can be useful and those for the other charges of powder will be as in the general table in art          these velocities however it must be remarked are those with which the ball strikes the pendulum after passing through the air between it and the muzzle of the gun and consequently they are less than the velocities with which it immediately issues from the gun by as much velocity as the ball loses by the resistance of the air in its flight through that space now we have found in art    that the first velocities lose at least their   th part by that resistance when the air behind the ball is supposed instantly to fill up the place always quitted by the ball in its flight but as this is not exactly the case the air rushing into a vacuum with a certain finite velocity therefore the part lost will be gradually more and more as the ball moves swifter till its velocity become equal to that of the air itself after which the part lost will remain constant and mr robins asserts that the velocity lost by very swift motions is about   times as great as that lost by slow ones and therefore that will be about the   th part so that the loss will always lie between the   th part and the   th part i shall therefore leave it in this uncertain state till other experiments enable us to ascertain what may be the exact proportion of loss peculiar to every degree of velocity      from the general table of medium velocities in art     it is evident that for each gun the velocity increases with the charge to a certain extent where it is greatest and that afterward it gradually decreases as the charge is increased it farther appears that the point or charge at which the velocity is the greatest is different in the guns of different lengths the charge which gives the maximum of velocity being always greater as the gun is longer and by tracing this increase of charge from the beginning to the point of greatest velocity it appears that with the  st  d and  d guns the charges which give the greatest velocities are nearly as follows viz gun no   at the charge of   oz gun no   at the charge of   oz gun no   at the charge of   oz   here it will not be so proper to specify what portion of the weight of the ball these weights of powder are being no ways regulated by that circumstance but what portion of the bore of the gun is filled with these quantities of powder now by the table of the lengths of charges in art  0  it appears that the lengths of the charges of       and   oz are these viz   oz   0 inches gun   its length       oz    inches gun   its length       oz  0  inches gun   its length     then dividing each length of charge by its corresponding length of gun we obtain nearly these three following fractions viz   0 in gun   of    calibers long in gun   of  0 calibers long   0 in gun   of  0 calibers long which express what part of the bore is filled with powder when the greatest velocity is given to the ball with each of these lengths of gun and which therefore is not one and the same constant part for all lengths of gun but varying nearly in the reciprocal subduplicate ratio of the length of the bore      having so far settled the degree of velocity of the ball as determined by the vibration of the pendulum we may in like manner now proceed to assign the mean velocities as deduced from the recoil of the gun the repetitions in this latter way are not so numerous as in the former but such as they are we shall here abstract them from the general tables in art     reducing them however all to the same common weight and diameter of ball as was done in art      mean velocities from the recoil of the gun powder oz                               0            gun no          0                          mediums                                    0            gun

those in art     because those were deduced from a greater number of particulars we shall therefore chiefly adopt those that were stated in that article for the radical standard velocities of the ball as determined from the recoil of the gun excepting in some instances when the other is used and sometimes the mediums of both so that the final mediums will be as follows velocities of the ball from the recoil of the gun gun no   oz   oz   oz    oz     0                        0                               0                    0      let us now compare these velocities deduced from the recoil of the gun with those that are stated in art     and     which were determined from the pendulum that we may see how near they will agree together and in this comparison it will be sufficient to employ the velocities for       and    ounces of powder this will be the most certain also as these mediums are better determined than most of the others  comparison of the velocities by the gun and

number of the gun and its velocity of ball both by the vibration of the gun and pendulum with their differences is on the same line with it for the several charges of powder after the first column the rest of the page is divided into four spaces for the four charges          ounces and each of these is divided into three columns in the first of the three is the velocity of the ball as determined from the vibration of the gun in the second is the ball as determined from the vibration of the pendulum and in the third is the difference between the two which is marked with the negative sign or  when the former velocity is less than the latter otherwise it is positive      from the comparison contained in the last article it appears in general that the velocities determined by the two different ways do not agree together and that therefore the method of determining the velocity of the ball from the recoil of the gun is not generally true although mr robins and mr thompson had suspected it to be so and consequently that the effect of the inflamed powder on the recoil of the gun is not exactly the same when it is fired without a ball as when it is fired with one it also appears that this difference is no ways regular neither in the different guns with the same charge nor in the same gun with different charges of powder that with very small charges the velocity by the gun is greater than that by the pendulum but that the latter always gains upon the former and soon becomes equal to it and then exceeds it more and more as the charge of powder is increased that the particular charge at which the two velocities become equal is different in the different guns and that this charge is less or the equality sooner takes place as the gun is longer and all this whether we use the actual velocity with which the ball strikes the pendulum or the same increased by the velocity lost by the resistance of the air in its flight from the gun to the pendulum  of the ranges and times of flight   0 having dispatched what relates to the velocity of the ball we may now proceed in like manner to the experiments made to determine the actual ranges and the times of flight of

last column are added the corresponding initial velocities which the ball would have at the muzzle of the gun which have been extracted from the medium velocities as determined by the pendulum and here reduced to the peculiar weight and diameter of ball in each particular case of this table by the reductions specified in art     and by augmenting the velocity for the   ounce charge by its   th part and the others by their   th part for the loss of velocity in passing from the gun to the pendulum  so that in this little table we have the following concomitant data determined with a tolerable degree of precision namely the weight of powder the weight and diameter of the ball the initial or projectile velocity the elevation of the gun the time of the balls flight and its range or the distance of the horizontal plane from which it is hoped that the resistance of the medium and its effect on other elevations etc may be determined and so afford the means of deriving easy rules for the several cases of practical gunnery a subject intended to be prosecuted in a future volume of these tracts  of the balls penetration into the wood i shall here select only the depths of the penetrations into the block of wood that have been made in the course of the last years experiments as they are the most numerous and uniform and were all made with the same gun namely no   i shall also select only those for     and   ounces of powder as they are the most useful and certain numbers for affording safe and general conclusions and besides the trials with other charges are too few in number being commonly no more than one of each  mean penetrations of balls into elm wood powder                              0   0  means       0  that is the balls penetrated about   inches deep with   oz of powder    inches deep with   oz of powder  0 inches deep with   oz of powder and these penetrations are nearly as the numbers       or       but the quantities of powder are as       or       so that the penetrations are as the charges as far as   ounces but in a less ratio at   ounces namely less in the ratio of   to   and are indeed so far proportional to the logarithms of the charges  now by the theory of penetrations the depths ought to be as the charges or which is the same thing as the squares of the velocities but from our experiments it appears that the penetrations fall short of that proportion in the higher charges and therefore it would seem that the resisting force of the wood is not uniformly the same but that it increases a little with the increased velocity of the ball and this probably may be occasioned by the greater quantity of fibers driven before the ball which may thus increase the spring or resistance of the wood and so prevent the ball from penetrating so deep as it otherwise would do but it will require sarther experiments in suture to determine this point more accurately      before we conclude this tract it may not be unuseful to make a short recapitulation of the more remarkable deductions that have been drawn from the experiments in the course of these calculations for by bringing them together into one collected point of view we may at any time easily see what useful points of knowledge are hereby obtained and thence be able to judge what remains yet to be done by future experiments having therefore experimented and examined all the objects that were pointed out in art   p  0  and seq we shall just slightly mention the answers to these enquiries which are either additions to or confirmations of those laid down p  0  as drawn from our former experiments in the year       and  st then it may be remarked that the former law between the charge and velocity of ball is again confirmed namely that the velocity is directly as the square root of the weight of powder as far as to about the charge of   ounces and so it would continue for all charges were the guns of an indefinite length but as the length of the charge is increased and bears a more considerable proportion to the length of the bore the velocity falls the more short of that proportion   nd that the velocity of the ball increases with the charge to a certain point which is peculiar to each gun where it is greatest and that by further increasing the charge the velocity gradually diminishes till the bore is quite full of powder that this charge for the greatest velocity is greater as the gun is longer but not greater however in so high a proportion as the length of the gun is so that the part of the bore filled with powder bears a less proportion to the whole in the long guns than it does in the shorter ones the part of the whole which is filled being indeed nearly in the reciprocal subduplicate ratio of the length of the empty part and the other circumstances are as in this table of charges producing the greatest velocity gun no length of the bore length filled part of the whole weight of the powder inches inches oz            0                           0                     0      dly it appears that the velocity continually increases as the gun is longer though the increase in velocity is but very small in respect to the increase in length the velocities being in a ratio somewhat less than that of the square roots of the length of the bore but somewhat greater than that of the cube roots of the length and is indeed nearly in the middle ratio between the two but the particular degrees of velocity for each gun and charge may be seen at p     and       thly it appears from the table of ranges in art     p     that the range increases in a much less ratio than the velocity and indeed is nearly as the square root of the velocity the gun and elevation being the same and when this is compared with the property of the velocity and length of gun in the foregoing paragraph we perceive that we gain extremely little in the range by a great increase in the length of the gun the charge being the same and indeed the range is nearly as the  th root of the length of the bore which is so small an increase as to amount only to about   th part more range for a double length of gun   thly from the same table in art     it also appears that the time of slight is nearly as the range the gun and elevation being the same   thly it appears that there is no difference caused in the velocity or range by varying the weight of the gun nor by the use of wads nor by different degrees of ramming nor by firing the charge of powder in different parts of it   thly but a very great difference in the velocity arises from a small degree of windage indeed with the usual established windage only namely about   0th of the caliber no less than between and of the powder escapes and is lost and as the balls are often smaller than that size it frequently happens that the powder is lost by unnecessary windage   thly it appears that the resisting force of wood to balls fired into it is not constant and that the depths penetrated by different velocities or charges are nearly as the logarithms of the charges instead of being as the charges themselves or which is the same thing as the square of the velocity   thly these and most other experiments show that balls are greatly deflected from the direction they are projected in and that so much as  00 or  00 yards in a range of a mile or almost th of the range which is nearly a deflection of an angle of    degrees   0thly finally these experiments furnish us with the following concomitant data to a tolerable degree of accuracy namely the dimensions and elevation of the gun the weight and dimensions of the powder and shot with the range and time of slight and first velocity of the ball from which it is to be hoped that the measure of the resistance of the air to projectiles may be determined and thereby lay the foundation for a true and practical system of gunnery which may be as well useful in service as in theory especially after a sew more accurate ranges
