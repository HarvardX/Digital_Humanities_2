to james beattie ll d professor of logic and moral philosophy in the university of aberdeen this elegy is inscribed as a mark of the greatest esteem by  the author  craigmillar castle an elegy wrote in september mdcclxxv the sun declining over the western sky in roseat splendour closed his circling course and tinged the clouds with many a varied dye when following fancys everflowing source of cool poetic joy i bent my way towered a majestic castles ruins wide within whose gates once royalty bore sway and for a season laid its cares aside the bleating flocks were pent within the fold the jovial reapers long had left the vale the plowman at his cheary fireside told the merry story or the mournful tale now sol had gone to other worlds to rise and all the place to silence was resigned while on the ruin fixed were my eyes a pleasing melancholy filled my mind comparing present things with past a tear starting from either eye down gently stole though from my heart wrung by reflection drear a tear which pity wished not to control while yielding thus to lenient grief i deemed a rushing noise i heard and looking round a sudden light effulgent on me beamed and all my soul in admiration bound upon the hill descended from on high a being far transcending human kind i gazed upon him as he glided nigh his form engaging all my pensive mind an azure robe of a celestial dye around him wildly wantoned in the breeze bare were his feet his looks did seem to vye with newfalln snow that tips the aged trees placid and mild his look yet conscious seemed of majesty and piercing was his eye that flashing with a heavenly ardor gleamd as formed with ease to scan earth sea and sky his decent footstops with a silver wand were guided as majestically slow towered me he calm advanced and took his stand beside me lost in pitys balmy woe ah mortal said he thou art moved in vain to see all human grandeur yield to fate when from its fall thou should essay to gain instruction not bewail its fallen state it is my delight at fall of dewy eve to visit and converse with mortals good my heavenly dictates who with joy receive in the low cot or mid the shady wood the vain magnificence of man may prove my present mournfully instructive theme whose fate observed might even the proudest move to own all earthly pomp a fleeting dream thus while he spoke i recognized the power of contemplation radiant son of truth when empty joys invite or sorrows lowr the comforter of age the guide of youth for often he my lone sequestered cot had deigned to visit where he taught my soul tranquilly to enjoy lifes checkered lot and each impetuous passion to control behold he thus resumed yon turrets high the once proud ornaments of that strong tower now rent and shattered by the inclement sky scarce rests the vestige of their former power the approaching foe by no portcullis dire nor bar of massy iron nor steady gate would now be forced disdainful to retire and leave a strength unworthy of his hate upon this moat once as a sea profound which erst no daring footstep ever trod the wanton infant now may sportive bound and harmless lambs choose a secure abode the room where arms in horrid order placed a glimmering light reflected to the eye is now with instruments of labor graced there sword to sickle changed thou may descry that chamber where the queen whose charms divine made wondering nations own the power of love often bathed her snowy limbs in sparkling wine now proves a lonely refuge for the dove yon hall capacious where the flowing bowl inspired convivial mirth unblamdly free unfolded all the secrets of the soul and whelmed each care in heartenlivning glee where the lovekindling lute and sounding lyre rapt all the mind or in soft pleasure drowned where the hoarse trumpet rouzing martial fire made vaulted roof and rocky walls resound there sullen silence reigns and there the owl makes her abode that loves the gloomy night thence not the least noise rises save the howl of bats and beasts obscene that shun the light yon mouldering chapel which in days of yore to some romantic saint was sacred made where the early priest his matins murmured over and said his numerous masses for the dead there now each noxious animal and weed in baleful darkness dwells and where the cross was placed the henbane spreads a deadly shade and the foul toad concealed lies in the moss see over the place deep melancholy reigns where splendour once diffused its brightest day and of a palace even these poor remains will soon to nameless ruin drop a prey such fate awaits all sublunary things save those that rest on virtues firm support she aid alone against times fell ravage brings and smiles secure at fortunes cruel sport thus while he spoke his robe expanding wide majestic as a cherub still he stood then through the liquid air was seen to glide and swift ascending gained his blessed abode i silent turning from the eastern seas behold the fullorbd moon refulgent rise no fluttering zephyr fans the yellow trees each breathe in gentle cadence softly dies the strepent horn no more the hills rebound but all the air is wrapped in stillness mild save where the faroff curfeus solemn sound steals on the ear melodiously wild fair cynthias ray swiftgliding as she rose first marked the place where a proud vessel lay which in the lulling calm seemed to repose while not a gale its slagging sails did sway then slow that towering hill to view disclosed at whose wide base a princely palace stands and by it to each ruthless storm exposed a sacred ruin  shame of modern hands sure scotias kings august and heroes brave claim the most splendid honors of the tomb to them their country who but lived to save no longer be denied the grateful dome soon all edinas glories rose to sight her lofty spires her castle proudly strong the distant forth reflecting the pale light as slow he flowed the laughing fields among autumn her golden mantle over the land had cast each sound was hushed in silence still save where the rivulet murmured through the sand the snowey moonlight sleepd on every hill a scene so sweetly solemn fancys eye surveyed with rapture
