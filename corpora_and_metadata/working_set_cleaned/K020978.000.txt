will never discover yourself without my leave dont look upon it as capricious fondness nor think because it is a mothers advice that in duty to yourself you are obliged not to follow it   ach but my character my honor  would you have your son live with infamy  on the first step of a young fellow depends his character for life  i beg you goddess to dispense with your commands   thet have you then no regard to my presentiment i cannot bear the thoughts of your going for i know that odious siege of troy would be the death of thee   ach because you have the natural fears of a mother would you have me insensible that i have the heart of a man the world madam must look upon my absconding in this manner and at this particular juncture as infamous cowardice  air i a clown in flanders once there was  what is life no curse is more severe than bearing life with shame is this your fondness this your care o give me death with fame    thet keep your temper achilles  it is both impious and undutiful to call my prescience in question   ach pardon me goddess for had you like other mothers been a mere woman only i should have taken the liberty of other sons and should as it is my duty have heard your advice and followed my own   thet i positively shall not be easy child unless you give me your word and honor  you know my commands   ach my word madam i can give you but my honor is already sacrificed to my duty that i gave you when i submitted to put on this womans habit   thet believe me achilles i have a tender regard for your honor as well as life  by preventing your running headlong to your destiny i preserve you for future glory therefore child i once more insist upon your solemn promise   ach was i a woman as i appear to be i could without difficulty give you a promise to have the pleasure of breaking it but when i promise my life is pledged for the performance  your commands madam are sacred  yet i entreat you goddess to consider the ignominious part you make me act  in obeying you i prove my self unworthy of you   thet my will achilles is not to be controverted your life depends upon your duty and positively child you shall not go to this siege  air ii gudgeons song  why thus am i held at defiance a mother a goddess obey will men never practice compliance till marriage has taught em the way    ach but why must i lead the life of a woman why was i stolen away from my preceptor was i not as safe under the care of chiron  i know the love he had for me i feel his concern and i dare swear that good creature is now so distressed for the loss of me that he will quite founder himself with galloping from place to place to look after me   thet i will hear no more obey and seek to know no further  can you imagine that i would have taken all this trouble to have lodged you under the protection of lycomedes if i had not seen the absolute necessity of it   ach were i allowed to follow my inclinations what would you have to fear  i should do my duty and die with honor  was i to live an age i could do no more   thet you are so very obstinate that really child there is no enduring you  your impatience seems to forget that i am a goddess have i not degraded my self into the character of a distressed grecian princess it is owing to my artifice and insinuation that we have the protection of the king of scyros have i not won lycomedes his friendship and hospitality to that degree as to place you without the least suspicion among his daughters  and for what dear achilles  your safety and future fame required it   ach it is impossible madam to bear it much longer  my words my actions my awkward behavior must one day inevitably discover me  i had been safer under the tuition of chiron   thet has not the prophet calchas persuaded the confederates that the success of their expedition against troy depends upon your being among em have they not emissaries and spies almost every where in search of you it is here only and in this disguise that i can believe you out of the reach of suspicion  you have so much youth and such a bloom that there is no man alive but must take you for a woman what i am most afraid of is that when you are among the ladies you should be so little master of your passions as to find your self a man   air iii did you ever hear of a galant sailor  ach the woman always in temptation must do what nature bids her do our hearts feel equal palpitation for we have unguarded minutes too by nature greedy when lank and needy within your fold the wolf confine then bid the glutton not think of mutton can you persuade him not to dine    thet now dear child let me beg you to be discreet  i have some seaaffairs that require my attendance which much against my will oblige me for a time to leave you to your own conduct   scene ii thetis achilles artemona art the princesses lady pyrrha have been sitting at their embroidery above a quarter of an hour and are perfectly miserable for want of you   thet pyrrha is so very unhandy and so monstrously awkward at her needle that i know she must be diverting her passion for romances as you must have observed in other girls took her off from every part of useful education   ach for the many obligations i have to the princesses i should no doubt upon all occasions show my self ready to be the but of their ridicule  it is a duty that all great people expect from what they call their dependants   art how can you lady pyrrha misinterpret a civility i know they have a friendship an esteem for you and have a pleasure in instructing you   thet for heavens sake pyrrha let not your captious temper run away with your goodmanners you cannot but be sensible of the kings and their civilities both to you and me  how can you be so horridly out of humor   ach all i mean madam is that when people are sensible of their own defects they are not the proper objects of ridicule   thet you are so very touchy pyrrha that there is no enduring you  how can you be so unsociable a creature as to deny a friend the liberty of laughing at your little follies and indiscretions for what do you think women keep company with one another   ach because they hate one another despise one another and seek to have the pleasure of seeing and exposing one anothers faults and follies   thet now dear pyrrha tell me is work a thing you pique yourself upon suppose too they should smile at an absurdity in your dress it could not be such a mortification as if like most women you had made it the chief business of your life   art dont they treat one another with equal familiarity   ach but a reply from me whatever was the provocation might be looked upon as impertinent i hate to be under the restraint of civility when i am illusd   art will you allow me madam to make your excuses to the princesses  the occasion of your highnesss leaving her i see troubles her  perhaps i may interrupt conversation   thet it is astonishing child how you can have so little complaisance this sullen behavior of yours must be disagreeable i hope madam she is not always in this way   art never was any creature more entertaining such spirits and so much vivacity the princesses are really fond of her to distraction  the most cheerful tempers are liable to the spleen and it is an indulgence that one woman owes to another   ach the spleen madam is a female frailty that i have no pretensions to nor any of its affections  air iv si vous vous moquez de nous  when a woman sullen sits and wants breath to conquer reason always these affected fits are in season since it is in her disposition make her be her own physician   nay dear madam you shall not go without me  though i have my particular reasons to be out of humor i cannot be deficient in goodmanners   art i know they would take it mortally ill if they thought your complaisance had put yourself under the least restraint   ach i cannot forgive myself for my behavior  you must excuse me madam for absence in conversation is an incivility that i am but too liable to   art you know we all rally you upon your being in love as that is one of its most infallible symptoms   thet i charge you upon my blessing  as you expect fame glory immortality obey me   to achilles thetis kisses him exeunt achilles and artemona scene iii thetis as for his face his air his figure i am not under the least apprehension all my concern is from the impetuosity of his temper  yet after all why should i fear a discovery for women have the same passions though they employ em upon different objects  air v a minuet  mans so touchy a word that is injurious wakes his honor he is sudden as fire woman kindles and is no less furious for her trifles or any desire man is sty or sour or resty if balkd of honors or power or pelf womans passions can no less molest ye and all for reasons she keeps to her self   he is sudden he is impatient what then are women less so ask almost all servants what they know of their mistresses  he is wilful testy and untractable cannot thousands of husbands say as much of their wives then as for his obstinacy  that can never show him less a woman but he has not that command of his tongue i could wish him he is too vehement too severe in his expressions in this particular indeed few women take equal liberties to one anothers faces but they make ample amends for it behind each others backs so that with all these infirmities of man he may with the least conduct very well pass for a finespirited woman  this reflection has cured my anxiety and will make me believe him secure   scene iv thetis lycomedes thet it is with the utmost gratitude that i return your majesty thanks for the honors and hospitable favors shown to me and my daughter   lycom you would oblige me more madam if your affairs would allow you to accept em longer   thet i have presumed sir to trespass further on your generosity in leaving my daughter under your protection  i hope pyrrhas behavior will deserve it   air vi to you my dear and to no other  must then alas the fondest mother desert her child  lycom  ah why this tear she will in theaspe find another in me paternal love and care    had you taken her with you my daughters would have been miserable beyond expression theirs and her education shall be the same   thet i beg you sir not to regard my gratitude like the common obligations of princes for neither time nor interest can ever cancel it   lycom affairs of consequence may require your presence importunity upon these occasions is troublesome and unhospitable  i ask no questions madam because i choose not to pry into secrets   thet i can only thank and rely upon your majestys goodness  my duty to the queen sir calls me hence to own my obligations and receive her commands   scene v lycomedes diphilus lyc the princess calista has taken her leave she is but just gone out of the room   diph that pyrrha sir was a most delicious piece   lycom with all her little vixen humors to my taste she is infinitely agreeable   diph your parting with her sir in this easy manner is astonishing one too so excessively fond of you   lycom parting with her diphilus   diph but no prince alive has so great a command of his passions   lycom dear diphilus let me understand you   diph to my knowledge you might have had her   lycom can i believe thee   diph i really thought the queen began to be a little uneasy and for the quiet of the family since she is gone i must own i am heartily glad of it  air vii john went suiting unto joan  how your patience had been tried had this haughty dame complied what is a mistress and a wife joy for moments plague for life    lycom i am not so unhappy diphilus  her mother has left her to my care   diph just as i wished   lycom would she had taken her with her   diph it might have been better for beyond dispute sir both you and the queen would have been easier   lycom why did she trust her to me   diph there could be but one reason   lycom i cannot answer for myself   diph twas upon that very presumption you was trusted   lycom would i could believe thee   diph it is an apparent manifest scheme sir and you would disappoint both mother and daughter if your majesty did not betray your trust  you love her sir you say   lycom to distraction diphilus   diph and was the betraying a trust ever as yet an obstacle to that passion what would you have a mother do more upon such an occasion ladies of her rank cannot transact an affair of this kind but with some decorum   lycom but you can never suppose pyrrha knows any thing of the matter   diph why not sir   lycom from me she cannot for i have never as yet made any downright professions   diph there lies the true cause of her thoughtfulness it is nothing but anxiety for fear her scheme should not take place for no doubt her mother has instructed her not to be too forward to make you more so  believe me sir you will have no difficulties in this affair but those little ones that every woman knows how to practice to quicken a lover   lycom be it as it will diphilus i must have her   diph had i been acquainted with your pleasure sooner your majesty by this time had been tired of her  how happy shall i make her if i may have the honor of your majestys commands to hint your passion to her   lycom never did eyes receive a passion with such coldness such indifference  air viii grooms complaint  whenever my looks have spoke desire i sighed i gazed in vain no glance confessed her secret fire and eyes the heart explain    diph though it is what she wishes what she longs for what she sighs for respect and awe are a restraint upon her eyes as well as tongue i have often told you sir she dares not understand you she dares not believe herself so happy   lycom this ring diphilus  i must leave the rest to your discretion   diph there may be a manner in giving it her a little hint or so  but the present will speak for itself it is the most successful advocate of love and never wants an interpreter   lycom say every thing for me diphilus for i feel i cannot speak for myself   diph could i be as successful in all my other negotiations yet there may be difficulties for if i mistake not the lady has something of the coquette about her and what selfdenial will not those creatures suffer to give a lover anxiety  air ix over bogie  observe the wanton kittens play whenever a mouse appears you there the true coquette survey in all her flirting airs now pawing now clawing now in fond embrace till midst her freaks he from her breaks steals off and bilks the chase    lycom dear diphilus what do you mean i never saw a woman so little of that character   diph pardon me sir your situation is such that you can never see what mankind really are in your presence every one is acting a part no one is himself and was it not for the eyes and tongues of your faithful servants how little would your subjects be known to you though she is so prim and reserved before you she is never at a loss for airs to draw all the young flirting lords of the court about her   lycom beauty must always have its followers   diph if i mistake not general ajax too who is sent to solicit your quota for the trojan war has another solicitation more at heart  but suppose she had ten thousand lovers a womans prevalent passion is ambition which must answer your ends  the queen is coming this way and her commands may detain me  i go sir to make pyrrha the happiest creature upon earth   scene vi lycomedes theaspe theas i think the princess calista might as well have taken her daughter with her  that girl is so intolerably forward that i cannot imagine such conversation can possibly be of any great advantage to your daughters education   lycom you seem of late to have taken an aversion to the girl she has spirit and vivacity but not more than is becoming the sex and i never saw any thing in her behavior but what was extremely modest   theas for heavens sake sir allow me to believe my own eyes her forwardness must give the fellows some encouragement or there would not be that intolerable flutter about her  but perhaps she has some reasons to be more upon her guard before you   lycom how can you be so unreasonably censorious   theas i can see her faults sir i see her as a woman sees a woman the men it seems think the awkward creature handsome   air x dutch skipper first part  lycom when a womans censorious and attacks the meritorious in the scandal she shows her own malicious thought if real guilt she blames then pride her heart inflames and she fancies she is better for anothers fault thus seeking to disclose the slips of friends and foes by her envy she does herself alone expose    nay dear child your attacking her in this peevish way can be nothing but downright antipathy   theas nay dear sir your defending her in this feeling manner can be nothing but downright partiality   lycom i own my self partial to distress and i see her in that circumstance   theas but there are other reasons that may make a man partial  air xi dutch skipper second part  as you sir are my husband no doubt youre prone to turn each new face to a wifes disgrace and for no other cause but that she is your own nay sir it is an evident case it is strange that all husbands should prove so blind that a wifes real merits they never can find though they strike all the rest of mankind    lycom how can you be so ridiculous by these airs madam you would have me believe you are jealous   these whence had you this contemptible opinion of me jealous if i was so i have a spirit above owning it i would never heighten your pleasure by letting you have the satisfaction of knowing i was uneasy   lycom let me beg you my dear to keep your temper   theas since i have been so unguarded as to own it give me leave to tell you sir that was i of a lower rank it would keep you in some awe because you would then know i could take my revenge   lycom you forget your duty child   theas there is a duty too due from a husband   lycom how can you give way to these passions   theas because you give way to yours   lycom but to be so unreasonably jealous   theas unreasonably would it were so   air xii black joke  lycom then must i bear eternal strife both night and day put in mind of a wife by her pouts spleen and passionate airs  theas do you think i will bear eternal slight and not complain when i am robbed of my right call you this sir but whimsical fears  lycom can naught then still this raging storm  theas yes what you promised if you would perform  lycom prythee teaze me no more  theas i can never give over till i find you as fond and as kind as before  lycom will you never ask a possible task    would you have me so unhospitable as to deny her my protection   theas it is not sir that i presume to control you in your pleasures  yet you might methinks have showed that tenderness for me to have acted with a little more reserve women are not so blind as husbands imagine  were there no other circumstances  your coolness to me your indifference  how i despise my self for this confession  pardon me sir love made me thus indiscreet  air xiii ye shepherds and nymphs  theaspe weeping o love plead my pardon nor plead it in vain twas you that was jealous twas you was in pain yet why should you speak to what purpose or end i must be unhappy if love can offend   yet was ever a design of this kind so manifest so barefaced  air xiv the goddesses  theaspe angry to what a pitch is man profuse and all for ostentatious pride even misses are not kept for use but for mere show and naught beside for might a wife speak out she could prove beyond all doubt with more than enough he was supplied   the princess calista has shown an uncommon confidence in your majesty the woman no doubt depends upon it that her daughters charms are not to be resisted   lycom nay dear child dont be scandalous  air xv joans placket  reputations backed and hewed can never be mended again yet nothing stints the tattling prude who joys in anothers pain thus while she rends both foes and friends by both she is torn in twain reputations hacked and hewed can never be mended

heart ask your own conduct those can best inform you  twoud have been more obliging if pyrrha and you had kept me out of this impudent secret  you know sir i have reason   lycom if one womans virtue depended upon anothers suspicions where should we find a woman of common modesty indeed child i think you injure her i believe her virtuous   theas when a man has ruined a woman he thinks himself obliged in honor to stand up for her reputation   lycom if you will believe only your own unaccountable suspicions and are determined not to hear reason i must leave you to your perverse humors  what would you have me say what would you have me do   theas show your hospitality as you call it to me and put that creature out of the palace   lycom i have a greater regard to yours and my own quiet than ever to comply with the extravagant passions of a jealous woman   theas you have taken then your resolutions i find and i am sentenced to neglect  did ever a woman marry but with the probability of having at least one man in her power  what a wretched wife am i   weeps lycom jealousy from a wife even to a man of quality is now looked upon as illmanners though the affair be never so public  but without a cause  i beg you madam to say no more upon this subject   theas though you sir may think her fit company for you methinks the very same reasons might tell you that she is not so very reputable a companion for your daughters   lycom since a passionate woman will only believe herself i must leave you madam to enjoy your obstinacy i know but that way of putting an end to the dispute  air xvi we have cheated the parson etc  though womans glib tongue when her passions are fired eternally go a mans ear can be tired since woman will have both her word and her way i yield to your tongue but my reason obey i obey nothing say since woman will have both her word and her way    scene vii theaspe theas would i had been more upon the reserve but husbands are horridly provoking they

creature that what do you call her that princess gone   art yes madam   theas why did not she take that awkward thing her daughter with her   art the advantages she mighr receive in her education

other reason for leaving her   art your courtesy madam your hospitality   theas no other reason   art no other reason    theas would i could believe there was no other   art it is not for me to pry into your majestys secrets   theas i hate a girl that is so intolerably forward   art i never observed any thing but those little liberties that girls of her age will take when they are among themselves  perhaps those particular distinctions the princesses show her may have made her too familiar  i am not madam an advocate for her behavior   theas a look so very audacious now the filthy men who love every thing that is impudent call that spirit  but there are artemona some particular distinctions from a certain person who of late has been very particular to me that might indeed make her too familiar   art heaven forbid   theas how precarious is the happiness of a wife when it is in the power of every new face to destroy it  now dear artemona tell me sincerely dont you from what you yourself have observed think i have reason to be uneasy   art that i have observed   theas dear artemona dont frighten thyself  i am not accusing you but talking to you as a friend  air xvii fairy elves  art o guard your hours from care of jealousy beware for she with fancied sprites herself torments and frights thus she frets and pines and grieves raising fears that she believes     theas i hate myself too for having so much condescension and humility as to be jealous it is flattering the man that uses one ill and it is wanting the natural pride that belongs to the sex what a wretched mean contemptible figure is a jealous woman how have i exposed myself   art your majesty is safe in the confidence reposed in me   theas that is not the case artemona lycomedes knows i am unhappy i have owned it and was so unguarded as to accuse him   art upon mere suspicion only   theas beyond dispute he loves her i know it artemona and can one imagine that girl has virtue enough to withstand such a proposal  air xviii moll peatly  all hearts are a little frail when temptation is rightly applied what can shame or fear avail when we sooth both ambition and pride all women have power in view then there is pleasure to tempt her too such a sure attack there is no defying no denying since complying gives her anothers due    i cannot indeed if you mean that positively affirm that he has yet had her   art then it may be still only suspicion   theas i have trusted too my daughter deidamia with my weakness that she by her intimacies and friendship with pyrrha may get into her secrets in short i have placed her as my spy about her  that girl out of goodnature and to prevent familydisputes may deceive me she insists upon it that i have nothing to fear from pyrrha and is so positive in this opinion that she offers to be answerable for her conduct   art why then madam will you still believe your own jealousies   theas all i say is that deidamia may deceive me for whatever is in the affair it is impossible but she must know it i have ordered it so that she is scarce ever from her they have one and the same bedchamber yet such is my distemper that i suspect every body and can only

would call you a pimp a pandar a bawd for this very honorable proposal of yours   diph what an unmerciful weapon is a womans tongue  i beg your highness to confine yourself within the bounds of common

either his taste or pleasure  notwithstanding she is such a spitfire it is my opinion the thing may still do things of this nature should be always transacted in person for there are women so ridiculously halfmodest that they are ashamed in words to consent to what when a man comes to the point they will make no difficulties to comply with   scene iii lycomedes diphilus lycom well diphilus

happily concluded  all that now remains to be done is with pyrrha i have left her to deidamias management and without doubt her good offices must prevail for you can never have a better advocate  but
