a discourse on the nature causes and cure of corpulency  price one shilling  a discourse on the nature causes and cure of corpulency  illustrated by a remarkable case read before the royal society november       and now first published by malcolm flemyng md  london printed for l davis and c reymers printers to the royal society over against graysinn holborn  mdcclx  advertisement the author of the following discourse had above ten years ago formed a resolution of writing a full treatise on corpulency both theoretical and practical with an appendix concerning its opposite extreme thinness or leanness and had accordingly not only drawn his plan but began to raise part of the structure in the year      then living in london but soon after returning into the country at a great distance from wellfurnished libraries he could not come at the necessary books for rendering his treatise as complete as he intended especially the foreign periodical literary transactions which he knew furnished many observations relating to his subject he was therefore obliged to lay aside his intention however having succeeded in an extraordinary case of corpulency beyond his most sanguine hopes and that solely by pursuing a method which his own reflections had suggested he drew up the following pages in which the nature and causes of that burdensome and dangerous state of body and the principal methods of cure indicated therein are briefly but he hopes clearly explained and particularly the method which proved successful is fully described and accounted for the paper was read in a meeting of the royal society november        though he had not obtained leave to mention in print the persons name upon whom the cure was made yet he then produced authentic and satisfactory vouchers for the truth of the facts as the very learned and worthy secretary of the said soiety dr birch will testify  caister in lincolnshire april  0    0 a discourse on corpulency corpulency when in an extraordinary degree may be reckoned a disease as it in some measure obstructs the free exercise of the animal functions and has a tendency to shorten life by paving the way to dangerous distempers  it is too great an accumulation of animal oil or fat more or less over the whole body but chiefly immediately under the skin in the interstices of the muscles and within the cavity of the abdomen or lower belly  that corpulency is caused by an increased quantity of fat and not of blood or any other substance whatsoever is so clear and evident that we may spare ourselves the trouble of proving it butchers stalls sufficiently evince it is truth and the common sense of mankind acquiesces in it fat and corpulent being synonymous epithets in common conversation  till within a century ago anatomists had a very imperfect notion of the manner in which the fat is distributed and lodged in the animal body they imagined that it lies in confused clusters or heaps sticking to the parts where it is found without being contained in cells or small membranous cavities but now it is generally and certainly known that it is reposited in the cells or vesicles of a certain web or texture called membrana or tela cellulosa which is spread over the whole body not only immediately under the skin but penetrating likewise into it is inmost recesses and entering more or less into the composition of almost every part the cells of this web or tissue are so framed as to communicate together all over where they are widest they contain oil or fat where they are too minute for that purpose they receive a fluid jelly or moist vapor  the fat is a secretion from the blood made by the most simple secretory apparatus to wit arteries bringing the blood from which the fat is to be separated and lateral vessels of a lesser diameter arising from these arteries which strain off the fat or oil and convey it to the cells or vesicles where it is to be reposited while small veins continued with the arteries return into the common channel of circulation that part of the blood which has passed by the mouths of the lateral secretory canals the tumidity with which the oil when new separated abounds is sucked up by extremely small tubules of the venous kind opening into or communicating with the fatty cells and so the fat or oil remains more pure or unmixed  the use of the fat is in general to lubricate the parts that they may move and slip over one another easily and therefore muscles are plentifully supplied with it to prevent brittleness in the bones which for that reason are furnished with marrow for marrow and fat scarce differ at all from one another to temper and as it were sheath acrimony and lastly to fill up the chasms and interstices which without some such contrivance would be left between parts adjacent to each other thus procuring a beautiful sleekness to the skin in particular we have good reason to believe that the fat of the omentum or cawl where it is always found in considerable quantity if the subject is not very much emaciated is subservient to the functions of the liver and contributes toward the matter of the bile but i confine myself to the principal subject of this discourse  the efficient causes of corpulency may be deduced to these following  first the taking in of too large a quantity of food especially of the rich and oily kind with a suitable digestion every thing that nourishes contains oil more or less which however scanty in proportion to the other constituent parts is yet actually separated and extracted from them by the powers of the animal machine and as it were treasured up for it is proper uses horses cows sheep and many other animals thrive and fatten upon grass hay and even straw with water but the poorest diet that can nourish and tolerably support the human species contains much more oil than grass or straw oil may be pressed out of the farinaceous grains in common use animals of every kind however lean yet contain some fat and those we daily feed on a very great deal whoever therefore throws in a large quantity even of the plainest wholesome food at the same time lays in matter out of which corpulency is more likely to be produced than out of a more sparing measure thereof and beyond all doubt that effect will more speedily and certainly be brought about if the aliment is oily and rich provided it is rightly digested not that all corpulent persons are great eaters or all thin persons spare feeders we daily see instances of the contrary though a voracious appetite be one cause of corpulency it is not the only cause and very often not even the conditio sine qua non thereof  secondly too lax a texture of the cellular or fatty membrane we have already mentioned whereby it is cells or vesicles are liable to be too easily distended and therefore receive and retain too great a quantity of fat and perhaps these cells may be originally of a larger size and capacity in some than in others this disposition may be connected with a general laxity of the solids but it may likewise be in a great measure local and subsist by itself there being no absurdity in supposing one part or set of parts in the human frame to be overrelaxed while the rest continue in a laudable state this particular cause of corpulency i incline to believe often runs in families it may likewise be connate that is interwoven with the original stamina and brought into the world by the infant though it is parents and ancestors had been otherwise constituted but no doubt it is much ofter acquired by the manner of living of the corpulent persons such as a plentiful rich relaxing diet a sedentary life much sleep an indolent tranquillity of mind warm bathing etc  thirdly such a mixture or crasis of the blood and it is serum as suffers the only parts to be too safely separated from it is other principles especially it is aqueous vehicle the whole being too weakly and imperfectly blended and united together this fault may either depend upon the general inaction of the solids whether constitutional or acquired and the chief means of bringing it on are as has been said plentiful luxurious diet and want of exercise or upon an overproportion of oily particles in the blood and it is serum which may require a greater energy in the solids though otherwise laudably constituted than they can exert in order to get the better of that excess and complete the union of the heterogeneous parts  fourthly and lastly corpulency is caused by a defective evacuation through the outlets of the body of that fat or oil which has been already separated from the blood and reposited in it is proper cells as whatever is alimentary contains oil if we did not daily expel part of it out of the body we should soon be buried under our own fat those who keep up for a considerable number of years nearly the same weight of body must discharge daily a quantity of oil or fat nearly equal to what they take in sweat urine foeces and no doubt insensible perspiration likewise all contain oil in an healthy state and therefore if they are not in a pretty constant way sufficiently charged therewith to balance the quantity constantly introduced with our meats and drinks corpulency must necessarily ensue this deficiency is i believe most frequently occasioned by a too sedentary way of life but it likewise may be influenced by the fats not being so easily dissolvible in and remixed with the blood as it should be in order to be readily enough brought to the emunctories and so may in some cases be a consequence of the cause described in the preceding paragraph for if the blood and it is serum has already too easily parted with it is oily particles that happened because in them the oil was not strongly enough united and blended with the other constituent principles and therefore the same quality of the blood and juices will render them so much the more unfit to redissolve and sweep it out of the cells in which it is laid up back into the channels of circulation and excretion  to recapitulate corpulency being an accumulation of too great a quantity of fat or animal oil in the vesicles of the membrana cellulosa wherever they are large enough to admit oily particles it can be caused either by the introduction of too much oil into the habit through the channels of nourishment whereby there is so much the greater chance of it is being retained in too great a quantity  or by the overlaxity or perhaps original overlargeness of the cells in which it is reposited disposing them to admit and retain an overproportion of it  or by such a crasis or temperament of the blood as renders it liable to part too easily with it is oily particles and let them be strained off in too great plenty by the secretory vessels  or lastly by a deficient evacuation or expulsion of oil already taken in and separated from the blood and laid up in it is cells through the outlets of the body  by one or more of these causes or perhaps all of them concurring in the same constitution and i think scarce by any other of moment can corpulency be produced and established  having enquired into the nature seat and efficient causes of corpulency we now proceed to lay down the rational methods of cure founded on the result of this our enquiry in the doing of which we shall but briefly treat of such things relating to the subject as are commonly known and delivered in books and be more full concerning the particular means we propose in order to diminish and keep under this burdensome state of body and prevent it is bad consequences to recommend and enforce the use of which this paper is principally intended  diseases like other faults and imperfections are in a general way to be attacked and conquered by remedies opposite or contrary to the causes that brought them on and that is exquisitely the case with respect to corpulency we shall therefore in delivering the method of cure follow the order in which we have treated of it is causes  and first the diet of corpulent persons ought to be as moderate in quantity as prudence may direct and ones patience can submit to celsus advises such to eat only one meal a day with us cutting off suppers may be substituted in the place of this rule as to how much food is to be taken at one time the best advice i can give is after eating such a quantity as is known in a common way to support persons in health and strength to stop as soon as the craving of the stomach will permit and so rise from table with an appetite in some cases it may be expedient to damp the stomach immediately before meals by eating fruits or sweetmeats by drinking a glass of sweet wine or other such safe means as ones own experience will best direct variety of dishes should not be made free with as they are apt to tempt one to transgress in quantity  with respect to quality the food of the corpulent should be lean and plain rather than rich and palatable celsus enumerates amongst the causes that fill or plump the body assumpta per cibus aut potus maxim dulcia and pinguia course brown bread is here preferable to the white finer sort as being more opening and less nourishing  roots greens and other esculent vegetables with a sparing quantity of butter difpose less to corpulency than animal foods as they contain less oil yield juices less viscid and pass more readily out of the body  wines in a general way are less feeding than malt liquors especially such as are thin sharp and old  acids and vinegar in particular have a remarkably emaciating quality but must be used sparingly and with caution  the cause of corpulency mentioned in the second place being a flabby relaxed state of the membranous texture in the cells of which the fat is collected the indication of cure answering thereto is to strengthen that texture so enabling it the better to resist distension and by it is contractile power to expel some part of it is contents in order to answer this end the more effectually it is requisite first to diminish if we can in a considerable degree the quantity of fat already contained in these cells that they may be the more at liberty to contract themselves and afterward remaining in a contracted state recover their tone in the next place we must take care so to concert measures in order to strengthen either the solids in general or the cellular texture where the fat is lodged in particular as neither to counteract the other methods directed against corpulency of which more in the sequel nor risk hurting the particular constitution we are treating cold bathing proper diet and exercise being supposed to go along bids fairest to answer the end we have in view but it will be both safer and more effectual after the bulk is considerably diminished than before and it ought never to be used without great caution lest it should prove hurtful in other respects for i scarce know any remedy that is more generally and more dangerously misapplied than cold bathing as to strengtheners taken inwardly whether under the title of diet or medicines they for the most part either whet the appetite or render the body costive both which are unfavourable to the cure of corpulency and upon that account they as well as cold bathing will come into use with greater advantage after the body is considerably reduced than before  the third cause of corpulency being too easy a separation of the oily particles of the blood from it is other contents especially the aqueous vehicle arising from a weak and imperfect union of the different elements together what occurs to me as most directly tending to it is removal is  first by a spare and plain diet to withhold or at least diminish the daily fresh supplies of oily matter to the blood that the solids by whose action and energy that union and as it were cohesion of the principles of the blood effected may not have more work to do than enough and  next to excite the action of the solids which is to be done chiefly by exercise under which i comprehend friction or dry rubbing of the surface of the body especially the trunk as a meterial article and this kind of exercise is so much the more necessary to extremely corpulent persons that they can scarcely use any other with remarkable effect strengtheners that heat moderately if judiciously chosen may come in as auxiliaries  the cause of corpulency assigned in the fourth and last place being a defective evacuation through the outlets of the body of the animal oil or fat already taken in the curative indication naturally arising therefrom is to promote and increase that discharge by the safest and most effectual methods that so the daily waste of the oily parts being brought to exceed the constant supplies thereof the quantity remaining within the habit may be properly diminished now the common natural excretions to wit urine foeces sweat and insensible perspiration being in a healthy state always more or less charged with animal oil its expulsion is to be procured through these channels and indeed it can scarce be brought about any other way without violence to the constitution if therefore one or more of these excretions be increased with safety to the general health and without lessening proportionably the rest the quantity of fat in the body must in time be diminished  insensible perspiration in our climate can carry off but little oil especially in corpulent persons where the extraordinary accumulation of fat under the skin must compress the arteries that go to it through the small excretory vessels that arise from which the matter of perspiration passes and is conveyed off and therefore no mighty stress is to be laid upon promoting that discharge more than what friction may effect  frequent purging if it could be safely brought on would no doubt be a speedy and effectual means of reducing corpulency we see often in practice what vast quantities of animal juices all which contain oil more or less are evacuated per annum in a diarrhaea or cholera morbus and how much the patient is emaciated thereby in not many hours but it is dangerous to proceed far this way by art purgatives often exhibited besides weakening the general habit by carrying off the nutritive serum hurt the stomach through which they must pass and the intestines still more where they exert their principal efficacy and must remain longer they may bring on dysenteries and ulcerations of the guts with all their direful train of symptoms by abating the natural mucus of the parts dysenteries hemorrhoids etc what therefore is most advisable to be done by the corpulent person in this respect is to use such a diet and manner of living as may prevent costiveness and occasionally take safe openers in small doses and no oftener than is necessary to remove it aloetic medicines are here preferable to rhubarb except where piles are troublesome as they are less apt to leave a binding quality after their operation is over walking in a general way promotes the evacuation per anum riding as well as a sedetary life encourages costiveness  sweat seems to contain more oil than the other fluid excretions and therefore promoting it often if it could be done safely and conveniently might no doubt be of the highest efficacy in reducing a corpulent habit  the safest way of raising sweat is by increased muscular motion as walking hard playing at tennis exercising some laborious mechanic employment or the like the next safest way in my opinion is by moist heat as in a bagnio medicines given to sweat upon besides the uncertainty of their operation may do hurt by overheating and by changing the crasis of the blood and juices for the worse if they are frequently administered  the last of the natural excretions by which animal oil is carried out of the body is urine the urine of a sound person made after a due concoction of the aliments and chyle contains an animal oil exalted by repeated circulations and the heat of the body and tending somewhat to the volatile and putrid as all chemists of note agree now as the excretion of urine may be promoted by a variety of diuretics with less shock to the constitution than that by sweat or stools and with tolerable certainty too where there is no morbid obstruction of the passages it would appear highly reasonable to conclude that animal oil may both more safely and more effectually in the end be discharged out of the body through the channels of urine than by any of the other ways already treated of as the increasing of that evacuation can be brought about more constantly and uniformly and longer persisted in because attended with less danger or inconveniency but that diureticts may be employed to the best advantage in order to discharge the animal oil and by that means reduce corpulency it is requisite to choose out of that extensive class of medicines such as besides increasing the quantity of urine may at the same time render the animal oil more mixible with the watery vehicle of the blood than otherwise it would be urine besides water which constitutes much the greatest part of it contains oil as has been already said an essential salt peculiar to itself resembling sal ammoniac in many respects but differing from it in some material properties and a fine subtilised earth abraded from the vessels by the constant motion of the liquids through them but it is the increase of the evacuation of the oil only that can diminish corpulency and therefore it is evident that such diuretics as are endowed with the property abovementioned are to have the preference here  now we are so happy as to be in possession of a diuretic medicine which has that quality in a singularly eminent degree and is withal so safe as that it may be taken in large quantities every day for years together without remarkably impairing the general health that medicine is soap which we shall here endeavor to prove both by reason and observation to be exquisitely proper for reducing corpulency in the safest and most effectual manner in a word its true remedy where it is curable  soap in general for there is a variety of soaps is a composition consisting of a vegetable fixed alcaline salt made by incineration and oil or fat whether animal or vegetable with the addition of quicklime in some form or other intimately and inseparably incorporated together by boiling according to art quicklime by the assistance of boiling has been found by experience to be the fittest bond of union between these two so different and repugnant substances without which it cannot be completely effected at least not so easily and commodiously soap as is well known is entirely dissolvable in soft water and that solution assisted by heat agitation and friction dissolves besides gums and resins likewise oil and animal fat incorporating them with itself thus fitting them to be scoured and washed off from the substances they adhere to and therefore its general as well as its original use is to clean clothes especially linen when soiled with animal filth in which oil is the predominant ingredient as being both most penetrating and adhering most obstinately at the same time cementing with itself other soiling particles of whatever kind and yet by the means of soap they are easily restored to cleanness sweetness and whiteness  it is less to be wondered that soap should have been introduced into the regular practice of physic as an inward medicine considering its wonderful dissolving virtue than that it was introduced so late in lemerys dictionaire des drogues first published at paris in      the fullest and most noted book of its kind in the hands of the public at that time and for some years after there is no mention made of the internal use of soap it has been much used inwardly since and deservedly held in great esteem as a resolvent detergent and deobstruent and of late as a lithontriptic it is found to be a diuretic of the milder sort the great run of mrs stephens medicines both as published by herself and as since new modeled and amended not to mention numberless cases well known to the public in which soap has been given for the stone either by itself or with lime water sufficiently evince its safety whole ounces having been exhibited every day for years together without remarkably injuring the constitution  as therefore soap is diuretic has a singular power of rendering oil or fat mixible with water and withal is so fafe as that it may be given in large quantities and its use long continued we may fairly conclude that it is a most effectual harmless and easy remedy for reducing corpulency and to sum up all more to be depended upon than any other yet proposed this will farther appear from the following considerations persons inclined to corpulency seldom think on reducing their size till they grow very bulky and then they scarce can or will use exercise enough to be remarkably serviceable it becomes a great trouble to them indolence usually gets the better of resolution and feeds the growing evil until what was at first only disagreeable and difficult becomes at length impracticable  where a rich and plentiful diet is one principal cause of corpulency as it often is the habits of good eating and drinking becomes so deeply rivetted as scarce to be conquered a luxurious table a keen appetite and good company are temptations to exceed often too strong for human nature to resist sweating and purging for the increase of insensible perspiration as has been already observed is herein insignificant though very proper now and then yet cannot be used with safety frequently and constantly enough to do the business by itself and atone for errors in point of regimen  whereas soap may be safely used in large quantities every day for years together  it is no small additional recommendation in favor of this remedy that it is highly proper for relieving complaints and curing diseases arising from corpulency even independently on diminishing it such as amongst the chronic tribe short windedness lethargy etc of the acute kind bastard peripneumonics which are more difficult to cure in very sat persons than others and in general whatever disorders may be owing to viscidity of juices a never failing attendant on plenitude and defect of motion but to prosecute this head farther would lead us beyond the bounds we have at present prescribed to ourselves  we now proceed to take into consideration the manner of exhibiting soap with a view to reduce corpulency and first let us choose the fittest kind for that purpose spanish soap particularly that from alicant is at present most esteemed for inward use and although in the observation i am going to relate the common home made castile soap was used yet i hesitate not to give the preference to that from alicant it is not only a more cleanly and less disagreeable medicine but is much more easily dissolved in water and therefore must answer better in every intention where soap is required  as to the manner of exhibiting it i think once a day may be sufficient and i apprehend the properest time is at night when going to bed a dram the eighth part of an ounce may be tried for the first four or five days and if that creates no remarkable disorder in the stomach or bowels the quantity should be increased to two three and in very stubborn cases to four drachms which last dose i think needs not in any case to be exceeded it may be taken either sliced down small and made into the form of a bolus or electuary with any palatable syrup as that made with orange or citron peel or it may be swallowed in the shape of pills or it may be dissolved in a gill or more of soft water and so drank  this course should be continued at least three months in order to give it a fair trial in which time without great errors on the corpulent persons side i think it highly probable that remarkable benefit will be felt in a common way if good service is really done the patient will at least ought to be encouraged to go on if his patience should sometimes be tired out he may intermit the use of the remedy for some days and afterward resume it for three or four months longer and so on dropping or renewing the course as his own direction or skilful advice may best direct  the following case will i hope greatly both illustrate and confirm what has been hitherto said a worthy acquaintance of mine a judicious and experienced physician in his younger days had been very active and used much exercise both on foot and on horseback and for many years seemed as little liable to extreme corpulency as most people by insensible degrees as he diminished his daily labors satness stole upon him and kept increasing insomuch that when i met with him about six years ago i found him in the greatest distress through mere corpulency of any person not exceeding middle age i ever knew he was then about fortyfive he was obliged to ride from house to house to visit his patients in the town where he practiced being quite unable to walk an hundred yards at a stretch and was in no small degree lethargic in other respects he seemed pretty clear of any remarkable disease except gout of which he had felt some not very violent attacks i warmly recommended the inward use of soap in order to reduce his corpulency as the only safe and effectual remedy in his case and a remedy which he might continue to use the longest i enforced my advice by the reasonings above urged of which he was too good a judge not to perceive their full cogency accordingly he began to take it july      at which time he weighed twenty stone and eleven pounds jockey weight a vast load for him to bear who is little above middle stature and withal small boned he took every night at bedtime a quarter of an ounce of common homemade castile soap dissolved in a quarter of a pint of soft water in about two or three months time he began to feel more freedom and an increase of activity which encouraged him to persevere and that he did with such success that in august      as he informs me in a letter now lying before me his bulk was reduced two whole stone weight and he could walk a mile with pleasure he had continued the use of the soap all the time between june      and august      with very short interruptions in the manner and quantity above mentioned it operated remarkably by urine without ever producing the least troublesome effect and now while i am sending these pages to the press april    0 i am certainly informed that he is hearty and well  these facts are well known all over the town where my friend resides and it is neighborhood and it is the general opinion that had it not been for the relief that was then given him he must have been in his grave long before now let me add that he used no other method or medicine all the while to which the extraordinary change in his favor can with any color of reason be imputed  i have taken opportunities of recommending the same remedy to others in similar circumstances but have not been as yet informed of any case in which a thorough trial thereof was made however as it proved so signally serviceable in the instance abovementioned under such disadvantages i hope it may be fairly concluded it may prove useful in a general way at least in cases less stubborn which consideration is sufficient to recommend it to the attention of physicians and the public  finis this day is
