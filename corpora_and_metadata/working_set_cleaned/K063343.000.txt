housebreakers and all sorts of thieves and i hope my unhappy fate will be a warning to all persons against the committing such crimes as i sadly lament and am to suffer for as the just rewards of my evil deeds i beg leave to say that i was born of honest parents at salisbury who gave me a sober and solid education and when i left my school they put me to an honest trade a cordwainer to which i served my apprenticeship at my first falling into this wicked course of life being short of money i made bold to rob a chandlers shop of the moneybox of about  0 s at collingbourn in the county of wilts and got clear off without being any ways suspected some time after that my master sent me one sunday to another chandlersshop to get him a shillingsworth of halfpence and there being no body at home i cut the bar of the window off and got in and rifled all the shop i took all the money i could find it being about three half crowns and out of a merry frolic i brought away all the raisins and currants that were in the shop and they was like to betray me but i stood it out with a great assurance and so i got off i was however searched for the money but i had hid it in a parcel of nettles but in their searching of me they found some of the raisins in my coatpocket but as usual i insisted upon it that i bought them at andover market the saturday before and they could not disprove me so i got clear off some short time after my master sending me to andover market with five pound to buy some leather another boy and i agreed together to feign a story as if i had been robbed of the money so i went home and told my master that i was robbed and brought the other boy who was concerned with me who vouched it to be true so the boy and i shared the five pound between us this was done near lurgershel in wiltshire  my master sometime after that sent me amongst his customers to get in some money which was due to him upon which i got up about three pound and as soon as i received it i went off with it and made the best of my way for salisbury in wiltshire as soon as i came there i got acquainted with a young woman and with her assistance and my own we soon spent the money when madam found the money gone she marched off too and then i was put to my shift going one market day into the market i spied a young woman and saw her receive some money then i watched her till she left the town when i followed her and overtook her and knocked her down and robbed her of what money she had afterward i made her go into the wood where i made her comply to my lustful desire after i had my will of her i tied her to a tree and there left her this robbery was committed about two miles from salisbury afterward i made my addresses to a young woman at a place called forthingbridge in hampshire i went there to work journey work and so became acquainted with her but after some small acquaintance i went to lodge at her mothers and that was what i wanted after i had lodged some short time there i made bold to take up my lodging with the daughter which occasioned a swelling in her belly finding herself with child she and i consulted to rob her mother which we did of twenty pounds after that we made the best of our way for bristol there we lived upon the reversion of the money till it was all gone then she returned once more to pay another visit to her mother where the good old woman received her and the child with abundance of joy i thought it not proper for me to appear therefore i made the best of my way and left the good old woman to take care of her dutiful daughter and grandchild  after this i made the best of my way to see my mother at salisbury i had not been long with her but i took an opportunity to rob her of fifty pounds and went immediately for bristol and there gamed best part of the money away then i took to work at my trade again and from bristol i went to a place called thornbury in gloucestershire and there i came acquainted with one mrs low a widow woman where we lived together about six months and we took the town in for about  0 l then we sold all off and went to a place called weekware and there the biter was bit for i agreed with a collier to go partners with him and was to give him  0 l whereof i gave him  0 l down and was to pay him the other monthly but before i came to pay the first payment my very good friend the collier went off of the ground and so the biter was bit indeed so i packed up my awls and came packing away from thence  from thence i went to a place called bartley in gloucestershire and there i worked very honestly for sometime till i was known by a man that came from thornbury and was obliged to move farther for fear of being betrayed so i packed up my awls there likewise and went to hereford city and worked there very honestly till one night i was in company with a higler and he said he was a going to a place called ross to buy some fowls i readily replied i dont care if i go along with you he said he should be very glad of my company but poor man he little thought i should deprive him of his journey the next day accordingly we set out and had not gone above four miles but i attacked my fellowtraveller and robbed him of two shillings i thought that but a very small matter of money for him to buy poultry with therefore i had a thought came into my head to search the hampers and accordingly i did where i found twelve pounds so i left him his hampers to look on but his horse i took and rid him about  0 miles and then turned him loose after that i went to marlborough in wiltshire and stayed there about a fortnight there i was taken and put into marlborough goal for a silver pint mug where i remained about a fortnight but one night i took an opportunity and made my escape and never had the manners to take my leave of my new landlord which gave me some uneasiness but that soon went off  from thence i went to see an aunt of mine at a place called douton within seven or eight miles of salisbury and there i remained till my uncle and aunt began to have words about me but the first opportunity i had i took my leave of my uncle and aunt and went afterward to my own sister and there lived with her about six months and i met with an old playmate where we renewed our former acquaintance and began to play some of our old former pranks for we thought what we took from our own friends was our own and no robbery we having in our opinion as much right to it as them so we very dishonestly and he like an undutiful son began with his own mother and robbed her to the value of about fifty shillings or three pounds and then we returned to our old course of life gaming as we had done before but we was disappointed of our aim for we was soon apprehended and taken and brought home to his mothers where we were mightily persuaded to own the robbery but we as usual brazend it out but after all they carried us before a justice of the peace and he very honestly committed us to bridewell where not approving of our new lodging we thought it not convenient for us to stay therefore we made our way through the necessaryhouse without so much as taking leave of our landlord  afterward i turned jockey and went to horsecoursing and took as many horses one spring out of the kings newforest near rumsay in hampshire as i sold for above threescore pounds at thirty and forty shillings apiece they were none of your large horses but only little foresters and indeed i went so often that i was ashamed to go any more for fear that the people should think much of my coming so i thought it best to leave off in time but soon after i stole a horse and set up a new trade but do not think it proper to name the man that i stole the horse from because the owner of it is alive and he knows me i went to work and the first man i met with in that way was one mr whitehead a painter and i robbed him of eighteen shillings and a platebuttoncoat and coming bravely off of that put more courage into me and i bought me a pair of pistols with some of the money for i had but one before and then i was stocked very well and so i proceeded on too  the next adventure which was with an old man that was going to market to buy a pig but i soon stopped his journey and robbed him and took what money he had away from him and sent him home about his business the man is since dead he lived at a place called whiteparish near salisbury his name was john price a tailor afterward i went on with my old or rather new game and with abundance of courage having pretty good success the next that i met with was a butterwoman coming from rumsaymarket and i robbed her of twelve shillings and made her go about her business she had not been gone long but came by a servantmaid just out of place so i made bold to rifle her of all the money she had the sum mounted to three and fifty shillings and a ring from her and after having served her so i thought it pity to let her carry a box of luggage and eased her of that also in the box i found two suits of clothes and linen and other necessaries which served for traveling charges so i came away about my business  from thence i went to winchester and there i disposed of the box of clothes and afterward i went to the cock alehouse in high street and after sometime drinking i fell into discourse with a laceman about traveling till the laceman told me he was going to amsbury fair in wiltshire i told him i was going that way too so at night when we got to amsbury and put up our horses at the sign of the choppingknife at one mr hedgess from whence the laceman went out to take a standing for to sell his goods in and the while he was gone i went to the landlord and asked him for my partners box of lace and he gave it to me and i went to the hostler and got my horse and away i went and left the landlord and the laceman to agree  the next i met with a bonny scot traveling over the plain going toward the devizes and i said well overtaken mr johnson and he said how mon how done you but he did not know me but i knew him so asked him if he had any good handkerchiefs and said yea he put down his pack and opened it and showed me several sorts of goods among which i saw a large quantity of hair which is a good commodity so i said to my friend johnson that i did not want to buy any thing of him for i must have them for nothing but he began to make words about that and was going to be obstropolous till i showed him the pistols and then he begged very heartily not for to use him ill and take all that he had upon which i took him about forty yards from his pack and there tied him to the post of a well and then went and searched the pack all over and found therein nine pounds odd money and a great parcel of hair as much as i sold at marlborough for eight pounds i also took six dozen of handkerchiefs and a quantity of muslin all that was light carriage and when i had took as much as i thought proper i went and released the scotchman from the well that he might take care of his pack again and then i took my leave of mr johnson and he paid his respects in a very handsome manner but it was more out of fear than love  after i had parted from the scotchman i met with a jolly shepherd that had been at a place called burfetfair in wiltshire and had sold a quantity of sheep for his master but that was a mistake of mine to say that he sold them for his master i should rather have said he had sold them for me for i met him at a place called humington about two miles from the fair where he sold the sheep and there i attacked him but he was a good old fellow for before he would part with his money he would have a duel i was loath to kill him because he was a brave fellow so i fought him with my hanger till the old fellow yielded and then i rifled him all over and took from him seventy odd pounds which he had received for the sheep upon which he said that if he had had his crook he would not a lost his money without he had been killed but as i have not my weapon says he i must submit and so he went homewards about his business after which i went away about mine also to a place called dortchester in dorsetshire and there i stayed till best part of my money was wasted where i took up with a broken butcher to be my companion but i was dubious of him for fear that his heart should fail him but it did not for he proved to be a good fellow and so we agreed very well together for some time till he began to sink some of the moneys out of our stock but i found him out and told him of it and he owned it but said he never would do so no more and so we agreed and went on together  then the butcher and i went to a place called woodburyhillfair in dorsetshire and there we tarried till the fair was over and then our fair began we attacked a man that had been selling of cheeses but he had but a small matter of money about him for he had paid it away for we see him receive above fourscore pounds but when we came to search him he had not above twelve pounds about him on which we fell a cursing our hard fortune and we gave him four or five good licks with our whips and bid him never pay money away when gentlemen waited to receive it but the old man went homewards very heavy hearted as it was we did not take above twelve pound from him which was but a small trifle to what we expected and so we left the honest cheesman  the next was an honest hopmerchant who answered our expectation very well but we may thank his wife for our booty for when we begun to search him we did not find any money about him till we began to curse and swear and said we would kill him and then the good wife cried out do not kill him and i will tell you where the money is so i asked her and she said it was in his boots upon which i took my knife out of my pocket and cut his boots off of his legs and there found in his boots fifty guineas which i liked the looks of very well so i took and put them in my pocket and we went smiling away about our business returning thanks to the good woman for our booty  from thence i and my friend went away together from woodburyhill to a place called sherbourn and there we staid and took our pleasure for some time and we got each of us a fine lass to divert us by the way so we staid and enjoyed our selves as well as we could for some time when we had information of a grasier going further down into the country to buy some lean beast to fatten upon which we went after him and robbed him of all the money he had which was fourscore and ten pounds with which we diverted our selves and came back again in hopes of more business and went to a place called ringwood in hampshire and there my friend happened to fall sick and lay for some time till that money was almost consumed and then growing pretty well again i took him down to the bath with me where we staid about six weeks and then we fell to work again and robbed the stage coaches going from bath to london and took them as they came back again from london to the bath and continued that practice till they were obliged to hire people to guard the coach to and fro as it passed from bath to london and from london to the bath we robbed the stage for six weeks together as it passed to and fro every time but once we were like to receive damage by a gentleman in the coach for as we went up to demand the money the gentleman fired a blunderbuss at us but missed us both however we robbed them afterward and well horsewhippd the gentleman for his reward and then we came away about other business of the like nature  the next adventure was at a place called hungerford and there we staid for two months where i made up a match for my friend to be married to a widow woman one of his own trade so we lived very well there till such time we were blowed by somebody that knew us and was very near being taken but by good conduct we got away safe and came to newberry which was not a great ways from the place where we was put to the rout that did not put any stop to our proceedings we met with a tallowchandler not far from newberry and we robbed him of what he had then we concluded to go and see one of the wonders of the country a place called stoneage where we staid about three or four days and then we concluded to make our way further from our enemies and agreed to come to london which accordingly we did and proceeded on our journey till we came to reading and there we was like to be taken again by the bath stage coachman but i and my friend were pretty well mounted and by good luck got away and rode that night and the next day from reading to exeter in devonshire and there we were safe so we remained there about three weeks but being very uneasy in our minds for fear we should be taken we agreed to part by consent and accordingly we did and he went back to dorchester again and i set out for salisbury to see my friends and staid there about a week after which i set out again for london once more by a round about way and in coming to london i met with four young sparks who were going for oxford but the merry joke was that after i had attacked and had searched them i could not find any money about two of them but the other two i had rifled and took from them their money and watches and was riding away therewith they called to me and told me that their companions had money about them so i went to work again and at last i found money upon one of them planted under the buttons of his coat and eased him of ten guineas i found there his watch he had conveyed into his codpiece but happening to find it there i made bold to keep it the other had his money planted in the cape of his coat that goes round his collar and his watch he had conveyed to one of his companions but being willing that they should be served all alike he held the watch in his hand with the chain hanging down that i might see it which i did and took it from him and then they could not laugh one at another for i am sure they had no occasion because they were served all alike i have laughed at the fancy many times to think of their telling of the others having money about them but i did not like them never the worse when i heard them speak of it because when i found it i did not grudge my time of looking for it otherwise i should have thought much of my time so i took my leave of them and came my ways for london  when i came to london i lived very honest and went to work journeywork at my trade and lodged at one mr rickets a shoemaker in harpalley shoelane and there worked for about six months for mr holliday shoemaker upon ludgate hill and from thence i moved into leatherlane in holbourn and there i worked almost twelvemonths till at last i took up with a harlot of the town i had not kept her company more then six days but she was arrested and carried to the marshalsea and the next day i got her bailed out and then they arrested her in the boroughcourt and i bailed her again and brought her home with me to one mr woods a shoemaker in threelegalley near fetterlane but all this while this was to make a mouth of me and to take me in for some ready money but i had none then but i had a legacy of ten pounds a year in the exchequer and they were persuading me to sell it and at last i went to the exchange and to the jobbers for that purpose but i could not agree with them for it so at last i sold it to one mr littlefield a carpenter in st pauls churchyard and he gave me fourscore pounds for it and then my mistress was pleased for there was a great score to the landlord for rent and he swore and damned that he would send her to the marshalsea again if he had not his money that was to make me the more fonder of the froe but i paid them nothing at that time but i took her out a long with me into monmouthstreet and there i bought her a suit of blue flowered satin clothes and every thing else that was agreeable to ware with them and then we came home again and the house was like a mad house for money there was gd dm your blood you bh must you have such fine clothes and i must go without my money but you bh i will see you dd first then the old bawd came to me and sweetened me up with abundance of fine words and said my dyer your alice is a fine woman now she is dressed come let us have a quartern of brandy to drink mr dyer and his spouses good health mary go and fill another quartern of brandy and call mrs dyer to her spouse come mr dyer sit down and bring your wife with you is not mr dyer and his spouse a very likely couple moll you bh when will you have any body fall in love with you dingybh moll pray call your master and tell him that mr dyer wants to drink a glass of brandy with him so when the landlord comes he sits himself down and drinks a glass of brandy and takes me by the hand mr dyer pray do not be angry with me for having words with your wife for i cannot help it it is my passion and for want of money that makes me mad i tell you what mr dyer your spouse owes me almost nine pounds if you will give me five guineas i will give you a receipt for the whole so i thought for to save three or four pounds and paid him the five guineas and took a receipt in full well that was mighty pleasing to my madam well my dear i am very glad that it is paid come my dear said she let us take a walk and see mrs shelton and there we shall see my sister so away we goes and when we came to mrs sheltons the first compliment was pray mr dyer and mrs dyer how do you both do you was the last people that my tom and i was talking about we was talking about that small matter that your spouse owes us pray said i how much is it but two and forty shillings well i put my hand in my pocket and paid him and took a receipt  some short time after this transaction another woman and she fell out one of her fellow trade and one that knew her secrets and then she told me that there was no money due to mr wood when i paid him the five guineas nor there was none due to mrs shelton but that she wanted the money in her own pocket for she thought she would make hay while the sun shone well this passed on for some time and i took no farther notice about it at all but soon after that her husband came from sea and came and knocked at the door one morning about four oclock and asked if one mrs davis did not live there and i told him yes i did not know that she had a husband before for i took it for one of her culls till she looked out of the window and then she said my dear johnny it is my husband what shall i do so i put my clothes on and came down one pair of stairs and went to bed to another harlot and there lay till madam and her husband came down stairs so i went away about my business and came home at twelve a clock and my brother was gone aboard a ship but he came home at night and deprived me of my bedfellow but the cream of the jest was that my madam shamed jealous of the woman that i went to bed to but she was not jealous of me but of my money but however somebody had let her husband know that i kept her company but he took no notice of me but he cursed and swore every time he saw me but in short he arrested me and put me into the compter and i got bailed out again and then i arrested him for meat drink and lodging for his wife and i put him into the compter and there he remained a great while till at last he sent for me to come to him which i did so we came to an agreement he gave me a note of ten pounds and i let him out and have not seen him never since so farewell brother tar soon after that i was married to an honest woman and then i took a coblersstall in leatherlane and lived very well if i could have been contented but i was like a great many more young men did not love work but presently after that i had taken this stall a young man in the neighborhood that was a little low in the world and wanted money but did not know how to get any opened his mind to me one night as we was a walking in the fields and said he must go upon the highway or else he must go to prison so i asked him if ever he did any such thing he said no and i asked him if he had any pistols he said no but he would pledge his watch and buy a pair and accordingly he did and he and i went out one night together and at the old spaw we stopped a man and robbed him of his watch and two rings and what money he had which was not much it was about   or   s in silver and from thence we went farther into the fields and by sadlerswells we robbed another gentleman of his watch and one cipher ring with a heart in it and a pair of silver buckles his hat and wig and then we tied his hands and legs and came away and left him my companion thought that was a good and quick way to get money therefore he liked it so well that he kept to it so the next time that we went out we had better success than we had before for we stopped a gentlemans chariot up by pancraswash and robbed the gentleman and his lady to the value of  0 l in goods and money and so we came home  soon after which my friend and i met one mr lewen the late city marshal and robbed him to the sum of near eight pounds in hornseylane going toward muzzlehill and got safe away the same night we robbed two more men near pancras church of about four or five pounds and being weary we came home that night the next engagement was in the strand where we stopped a hackney coach and rifled the men all over but to a very little purpose and from thence we went to covent garden and there we picked up a molley and carried him to one corner of the rails and we took from him a silver watch and about fifteen shillings in money but the molleyingbitch had a goose with him which we made bold to take with us and we had it roasted the next day for dinner and made our selves very merry over it the next was a merry frolic which happened in lincolns innfields i and my consort one night set upon a man in lincolns innfields and robbed him and he went about his business as we thought but we staid there for some time after we robbed him we were surrounded with fifteen or sixteen watchmen they came in all four ways upon us that we did not know very well what to do but being both of a mind to be killed before we would be taken so the watchmen at last gathered themselves near together and were coming to look for us we did suppose but we did not give them the trouble for we went and met them and came as nigh them as we thought might without danger of hurting them and then we fired three pistols at them and in a quarter of an hour afterward if you would have given a hundred pound for a watchman you could not see one in the fields for happy was he that could run fastest  i hope i shall not be thought tedious in giving this true and plain account how i fell from the paths of virtue and a sober religious life in which my dear parents took great care to have rendered me an honest man i do not boast of my sins nor believe there is any real satisfaction in the doing what is ill contrary to the laws of god and man i humbly take shame to my self and do affirm that the foregoing narrative is in every part true i only rehearse it to warn young men especially to take notice by what degrees i fell into these crimes so that they may by the prudent use of gods grace be preserved from iniquities i have shown how masters may be wronged by their servants who follow such vices as i own i have done as well as to caution against the sad consequences of conversing with lewd women and as what i have already said was principally done in the country i shall now proceed plainly and briefly as i can to show what company and more pernicious adventures i have more lately been engaged in which has brought me to many dangerous misfortunes and rendered me liable to be prosecuted even by my vile companions whom often drawd me into this snare but as a landmark serves to warn the careful mariner of danger so i propose in the remaining part of this narrative impartially to discover such bold daring dangers and vile attempts as may secure honest men from danger for the future which may in some means convince the world of my sincere repentance i shall only beg leave to trouble my reader with two or three petty accounts of my actions that i may thereby render the most weighty matters contained in the following pages clear and of use to those who are so kind to read them  some little time after our escape in lincolns inn fields before mentioned i and my fellowmen robbed a gentleman and a woman at hydepark corner in a hackney coach of a silver watch snuff box and about four or five pounds in money and a small cipher ring the value of it was not very much but they was very desiring not to part with it which made us the more eager to keep it but we told the people that if it was not a diamond one they should have it again if they would let us know their names and where to direct for them they should have it again upon honor and accordingly we sent it to them to the deviltavern at charing cross in a pennypost letter for it was no service to us  some small time after we met a clergyman near the same place where we robbed him of all his money watch hat and wig and so came home for that night  the next prank we played was at hollowway going to highgate and there we robbed the barnet stage coach there was but two passengers in the coach and we rifled them both but they had but a small quantity of money about them not above thirty shillings between them we stayed there about all night till morning and met with the hogbutchers going to finchley to buy hogs but i believe it prevented their journey for they were obliged to go back again to fetch more money before they could proceed on their journey for we took from them between forty and fifty pounds and came away about our business but i fear they were obliged to sell bacon very dear to fetch up their money we took from them  the next was an honest baker if a baker can be so that we met coming from hampstead but he was very much in liquor and which obliged us to tie his hands and feet before we could do any thing with him and then we rifled him of twentyfive pounds a silver watch and two plain rings and left him in the fields  we next met with a hackneycoach coming from hampstead with two tailors and a woman in it we pulled the tailors out of the coach to search them and then we handed their lady out and rifled her also but she was worth both the tailors for she had a very handsome gold chain about her neck and two good rings on her fingers and a spanker in her pocket and seven or eight shillings in silver but the two poor tailors not above four shillings between them so we bid the coachman drive on and i gave him half a crown and bid him say nothing but when they came to tottenhamcourt turnpyke the coachman begun to cry out thieves and rogues on the road but he little thought that we was so nigh them for we heard every word they said and so they went on about their business but the coachman had better to have held his tongue and then he might have got home safe but he fared well and cried roastmeat upon which as soon as he had passed the turnpyke we stopped him and took the half crown from him that we had before given him and twelve shillings to boot and made him go about his business which we said would teach the fool more wit another time  in an other adventure i and my companion undertook to rob the salisbury wagon at knightsbridge there proved to be but one passenger in it who was a country fellow and going into the country he had but a small store of money about him and was very loath to part with it but we frighted him into a compliance and left him pennyless all he had was twelve shillings and sixpence we had not time nor proper opportunity to take out any boxes it being so near the town and people passing hardby who probably saw what we were doing but they and the waggoners finding our being armed with several pistols made free way for our escapes  the same day we took a tour to blackheath in kent where we met with a gentleman on horseback well mounted my partner suddenly took hold of his horse whilst i surprised the gentleman laying hold of him presented my pistol to his breast cocked and primd swearing  the lord in mercy pardon me that i would shoot him immediately if he did not instantly without any delay or making any noise deliver what he had and we took from him fourteen shillings in money and a handsome silver watch cutting his stirrups and horses bridle we left him unmounted not imagining he could or would attempt to follow after us but unexpectedly the enraged gentleman mended the broken bridle that he mounted again and pursued us with more rashness than with prudence for his own safety for he pursued us with so great have that he forced us to attack him in our own defense whilst we ran over the common whereas had he sliely followed us as he might have done we having not the least apprehension of his being mounted he might have easily apprehended us when he had found us in a conveniently place where he might have had assistance but he as i said before attacked us by himself that we were forced to unhorse him again to give him blows for his blows and then to bind him to strick obedience of our pleasure viz to lie quiet until we were out of sight and to speak the truth we left him secure until some might come to relieve him and for his horse we quite demolished his furniture and turned him loose and by this means got free from one of the most refractory chaps i ever met with in a word he acted as a person drunk or mad  we took our way by peckham to lambeth and so over the ferry and so home to spend the sad fruits of our abominable labor and shortly after as our wants required we took a journey to eppingforest where looking for our prey we met with a gentleman and his lady in a chaise we civilly accost them in our way desiring them to supply our want of money which we hoped they could conveniently spare which they being unwilling to do we took the boldness to oblige them to alight and showing our pistols the fear of death compelled them to submit to be searched and we found five guineas and some silver and a silver watch from the gentleman and a ring and silver snuff box from the lady who we used with great tenderness observing that she was in a great fright insomuch that they freely forgave us and would never prosecute us if it should be in their power and so we parted with great curtesy this booty served us a little while but we quickly turned out again choosing to change our horses apparel wigs and every thing that was remarkable about us  the next attempt we made was on hatfield common were we met a tallowchandler coming from ware who was well mounted and somewhat obstinate however we took from him eleven guineas and about seven or eight shillings in silver we left him unhorsd and made the best and surest way we could back to town immediately after we met a gentleman very drunk on tower hill of whom we took five pounds in silver his hat and wig after he had been very rustical and fought with us we were forced to prevent his clamor and noise for he began to cry out aloud for help but we left him on the ground and took prudently to our heels the same morning we made our way home by doctorscommons where we desired a gentleman to speak with us and telling him our business was wanting money we begged that he would spare what he had about him the gentleman was greatly surpised seeing our commission a pistol begged of us not to kill him i said no sir we will not hurt your body it is your money we want and that we must and will have we were forced to rifle him and took about thirty five shillings he did  stage much that is our cant word for crying out so we left him and found no manner of annoyance from the watchmen or otherwise  coming to fleetditch in harp alley we met with a person who for some reasons i believe was a grocer he was surprised and stopped by us we took from him fourteen shillings a watch and a cane which he was pretty easy to part withal after we had put him into a trembling fit a few days after we and our doxies having consumed the product of our illgotten pelf we turned into grays innlane in our common road like birds of prey and there we met with one of the disturbers of human society i mean a petty fogging lawyer as he called himself who upon our attacking him told us his employ and would argue with us with the consideration of the great danger we should bring upon ourselves by provoking a person of his knowledge how to find us out he knew many thieves and highwaymen some had been his clients and as for the thieftakers he knew all in or about london and westminster we had dragged him partly by force and gentle persuasions to a convenient dark silent place under the walls and found him so diverting that i desired my partners to let him go but one of them had felt his pocket and said there was swag in it and obliged me to consent that he might rifle his pocket where they found thirty odd shillings and one of them took his sword gilt handle of little value the poor gentleman was obliged to submit and has since made a most sad complaint to some of my acquaintance who assures me that he pretended in grays inn to have lost a great sum of his clients money we left him in a quiet temper and much i fear some thieves as well as honest men have dearly paid for this robbery which was done very lately in the last long vacation  another very late crime i committed with my companion was on a victualler who having been merry with his friends abroad was reeling over bloomsburymarket betwixt one and two in the morning we attacked him and he pleasantly asked what we meant what we wanted our reply was still the same we were men of fortune and money was our game we had no time the place would not admit of a long dispute we flung him down stopped his mouth not to hurt him then took from a silver watch seventeen shillings in money two plain rings and his buckles out of his shoes and so wished him better fortune for the future  afterward in tottenham court road we met with a man coming to town we seized him by surprise and took from him fortyfour shillings and the man was as joyful to be rid of our company as we were to be free from him i prevented his being stripped of his clothes for i ever abhorred to leave any person naked or to offer any violence to modest women but have often restrained the rude and cruel behavior of my unhappy acquaintance when such attempts have been designed  another late exploit was returning to chelsea road where we met with two gardiners coming drunk from market they proved very troublesome awhile but we were too strong for them and our usual arms afrighted them to a compliance so we took    s from them and they having warm great coats and my companions wanting them took the freedom to take them and tied them back to back disabling them from pursuing us in the long field we robbed mr homes commonly called lord homes a clerk at chelsea he had a guinea and a steel seal which was all he had about him but the patrole coming that way which we were aware off we made our escape with great precipitation other crimes we committed and laid wait to do to the prejudice of great men and particular private families which may not in the reading be unacceptable to the reader  i not long ago meet with a person of some distinction well known in this town of the sordid vile company of sodamites i was clean dressed and looked fresh in lincolns end fields he pretended after several times turning and looking hard at me to know me and desired me as i went along to go and drink a glass of wine with him at a tavern which i consented to do and he going to the drawer desired a good room up stairs who carried us into a room next the street which happened luckily to my purpose for this gentleman who is in years was very amorous upon me and would by all means treat me with a fowl or any thing i could eat which was ordered accordingly and whilst it was getting ready he took a diamond ring from his finger saying it was a rich stone i begged the favor to see if my finger was not bigger then his which he granted and presently after i had it on i being near the window and seeing a coach going by i called out stop coach pretending i had a friend in the coach that i wanted to speak with i ran down stairs and so went off with the ring i shortly after met the same gentleman under the great arch in lincolns innfields who in a surpize told me he wondered that i carried away his ring i gave him a surley answer and so he went quietly away  a whipmakers house in holbourn we broke open and took a quantity of whips from him one saturday night and we came away safe  the next was a shoemakers shop in wildcourt near drury lane and there i and my companions took away all the shoes the man had in his shop and likewise came off safe that night  i am my companion had a mind for a hollow bit so we opened a poulterers shop in claremarket with a false key and took a dozen of chickens and two turkeys for our selves and doxies just for our own spending for soon after one of our doxies layin and with the help of those chickens and two turkeys we made a grand christening were we had some of our own fraternity and doxies but my companion and i never had the good manners to invite the poulterer and his wife  not long since we met a man in kirbystreet near hattongarden and we knocked him down and robbed him of his hat and whig and that was all for we were disturbed from doing any more for the watch came and surrounded us that we was obliged to fire before we could get away but by good luck we got off safe  then we broke open a linen drapers shop at the sign of the maidenhead in piccadilly there we took a great quantity of linen as much as two of us could well bring away and came off with it without being discovered  n b the two last robberies i was capitally convicted for at the last sessions at the oldbailey and am to suffer tomorrow at tyburn for them  finis postscript good people i desire of all young men to take warning by my ignominious death and to forsake evil company especially lewd women who has been the chief cause of my unhappy fate i hope and make it my earnest request no body will be so ill christians as to reflect on my aged parents who took an early care to instruct me and brought me up a member though a very unworthy one of the church of england i hope my misfortunes will be a warning to all youth especially some whom i wish well i will not name them but hope if they see this they will take it to themselves i die in charity with all men forgiving hoping to be forgiven my self through the merits of  blessed savior jesus christ
