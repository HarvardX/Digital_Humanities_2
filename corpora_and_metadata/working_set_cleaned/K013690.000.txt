speech of philip francis esquire in the house of commons on friday february         on the motion that it appears to this house that the principle of making loans for the public service by free and open competition uniformly professed by the chancellor of the exchequer has been very generally recognized as affording the fairest prospect of public advantage  london printed for j debrett opposite burlington house piccadily       speech of philip francis esquire etc etc house of commons friday   th february      mr francis said that although he was but little prepared and not at all inclined to enter far into the debate and though he was full of impatience and curiosity to know what the chancellor of the exchequer had to say for himself or whether he would be content to rest his defense on the ground taken and trust it to the arguments used by the learned gentleman nevertheless there were some passages in that gentlemans speech of which he thought himself bound not only as a member of parliament but especially as a diligent if not very active member of the committee to take some notice on those particulars i shall first endeavor to set the house right and to prevent their being misled not that the facts mistated by the learned gentleman are very material in themselves but because some serious conclusions have been fallaciously drawn from them i shall then endeavor to show that the learned gentleman in the general drift and tendency of his speech has labored to divert the attention of the house from the real object of the inquiry and to fix it on others not immediately in question or not essential to the point in issue namely whether the chancellor of the exchequer has or has not made a provident bargain for the public and if he has not to what motives his misconduct may fairly and rationally be imputed the first may possibly be proved the second can only be matter of moral inference or unavoidable conclusion and never the subject or very rarely of direct evidence no man accused has a right in the first instance to plead character against conduct or expect us to conclude that he has acted faithfully because the worst motives possible are not to be proved by witnesses against him almost the whole of the learned gentlemans speech has been a digression from the question he has incessantly traveled out of the record but i flatter myself that before i sit down i shall be able to bring him back to it  the learned gentleman has thought fit to open his defense of this transaction by a triumphant appeal to the opinion of the committee declared in the outset and stated in the front of their report viz that on the inspection of the lists as well as from the examination of the parties your committee see no ground to suppose that any interference took place on the part of any persons connected with government in the distribution of any partof the loan and this declaration he says was made with the unanimous concurrence of the committee and expressly of the chairman and his colleagues a description of a part of the committee not very parliamentary in point of form and perfectly unjust in its application the word colleague applied in that manner would have no meaning if it were not intended to intimate that the committee was banded into parties one of which was determined to censure and to condemn and that the opinion if agreed to by two or three of us who might be supposed to attend on the part of opposition must be unquestionably true in itself and in all its consequences now sir i can affirm for one and i believe it will not be denied by any that although i attended the committee constantly till the last two or three days when i conceived the business was in effect over and that nothing remained to close the proceedings but a repetition of the same formal question to the several subscribers i took but little part certainly not an eager part in the inquiry i asked some of the witnesses a very few questions and left it to the honorable gentlemen on the other side whose superior numbers generally ten to one gave them an absolute command of the inquiry to conduct it as they pleased i was not present when the preamble to the report was voted i had neither notice nor suspicion that it was intended to introduce such a declaration into a report of evidence otherwise assuredly i should have attended on purpose to oppose it in this sense then and with this explanation the resolution of the committee was not unanimous in any other the unanimity in which the learned gentleman triumphs proves nothing it was properly and exclusively the act of himself and his friends i now object to it as not only untrue in the available meaning and effect of unanimity which amounts to nothing unless it includes the opinion of your opponent but as utterly irregular and in every point of view inconclusive in the first place i affirm that the declaration whether true or not ought not to have been forced into the report the committee was appointed to inquire into the circumstances of the negotiation of the late loan and were empowered only to report the evidence as it should appear to them to the house on the result or effect of that evidence or any part of it they had no authority to report an opinion nor could they have it otherwise than by express terms in the resolution of the house but waving this objection which in limine is decisive let us consider a little what the declaration in itself amounts to and taken with all its circumstances what weight should be allowed to it the committee say that on inspection of the lists etc they see no ground to suppose that any interference has taken place etc be it so  is that enough does the contrary appear from the evidence if it does not the negative proposition leaves its own question untouched i know very well that the lists produced to the committee with respect to the interference in question prove nothing and that the publication of them was said to be withheld for fear of injuring bankers and other persons in business who were great subscribers and who might be suspected of not dividing fairly with their customers but if you look into the report you will find that sums little short of millions are still covered by single names the distribution of which was never known to the committee  for one example out of many  question to mr goldsmid  is the whole of the remainder amounting to     000l for yourself only  a no  q will you state to the committee how much of that sum is for yourself and the names of the persons among whom the remainder is distributed  a    000l is for my brother and myself as to the remaining  0 0000l i cannot give up a list as i was in honor bound not to do so  with a number of such facts before us is it possible to contend that any affirmative proof arises from an inspection of the lists or any other part of the evidence that no interference did take place on the part of any persons connected with government in the distribution of any part of the loan but unless that proposition be maintained the opinion of the committee is not only irregular but useless and unavailing to the purpose for which it was produced and insisted on by the learned gentleman these objections in my judgment are fatal to the opinion in itself let us see what importance it derives from the persons who concurred in it i am not speaking of the formal constitution of the committee but of the materials of which it was in fact composed individually without doubt the members who attended most diligently and who had an entire command of the proceedings are entitled to all manner of consideration and respect they are all honorable men and in proportion to their sense of honor most likely to be influenced in favor of their benefactor i shall describe them by their stations only and that i may do even that without a risk of offense i shall state the case in another form sufficient for my own purpose and not liable to an invidious construction suppose my right honorable friend near me had been chancellor of the exchequer and that a question had arisen concerning the integrity of his conduct in some transaction of his office i ask this house i ask every man of common sense who hears me whether the unanimous opinion of two secretaries of the treasury of two paymasters general and of twenty members of the boards of admiralty treasury and control all appointed by himself would have the weight of a feather to satisfy the world that his conduct had been pure and irreproachable on this part of the subject i shall only add that my right honorable friend whether guilty or innocent has too much discernment and knowledge of the world to rely on such miserable evidence for his acquittal i shall dwell but little on the other parts of the learned gentlemans speech because it appears to me that the whole of it runs in a false direction and that if his particular observations were ever so true they would not lead the house to a just conclusion on the body and substance of the transaction before us in defense or behalf of the proposed resolutions it would be in vain for me to address myself to the learned gentleman he has loudly declared that whether true or false he was determined to reject them all against so vigorous and intrepid an effort of resolution i know it would be in vain to apply any arguments of mine so i shall leave him undisturbed in the possession of it he has said a great deal with great asperity and i think with no little injustice against the credibility of mr morgans evidence grounded on the extreme interest which he supposes mr morgan to have had to misrepresent such parts of the ministers conduct as affected himself and to state them in his own favor he has also taken pains to prove that mr morgan was not injured and had no reason to complain well sir i at least have no personal interest in defending mr morgan i never saw him before the day when he first attended the committee and then i must confess that in his temper and deportment i saw no indications of deep design of cool thoughtful guarded cunning to judge of him by appearances there never was a man so little qualified by nature for the part of an impostor he must be an idiot indeed who could be imposed upon by mr morgan i gave him credit for what he said because he said nothing but what was probable on the other hand if with the most unimpeached character he had stated things utterly improbable his character alone would not have secured his evidence from suspicion in by much the greatest part of it he was supported by the concurring testimony of all the other witnesses on that assertion on which the learned gentleman denies that any credit is due to mr morgan and which as he affirms must have been a mere afterthought and subsequent invention when he knew the terms on which the loan was actually settled with mr boyd viz that on the   th of november if he had been called upon on that day he would have offered those terms for the loan which he stated to the committee and by which if they had been accepted an advantage of     00l would have accrued to the public i for one declare most solemnly that i give mr morgan entire credit because i know that on those terms the loan would still have been extremely profitable to the subscribers and because i have good reason to believe from particular inquiry that men of the first property in the city would have been glad to have gone halves with mr morgan in that bargain i do not mean now and with their present knowledge but on the   th of november and with all the circumstances in their view by which transactions of this sort are commonly governed as they actually stood on that day as to motives of a great interest which might influence the testimony and lessen the credit of mr morgan let it be remembered that all the competitors had an interest of the same kind and full as considerable as he had to believe by selection is mere partiality and indicates an interest in the examiner just as much as in the witness but what is all this to the purpose what have we to do with mr morgans interest or with the injury which in his own opinion or any other he is supposed to have suffered the learned gentleman travels out of the record in the resolutions now proposed to you by the chairman of the committee there is not a single word on either of those points the true and only object of inquiry both here and in the committee is whether the interest of the public was or was not faithfully guarded by their representative and trustee the chancellor of the exchequer whether the public has or has not been essentially injured by any act or omission of his in the settlement of that loan which he had at his sole disposal  but it seems mr morgan is not to be credited because he suspected the chancellor of the exchequer of collusion with mr boyd was he the only person to whom that suspicion ocurred  look at the evidence of mr mellish that gentlemans character at least is unsuspected when mr boyd and mr robarts were called out of the room at mr pitts on the   th of november i had a suspicion that it would not be by competition and said hey day a secret committee i believe sir i shall be able to make it appear that what then was suspicion to mr mellish should now be conviction to this house the learned gentleman objects with all possible vehemence and indignation to the two last resolutions as if they contained propositions palpably false or monstrously absurd the former asserts and to that part of it i confine myself at present that the loan was a gift to mr boyd the evidence proves that the chancellor of the exchequer who had uniformly professed and held up the principle of free and open competition and who had invited the competitors to his house to bid for the loan did on the   th of november for the first time and after a separate conference with one of the parties propose to the other competitors another principle of what is called a qualified competition which they instantly refused and which the governor of the bank tells you that in their place he would not have accepted mr boyd says we were very willing to leave the fixing of the price of the loan to the chancellor of the exchequer the governor of the bank says their answer was that they would trust to mr pitts candor and take it on his own terms and in a few minutes the loan was theirs if this be not a gift in all its effects i should be curious to hear the learned gentlemans definition of that word and supposing it a gift in what terms he would describe it the learned gentleman does not deny the previous conference alluded to in the third resolution but he objects to calling it separate the epithet it seems is invidious and calculated to convey a false idea of the conference as if it had been secret whereas it was held in presence of the governor and deputy governor of the bank  true it was so still the conference was separate in the terms and meaning of the resolution it was held with one of the parties while the other two were excluded the competitors were assembled by appointment from the chancellor of the exchequer to bid for the loan as they thought on equal terms the governor of the bank says that on the   d of november i asked him pointedly the question whether it was to be by competition and he told me certainly it would and that i might tell the gentlemen  and then my suspicions were done away when the parties meet the first thing that happens is a separate conference with one of them the next a proposal to the other two to bid for the loan on terms incompatible with the principle of free and open competition  the last of the resolutions is that which fills the learned gentleman with particular indignation which he can no way endure and which he will not only negative but substitute another of his own in the room of it now sir let this proposed resolution be ever so defective or ever so false and unjust he ought at all events to state it fairly he asks whether it be possible to advance a proposition more extravagant and absurd than that two millions and a half have been given to the contractors for the loan and lost to the public the learned gentleman is not very exact in stating large sums for shortness i suppose or to save time or to speak in round numbers he always calls it two millions and a half when the resolutions specify two millions one hundred and sixty thousand pounds at this precise sum the resolutions estimate the profits to the contributors at the expense of the nation but do not say that it was given to the contractors or that the whole of it was lost to the nation undoubtedly a fair and reasonable profit to the contributors ought to be allowed and deducted the remainder is evidently given away but the whole premium is truly stated as a profit to the contributor there is no other way of describing it at    per cent on eighteen millions it amounts to    0000l i know that at one period the premium on the loan rose to twelve and an half per cent and that some of the principal holders of omnium did not sell at that price or near it as they might have done because they expected it to rise to fifteen or sixteen and so it would without doubt if the expectations fallaciously held out by the kings message of the  th of december had not been defeated by the subsequent conduct of government what the real intention of the message was i know not but i know that it was calculated to answer a purpose that it had a considerable effect and that since that time the contents of it have been discarded and forgotten  i shall now endeavor sir to state to the house as briefly and distinctly as i can what in my judgment are not and then what are the true essential points in issue between those who applaud and those who condemn the conduct of the chancellor of the exchequer in this transaction and which alone deserve the attention of the house every attempt to shift the question or the charge from its real ground is in some degree an admission men of experience and ability who know the consequence would not resort to bad logic or to false ground if they felt themselves strong in fair and honorable argument on the real merits of the subject the line of examination which the right honorable gentlemans friends incessantly pursued in the committee tended to prove some propositions which were not in dispute the honorable secretary of the treasury i am sure will remember my having said expressly that the result though ever so favorable to him would be superfluous that it was a defense without a charge and that i cautioned him against the natural inference that must be drawn from that mode of proceeding they adhered to it in the committee and they rely upon it in the debate we shall see with what effect i assert then that admitting the learned gentleman to have proved to his own entire satisfaction that there is no ground to suspect the chancellor of the exchequer of having turned the loan to his own account or even of having distributed any portion of it among his friends in either house of parliament to reward or corrupt them which for the present i neither affirm nor deny he has proved nothing to the purpose he has resisted vigorously where there was no attack and exhibited great courage where there was no danger he knows very well how difficult if not impossible it is even in the grossest transactions to obtain direct proof of corruption between ministers and members of parliament he knows or ought to know that in the present case that sort of charge was never attempted my honorable friend who moved the inquiry not only did not lay prostitution or corruption to the charge of the minister in the sense taken by the learned gentleman but did expressly and repeatedly disclaim it so did i and others in the committee not that the contrary has by any means been made out in evidence of such propositions the negative is full as difficult to prove as the affirmative we said and we adhere to it that it appeared to us that a most improvident bargain had been made for the public we say now and we have proved it that in every part of the transaction of the late loan the public interest has been sacrificed by the chancellor of the exchequer if i am asked what could be his motives my answer is that i cannot penetrate into the hearts of men or judge of their intentions otherwise than by facts and circumstances and by a comparison between conduct and professions but that in this case in my opinion sufficient ground is laid for all the conclusions drawn by the resolutions that point shall be considered in its place if i am asked whether i suspect the right honorable gentleman of personal corruption in this business i answer frankly and without reserve no i scorn to insinuate what i do not believe neither do i pretend to have ground to believe that the loan was distributed among the members of this house and therefore i say nothing on that head the distribution in the city of london speaks for itself in that quarter undoubtedly i suspect that corruption was intended because i see the effect i see an exorbitant profit given and a corresponding conduct in those who received it but the chancellor of the exchequer in his own person is immaculate you may prove any thing else but since you cannot prove that he kept a share in the loan for his own use your objections and your charges signify nothing that is we have proved nothing because we have not proved what we did not allege but after all sir is it much to say for a man in his elevated situation for a man of his understanding that he is not vile enough and fool enough to take money in his office could he do it without the assistance of a middle man of an agent must he not employ a banyan and if he trusted himself to a third person in a business so full of danger and difficulty must he not be at once in the power of that person and his slave for ever in all these transactions there is undoubtedly a clear available profit to the minister but who is it suspects him of taking it in specie the thing is morally impossible i acquit him on his understanding  in all the preceding observations sir i have intended little more than to clear the ground and open my way to the body of the question i shall state it now in the only form in which i think it ought to be stated to a popular assembly and in which i can hope to make myself understood minute calculations of pounds or pence would not be attended to nor would they be intelligible at least with any explanations of mine i may not succeed in ascertaining the precise motives on which the chancellor of the exchequer has acted but that he has acted on motives inconsistent with his duty and that he has wilfully sacrificed the public interest in such a man i cannot attribute any thing to ignorance or surprise of which he was the appointed guardian the special trustee  these propositions i am sure i can make out by what evidence by a concurrence of undisputed facts and of circumstances which cannot lie and all of them meeting in one central point the profit of the contractors i shall bring them together as closely and compare them as accurately as i can and then let it be seen whether so collected and so compared they do not amount to a moral proof whether they do not force you to a conclusion which whatever you may say the human mind is not made to resist judgment is not yet at the command of volition if it were the right honorable gentleman undoubtedly would be as secure of the esteem as he is of the partiality of this house on the present question it is not within the limits of possibility that their inclination and their judgment should really go together now sir i request the house in observing the facts to be attentive to the dates i need not stop to prove that to ascertain the quality of human actions the date is very often an essential part of the fact i shall state nothing in point of fact but what is proved and admitted first till the   d of november      it appears that the chancellor of the exchequer adhered to the principle which he had uniformly professed of free and open competition and that until the   th of november he did never express an intention of departing from that principle second by the evidence on which the eleventh resolution is founded it appears that mr boyds supposed right to object to the negotiation of a new loan was stated to the chancellor of the exchequer some time in october and that he promised to send to mr boyd and his party to hear what they had to say before any competition should take place but that at that time he seemed positively determined not to admit of their claim he never sent for mr boyd on the   d of november he still adhered to his plan of free and open competition and invited the competitors to meet him on the   th in order to bid on that principle the house will observe that i speak of facts as they appear on the surface of the evidence not as i think they really were after being reminded of his engagement to mr boyd first in a conversation and then by a letter of the   th of november he says on the   th that the circumstances had come but recently to his knowledge and that he did not admit any obligation to exist he seems to have forgotten not only his original engagement to mr boyd but the revival of it in october and indeed not to have been very much struck with the force of it when it was again detailed to him on the   th of november let us consider a little what this right and claim is which appears to have made so very slight an impression on the memory and judgment of the chancellor of the exchequer but to which at last he submits without resistance as if he were suddenly overpowered by a torrent of conviction in this place sir it may be proper for me to premise that whatever i say on these points is meant to be exclusively applied to the minister i have the pleasure of knowing mr boyd and shall always speak of him as i think with the greatest consideration  first of all i find from mr boyds letter that the contract for the loan of last year was entered into under the condition that no other public loan for this country should be made until the period fixed for the last payment of the loan then contracted for should have elapsed here the claim begins with a positive condition which if it could be proved would make all general arguments superfluous mr boyd allows that it was not reduced to a specific form and the chancellor of the exchequer has no recollection of it in a question of mere fact between him and mr boyd though rather too material to be readily forgotten i am willing to allow him the full benefit of a feeble memory but observe what the nature and qualities of this right are and then believe it if you can that a right so founded and so qualified should have escaped the attention of such a man as the chancellor of the exchequer or that when it was revived and brought back to his view it should have made so very slight an impression on his mind mr boyd says  it is a right founded in justice you may not remember an engagement but justice though often violated is not quite so easily forgotten this right is also founded in the nature of things a curious description certainly of a claim to lend money from a contractor to a chancellor of the exchequer or is it one of the rights of man newly imported from paris but it also partakes of the quality of a metaphysical right mr boyd contends that it was inherent and inalienable in him as contractor that in that character he could not separate himself from it and that as such his right and he were indissolubly attached to one another and would have continued so though he should have parted with all his share in the loan or even though he never should have held any part of it but only have acted as agent for the other contributors and though he himself admits that the contractors for the loan of      could not suffer any pecuniary loss by the introduction of a new loan otherwise than as holders of scrip his own words are but i do not understand that while i sell or alienate a part of the loan i transfer any of the inalienable and inherent right which belongs exclusively to me as a contractor this to me i confess sir is a new speculation and therefore it is possible that i may not be a proper judge of it but this i know that all the witnesses concur in a very different opinion viz that as there could be no pecuniary loss but to the holders of scrip all the contributors to the loan of      had as good a claim as the contractors to a preference for the succeeding loan in proportion to the amount of the shares in the loan of      then held by them respectively and that not one of them on that principle at least appears to have been considered in the present loan  but leaving this problem to shift for itself you will find that the right so claimed by the contractor has been recognized by constant practice and public opinion here comes a question of fact has it been the constant practice if it has you have a custom without an instance no similar case has been stated no example has been alleged to make good the affirmative the truth is that there never was a precedent in point the governor of the bank says he does not recollect any loan made for the receipts to come out before the others were totally extinct and that mr newland had looked back a great way but since the establishment of the bank no new loan has been made when two payments of the preceding one were not fulfilled as in the present case the asserted right of the contractor is therefore clearly not founded on constant practice but it would be treating such a proposition too gently if i contented myself with saying that it has not been proved there is a decisive fact on the other side of the question which annihilates the allegation of practice allow me to state this point distinctly the moment you understand it you must be convinced by it the contractors say they cannot relinquish their right without evident loss how are they to lose as holders of scrip belonging to the former loan by the introduction of eighteen millions more into the market but if you look to the evidence you will find there is one opinion in which all the witnesses agree viz to speak in the terms of the fourteenth resolution that the value of the existing funds is affected in a far greater degree by the negotiation for a new loan and the settlement of the terms thereof than by the making the deposit on such loan after it is settled mr boyd himself expressly objects to the negotiation of a new loan while payments on the former loan were depending because undoubtedly if injury be done to the holders of scrip it must be by the negotiation and terms not by the deposit now sir supposing this to be the truth as it certainly is it appears by the evidence in opposition to that constant practice and opinion alleged by mr boyd that before all the payments were completed on the loan for      a new loan for      was negociated with mr boyd while considerable sums of the preceding loan were outstanding yet the contributors to that loan did not object to such negotiation or make any complaint on account of it you will find the fact more precisely stated in the   th resolution i am not arguing now about the validity of mr boyds pretentions to a preference but supposing them to be good in the sense and to the effect stated is it possible they could be forgotten or if they were not valid why did they prevail it would not be difficult to assign a probable motive for the ministers conduct but as it would be said to amount to nothing but suspicion or conjecture i shall leave it to every man who observes the facts to conclude for himself there are still some material circumstances in this transaction very well worthy of your attention mr boyd obtains the preference if not as we call it a gift of the loan what follows he trusts to the candor of the chancellor of the exchequer and agrees to take it on his own terms what precedes  a singular fact in the beginning of november for the first time the commissioners appointed to buy up the public debt began to make purchases in the   per cent stock the bargain for the loan was fixed by the chancellor of the exchequer himself in the   per cents only that is he did every thing that depended on him to lower the value of that commodity which he meant to dispose of the   per cents rose of course by this new and unexpected investment of more than half a million in ready money whatever that advantage amounted to ought to have been given to the   per cents in which the bargain for the loan was concluded the learned gentleman says that in november      the purchases by the commissioners could not be made in the   per cent annuities because in that month the books of those annuities were shut so they were in      so they were in every preceding year the times at which the several books are shut in all the funds respectively never vary did that difficulty occur in      or      did the commissioners ever purchase in the   per cents before november last never again i say what follows the settlement of the loan another fact most singular in its appearance most important in its effect the chancellor of the exchequer makes the bargain on the   th of november but does not bring forward the budget till the  th of december on the length of that interval and its consequences i shall observe presently but here comes the questionable point of all the very day after the budget the minister delivers a message from his majesty from which all men concluded that a negotiation for peace was on foot or very likely to take place the value of the loan immediately rose above   per cent or  00000l on the capital which we affirm was to all intents and purposes a voluntary determined and premeditated gift to the contractors at the expense of the public if the chancellor of the exchequer should allege that this effect of the message was not to be foreseen or that in fact he did not foresee it i shall leave the first of those allegations to the judgment of the house and of the world the second i shall not contradict they who take him at his word must defend his integrity at the expense of his sagacity on a point that could not escape the meanest understanding in so gross a mistake it is not possible that common sense and common honesty should have acted together of the effect at least there can be no doubt no man will deny that if he had timed and graduated these several acts as he ought to have done i mean the loan the budget and the message the public might have had the benefit of that advance in the funds which was produced by the message  the   th resolution states in moderate terms that the interval of twelve days between the settlement and the budget is unusual and not likely to be productive of any advantage to the public the fact is that by any delay of the budget after the bargain the public cannot possibly gain but may possibly lose with respect to the contractors the direct reverse is the case if in that protracted interval political events of a favorable nature should happen by which the price of stocks should be considerably advanced the contractor has the whole benefit of the rise whereas if the contrary should happen whether by misfortunes abroad or any other sinister event and if in consequence the loan instead of bearing a premium of ten or twelve per cent should fall considerably under par what remedy has the public against the contractors or would they if they could enforce the contract to the ruin of the parties no sir we all know that it would not be attempted the learned gentleman admits with truth and candor that parliament in such a case of pure misfortune would relieve the contractor i say they would because they ought to do so for reasons of this nature it was formerly the constant rule not to conclude the bargain till the day before the budget even in later times the interval has seldom exceeded two days supposing that in a political view it might have been advisable to conclude the bargain for the loan at so very early a period of the session why did not the budget immediately follow if otherwise why might not the bargain have waited for the budget on this point one argument only has been urged with a great deal of pomp and emphasis namely that it was good policy to take the earliest moment possible after the meeting of parliament to exhibit to the enemy the extent of our resources and the facility with which the enormous capital of eighteen millions sterling could still be raised in this country it does not yet appear that this eager exhibition of our extravagance has made any material impression on the enemy as far as i can discover they have not yet been much appalled by it but be it so allow the policy to be good whether in this instance it succeeded or not how will the right honorable gentleman answer this question if the policy was good in november      it may be so equally in november      then why have you now for the first time introduced into the contract for the present loan a specific stipulation that no payment on any new loan shall be made till after the last payment on this loan that is till after the    th of december      how do you know that before that day it may not be indispensably necessary to raise another loan for the public service on your own principles you have disarmed your government of a powerful weapon or at least of an instrument of terror from which as you contend a great effect might be expected let the case be ever so pressing let the opportunity be ever so favorable your hands are tied you cannot resort to your own remedy without asking leave of the present contractors that is you must buy their consent by the gift of another loan which they in their turn will trust to the ministers candor and take it on his own terms  on the curious transaction of the hamburgh bills which i believe will furnish a clue to unravel the mysteries of the loan i purposely restrain myself at present an honorable gentleman near me having engaged to make it the object of a particular inquiry as it richly deserves one observation only is too pressing to be omitted the learned gentleman insists on the clear and unquestionable fairness of the measure though unusual in the mode now i ask him whether when these bills were brought into circulation the true nature of them was avowed was the discounter informed that the place and date were fictitious that they were drawn in london in september though dated from hamburgh in august if not the discounter was imposed upon i do not say that the intention was to defraud but it certainly was to deceive him if the truth had been declared would any banker have risqued the credit of his house by discounting such bills it does not appear that they were ever offered to the bank of england  now sir i call upon the house to put together the facts the circumstances the consequences and pretenses of the ministers conduct in this extraordinary transaction and leaving out of their consideration the collusion that appears or the motives that may be suspected to pronounce their verdict on the simple issue of fact has he or has he not made a most improvident bargain for the public if the fact be found the moral inference is obvious and unavoidable it need not be argued for it cannot be resisted nevertheless sir speaking now for myself alone i declare that i am ready to wave every one of the objections i have stated and even to join with his friends in a vote of acquittal if the minister can and will give me a fair direct and satisfactory answer to one remaining question when mellish and morgan refused to bid on the plan of a qualified competition proposed to them on the   th of november for what reason did he instantly conclude with mr boyd he was not pressed for time since friday the   th was the day fixed by himself for the final settlement he was not pressed for money since the first payment on the new loan was not required before the  0th of december for any thing that appears to the contrary he might have taken a week but certainly two days without any possible inconvenience to try at least whether some other competitors might not offer and by that means give the public a possible chance of the benefit of a competition on his own plan then why did he not immediately send to the bank and desire the governor to give public notice of the alteration and of his being open for a certain number of days to receive proposals on that principle i presume he will not say that he knew it to be such as no man of credit would offer to bid upon yet what else he can say to cover so gross and palpable a breach of his duty to the public  i confess my imbecility  i have taxed my imagination  but i am not able to conceive it  the last appeal i shall make is to the prudence of the house we are trustees for the nation and accountable for the trust reposed in us if we acted only for ourselves or if the question ended with a few speeches a short question and a vigorous resolution the chancellor of the exchequer might possibly be as safe in the opinion of his country as he is in this house but let it be remembered before we decide that the evidence is before the public who will compare it with the verdict and judge of us accordingly we may acquit the minister by a vote but if that vote should not appear to be warranted by the evidence it will avail him nothing in point of reputation the country have it in their power to try us as well as him the minister may escape but in the judgment of mankind this house will not be acquitted  the two following resolutions as founded on the evidence were proposed by mr sylvester douglas and carried without a division  resolved that it appears to this house that the terms of the loan were fixed with a due regard to the magnitude of the sums borrowed and provided for as well as to the market price of the funds and the situation of public affairs at the time the bargain was concluded  resolved that it appears to this house that in every part of the transaction of the late loan the conduct of the chancellor of the exchequer was actuated by a view to the public interest and that there is no ground to suppose that any interference took place on the part of any persons connected with government in the distribution of any part of the said loan  finis
