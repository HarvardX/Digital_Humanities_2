a wife in the right a comedy  by mrs griffith  london printed for the author and sold by mess e and c dilly in the poultry j robson new bondstreet and j walter at charing cross mdcclxxii  preface the author of this address is so perfectly sensible of how little consequence such writings are to the public that she would most willingly have declined troubling them on this occasion were she not impelled to it by two very strong motives a desire of vindicating herself from some of the charges brought against the following comedy from the interpolations thrown into one of the principal parts on the night of performance and the earnest wish of expressing the sincere gratitude she is sensible of to the public in general and to her friends in particular for the generous patronage they have shown toward the publication of this little piece which with true humility and diffidence she now submits to their candor and indulgence  the author certainly had no reason to have apprehended the unlucky event of this comedy after the very favorable opinion which mr colman who is undoubtedly a competent judge of dramatic compositions had expressed of it all along from the time he received it in july    0 when he pronounced it to bid fairer both for same and profit than any of her theatrical writings to the day of its representation in march last on the morning of which he offered to underwrite its success for half a crown  however she confesses that for some time before the exhibition she had sufficient cause to be alarmed on account of mr shuter who had a long and principal part in the comedy seldom attending the rehearsals and when he did being found to be extremely imperfect  the author remonstrated upon this occasion and the manager indeed lamented the difficulty along with her but redressed it not  at length though late a day was appointed for the representation and on that morning mr shuter appeared at rehearsal pretty much in the same state as before and confessed himself incapable of performing his part that night upon which the play was obliged to be further postponed and handbills were sent about at noon to advertise the town of the disappointment  this was a most unlucky circumstance for the author the curiosity of the public palls upon such delays and many of her friends who had waited in london to attend the performance went into the country concluding from the uncertainty of the performer joined to the lateness of the season that the comedy could not be exhibited this year  a further and final day was afterward determined on but the audience being out of humor at their former disappointment called mr shuter to account for it on his first appearance which threw him into such a confusion that he was not able to get the better of it throughout the whole performance  this untoward incident occasioned two very considerable disadvantages to the piece in the hurry of his spirits the actor not only forgot his part the deficiency of which he endeavored to supply with his own dialect but also seemed to lose all idea of the character he was to perform and made the governor appear in a light which the author never intended that of a mean ridiculous buffoon this unlucky failure in the performer was by some unfortunately imputed to the writer and appeared to be a sufficient reason for condemning the piece  yet notwithstanding these almost insuperable disadvantages the play was suffered to proceed without any sort of reprehension except in the instance abovementioned and the epilogue concluding with these lines the author for your passport trembling stands and hopes you will grant it under all your hands received the fullest approbation from the audience without one single dissenting voice  many of her friends immediately quitted the theater in perfect assurance of the favorable event and came to wish her joy that the comedy had been sufficiently strong to struggle through such hazardous circumstances as before recited but the pleasure she received on this occasion was extremely transient for she was in a few minutes after informed that when the play was going to be given out for the next night some obscure persons in a corner of the gallery objected to it who were opposed by a considerable majority in all parts of the house but that after this kind of altercation had been continued for some minutes the council behind the curtain taking alarm at an apple being flung from the upper gallery and striking a branch of one of the chandeliers thought proper to obey the malicious who are ever the most active rather than the friendly part of the audience and withdrew the play  whether this opposition arose from ill nature or illtemper cannot be now determined though the latter cause is full sufficient to account for the effect as every one knows how dangerous a thing it must always be to suffer an audience to be out of humor at a first representation of any dramatic performance and on this account it would certainly have been prudent to have brought mr shuter before them in some of his more perfect characters between the night of the first and second disappointment in order to have palliated the resentment of the public so as to have prevented any interruption to the performance on that account at least  by the advice of those friends who were present the author went that night to mr colmans house to confer with him upon this unexpected ebb of fortune he seemed to be much affected with it himself expressed a friendly concern at her disappointment and promised to consult with the rest of the proprietors upon what compensation or redress it might be reasonable to make her upon this occasion but the next morning he sent her a letter to acquaint her that all her prospects from that quarter must be at an end for that she was to expect nothing farther from the theater  the author happened to receive this severe sentence in the midst of a large circle of her friends who were then with her offering their services for that night to bring on the comedy again engaging to prove the positive part of the audience superior to the negative one upon that trial but this kind and wellintentioned offer she declined  she adhered to the same moderation also the next day when the same offer was again repeated and seconded by several persons before unknown to her but who seemed to consider hers as a common cause against oppression and declared a full confidence of carrying the point against any opposition that might be attempted  the author does not deny that she felt resentment and was sensible of injustice all the while but she feared the consequence of a riot to the managers property choosing to suffer an injury rather than to do one  all this temper and conduct was then calmly represented to the manager both by letter and the interposition of friends but no notice was taken of it the author confesses that she then made a claim of right to some compensation upon the late occasion but not till after it had been refused her as a matter of favor she founded her demand upon the usage which is the only law of theaters and quoted many precedents of the same kind some of them in circumstances too far more unfavourable to the client but neither custom nor courtesy it seems were to be allowed sufficient pleas in her most singular case  the author does not mean by any thing the situation of this affair has obliged her to say here to charge mr colman with the least design to her injury by any part of his conduct throughout she believes him to have been perfectly sincere in his professions and ingenuous in his purposes toward her and has seen him mortified and concerned to the last degree at the delays and disappointments she met with though he did not sufficiently exert his authority to prevent or remedy them  the authors friends upon finding that she would not avail herself in the way they had first recommended advised her to publish the comedy by subscription as well to vindicate her writing from the misrepresentation of the night of performance as to make herself some small amends for the considerable loss and mortification she had sustained from its failure  this kind proposal she has most gratefully accepted of and after repeating here her acknowledgments to the public and her friends for the liberal encouragement they have shown her upon this and every occasion she takes this opportunity also of returning her thanks to the other performers in her comedy who took the pains to be perfect in their several parts and so well endeavored to support the spirit of their respective characters amidst the hurry and confusion which so unhappily interrupted the course of the performance  she now begs leave to make an apology for having presumed to claim so much of the public attention on a subject relative merely to herself and with the sincerest gratitude has the honor to subscribe herself their much obliged and most

inserted in the list  prologue written by mr colman and spoken by mrs bulkley by your leave critics to a female play a female prologue may prepare the way among the chronicles of modern fame who has not read of gentle frances name henry and frances a fond tender pair whose soft epistles still amuse the fair some nights ago our couple all alone a fireside teteatete  darby and joan  frances said henry give up writing men and men alone should dare to wield the pen your sex of late all decency confounds and breaks twixt us and them the modest bounds whether from passion love of power or riches women we see all like to wear the breeches at sea some madcaps enter volunteers some in the army list as grenadiers others write histries stateintrigues unriddle ride the great horse and play upon the fiddle gently cries frances truce with your reproaches and mark which sex on the other most encroaches soft silky coxcombs full of nice punctilio all paste pomatum essence and pulvilio with huge boaupots like boughpots daily go tricked out like dolls to pace in rottenrow thus flies the morning and the day to crown to quinze and faro every fop sits down each coat so trim lest any speck fall on it an apron guards  each forehead a strawbonnet nay lest rouleaus themselves should soil their ruffles a muffatee each pretty master muffles women in vain to keep their place have striven from every trade from each profession driven menmidwives swarm men mantuas make make stays dress hair dress meat  let women then write plays while narrow prejudice deformed the age no actress played no female trod the stage some smooth unrazord youth for juliet raved and kings sat waiting till the queen was shaved but woman once brought forward on the scene by man like eve was liked as soon as seen let females then compose as well as play and strive to please you in the noblest way no sulky critic to the playhouse drawn whom modern comedy provokes to yawn but marks of authors past the valued file and owns centlivre tempted him to smile why may not ladies too in future plays strike a bold stroke and anxious for the bays new busy bodies form new wonders raise thus frances spoke and bid her dear

markam woman to lady seaton mrs greeen lucy maid to mrs frankly mrs gardner scene london  a wife in the right act i scene a dressing room lady seaton and mrs markam lady seaton i tell you markam it is impossible i neither can nor will believe it what charlotte melville the companion of my youth the confidant of my heart could she form a connection so unworthy of herself i say again it must be impossible   mark to be sure maam if you dont choose to believe it i cannot undertake to convince your ladyship but i think the proofs are sufficiently strong on my side of the question  and if i had such a husband    lady sea learn to speak with more respect of lord seaton markam   mark i beg pardon maam but i was in a little sort of flurry to think of your ladyships being so ungratefully used by    lady sea stop i command you   mark why maam if your ladyship will not hear what one has to say you can never expect to come at the truth surely   lady sea that however i wish to learn therefore now tell me upon what circumstances you ground your suspicions   mark in the first place maam did not miss melville elope as it were from this house without so much as letting me know where she was going to just a few days before you were married   lady sea i can account for charlottes quitting me at that time but too well markam   mark may be maam you can account for her clandestine correspondence with my lord also   lady sea a clandestine correspondence with lord seaton what do you mean markam   mark mean i mean what i say maam these very eyes saw her receive a letter from him   lady sea not from my lord  from lord seaton markam   mark yes maam from your ladyships lord  lord seaton   lady sea now you indeed amaze me   mark she was sitting in the very next room just there at the harpsichord  and sweetly she does play to be sure  i happened to be standing in this very spot settling the toilette maam  i love a little music dearly and i did stop to listen i own but without thinking any sort of harm heaven knows  for i then took her to be as innocent as the child unborn  when    lady sea so i still wish to think her but proceed   mark when as i was saying maam in steps my lord and with the very same sort of bow that he used to make to your ladyship  for you know he was courting at that time  miss melville said he i have long languished  yes  languished was the word maam for an opportunity of speaking to you upon a subject of the utmost importance to my happiness   lady sea what subject   mark why that indeed he did not directly say maam  but really i dont think it so very difficult to guess but you shall hear maam  whereabouts was i o where he languished for an opportunity but despairing to find one continued he i have taken the liberty of conveying my sentiments to you in writing so saying he laid a letter down upon the harpsichord and i made the best of my way out of this room for fear of being seen   lady sea grant all this to be true it does not prove her guilty   mark she had no need to blush then if she was innocent and i warrant your ladyship that her face was as red as your morro satin all the while my lord was talking to her though it is naturally pure and pale you know at any other time i never was deceived in looks in my life and it was by dolly sly the housemaids blushing that i found out the affair between her and george the groom last summer   lady sea drop your absurd comparisons and tell me markam why you did not mention this circumstance to me before i was married it might have served me then  sighs   mark why really maam it would have been a very indiscreet thing in me and contrary to my own interest as well as your ladyships to have made mischief between my lord and you before you were married it might have broken off the match perhaps and then every servant in the house would have been a loser as well as i maam but when once the wedding should be over and all secured i resolved to watch her closely and if i saw any thing wrong to acquaint your ladyship with it then when it could do no harm but they have been too cunning for us this trip for to be sure and certain she is now with my lord at his house in the country   lady sea impossible i will not listen to this idle tale spun out of your own imagination without a single proof or even probable conclusion to support it again i tell you that you are deceived and that miss melvilles tenderness for me admits of no dispute   mark her tenderness indeed a plague on all such tenderness i say   lady sea you grow intemperate markam leave me and order thomas to try at every stand in london to find out the chair that carried miss melville from this house   mark it is above a month ago since she left us and i mightily doubt whether thomas will be able to recollect either the chairmen or their number at this distance   lady sea do as i direct without surmises   mark i will send thomas instantly maam a pretty sort of wild goose chase truly aside   exit lady sea this affair of the letter has tended but too much to convince me of my lords attachment to charlotte  but how is she to blame did she take advantage of his passion for her or strive to supplant me in his heart o no i only am in fault  my illtimed coldness and reserve banished my friend and has deprived me of that more than sisterly affection which had ever subsisted between us i will not rest till i atone my conduct toward her for in spite of all that markam says my heart by sympathy assures me of her innocence   enter markam mark my lord maam is just arrived i hope she will be in a better humor now since he is returned aside   lady sea and how does he look pray he has been absent i think these ten days   mark look maam  why just as he used to do to be sure  ten days why what is that in a gentlemans life maam though truly your ladyship has moped yourself pale again in that time with fretting about him and that plaguey miss melville   lady sea be silent i command you   mark what the duce makes her so cross of late one had as good be dumb if they are not allowed to speak aside   lady sea and where is my lord did he ask for me   mark he was following me up to wait on you maam when colonel ramsay just arrived from abroad came into the house   lady sea colonel ramsay what shall i say to him or how account for charlottes abrupt departure from my house   mark in truth maam if i was you i would throw all the blame on miss melville for i am sure that your ladyship never used her ill in the least but was as civil and distant to her latterly as if she had been a duchess   lady sea that was the worst of usage markam but retire  exit markam   enter lord seaton and colonel ramsay lady sea my dearest lord advancing toward him   lord sea my dear your most obedient bows gravely   lady sea so cold and distant aside   col though my congratulations come late i hope you will permit me to give you joy madam and accept my best wishes for your ladyships happiness   lady sea i am much obliged to you colonel   col pray madam how does our fair friend after so long an absence may i not be permitted the pleasure of seeing miss melville   lady sea i wish sir both for your sake and hers that this was in my power but    col you alarm me madam where is miss melville   lady sea indeed sir i know not but much wish i did for my own sake   col surely madam if she has withdrawn herself from your protection she must have had some very extraordinary reasons for it   lord sea female friendships you know charles are not among the perennials of life   col that is a mere commonplace reflection my lord adapted only to the very triflers of the sex i have been acquainted with miss melville even from her infancy and never knew any person more entirely governed by sense prudence and proper affections   lord sea why colonel you are entering into a serious defense of one whom i had not the least design of accusing  there are two ladies in the question you know and if either was to blame mine might possibly be the one in fault for i have not been able to discover any symptoms of infallibility in her ladyship yet   lady sea i pretend not to perfection my lord but hope i am incapable of acting    lord sea wrong  doubtless madam but errors in judgment i suppose you will admit to be the common lot of frail mortality   lady sea i feel it severely in myself my lord but cannot however avoid thinking it cruel to add to the distress i am already sensible of on miss melvilles account   lord sea quite barbarous i confess madam  but husbands are savages it seems   lady sea i neither said nor thought so my lord but i have done   lord sea charles you will dine with us today   lady sea i join in the request sir   col i shall attend your ladyship   lord sea are there any letters for me lady seaton   lady sea there are some my lord shall i send them to you   lord sea yes if you please   exit lady seaton col may i presume my lord upon the privilege of former friendship to speak my sentiments freely to you on the present occasion   lord sea why i think charles that this same former friendship you hint at has rendered us so thoroughly acquainted with each other that i am not to expect any thing very new in the sentimental dialect i suppose at present but proceed  a story may be good though it is an old one   col why then my lord i will frankly confess to you that i feel myself hurt at your behavior to lady seaton just now   lord sea why that is pretty concise truly colonel   col remember my lord the condition stipulated and then suffer me to tell you that there is something so unmanly in treating a woman ill especially one within our power that had i not been a witness to the unpoliteness i shall only say of your speech and manner toward lady seaton i could never have given credit to it   lord sea well well charles i believe i might have behaved a little too harshly to her ladyship upon this occasion but i own i was displeased at her seeming to cast the blame of her quitting the house upon the dear girl    col what girl my lord you do not speak of miss melville sure   lord sea miss melville o no no  my wife  twas her i meant  dear foolish girl i say to quarrel with her friend   col so then my lord you think that she did quarrel with her   lord sea why you cannot suppose colonel that there could possibly have been any other reason for miss melvilles quitting lady seatons house for my own part    col nay my lord i know not what to think but as there appears to be some sort of mystery in this affair i shall write to my sister mrs freeman this night between whom and lady seaton her affections were equally divided and with whom i hope she is at present two years absence have left me scarce any other clue to trace her by but i shall never cease from the pursuit till i have recovered my lost treasure the lovely charlotte   lord sea though you should find her colonel she may possibly be lost to you  two years constancy to an absent lover charles how can you be so unconscionable to expect it   col i have not the least doubt of it my lord nor shall i ever suspect my mistress of inconstancy or my friend of infidelity till i detect a failure in my own heart that may warrant theirs i neither love nor like lightly my lord and of course do not lightly change   lord sea i am glad to hear it charles as i think i may now venture to introduce you this evening to a very fine woman who may possibly put your boasted constancy to the trial   col i wish both for lady seatons sake and your own my lord that your heart was as much proof against the allurements of profligate beauty as mine is but i have no leisure to make the experiment you mention at present as every moment of my time shall be devoted to my search after miss melville   lord sea i rather fancy you doubt your own strength colonel and would not afford me the triumph of discovering your weakness but it is worth the hazard believe me charles   col your lordship must excuse me i have better purposes for my love and youth than to sacrifice them on circes altar   lord sea you must certainly have struck out some very unmodern tour for yourself charles to have brought home such an antique moral as this from your travels   col in this my lord    the governor behind the scenes gov i tell you it is a much finer hand that ever you wrote even before you wore spectacles   lord sea not a word more on this subject charles  here comes the governor my wifes uncle and for your entertainment i hope his umbra his secretary his valet de chamber or whatever else he pleases to call him is with him for i really think he is as great a curiosity as has ever been imported from the coast of cormandel   col there must certainly be something extraordinary in a person who has contrived to unite in a single individual such a plurality of characters a i should be glad to know something more of him   lord sea he was originally a country schoolmaster whom the governor carried with him to india and there used him as his private secretary but on his return to england having no further occasion for him in that capacity he has now degraded him to the state of his valet de chamber while the mortified pride of poor propria quae maribus makes him affect to show his learning upon all occasions to vindicate a superiority over his master   enter the governor in a loose indian habit gov i am glad your lordship is come home again here has been as much sighing and groaning as if you had gone an india voyage to take a tiltingbout with heyderally  do you know that fellow captain he is a stout buck i assure you   col no sir i have only heard of his fame   gov i have some letters for you nephew  i took them from mrs markam as she was bringing them hither about a quarter of an hour ago being impatient to know if your lordship had any accounts from madrass or bombay  early intelligence is of the last consequence to us poor piddlers in the stocks  a man may make some thousands by it in a morning you know captain   col i am utterly unacquainted with the business of the alley sir   gov then i would not give a single rupee for your knowledge aside   lord sea but where are my letters governor   gov safe enough i will warrant you takes them out of his pocket look at that hand nephew i will be hanged if any of your correspondents write such another pray observe the lls and the rrs of it  curious indeed   lord sea i am only curious about the matter and not the manner of writing therefore pray sir give me my letters   gov well it may be so but i think now that a fine hand  looks at one of the letters  by the way if i guess right this is a female scrawl   lord sea suppose it should governor you have no reason to be jealous as you have no wife living   gov no heaven be praised  poor dear babs at peace but as you have one my lord she may perhaps think she has a right to be jealous of your receiving billetdouxs  i used to have a sad time of it with her aunt upon that score i will assure you we have had twenty squabbles a day sometimes   lord sea it is from my charming widow charles aside   col your female correspondents must have been very numerous i presume sir   gov pretty well that way you may suppose sir for before my last trip to india i was called handsome ned anderson do you see am i much altered think you   col i had not the pleasure of knowing you then sir   gov this fellow knows nothing aside but even then sir i dont take upon me to say that i used to receive a score of love letters every day  i am no boaster captain though i have been a favorite in my time let me tell you but what with her jealousy and other slight causes my poor dear wife and i used to contrive a wranglingbout for every hour in the day you cannot imagine how much i missed her for the first two or three months after she died but time  time captain gets the better of every thing   col doubtless sir  i fancy my lord the hour of dressing draws nigh and as the governor seems to have a good deal to do in that way i think it but fair to allow him leisure for it   lord sea we shall meet at four colonel   col certainly exit   gov dress  what silly fops you europeans are  why cannot a man sit down and eat his victuals in a comfortable easy habit instead of being cased up in a strait waistcoat like a madman do you see but my lady my niece dont like it i presume   lord sea why really governor though your apparel may be perfectly convenient to yourself i should think it rather too easy and familiar a garb for the company of ladies   gov why there now what a pragmatical world do we live in your wife is my niece and yet i must suffer myself to be bound up to my good behavior forsooth before i can be allowed to sit down to table with her more than if i was to dine with the sultana of persia   lord sea we are all too much bound up in forms and fashions i confess governor   gov confound the fashion i say but if we must adopt the customs of other countries why not choose the best  rather than ape your mounseers and maccaronis why not follow the manners of the east where a man may sit at his ease in spite of the fashion   lord sea i think we seem rather too much inclined to relish the eastern luxury and effeminacy already sir   gov so much the better nephew do you see and as soon as ever i get into parliament i will endeavor to have an act passed that curry and pellow shall be the common food and that there shall not be a button worn in all england   enter nicholas nich your excellencys commercial agent mr samuel bull attends upon your leisure   gov i think that is as much as to say in plain english that bull the broker is below and now i desire you to bid him walk up   nich i shall observe your excellencys behest   exit gov behest now what does that word mean my lord but no matter the fellow is constantly puzzling me from morning to night with one outlandish phrase or another but here comes my little bull that i can always understand and a very understanding man he is i can assure your lordship   lord sea i dont in the least doubt it sir and shall therefore leave you to profit by his conversation exit   gov it is unlucky that honest bull is not as clever at jobbing in boroughs as he is at the same work at jonathans for then i might save my money a little but a man cannot have all perfections so i must even be content to purchase a seat on the best terms i can for what is wealth without honors to a person of my consequence do you see   enter bull gov your servant my good friend how go things in the alley today and how does the fair widow your niece i pray   bull bad  very bad   gov bad  very bad what has she got a fever   bull devilish tumble   gov not much hurt i hope   bull lame very lame  all sellers  no buyers  twelve per cent at least  bad news from bombay   gov what is there an indiaman arrived from thence   bull private advice   gov pshaw pshaw i dont mind that a dollar  private advices are generally contrived for private purposes though i was actually thinking of selling out before you came   bull right very right   gov by your leave mr bull i should rather think it wrong very wrong  what to lose twelve per cent man   bull may repent  twenty lower tomorrow   gov well then i will stay till they are got up again  but come tell me how does your fair niece not very bad i hope   bull much afflicted  greatly grieved   gov why what is the matter with the dear girl eh   bull vexatious lawsuit  comes on tomorrow   gov well so much the better i think every one would be glad to have a lawsuit over i fancy   bull will certainly lose it wants money to fee lawyers   gov why now man you speak a little sense and i begin to understand you  let us see let us see  thirty gold rupees make about fifty pounds  that will do the thing handsomely i suppose  the girl shall not lose her cause for that article friend bull   bull will not do   gov not do   bull not less than five hundred sterling   gov zounds and furies man  what give five hundred pounds in a morning to lawyers i would see the whole temple in a blaze first do you see   bull bid me not ask  said didnt love her well enough to lend it  though able to pay less than a year out of jointure six hundred a year tells well on the change governor   gov not love her why that is not the matter in hand mr bull  but five hundred is a large sum to sell out at loss you know as well as any man  if sock was high now i would show my affection do you see i wish this account from bombay had not   will not the lawyers wait a few days fr their sees stocks ebb and flow you know   bul lawyers wait no delay in that branch of their practice governor must have it this very day   gov twelve per cent didnt you say twelve per cent   bull twelve three eighths   gov twill be a great loss  a considerable loss indeed mr bull  but she has six hundred a year you say    bull six hundred per annum   gov why that is one pretty thing and she is another so i give you leave to sell out the five hundred and carry it to her directly my honest sam bull  well meet at garraways at eight   bull at garraways exit   gov this lie or truth for it is all one for that about bombay has been extremely unlucky just at this time  this bulls a devilish honest fellow truly  i might have lost her but for him  what a misfortune would that have been but i think the five hundred has secured her for the present and as soon as ever stocks get up again i will release a few thousands purchase a seat in the house build another on the banks of the thames marry the dear girl i dote upon sit in my nightcap and nightgown all day and then a fig for their dress and their fashions say i exit   end of the first act act ii a table with a deed pen and ink the governor mr squeezem and nicholas discovered governor and so mr squeezem you are of opinion that the voters of bartertown    squeez of opinion nay positively certain sir  you shall hear reads upon the aforesaid conditions made stipulated and agreed upon by and between you the aforesaid edward anderson esquire and myself bartholomew squeezem who am the contracting party for the aforesaid freemen and burgesses of the aforesaid potwalloping true ancient and loyal corporation of bartertown that they will return you the aforesaid edward anderson to be their true and legal representative in parliament provided that you the said edward anderson do pay or cause to be paid into the hands of me the said barthomew squeezem on or before the day of election the full sum of five hundred pounds more than their former representative sir william wealthy is willing to give for the same   gov softly softly good mr squeezem you have run yourself out of breath and taken mine away too with that last article what five hundred more than sir william may be willing to give why he may bid three thousand for aught i know   squeez not unlikely sir though as yet he has offered but two but sir william is a man of spirit and honor honor sir cannot be bought too dear   gov let me tell you sir that honors that are bought are not very honorable   nich they are doubtless of more value when derived from personal worth    squeez which is exactly the case in point mr nicholas for if his excellency was not worth the aforesaid sum of three thousand five hundred pounds he would not have the honor conferred upon him of representing the ancient and loyal corporation of bartertown  ergol it is his worth or what he is worth which is the same thing that obtains him that honor   nich i deny your major and will prove your postulatum false    gov why heyday do you think that i shall sit here to hear you disputing about worth and honor and such nonsense   nich henceforth i am dumb   gov so much the better now to the purpose mr squeezem suppose then that this same gentleman  sir william wealthy i think you call him    squeez why that sir is his real name and title his father was sir john wealthy his grandfather sir robert and his great grandfather who was the first baronet of the family    gov why what the plague man have i to do with his father or grandfather   squeez nay sir if you are in a passion about the matter there is no harm done i dont want to persuade you to be a member of parliament against your inclination though i must needs own that i know no person who would make a better figure in the house than your excellency such a presence such a sweet toned voice i think i hear the people ask who is that honorable gentleman who spoke last governor anderson says one o he is a charming man and a true patriot says another   gov why ay mr squeezem if i do come into the house i shall be a true patriot you may rely on it  i will get their streets paved and their lamps lighted for them i warrant me   squeez why so i have already told them sir governor anderson says i is as rich as forty jews and no more values money than dirt he would scorn to do a mean thing for filthy lucre but will let his cash fly amongst ye like dust my boys for you know sir they always think him the best patriot that spends most money and let little squeezem alone for disposing of it   gov that is the very thing i would be at the laying out my money to the best advantage and therefore do you hear i would be glad to know supposing the worst should happen and that sir william should outbid me how much i may be likely to lose by the disappointment   squeez that is a calculation entirely out of my way sir but to cut the matter short sir if you will please to sign this article and give me a bill on your baier for fifteen hundred or a couple of thousands i will promise you to make it go as far as any man in england sir   gov why truly stocks are so confounded low at present that i cannot bear the thoughts of selling out to a disadvantage but you may pass your word to them mr squeezem   squeez pass my word governor such coin will not pass current in that quarter i assure you sterling cash and nothing else will do but if it is so very inconvenient to you to raise the money there are gentlemen enough ready to leap at the offer there has not been so cheap a borough to be sold these seven years nor will not be during this session i will warrant you why sir every man of property in the kingdom wants to get into parliament now and you gentlemen nabobs have raised the price of boroughs as well as of every other commodity throughout the nation   gov well well since it must be so well see what is to be done i shall meet bull presently and he shall carry you a thousand that will be two and i will not go a shilling farther remember mr squeezem   squeez i shall do my best sir but two will never do the thing handsomely i fear   gov so it be done at all i care not a farthing for the handsomness of the matter do you see   squeez i can venture to say that neither sir william his father or grandfather    gov what the plague are you going to draw down the wealthys upon us again  come along nicholas get me my hat and my goldheaded bamboo i mean the best of them   nich i obey your excellency exit   squeez i must set out with the sun tomorrow morning to fix our friends for i hear that sir william went down this day with his coach full of money but no matter leave it to me to outpromise all that he can perform so that if your excellency will be pleased but to sign this bond you shall have a good account of the borough by the very next post   gov we have no bonds in india and a man is unworthy to live in any quarter of the globe whose word requires a countersecurity  bull shall carry you the money tonight exit   squeez it would be a bad thing for us practitioners in the law if such customs were to obtain in europe but it is our certain maxim that any mans money is as good as his bond whatever his word may be exit   second scene changes to mrs franklys house a dressing room and toilette mrs frankly and lucy lucy lord madam how charmingly you look today never sure was any thing so becoming as your dress and if we could but get your jewels now out of mr cheatalls hands i think you might really pass for a queen madam   mrs frank as to the jewels lucy i fear i shall never see them more however give me the paste earrings for the present they will pass on the governor for his own brilliants   lucy i hope they may madam for as they were a lovetoken from his excellency you should not have parted with them at least till after you were married   mrs frank lovetoken nonsense lucy for such a creature to think of love   lucy and yet madam if it was not for that same nonsense you would not have had the earrings and i wish mr bull and his nonsense had been far enough before he wheedled you out of them for i tell you again madam that if the governor should miss them we are all blown up at once   mrs frank i know it lucy but there was no resisting mr bulls importunities unless one had a heart as hard    lucy as his own madam but i hope when you are married you will cast him off entirely for i am sure if you dont his necessities will always keep you poor and then no body else will ever be a farthing the better for you   mrs frank ay lucy there is the rub with you  and so you would have me seriously think of becoming a kind and faithful spouse and devoting my whole affections to the love of my great grandfather for your advantage truly   lucy no really madam i am not quite so unreasonable for i know it is as good to be out of the world as out of the fashion and since you must have a lover why there is my lord seaton that admires you so much and a fine gentleman he is and rich too into the bargain i will warrant me   mrs frank there you have touched the master string of all my misery i love him lucy and know myself unworthy of his passion   lucy o for goodness sake dear madam dont sigh and look so melancholy  you frighten me out of my wits i shall dream of the magdalen as sure as a gun tonight you ought not to let such thoughts come into your head   mrs frank a sincere passion makes us humble lucy it is impossible that lord seaton should return my affection   lucy now i cannot see that for my life and if you would but look in the glass there i fancy you would soon be of another opinion yourself too if i was but half as handsome i know what i should think why there is that miss melville now that our john says is such a beauty    mrs frank why indeed i must confess that i have some personal advantages over her but then how many others has she above me i almost hate her at the thought a knocking at the door run lucy see who it is my spirits take alarm at every motion   lucy and reason enough indeed madam so many duns and nothing to satisfy them my patience is almost as much worn out as theirs and if it were not for my hopes of being well rewarded when she is married to the governor i would even leave her to answer them herself aside exit   mrs frank into what scenes of misery has my thoughtless vanity plunged me could i have been but contented with the safe though humble state of life in which my fortune had placed me i should not now have been the wretch i am   enter lucy lucy dont be frightened madam it was no body but the postman with a letter to miss melville i left her reading it in the parlour she asked me if you were dressed and i fancy she is just coming up i wish miss would not be so prying as to sit so much below stairs for there cannot be a hands turn done in the house without her knowing it   mrs frank i wish she was fairly out of it with all my heart i beg lucy that you will contrive to keep every thing quiet here for a few days lest any untoward circumstance should mar all our projects   lucy never fear well manage matters i warrant you till you are the governors lady madam and then you know  exit lucy   mrs frank yes i know that i shall be completely wretched  to have nothing further to hope for without enjoyment in our present possessions is a miserable state surely enter miss melville with a letter so my dear you have just received a billetdoux i presume   charl no really madam the contents of this letter have nothing either sweet or soft in them  it is from my aunt lady walton who declines receiving me under her protection from a ridiculous apprehension that her son sir william now just coming of age might possibly take it into his head to fall in love with his cosen   mrs frank why i think that to be no unlikely surmise miss melville and i must suppose it to be with such an idea at least that the burying yourself alive in northamptonshire could ever have come into your head   charl indeed mrs frankly you are much mistaken  i could never have thought of soliciting a favor with an intention of repaying it with ingratitude   mrs frank well then if that was not the case i think i have reason to congratulate you on being as it were compelled to follow your own inclinations by remaining still in this dear delightful city   charl london i confess to be a charming place maria to those who may innocently indulge themselves in its gaieties but a young woman without fortune or friends    mrs frank friends what an antique expression but you were ever romantic my dear and began even at school i remember to speculate upon morals sentiment and such notions but believe me there is no such thing on earth as a friend except money child youth and beauty are bills of exchange and therefore you may be a friend to yourself if you please my dear hums a tune   charl this is a strange wild way of talking mrs frankly   mrs frankly nothing but the way of the world and plain common sense child but bytheby charlotte i think the story you told me about your quitting your friend as you affect to call her has something in it bordering nearly upon absurdity and then your concealing the names of the parties even from me my dear has somewhat in it so very childish mysterious and pretty    charl i have said too much of their respective situations ever to reveal their names we may make confidants in our own secrets but have no right over those of others nor can i be said to be absurd in sacrificing my own interest and convenience to the peace and happiness of a person whom notwithstanding your sad opinion of the world i truly believe to have been my friend   mrs frank your conduct i grant it was heroic charlotte and might have made a notable figure in a romance some centuries ago but epic virtue my dear is by no means the ton of modern times the present world is not near so difficult as it was formerly and the utmost that is required of feeble nature nowadays is barely to conceal the vices we have under the affectation of those virtues we are deficient in   charl hypocrisy they say is the homage that vice pays to virtue but i consider it rather as an aggravation of iniquity   mrs frank nay prithee miss melville do not preach against prudence it is certainly a very necessary quality at least and one that i would as a friend most seriously recommend to your own practice but as i am really not yet old enough to set up for a duenna well change the subject if you please  what think you of ranelagh tonight   charl i must beg to be excused from appearing in public mrs frankly till my situation and circumstances in life shall be in some degree more ascertained   mrs frank why absolutely child you amaze me your fortune is small your relations seem to have cut you off then what measure is left you now but to ascertain your situation and circumstances as you say by the means of your personal advantages had i staid moping and moralizing in a corner i should never have made the figure in life i do at present   charl our spirit and talents are of quite different natures maria   mrs frank i must confess indeed that there is something rather more striking in my form and features than in yours but tastes differ you know my dear and as in pictures some like the busy others the still life so there may perhaps be certain virtuosos who might possibly give you the preference   charl upon my word mrs frankly i shall never pretend to rival you there is but one man in the world i ever wished to please and he is to my misfortune far distant at present   mrs frank bravo miss charlotte and who is this dear man i pray you   charl there again you must excuse my silence maria two years of absence may have changed his sentiments and though mine for him can never vary the world is apt to think our being the first to receive and the last to retain a passion to be a i reach of that kind of prudence you have just now recommended to me you see i can profit by advice maria   enter a servant ser mr bull madam is below and is come to wait on you   mrs frank desire my uncle to walk up exit servant believe me miss melville i have not the least curiosity about your swain unless it might be to assist you but i have rather more business of this sort of my own on my hands already than i know well how to manage but softly here comes my uncle  not a word more on this subject for the present   enter bull with a large bag of money in his hand bull i hope i am welcome now my dear maria starts at seeing miss melville servant niece puts up the money   mrs frank how unguarded aside miss melville my uncle and i have a little business about money matters to transact together and i hope therefore that you will excuse my requesting you to retire a while   charl i was just going to beg the favor of one of your servants to attend me a few doors off to inquire whether a friend of mine mrs freeman be come to town   mrs frank o by all means go and inquire after your friend i wish she had been gone an hour ago aside you will come back to dinner i suppose   charl i shall attend you exit   bull looking after her who is that charming girl maria and how came you acquainted with her   mrs frank we were bred at the same boardingschool together but had not seen one another these eight years till about a month ago i met her by chance at my milleners who happened to be here is also she was inquiring for lodgings for a short time that she purposed staying in london and i foolishly invited her to my house in hopes of an agreeable companion at home but i find her such a canting methodist that i shall lay hold on the first fair pretense that offers of ridding myself of so stupid an encumbrance   bull she looks far from being stupid maria and if i might advise i would not have you let the governor see her i think i never saw more lively eyes in my life   mrs frank and they have set your heart of tinder in a blaze i suppose   bull no maria  though if you had not been by i know not what might have been the case   mrs frank stuff this is nothing to the purpose at present but where is the money you showed me just now   bull here it is a round five hundred in cash and paper there never was any thing so lucky as my getting it from the governor to see your lawyers maria ha ha ha  but i hope it will keep me out of their talons at least for a little while longer till something better happens   mrs frank you astonish me mr bull why you do not mean to convert it to your own use surely   bull i must confess i really do thou most astonished fair   mrs frank what while my jewels lie pledged for your necessities   bull and who was the cause of your getting those jewels mrs frankly whose credit has hitherto supported you in affluence and grandeur mrs frankly and what has involved samuel bull in difficulties and ruin but the necessities of mrs frankly   mrs frank upbraiding cancels every obligation  i shall let the governor know how you have behaved both to him and me   bull then you will let him know that you are a fool maria and choose to put back to sea in a storm when you were got within sight of the port will not underwrite the vessel for a shilling   mrs frank no it is you that mean to destroy my hopes of fortune and your own too by robbing me thus   bull have a care  injure the credit of a man of business  heavy action will lie must assure you    mrs frank what are you putting on your canting face and set phrases to me i will expose you to the world though i should be ruined with you   bull weather hot  passion dangerous  may bring on a fever   mrs frank insulting monster   bull no monster maria well built tight little man as you would see upon change on a summers day  will bring the governor in the evening  must acknowledge the receipt of the five hundred   mrs frank then let me have it to release my earrings  you know if he misses them we are undone and you can have them again in a day or two if your occasions should require it   bull some sense and reason in that must confess   mrs frank do you think i is for the mere vanity of such toys that i  distress you   bull here take the money then and release your jewels  but remember maria that if we still continue to act on the family compact we may both of us thrive but if you attempt to play me false your own ruin must be the consequence   gives the money mrs frank fear me not mr bull but i cannot stay to make professions now i am all impatience till i release the dear little sparklers goes to the side of the scene get me a chair directly how mean and dull these paste baubles appear at the very idea of brilliants looking in the glass   bull you dont seem to think them such vain toys as you did just now maria   mrs frank dont you know that it is the very perfection of philosophy to seem to despise what we dote on when it is out of our reach but to show you that i can be indifferent even to finery i positively assure you that i will not wear them this whole day  there is resolution for you   bull a whole day amazing effort of philosophy truly   enter a servant ser the chair is ready madam   bull i will hand you into it and direct the men   exeunt enter miss melville char how fortunate have i been in meeting with mrs freeman even in the very moment when i began so severely to be sensible of my indiscretion in having too lightly accepted of mrs franklys invitation the freedom of those sentiments she expressed just now has both shocked and surprised me my happy inexperience did not suffer me to suspect that a few years commerce with the world could have produced so absolute a change in a heart that formerly appeared as innocent and artless as my own nor could i have believed that the widow frankly launched into the world at large might become a very different sort of character from what she first appeared in as my schoolfellow and friend   enter varnish followed by lucy varn dont tell me mrs lucy i will have my money   lucy for goodness sake my dear sweet mr varnish have patience but for a few days longer i give you my honor that my lady is to be married directly and then all her debts will be duly paid miss melville here then we are blown indeed aside   varn i tell you my dear sweet mrs lucy that i will not have patience for an hour longer and that i would not give a cast coachwheel for yours and your ladys honor into the bargain married quotha why that may be mrs lucy but matrimony nowadays is more apt to create new debts than to discharge old ones and therefore i am resolved not to stir out of this house mrs lucy till i get satisfaction for my demand   lucy sure never was any thing so unlucky  aside charl pray what is the matter mrs lucy   lucy why madam this honest gentleman a cheating rogue aside is come to demand a trifling sum    varn a trifle do you call it well then pay me my good hundred and thirty pounds and i shall thank you for the trifle i assure you   lucy dear mr varnish what is a paltry hundred and thirty pounds to a man of your substance when you consider how many more hundreds you may get by my lady why she must have three new carriages at least for herself when she is married besides a most superb palanquin for his excellency such as your nabobs use and she has promised to buy me a timwhiskey for myself and i have ever found her as good as her word  she is not one of your court promisers i assure you   varn i wish i could say so with all my heart but she has promised to pay me my paltry sum as you call it any time these six months and her memory has failed her plaguily mrs lucy   lucy lord man how can a woman think of any thing when she is going to be married but of almacks cornelys the pantheon or the coterie   charl i think mrs lucy that you had better acquaint your lady with this gentlemans impatience at present as i left her uncle with her just now and he would most probably satisfy him   lucy dear madam he is gone and my mistress out too but if he were with her a thousand times i dare not do so mr bull to be sure is a very rich man but a very penurious one and might perhaps disinherit his niece if he knew that she ventured to run a shilling in debt   varn why it is not to him she is going to be married eh lucy he has debts enough of his own to pay i can tell you   lucy o dear no mr varnish she is to be married to a great rich nabob worth six millions the least farthing   varn why that is a good round sum truly if one could be certain of the matter  it is worth trying however aside eh mrs lucy and may i depend on her dealing with me afterward for i have been fobbed off in that way before now when the quality get so far in our debt that they dont choose to pay they often quit us and then do as much for some other of the trade   lucy but my lady has too much honor to serve any one so believe me   varn not overstocked with that commodity i dare say aside well mrs lucy to show you now what a reasonable man i am i will take your word for my debt till your lady is married and then either the nabobs purse or person shall be my security aside but you are certain she will want three carriages   lucy ay as sure as there is truth in my words mr varnish   varn well then good mrs lucy we will not disturb this gentlewoman any further your servant madam   lucy let me wait on you down stairs good mr varnish   varn you would have the whisky green i suppose   lucy a bright peagreen certainly   exeunt varnish and lucy charl i am alarmed even to terror at my situation here every thing i see or hear confirms my apprehensions and suspicions with regard to mrs franklys conduct it seems an age till i quit her house  under the protection of my dear mrs freeman how safe and happy shall i feel myself the consciousness of ones own virtue becomes doubly pleasing from the concurring testimony of an amiable and worthy friend   enter lucy lucy lord madam i beg your pardon but that vile blundering coachmaker man has put it quite out of my head to tell you that just as you came into the door a servant in livery followed you and asked our john if you lived here and the fool only answered simply yes without inquiring his business or calling me to sift him but if he should come again i shall be able to give a good account of his errand i warrant me   charl i am obliged to you mrs lucy but would not have you give yourself the least trouble in the matter as i shall quit this house in the evening and know no person who can have any manner of business to enquire after me   lucy dear madam why my lady will be so lonesome without you   charl i fancy not mrs lucy but pray is she visible at present for i am impatient to acquaint her with my good fortune in meeting with the friend i went in quest of   lucy i am sure she will rejoice at it but pray madam where does your friend live i should be glad to know in case the servant should call again with a letter to you i will lay my life on it you have made some new conquest madam though the fellow was cunning enough to pretend that he belonged to some lady when he asked the question   charl it is never worth a womans while lucy to trouble herself about any chance admirer  if he be really one he will soon find out some method or other of declaring himself so too much anxiety about such matters always renders us contemptible   lucy i find madam that you dont choose to trust me with your secrets   charl indeed lucy i have none innocence disdains mystery nor is there a single action of my life that i need wish to be concealed   lucy that is an extraordinary declaration truly in these days for a young lady turned of eighteen and now if you please madam i will see if my lady be come in and let her know that you desire to speak with her   charl i shall be obliged to you exit lucy unhappy maria how sincerely do i pity her situation yet let me hope that indiscretions rather than vice have misled her steps from the sole paths of happiness and peace but do they not alas in our sex almost equally involve their wretched victims in misery and lead them on to ruin were it possible for me to awaken her to a sense of her danger i should then have most amply repaid her civilities to me by an act of the most real kindness and friendship exit   end of the second act act iii scene lord seatons house lord seaton and colonel ramsay at table with bottles glasses etc colonel you must excuse me my lord i dont choose to drink any more  rising   lord sea why thou art such a sober fellow charles that if i did not know you well i should imagine you had a design upon some rich dowager and were to pass your evening at picquet with her rises   col why even that my lord though by no means my choice i should prefer to the unmanly practice of stupefying my senses and inflaming my blood with wine   lord sea you will certainly be a vast favorite with the ladies colonel   col then i shall as certainly think myself a very happy man my lord for i look upon the company of agreeable women

restrained me from communicating them you shall be informed my lord   gives him the card lord sea lady seatons compliments to colonel ramsay and desires the honor of his company to supper this evening on a very particular occasion what can this particular invitation mean there seems to be something odd in this business colonel perhaps her ladyship designs to raise my jealousy i have heard of such arts put in practice upon lukewarm husbands heretofore   col she has gone one step toward it my lord at least by raising your curiosity but where our affections are not much interested i should think it unnatural for any such passion to be moved   lord sea you will pardon me colonel for though i am not romantically in love with my wife i could perhaps be as outrageously jealous of her honor on the least alarm as the most amorous coxcomb breathing but to do her justice her conduct through life has been so irreproachable that i dare say her sense and virtue will never suffer her to render me uneasy that way at least   col i should be better pleased at hearing you make your wifes encomium if it did not so strongly reflect upon yourself my lord how is it possible that you can allow her those merits which are to be the basis of your security and peace and yet withhold from her the just reward of them your tenderness and esteem   lord sea do not press me upon this subject ramsay for even to you i cannot unfold the secret of my heart but will so far confess to you that i have acted and still continue to do so against the fullest conviction both of my honor and reason but perhaps if i could happen to discover a few failings in my wifes character her presence would be less uneasy to me for in short charles we cannot love any one cordially who constantly reproaches us though ever so silently   col what a perverse fate is lady seaton doomed to whose very merits are imputed to her as faults but i hope for your own sake as well as hers that this delirium will soon have an end for no rational person can ever taste of happiness who is conscious of pursuing it by improper means   lord sea though i feel the full force of your argument charles you must permit me to tell you    col what i know already my lord that passion is often too strong for reason and while mrs franklys charms retain their dominion over your heart you will continue still blind and insensible to those of lady seaton   lord sea you are mistaken colonel my heart is no way concerned in my attachment to mrs frankly  for though she is handsome lively and as far as i can judge has nothing of the prude about her she can only amuse but not infatuate and it is merely in hopes of triumphing over a more serious passion that i sometimes trifle away an hour or two with her   col this is an extraordinary declaration indeed my lord and leaves me still more at a loss for the clue to your labyrinth   enter waters wat the coach is ready my lord   lord sea get me my hat and sword exit waters will you accompany me colonel or shall i set you down any where else   col no my lord i shall return to my search after miss melville and shall then do myself the honor to obey lady seatons summons to supper i hope we shall meet then   lord sea i know not whether i should obtrude on your tete a tete or shall have resolution enough to quit mine with my little widow so soon but success attend your pursuit   col au revoir exit   lord sea i most sincerely wish that he may be able to discover miss melvilles retreat which i have so much in vain attempted but then should she reveal the cause of her quitting this house will not ramsay think i have acted unworthily but of what consequence are his thoughts to the secret upbraidings of my own could i but recall a few short weeks i should be happy because i should be blameless but that indissoluble knot which has rendered an amiable woman as wretched as myself can never be untied then hang reflection success to dissipation and now for a little flirt with my lively widow for the rest of the evening exit   scene mrs franklys house enter mrs frankly and miss melville you are upon the wing i find miss melville i shall be vastly dull without you but before you set out pray let me a little into your present scheme and first tell me about what age may your friend mrs freeman be immensely rich extremely old i suppose and you mean kindly to assist in making her will  char how wildly you talk maria mrs freeman is in the prime of life and likely i hope to live long she has been a widow about five years and though universally admired has chosen to pass the greatest part of that time at her seat in somersetshire amidst her own and her late husbands friends and neighbors there i first had the happiness of her acquaintance and there is she idolized for her goodness   mrs frank and so your hopeful scheme is to be as good as she till you both fall into a lethargy together do you know charlotte that there is nothing on earth so tiresome as your good sort of people they constantly set me a yawning and will at any time serve to procure me as sound a slumber as a dose of opium   char they have a very different effect on me mrs frankly they rather rouse my slumbering virtue emulation is the strongest incentive to    mrs frank o pray miss melville keep all this canting stuff for your good mrs freeman and do not stupify my senses with any more of your homilies  i am in an agony till she is out of the house aside   char i shall not trespass on your patience much longer madam  mrs freeman said she would send her chariot for me at six oclock and i believe it is now near that hour   mrs frank looking at her watch six yes really madam it is extremely six   char i think i hear the chariot stop and now give me leave to assure you madam that i shall ever think myself much obliged to you for your kindness and hospitality   mrs frank nay prithee my dear spare your acknowledgments i most heartily wish you a good evening and a world of happiness with your good mrs freeman   enter lord seaton lord sea my dear mrs frankly  on seeing miss melville miss melville here o madam what an happiness is mine to have met with you   mrs frank why this is vastly pretty sure what can it mean   lord sea nay do not turn from me miss melville for be assured that i have suffered more on your account than words can express and that my utmost purpose will be accomplished in restoring you to the society of your friends again   char it is impossible my lord   mrs frank this is rather too much miss melville you should have made your appointments at your good mrs freemans and not under my roof madam   lord sea let me implore you on my knees to hear me  for lady seatons for ramsays sake   char pray rise my lord  colonel ramsay did you say is he in england then   enter lady seaton lady sea where is my friend my dearest charlotte sees lord seaton at her feet can i believe my sight  starts it is it is too true  sinks into a chair   char my dearest lady seaton hear me   lady sea no miss melville  no you cannot clear yourself nor should i wish to hear you criminate my lord   lord sea i am astonished  what can have brought her hither  aside i shall not bend to your tribunal madam  you are my wife but not my judge and i must tell you madam that i shall not easily pardon your acting in a manner so unbecoming either of your own character or my rank in life   char let me turn suppliant now to you my lord  do not distress my best my dearest friend indeed lady seaton i am perfectly innocent notwithstanding these unlucky appearances   mrs frank o yes a mighty innocent creature truly to make your assignations here with a married man and bring a scandal on my house little did i think i had harbored such a serpent in my bosom i am sure her ladyship is much to be pitied between ye and to let her see that i have no improper connections with such persons i desire my pretty innocent miss that you will leave my house directly   char you need not fear any further intrusion from me madam suffer me but to speak a few words to lady seaton   lord sea these are your doings madam  to lady seaton   char would i had died before i became the unhappy cause of this dissension but be assured my dearest lady seaton however this incident may have raised your suspicions a time will shortly come when you shall be convinced that i as well as you have been grossly injured exit   mrs frank o yes vastly injured i dare say  in being interrupted  i think you had better go after your friend my lord and see her safe to her new lodgings that you may not be at a loss to find her again base inconstant man aside   lord sea i shall not incumber your apartment longer madam than just to see that lady out of it for as she bears my name i do not choose to have it joined with yours   mrs frank insolent to a degree beyond bearing  aside   lady sea i am extremely sorry madam for the confusion i have occasioned in your house but be assured that i did not expect to have met with such a scene when i entered it i have been much deceived   mrs frank yes indeed madam miss melville has deceived you most extremely   lady sea i fear she has unhappily deceived herself even more than me  but i shall not trespass longer on your time and patience madam and again beg your excuse for my intrusion  i am ready my lord to attend you to lord seaton  exit lord sea i follow you madam    as he is going mrs frankly opposes him mrs frankly pray my lord let me speak a word to you   lord sea you must pardon me madam if after what has happened just now i should wish to shorten our conversation as much as possible   mrs frank nay then i am convinced that what i said in order to remove lady seatons suspicions of myself and turn them on miss melville was but too true cruel ungrateful man but yet you shall not go   lord sea by your leave madam this is no time for trifling  breaks from her   enter the governor gov hey dey what have we here lord seaton running away from a fair lady and she laying violent hands on his garments   mrs frank o sir i am glad you are come to my assistance that you may help me to detain this infatuated man for his wifes sake from flying after a vile creature that he followed here just now i am sure i would not for a thousand guineas that it happened in my house and i pity his poor lady of all things   lord sea this is a master stroke indeed mrs frankly  aside   gov why really if this be the case i do think his poor lady is to be pitied  why man the honeymoon is hardly over yet and i declare that i was constant to my wife for near a year after we were married  but then i was in love mightily in love do you see  however i dont think that either you or i have any right to interfere in his lordships amors mrs frankly and a forcible detainer is contrary to law  besides i have a small matter of business to confer with you upon myself at present   lord sea which i will by no means interrupt governor and heartily wish you may settle it to your mutual satisfaction exit   gov i shall be home to supper my lord i have bespoke a couple of little plates to be dressed after our india fashion my lady has ordered the rest i suppose i make bold to hope my dear little widow that you understand something of cookery  for they absolutely know nothing of seasoning their meat in england i have some excellent receipts of poor babs by me   mrs frank how could i be so weak a wretch as to imagine i could retain lord seatons affections he is alas gone from me for ever  aside   gov you seem mightily disturbed i think  i wonder she does not say any thing of the five hundred pounds  aside no bad news i hope from your lawyers   enter bull mrs frank here comes another of my plagues    aside gov your servant mr bull now my little widow speak to sammy there  he will make your mind easy i believe he is certain of your success and tells me that the suit will be determined tomorrow   bull trial put off till next term   gov never the worse for that master bull stocks may rise by that time perhaps you did not sell out    bull before dinner   gov how unlucky but however it dont much signify as it happens as i shall want that and another five hundred for squeezem this very night   bull money disposed of to lawyers did not know of the delay till it was expended will not refund must be refreshed again first day of term   gov refreshed i actually believe you invent words only to put me in a passion this refreshment has almost thrown me into a fever   bull dont be obstinate  speak to him or we shall be undone maria  aside to mrs frankly   mrs frank no matter  i care not what becomes of you myself or all the world   gov nay prithee dont take on so neither  though delays are dangerous to be sure as well as mortifying   bull wants comfort mightily   gov and she shall have it sammy eh but let us see  why the term dont sit till november next  that is a plaguey long day to be sure  i thought to have been married directly  and if one was certain that this same law suit do you see was quite a hollow thing    bull quite hollow   gov say you so why then if my pretty widow pleases well be married tomorrow and dine at the london tavern or the crown and anchor or wherever else she pleases  you shall have your choice do you see    mrs frank all places upon earth are equal now to me  for none can quiet my distracted mind    half aside gov  to bull why i dont rightly understand that now  didnt she whisper something about distractions eh there is no madness in the family i hope   bull madness no no no  distracted with joy on her wedding day that is all  pretty compliment if rightly taken  has wit at her fingers end  recover yourself or we are ruined    aside to mrs frankly gov why that is witty to be sure but it did not strike me i own at first  to mrs frankly well but compose yourself do you see for too much joy may sometimes be hurtful   mrs frank mine will not be immoderate sir i promise you   gov that is very discreetly said now i am impatient for tomorrow i will go directly to bespeak the dinner and get the license ready come mr bull you shall go with me but will not your niece give me one kiss    bull may command it   gov do you tell me so by your leave then  kisses her her breath smells like otto of roses by the way you shall have a bottle of the best that ever was made in persia tomorrow morning the great mogul has not as good but come along master bull i have many matters and money matters to talk to you about but those little twinklers put every thing out of my head i shall want a thousand pounds for the good of the nation this very night do you see i have promised to send it to squeezem and ned anderson never yet broke his word and that is a bold expression for one of my age let me tell you i am not a man of words but of deeds my little widow and i hope you will like me the better therefore  eh and so adieu my pretty pretty poll  singing   exeunt governor and bull mrs frank i am glad they are gone  i could not conquer my confusion detested be the hour i tried the art to wear a smile upon my cheek while rage and grief tear my distracted soul   enter lucy lucy lord madam what a sad bustle has been here this afternoon i am afraid we are all blown up with the governor as i hear he was by at some part of it   mrs frank lucy i am undone for ever i have lost lord seatons heart and all other misery is equal to me   lucy i wish you had no other misfortune to complain of madam hearts are soon won and soon lost it is not love but money that should take up your thoughts at present in short all your creditors are alarmed and you had much better think of the only way you have to quiet them by becoming the governors lawful wife immediately   mrs frank i do not want your advice but your pity lucy   lucy pity charity begins at home madam and for that matter i think myself as much to be pitied as other people   mrs frank  pausing get me a pen and ink i will write to lord seaton directly   lucy if you have lost his heart a pen and ink will hardly bring it back again but they are on your table in the dressing room and if i might advise it would be for the present at least to drop a connection which by ruining you may injure my own interests  carelessly   mrs frank and pray mrs lucy how came your interests to be any way connected in this matter   lucy why really madam to tell you the truth i apprehend that if any unlucky circumstance should break off your match with the governor it would then be out of your power to reward my many long and faithful services   mrs frank insolent wretch needed there this addition to my misfortunes   lucy people who bring on their own misfortunes madam    mrs frank are to be insulted by their servants it seems  but i will no longer bear your insolence   lucy nor i your distresses madam   mrs frank my affability has been mistaken i find or you had not dared to insult me thus  but as for the extraordinary merits you boast of i shall think it not the least injustice to leave such virtues to their own reward prepare your accounts instantly nor dare appear before me again but to give them in ungrateful woman exit   lucy prepare your accounts yes that is easily done i have them pretty well by heart already i will give them in tomorrow morning to the governor and leave you two to cast them up together at your next meeting ungrateful woman too i am called it is fine talking truly about gratitude and such stuff because one will not spend their whole life in poverty with her  and that i foresee will be her fate at last in love with my lord forsooth and every thing must be sacrificed to that girlish passion why if the governor should marry her tomorrow it is ten to one but she would be in the height of the mode in a week in doctors commons in a fortnight and a beggar before the honeymoon was over but i will prevent that mischief at least by exposing her to his excellency and if he is bent upon matrimony right or wrong there are people who think me handsomer than my mistress and if he has but half as much sense as money he may possibly be of the same opinion too exit   end of the third act act iv scene lord seatons house enter colonel ramsay colonel my search has hitherto been vain but i have just now heard that my sister freeman is expected soon in town and if female friendships are not as lord seaton says an empty name she will probably know something of my dear charlottes situation or abode my engagement here for this evening puts it out of my power to enquire about her tonight but to morrow early i shall call at her house  mrs markam   enter mrs markam mark you are welcome to england sir but am sorry to acquaint you that my lady happens to be so much indisposed at present that she must deny herself the pleasure of seeing you for this evening   col i am extremely sorry for your ladys illness mrs markam this sudden attack alarms me for her   mark o by no means sudden sir my lady has been ill of the same disorder ever since she has been married i wonder for my part how she has been able to bear it so patiently but she is convinced at last and i hope she will pluck up a spirit now and not suffer herself to be imposed upon any longer   col i do not understand you she seemed to be in perfect health at dinner   mark well sir and if she was she has had enough in conscience to have made her sick since then she will believe me another time i fancy i am not apt to be mistaken whatever she may be i am sure it is a scandalous thing for him that has such a charming lady of his own and has not been married quite two months yet  and that pretty demure miss too that my lady was so fond of  but i never liked her for my part and always said that smooth water    col prithee mrs markam explain yourself  you alarm me extremely   mark i beg your honors pardon  i forgot that you were in love with miss melville formerly or to be sure i would not have said a word against her before you but then i was so enraged with my lord for slighting his good lady that i could not command myself  though for certain it is no affair of mine after all and i must beg sir that you would not mention any thing i have said for the world for my lady would never forgive me if she knew that i spoke of it to any one   col i am on the rack aside the only way then to insure my secrecy mrs markam is by making me a thorough confidant for as yet i do not comprehend what miss melville has to do with either your ladys illness or your lords unkindness she quitted this house i have been informed before they were married and they have both assured me they have neither of them seen her since   mark does my lord say so   col he most certainly did   mark why then great folks have a patent  i suppose for as sure as i stand here my lady detected his lordship and miss melville together this very afternoon  and was that their first tete a tete think you   col by heaven i cannot give credit to this story  i should still think it impossible though lord seaton and miss melville themselves were both to confess it   mark o lord sir i am frightened out of my wits  it may not be true as you say after all i could bite my tongue off for being so nimble i wish heartily i had been dumb   col if you have idly slandered miss melville you deserve to be so for life but i will have this matter explained immediately  where is lord seaton   mark o dear good colonel for heavens sake dont be in a passion  there might be no harm done to be sure  he was only kneeling at her feet when my lady happened to come into the room   col insidious base dissembler   mark why to be sure he has a dissembling tongue and every one thought that he was in love with my lady before he married her except herself  but she it seems had her suspicions that he liked miss better and that made my lady so cold to her that she hardly opened her lips to her for a great while before she left the house  a rapping at the door here is my lord a coming i fear   col i hope so   mark o dear merciful colonel have compassion and dont betray me now consider i am but a poor servant sir and indeed miss melville was always very kind to me and if your honor will but forgive me this once i promise never to speak another word against her while i have breath  but i must run sir exit   col and well you have rewarded her kindness but when persons of rank and education set an example of meanness and ingratitude we are not to expect to meet with their opposite virtues in an inferior class   enter lord seaton lord sea o charles i am glad to meet you i have a perfect novel of extraordinary incidents to communicate to you   col and i am glad my lord that we are met and that you are in such a communicative disposition as i have a question to ask you that must be answered   lord sea must colonel   col yes my lord it must be resolved  where is miss melville   lord sea that question colonel neither must nor can be resolved by me  i know not where she is   col can it be possible you should be mean enough to attempt to screen an act of perfidy and baseness beneath the flimsy subterfuge of falsehood but twill not do my lord we must not part till you inform me where miss melville is and from her lips which used to be the oracles of truth i will learn all the rest   lord sea you really astonish me sir with a language as little becoming you to use as for me to bear   col the man who has deserved such language ought to bear it courage and falsehood never dwelt together and when the mind is so far debased as to forge a tale to impose upon a friend all pretense to bravery is but a jest  a madmans phrenzy or a cowards rage   lord sea i can endure this insolence no longer this roof is your protection for the present sir but quit it instantly and let us quickly meet where the vile term you have now used may light on him who most deserves it   col unworthy as i think your lordships conduct i cannot yet refuse your appointment  tomorrow morning i shall call upon you  till then farewell my lord exit   lord sea you shall find me ready sir how was it possible for him to know that i had seen miss melville when i came in the servant told me my wife was ill and had not seen the colonel  she could not therefore nay she would not tell him  but it matters not at present who informed him i never meant to injure him i did not know of his passion for charlotte till after i was married and had i on his return acknowledged each circumstance that ever passed between us he could not have condemned me how weak and culpable is want of frankness this alone has involved me in all my difficulties   enter waters with a letter wat from mrs frankly my lord exit   lord sea  reads notwithstanding inhumanity unkind treatment of me  fondness triumphed  still weak enough  possibly hazard  breaking off  advantageous match  a man i detest  but what is worldly interest etc  mary frankly   despicable yet unhappy woman the artful meanness of her conduct this evening has sunk her below my pity this marriage that she hints at is thrown out merely to draw me to her lure  but it is in vain for i shall never see or think of her again indeed i have something more material to take up my thoughts at present  this hasty conduct of ramsays distresses me extremely  but it is first necessary that i should clear miss melvilles conduct to my wife  they must be mutual sufferers by the continuance of lady seatons mistake and she at least deserves all my endeavors to restore her peace though i cannot account for her following me to mrs franklys this evening but grant it were a fault it is her first to me and mine i confess to have been manifold against her  who is there  enter waters ask markam if her lady be in her dressing room and let her know that i desire to speak with her exit waters in what different points of view do the same objects present themselves at different times before us the seriousness of my present situation has removed the veil which the false notions and loose manners of the present world had spread over my thoughts and actions i see now the impropriety nay the inhumanity of my whole conduct to lady seaton and wish though perhaps too late that it may yet be in my power to make her every atonement  enter lady seaton in confusion you seem alarmed madam but lay aside your fears  you have nothing to apprehend   lady sea the consciousness my lord of having offended you though most inadvertently must certainly render me unhappy   lord sea the extraordinary step you took this evening madam appears to be but little consistent with the delicacy of the sentiment you now express   lady sea if you will condescend to hear my motives for it my lord you will not judge so hardly of me i then thought miss melville innocent    lord sea and so by heaven she is   lady sea my lord   lord sea yes madam i repeat it and though to support my assertion i shall be obliged to accuse myself yet will i do her merit the justice it deserves on my return from italy at the same moment i beheld ye both    lady sea stop there my lord  too well alas i know who then won the preference in your affections   lord sea passion is involuntary madam but i had hopes that reason which directed my addresses to you would have conquered that partiality   lady sea impossible my lord i fear and blushing own that though i perceived your attachment to my rival i yet nourished in my breast the same to you  by vain selflove misled i fondly thought i might perhaps inspire the tenderness i felt  my weakness has been punished as it ought   lord sea you judge yourself too severely madam  it is i alone am culpable   lady sea we both deceived ourselves my lord and both have been to blame   lord sea i would not wish madam to involve you in my errors and am sincerely sorry you should have suffered by them  let me now proceed  after some unsuccessful struggles with myself i at length determined to confess my prepossession for miss melville and break off the treaty with you  i wrote to her accordingly on the subject  her answer was consistent with that worth which dignifies her whole conduct she owned ingenuously that her heart had been preingaged but also generously assured me that were it perfectly free she could never have availed herself of my preference in her favor to your prejudice   lady sea generous charming girl how have i injured her   lord sea i have reason to believe that she left this house in hopes her absence might efface my passion and suffer your beauty and merits madam to produce the effect they must naturally have had upon a disengaged heart from that moment till this evening and that by accident merely i declare i never saw or heard from her and was at that instant only entreating her return to you again if therefore you have conceived one doubt to her dishonor banish it for ever from your mind   lady sea i never had a doubt my lord of charlottes worth nor was it jealousy but friendship that brought me to be a witness of that scene which first disturbed my confidence in her  but you have now restored it and if i knew where to direct my course i would this moment fly to entreat her pardon as i do yours for i have injured you beyond the hope of an atonement  twas selfish vanity inspired the cruel wish of being yours without the power of paying back the happiness i received   lord sea nay madam do not speak so humbly  the polite attentions which i paid you joined to your own personal charms and merits might without vanity have made you think that you possessed my love whilst i false to your happiness as well as to my own knew but too well i had not then a heart to give   lady sea in vain my lord you kindly strive to set my mind at peace and reconcile me to an error that has been fatal to us both i fear   lord sea i am too sensible how far i have wronged you to bear this generous contest but may i hope the frankness i have shown in thus discovering to you the weakness of my conduct will at least assure you of my confidence and esteem   lady sea i ask no more my lord and shall ever study to deserve them   lord sea the kindness and condescension of that speech lady seaton merits much more and has awaked my tenderness  but is that worthy your acceptance now   lady sea the world were well exchanged for such a treasure   lord sea accept then thou most deserving of thy sex a heart more surely thine than if it had first been led to you by passion only for that is liable to change but kindness and worth like yours must naturally inspire unfading love   lady sea my tears alone can speak my joy my gratitude   lord sea thus let me wipe away the precious drops and with them all remembrance of my past follies  embraces her   enter the governor gov why hey dey what wind blows now but no matter this at least is as it should be and just so i hope little spousey and i will spend our time together i have a business of consequence to communicate to your lordship  i do all above board do you see and as i thought you were dull and alone i came up to discourse you a little  i am glad to see you recovered niece they told me you were sick and kept your chamber   lady sea i am much better sir and now may truly say that i am well and happy   gov and i am truly glad of both my dear niece   lord sea  to lady seaton can it be possible my dear that generous as your nature is a woman can sincerely pardon a preference once shown to another   lady sea the doubts unkind  but ask yourself my lord can there be any thing in nature more pleasing to a generous mind than to have something to forgive   gov why this is downright making love my lord and renders me the more impatient to talk of my own affairs do you see   lord sea retire my dear and rest assured that all my future life shall be devoted to the continuance of our present happiness   lady sea your kind intentions have secured its permanence and made my bliss complete exit   lord sea  lord seaton looking after her how little do we foresee the evils that await us the apprehensions of what that amiable woman may have yet to suffer on my account disturb me much   gov why for that matter my lord i am a little disturbed myself do you see or else i would not have troubled you  you must know then that i am going to be married out of hand directly and my friend bull who was to have given away the bride writes me word that he cannot attend my wedding  but if your lordship will be so good to supply his place do you see    lord sea i heartily wish you joy governor and will readily accept the office but pray who is our aunt to be   gov one that you have seen very lately my lord but you dont know half her good qualities perhaps she is the modestest most reserved little rogue  and a man at my time of life you know and in these times too has no business with a fine gay flaunting lady do you see   lord sea not much truly sir   gov no no ned anderson is no such simpleton i have chosen a sober discreet young creature very handsome withal  that will mind family matters and be proud of her husbands company do you see  cannot you guess now my lord there are but few in these days that can answer such a description i fancy    lord sea very few i believe governor and i happen to be wholly unacquainted with any of that small number   gov why then not to puzzle you farther my lord the first letter of her name is frankly    lord sea frankly   gov why yes my lord the pretty widow at whose house we happened to meet this evening  she was mightily concerned for my niece i assure you for she is very strict and was greatly out of sorts at your behavior and by the way you ought to be a little more cautious in your conduct and not expose yourself by pursuing a girl into a strange house do you see    lord sea i am much obliged to you for your advice sir but pray will you give me leave to ask you by what means you became acquainted with this same paragon of virtue   gov why my good friend honest sam bull the broker having in the course of our business together conceived a particular regard for me introduced me to his niece some time ago  she has a jointure of six hundred per annum and he was plaguily afraid that some young fop might run away with her and use her ill he therefore recommended me as one that would be a kind of a father to her do you see    lord sea yes that i do see very plainly indeed  but pray is your good friend mr bull a broker for marriages as well as stocks sir   gov no no my lord he made no matter of business of it in the least for though he understands making a bargain as well as any man in the alley he never once talked of a settlement  all all is left to my own honor  but he knows his man that is pretty plain i think    lord sea very apparent truly   gov do you think your lordship can be ready to attend upon us to church by nine tomorrow morning   lord sea tomorrow governor   gov yes tomorrow is to be the happy day nephew   lord sea as circumstances are drawing so near a conclusion sir i will be free enough to tell you that you must not think of mrs frankly for a wife   gov why that is frank and free enough to be sure my lord but i must have some better reason than a mere ipse dixit as nicholas calls it i have always been a man of honor to the ladies my lord   lord sea i approve your chivalry governor but with this reserve that you are sure your ladies be also ladies of honor on their part lest your knighterrantry should be dishonored by your galantry and as it is happily not yet too late i may venture to tell you that your present dulcinea is totally devoid of such a character   gov not too late ay truly but it is though for i have not even so much as an acknowledgment under her hand for five hundred pounds i lent her this very morning to fee her lawyers and i gave her a pair of earrings not a month ago that cost me five hundred pounds more but if she has no honor it is well she has some land at least bull assures me that her jointure is a good six hundred per annum   lord sea what upon his estate governor   gov i never heard he had one   lord sea nor i either i promise you and i rather doubt his having a foot of ground to stand upon in the alley much longer   gov dont say so my lord you will break my heart if bull has waddled out a lame duck i may be an undone man for aught i see   lord sea matters may not be so bad as you apprehend but at any rate i think you have reason to rejoice at having escaped being mrs franklys dupe at least   gov rejoice at what that i have been deceived and disappointed in the woman i had set my heart upon when it is too late in life to think of mending myself elsewhere but i will have my money and my jewels from her if they are to be had do you see before we part   lord sea you will find it rather a difficult matter i fancy to recover your property out of such hands but i wish you success and a good night with all my heart governor exit   gov a good night fine talking truly after you have broke my rest i dont believe i shall be able to get a

it has broke my heart to see how you have been cheated and deceived both by mr bull and mrs frankly   gov you acknowledge it then but i will show them the difference immediately and bull may look out for some fitter dupe to repair the honor and fortune of his family by marrying his niece   lucy his niece why that indeed sounds well sir    gov why is not bull her uncle girl   lucy no more related to her sir than you are the very jewels you gave her sir are gone past redemption sold sir to supply her uncles necessities and will never more be heard of believe me   gov i am struck dumb with amazement but if bull be not her uncle why should she bestow him her jewels do you see   lucy lord sir there may be closer connections than relations i suppose in the world   gov i shall be petrified

on the wrong side there i can answer for it    gov my hair stands an end at her wickedness as for you girl there take my purse as a reward for your honesty do you see  but never let me see you or any

squeez no really sir mr bull did not bring me a farthing but i believe he has carried that and himself off together by the light of the moon for he was not to be found at his own house at daybreak

scoundrel and a pretty face    squeez what signifies all this to your seat in the house honors sir dont spring up like mushrooms in a night  they are not to be had when where and how you please   gov

villain bull if it is to be had in the land was there ever so unfortunate a man as i am disappointed in every thing  plundered by every body what a pack of troubles have i brought upon myself without designing the least manner of mischief to any one alive exit   mrs frankly s house mrs frankly alone bulls absconding and lucys deserting me in so critical a situation have happened most unluckily what excuse can i make for bulls absence to the governor he was here late last night and raving at being refused admittance fear of detection what a curse art thou o could the young and artless mind but know the agonies that dwell with guilt it would prefer the humblest lot with peace to all that splendid vice can ever bestow  but what have i to do with such reflections now no reply yet from seaton  his cold unkindness stabs me to the heart  my dear governor   enter the governor in a passion gov thou worse than a vulture or a kite  thou cruellest and most ungrateful of women i know not where to begin nor in what language to speak of you   mrs frank what can this mean lucy has betrayed me i fear aside   gov i am thoroughly acquainted with your arts i know all your history at full length do you see   mrs frank i hope it has entertained you sir for you seem to be much engaged with it   gov dont offer to interrupt me  let me speak i say that villain bull that fellow that passed for your uncle is no more related to you than the great mogul he is your galant it seems and you meant to marry me merely to make his fortune   mrs frank mr bull of all creatures my galant this is too ridiculous sir   gov it is true for all that as honest lucy has assured me  and the very jewels i gave you nay perhaps the money i advanced to see your lawyers ungenerous woman have been all sacrificed to him   mrs frank lucy and so honest mrs lucy is your informer sir i give you joy of your authority   gov dont answer me i say thou harpy  i have not brought half my charges against you yet   mrs frank i shall not attempt to answer you indeed sir as you really appear to be quite out of your reason at present and there is no arguing with a madman   gov if i am mad it is you that have made me so  but your insolence shall not defend you i will expose you and your good uncle bull to the whole world i will not confine myself to one quarter of it  all india shall know how you have used me where are the earrings i gave you where are my jewels i say show them to me this instant i insist upon seeing them at least   mrs frank how is that possible pray if i have already given them to mr bull  delirious   gov her assurance amazes me  i thought she would have fallen at my feet and implored my pardon   mrs frank no really sir  injured innocence has a right to resent    gov injured innocence  that word has almost choked me  this is too much  then madam injured innocence i have accused you wrongfully it seems    mrs frank so you may possibly find sir when perhaps it may be too late to repent of it   gov and why the plague dont you justify yourself then   mrs frank so i would sir if you were in a condition to hear reason   gov well well  speak  speak freely  i am perfectly cool  quite calm madam   mrs frank hear me then all this rage of yours proceeds from lucys having trumped up a false story    gov a false story hell and the furies then prove it so madam   mrs frank dont swear sir  remember you are perfectly cool  quite calm you know   gov well well i am so i had forgot  go on madam now without interruption   mrs frank then first sir give me leave to ask you if you are acquainted with the reason of lucys quitting my service   gov yes madam because she could not bear to be a witness of your imposing on me   mrs frank just the reverse sir  i turned her out of my house last night for abusing you ungenerous as you are   gov abusing me why what could the minx find to say against me   mrs frank how can you think said she of burying your youth beauty and fortune in the arms of your grandfather when there are so many    gov grandfather confound the jade  let me hear no more of her impertinence but come to the point madam where is your uncle and where are my diamonds do you see   mrs frank mr bull sir is gone into wiltshire to bring up a witness to prove my dear mr franklys last will  and as to the diamonds sir lucy you say has given you a full account of them   gov yes yes and a receipt in full too madam  your pretended uncle has carried them into wiltshire to bribe your evidence i suppose   mrs frank mr bull has them then mighty well sir and if i was to produce them now what would you say then sir   gov say why really in such a case madam i should say  hang me if i know what i should say  but it is absolutely impossible    mrs frank then not to satisfy but to shock you look there  opening a casket he starts  now take them back again sir for as i prized them more as a token than a gift they have lost their value with your unkindness weeps   gov i am confounded i am dead the very jewels i gave her that is certain that vile jade lucy i see you are innocent madam and must implore your pardon for having doubted it   mrs frank you ought not to have doubted it sir nor have ventured to insult a woman of honor upon the testimony of a wretch whom common sense might have informed you i should not have discarded had it been in her power to have hurt me   gov why to be sure i might have thought of that madam but you cannot conceive what a pack of plausible lies she told me  she said you were in love too with lord seaton who despised you  nay his lordship spoke to your disadvantage himself also and first cautioned me against marrying you   mrs frank but surely now any person of common sense sir would have considered his endeavor to prevent it as a proof rather of love than of hate  i soon perceived he had gained lucy over to his interest which was the chief reason of my discharging her in revenge for which she invented all those abominable stories and you were weak enough to believe them   gov i have been weak enough to be sure but you shall find now that i am perfectly satisfied   mrs frank you allow then that you have been in the wrong sir    gov exceedingly   mrs frank and that you have been duped by a woman    gov shamefully  i see it now  i feel it  yes yes i have been duped indeed with a vengeance   mrs frank and you really do repent of your credulity   gov repent shall hang myself if you do not forgive me   mrs frank well well then i do forgive you sir   gov and i ask your pardon again and again  so now let us kiss and friends  kiss and friends for life do you see i shall think every minute an age till we are one  well be married this very day let us lose no time do you see i will step home and bring nicholas directly to give you away and do you run in and prepare so that there may be no waiting when we call on you   mrs frank you trespass on my fondness which pleads your cause so strongly for had you less love you would have had less jealousy and the excess of one should ever atone for the vioce of the other and so i shall be ready to attend you sir exit   gov why that is very goodnatured and very true too yes indeed i do love her monstrously or i should not have been so jealous but for all this i shall discourse my lord seaton a little before i am married for i neither can nor will be satisfied till i have made him recant his calumny exit   scene mrs freemans house enter miss melville char the hurry and agitation i passed through yesterday evening have discomposed my spirits so much that i find it impossible to rest mrs freeman is not yet up so that i have sufficient leisure to reflect on the extraordinary adventures of yesterday which i confess appear to me now more like a vision than a fact i am impatient till all this mystery is explained that i may have an opportunity of clearing my conduct to my amiable friend if the weight only of an imputed crime be so hard to bear what a burden must real guilt be lord seaton said something i think of colonel ramsay i dare not flatter my hopes about his arrival as mrs freeman knows nothing of it yet but see beyond a doubt my wishes are accomplished  enter colonel ramsay you are welcome to england sir   col i have been so long absent madam that i own myself rather surprised at your recollection of a person whom i hoped for your own sake you had totally forgotten and you must pardon me if i also add that my wonder is a good deal increased by seeing you at present in mrs freemans house   char what can this mean surely it is you sir who have forgotten both yourself and me or after two tedious years of absence it were not possible we should meet thus   col i fancy madam that the absence of an injured lover does not appear tedious to those who enjoy the presence of a favored one lord seaton madam has sufficiently consoled you for my loss   char lord seaton   col you seem surprised but i am too well informed of your connection however madam i did not mean to upbraid or intrude upon you now i came here only to see my sister and have but a short time to spare to her from a very particular and pressing engagement   char be your engagements what they may sir i have a right to expect you should explain the meaning of your present conduct toward me as far at least as it respects my character   col you speak madam as if you thought you still retained the power you once had over me but you have forfeited it and i am no longer now the dupe of my own weakness or of your deceit   char o ramsay how have i deserved this treatment   col i cannot bear her tears aside i wish not madam to offend or wound you  you are mistress of your own actions and all i shall further say upon this subject is that had your new engagement been more for your own honor your perfidy might have been more pardonable to one who respected your character as much as he admired your person   char i do not comprehend you sir what engagements have i entered into inconsistent with that preference i had too hastily i fear confessed for you   col the ties of hearts like mine are formed by honor only madam nor could i ever take advantage of a womans fondness to hurt her innocence or wound her fame lord seaton is a more modern kind of lover madam   char lord seaton again what can you mean by him is he not married sir   col for his unhappy ladys sake as well as yours i would he were not the woman i once loved might then have had some excuse   char i can sustain this injury no longer  have you not known me from my earliest youth   col no madam it is plain i did not my fond imagination had indeed conceived a fair idea from miss melvilles form  a heart replete with honor love and constancy virtues too seldom found in your frail sex and it was vanity in me to hope i should engross so rare a treasure   char what have i done to forfeit your opinion but i will condescend to waive the pride of injured virtue and tell you sir that you are much deceived   col i have been so i own but the deliriums fled my time is precious now  i came hither on other purpose madam and neither thought or wished to have met you here   char can it be possible the time should come when ramsay should not wish to see me   col too many hours have i alas devoted to the fond impatience of seeing her i loved  twas the reward i promised to myself for toil for danger for the still greater pangs of absence  and how have you repaid my anxious hope   char if the most constant unabated tenderness and esteem could have repaid the sufferings you pretend i should not now be deemed your debtor nor would a lover such as you would seem have listened to a tale invented by some fiend to blast my honor o ramsay it is now alas too plain you never loved   col i know not what to think  she speaks with confidence and looks with innocence  yet lady seaton surely could not invent a falsehood perhaps i have been too rash and yet i have not time to repair my error now my honor is elsewhere too far engaged at present and the time draws near aside if ever we should meet again miss melville you will be then convinced that i have loved   char what do you say if ever we should meet do not distract me sir  you must not leave me till this riddle is explained and you convinced both of my truth and love   col you must excuse me madam for the present though it is a subject of the dearest import i cannot now attend the explication  going   enter a servant serve lord seaton madam exit   char lord seaton what can his visit mean   col o fair dissembler my doubts are all explained   enter lord seaton lord sea i come madam to make my apology for having been though inadvertently the cause of any anxiety or distress to you   char indeed my lord i know not how i have deserved it but you have been the source of most mortifying difficulties and distresses to me but surely you will now be candid and generous enough to undeceive this gentleman my friend  i know not what to style him  colonel ramsay with regard to me   col o spare yourself and him the trouble madam you are mistaken i am not deceived i know lord seaton well and know miss melville too   lord sea blind and ungrateful as you are to love and friendship yet for miss melvilles sake    col o sir i doubt not but for her dear sake your lordship may generously condescend to vouch her honor with the loss of yours but my lord you know there is another mode of satisfying me aside to lord seaton   enter lady seaton who runs to miss melville and embraces her lady sea my dear my injured charlotte i have not words to atone the wrong i have done you but hope in colonel ramsay to obtain an advocate more powerful than myself for your forgiveness   col this surely must be illusion all my feet are rooted to the spot i stand upon with wonder aside   char my dear lady seaton this is too good too condescending and too kind i meant to have gone to you   lady sea no my friend nothing can be too much from one who has injured innocence and worth like yours by doubting of your virtue for a moment   char i cannot comprehend this mystery  it is impossible that you should wrong me some spell has surely been cast round me for ramsay too has doubted of my truth and love   lady sea i only i who formed the charm can break it my weak unjust suspicions have betrayed you into error your censure and resentment therefore should light on me alone to the colonel   char i am perplexed  what can all this mean   col it means my charlotte that my too hasty credulity has hurried me into a fault which i can never hope you should forgive the suspecting truth and virtue such as yours   char to doubt of pardon on repentance aggravates the crime for who that pretends not to perfection in themselves shall dare to be implacable to anothers sailings but still i am in the dark and on the rack to know how all this strange confusion has been conjured up   lady sea it arose entirely from my indiscretion in letting drop to markam my having met you at mrs franklys she happened to see the colonel immediately after and informed him of all and perhaps more than she knew   col at mrs franklys   char yes at mrs franklys take care colonel relapses are dangerous to susceptible constitutions  but i shall at more leisure account to you for so extraordinary an incident   col and i shall most patiently wait till you think proper to gratify merely my curiosity in that particular   char but mine is not to be satisfied till i know how lady seaton should come there   lady sea and i am ready to indulge you  unhappy at your absence my dear charlotte i ordered my servant to make every possible inquiry to find you out  he saw you by chance going into mrs franklys and was informed you lived there i immediately flew to request your company in hopes of agreeably surprising both you and the colonel with an unexpected interview at my house you know the unhappy mistake occasioned then by mrs franklys behavior for which i again ask both my lords pardon and yours   lord sea the nobleness of your behavior upon that occasion my dear has fully entitled you to the warmest gratitude of every person present though you yet know not how highly meritorious your conduct has been to us all   col i blush to think how i have injured your lordship by my rashness and here throw myself on your generosity for forgiveness   lord sea you shall not stoop to ask it colonel  forgiveness we bestow upon our enemies  but we are now and ever shall be friends   enter a servant ser a gentleman seeing your lordships carriage at the door inquired if you were here and desires to speak with you   lord sea i shall attend him exit servant by the degree of familiarity he uses i fancy it must be the governor   char if it be my lord pray desire him to walk up   lord sea you see madam he introduces himself without a gentleman usher   enter the governor gov i have been at your house to look for you my lord   lord sea well governor and now you have found me what are your commands   gov why my lord i have both questions and commands to propose to you do you see though i think you have been more inclined to a game of crosspurposes than any thing else lately but in plain english i think you have behaved very ungenerously in this affair of my marriage let me tell you   char his marriage bless us with whom   lord sea your charge is severe governor but prithee explain yourself for at present i dont understand you   gov i shall make it plain enough i warrant you  i mean my lord that you have traduced the character of a woman whose honor i am bound to support by every principle of a man and i never yet put up with an affront nor ever will do you see   lord sea spoken like a champion stout and strong governor   gov i dont mean to act the bravo my lord though i have faced a nabob at the head of his forces before now but all i desire of you at present is that as a man of honor you will come with me and ask mrs franklys pardon before we go to church together   lord sea indeed governor you must excuse me from going through such a ceremony and also for endeavoring to prevent your going through a more serious one with a woman who is    gov dont venture to say a word against her beauty or her virtue my lord or i may not be able to command myself perhaps   lord sea the goodness and generosity of your own heart governor render you too liable to imposition it is the nature of man to impute their own principles to others be they good or bad   gov why i am not apt to be suspicious that is certain and when i met you at my pretty widows yesterday evening i little thought that we had been rivals do you see   lord sea to convince you sir as well as the rest of this company that i have no farther designs upon that lady i here resign into your hands the last favor i received from hers read that governor  gives him mrs franklys letter   gov putting on his spectacles hey day  what is this a billet to you she has been very nimble in sending it truly  i thought i had made tolerable haste in finding you myself but my legs are none of the best to be sure opens the letter and reads notwithstanding the inhumanity of your unkind treatment of me you see my lord she resents your behavior mightily my fondness has triumphed over my resentment and i am still weak enough to desire another interview why what can all this mean this letter should have been directed to me    lord sea proceed sir and the mystery will soon vanish   gov though by seeing you again i may possibly hazard the breaking off an advantageous match with a man i detest hell and the furies what is this does she mean me the crocodile of the nile and the shark of the ganges had she nobody to play off her monkey tricks upon but me detest me   lord sea compose your rage good governor and finish the epistle   gov compose the devil my lord why i cannot see a word more of it  i am struck blind with passion  this comes of my falling in love forsooth and wanting to be married to a young girl truly   lord sea you are cheaply off governor at the expense only of a little laughing and i think i have a right to my share of that  ha ha ha    gov cheaply off now i think that what between money and mortification i have paid plaguey dear for my experiment  but i will have my revenge do you see and shall go this moment in pursuit of it   lord sea i must stop you sir till your passion has subsided a little and then i will venture to trust to your good nature   gov dont tell me of good nature my lord she has made my heart as hard as a rock   enter a servant with a letter to the governor serve the messenger waits for an answer sir   exit gov what is this another billetdoux from the traitress   char he is in a horrid passion my lord   lord sea not without reason i assure you madam   gov reading i shall burst with rage  there never was such a villainous proceeding a rascally coachmaker a varnishing scoundrel i think that is his name my lord threatens to arrest me for a debt i never contracted because the fellow thought i had been married this morning do you see  it would have been a pretty sort of incident truly to have happened on ones wedding day   lord sea i apprehend governor that this would not have been the only circumstance of the kind you would have had to celebrate your nuptials if you had married that lady   gov no no i did not fight gentoos marattoes seapoys and climates do you see to be bamboozled out of my money at home   lord sea except by a pretty woman governor   gov nor by her neither when i find her false and so mr vanish may arrest mrs frankly as soon as he pleases for me   lord sea no sir that debt i shall take upon myself with pleasure for the happiness i have received through mrs franklys means of knowing and esteeming lady seaton as i ought besides a woman in distress however incurred is always entitled to the compassion and protection of a man of honor   gov nay for that matter my lord let me have but a little of my own way do you see and i can be as liberal as the best of you i am passionate but not severe and so i forgive the injury and shall discharge that debt for methinks a mans mind and his means must be miserably poor indeed who cannot afford to give and forgive too    col nobly said sir  i find you have brought over not only the wealth but the humanity of the east indians along with you   lord sea his tastes and manners may be foreign perhaps colonel but his goodnature and generosity are true english staple a briton need never go a trafficking for principles   gov well take me as i am  i have bought some wisdom for myself at present for i shall not so readily believe that the women are in love with me now as they might have been some thirty years ago and so i shall think no more about a wife for some time at least do you see unless i should renew my courtship to my old passion miss melville here   char take care of that governor lest you should make the colonel jealous   gov nay if you are inclined to list with him do you see i will keep clear of you for it is dangerous meddling with other mens wives nowadays i hear   col if our modern marriages sir were contracted upon the same principles i flatter myself ours is likely to be a thorough love and esteem for each other we should neither have so many libertine husbands or faithless wives   true worth alone can form the charm that binds and rivet beautys chains upon the mind end of the fifth act epilogue by
