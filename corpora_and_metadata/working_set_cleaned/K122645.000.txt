an essay on the suretiship of christ  in two parts part i the doctrine stated part ii objections answered   by samuel richardson  by so much was jesus made a surety of a better testament heb vii     chester printed by c w leadbeater for the author and sold by w button paternosterrow t knott lombard street london leadbeater and the author chester morrisson perth and gillies glasgow      price  s  preface although the following essay originated in a private controversy that is a controversy carried on for some time in private between the church of which i am a member and some other churches of the same denomination and although i am in some measure sensible of my literary defects yet something may be said by way of apology for my appearing thus in print    we have no other way of communicating our sentiments to all who are concerned in this controversy    some who were not immediately concerned herein have heard of the dispute and our sentiments have been so much misunderstood that it seems necessary to rectify these mistakes   the subject in debate is in our estimation of infinite importance and of universal concernment and therefore i have not confined myself to the question as it stood amongst ourselves but have endeavored to treat it in such a manner as to make this essay equally interesting and useful to all who read it   although the truth of christianity in general has been supported with ability and success against the bold attack made by mr thomas pain yet i have not met with any thing which i could esteem as a sufficient reply to the argument he has urged against that grand peculiarity of the gospel  the doctrine of redemption i have therefore attempted something in that way   i am in hopes that if there should seem a necessity for it this little essay may give occasion to some more able friend to take up his pen  for the rest i can only say to the critic  spare me  but to the deist jew or christian i say  spare not  so much by way of apology  i have used very freely every thing i found to my purpose in human authors but i never rest any part of the argument upon their authority they frequently helped me to express my own thoughts with more ease and clearness than i could otherwise have done and therefore i used their words but so far am i from building upon the authority of their names that i differ widely from almost all of them upon other matters  the age of popery is gone let every man now exercise his own reasoning powers and be fully persuaded in his own mind  but although i reject all human authority in matters of a religious nature i have so frequently referred to the authority of revelation that i fear the reader will not have patience to examine the sacred text yet it is what he ought to do  as to that part of the book which is controversial i can only say   i hope i have neither misrepresented the sentiments nor abused the person of any man   the replies i have made and the proofs i have advanced appear to me to be conclusive and i am fully satisfied that the doctrine we maintain is the most just to god and the most safe to man that can be imagined but i do not expect that every one else will be thus minded when we do not like a sentiment it is easy to misrepresent it to ourselves and others we can start objections and refuse to be satisfied and as to scripture texts we can either find a different sense for the words as they stand or we can alter the translation at least we may darken or perplex the question so as to make it a matter of doubtful disputation which therefore ought not to be insisted upon for instance   some perhaps may say  what a piece of work is here about a single word christ is called a surety only once in all the bible and even then he is not said to be the surety of sinners but the surety of a testament  yet here is a book written upon the suretiship of christ  i shall conclude the preface with a reply to this    although christ is only once expressly called a surety yet since it is god who calls him so we are absolutely certain that christ does sustain this character we do not find that it was said to adam any more than once  on the day that thou eatest thereof thou shall surely die  was the threatening less certain or of less importance i might multiply instances of this kind the word atonement occurs but once in the new testament but the thing intended thereby is often mentioned so it is with respect to the suretiship of christ  as to the word testament it will be granted that it is of the same import in this place as the word covenant see mr mleans treatise on the apostolic commission p    now as this is certainly a covenant between god and man christ must be the surety of sinners for the following reasons    eggus or egguhths a surety is one that undertaketh for another wherein he is defective really or in reputation whatever the undertaking be whether in words or promise or in depositing a real security in the hands of an arbitrator or by any other personal engagement of life and body it respects the defect of the person for whom any one becomes a surety such an one is sponsor or fidejussor in all good authors and common use of speech and if any one be of absolute credit himself and of a reputation very unquestionable there is no need of a surety unless in case of mortality the words of a surety in the behalf of another whose ability or reputation is dubious are ad me recipio faciet aut faciam i take the matter upon me he shall do it or i will    god therefore can have no surety properly because there can be no conceiveable defect on his part there may be indeed a question whether any words or promise be his but to assure us of that is not the work of a surety but of any means whatever that may give evidence that it is so he does indeed make use of witnesses to confirm his word that is to testify that he has made such promises but the difference is wide enough between a witness and a surety for the latter must be of more ability or more credit and reputation than he for whom he engages or there is no need of his suretiship this none can be for god  and if this be not the notion of a surety in this place the apostle makes use of a word no where else used in the whole scripture to teach us that which it does never signify among men which is sufficiently improbable and absurd for the sole reason why he made use of it was that from the nature and notion of it among men in other cases we may understand what he ascribes under that name to the lord jesus    we on all accounts stand in need of a surety for us or on our behalf neither without the interposition of such a surety could any covenant between god and us be firm and stable or an everlasting covenant ordered in all things and sure in the first covenant made with adam there was no surety but god and men were the immediate covenanters and although we were then in a state and condition able to perform and answer all the terms of the covenant yet was it broken and disannulled if this came to pass by the failure of the promise of god it was necessary that on the making of a new covenant he should have a surety to undertake for him that the covenant might be stable and everlasting but this is false and blasphemous to imagine it was man alone who sailed and broke that covenant wherefore it was necessary that upon the making of the new covenant and that with a design and purpose that it should never be disannulled as the former was that we should have a surety and undertaker for us for if that first covenant was not firm and stable because there was no surety to undertake for us notwithstanding all that ability which we had to answer the terms of it how much less can any other be so now our natures are become depraved and sinful wherefore we alone were capable of a surety properly so called we alone stood in need of him and without him the covenant could not be firm and inviolate on our parts the surety therefore of this covenant is so with god for us    it is the priesthood of christ that the apostle treats of in this place and that alone wherefore seeing the lord christ is the surety of the covenant as a priest and all the sacerdotal actings of christ have god for their immediate object and are performed with him on our behalf he was properly a surety for us  dr owen  the following pages are designed to state and defend that work which christ performed in the capacity of a surety i have attempted to prove that he acted in this capacity from his infancy to his death in obeying the commandments and suffering the penalty of the moral law this is the doctrine however expressed which these lines are intended to maintain i contend not about particular words or modes of expression the truth itself and not any particular mode of expressing it is that which i labor to defend neither is it every particular circumstance attending the life death resurrection and ascension of christ as they are stated in this essay which i contend for i have mentioned these circumstances as i found them or as i think i found them in the scriptures and that for the sake of illustration but they are not all essential to the main point as expressed above  therefore if any one should think it his duty to animadvert upon this essay let him not spend his time in cavilling at mere expressions or circumstances but attend to the main doctrine in question  chester dec        s richardson  an essay on the suretiship of christ part i the doctrine stated section i on the state of man by nature i take it for granted that there is a god who presides over the universe and takes notice of the moral actions of men and consequently that there is a future state of rewards and punishments of happiness and misery it is also reasonable to believe that the moral law delivered by moses and continued as a rule of life to christians under the new testament dispensation is in fubstance the very same law which naturally binds all men and by which god will judge the world this law dictates to us our duty toward god and man it also promises happiness to the obedient and condemns the sinner    the moral law requires that we love the only true god with all our heart soul mind and strength this is the first and great commandment the second is like unto it namely thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself upon these two commandments hang all the law mat       0 whatsoever flows naturally from this principle of love is a part of the moral law romans      0 and is binding upon all mankind romans          this law is enforced by a promise and a threatening if thou will enter into life keep the commandments mat       romans  0   but cursed is every one who continues not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them gal    0  to be bound upon these terms to keep the commandments is what the scriptures usually intend by the expression  under the law romans      chap        all men are by nature under this law the heathen nations who had not this law as delivered by moses were nevertheless bound by it as it is made known by the light of nature all mankind lunaticks idiots and infants excepted may and actually do know enough of this law to constitute them sinners and leave them without excuse when they act contrary to it  in speaking of a law of nature we have no occasion to strive with philosophers about what they call innate ideas equally impertinent would it be to enquire what impressions of duty men would have had if they were otherwise framed and situated than what they are that is if they were not every where surrounded with the visible works of their creator if they were not furnished with powers of body and mind suited to perceive these works and if they had not been made male and female parents children brethren etc taking men as they are it is evident they are abundantly furnished with the means of knowledge to render them accountable to their maker for all their ways  that which may be known of god says paul is manifest unto men for god has showed it unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse romans       0 it can do nothing toward invalidating these words of scripture to recount the many absurd notions of the heathen concerning the number and quality of their gods because nothing more absurd has been either thought or done by them in regard to religion than what has been done by those who have lived under the superior light of revelation if transubstantiation cannot prove that we are without a bible no more can idolatry prove that the heathen are without a law of nature  having showed that the heathens transgressed the first part of the law our duty toward god the apostle proceeds to speak of those things which regard man and man and here speaking of the propensity bebetween the different sexes which stands at the head of all other relations among mankind he calls it natural and a similar propensity between those of the same sex he calls unnatural romans          therefore highly criminal is any other argument necessary to evince its criminality beside an appeal to the human breast i hope not  in like manner the other relations formed by nature between parents and their offspring between children of the fame parents etc demand suitable affection and behavour and to counteract that affecton is to act an unnatural part indeed the scriptures every where appeal to the human breast as fixing the law of natural affection thus  can a woman forget her sucking child isa  0     ye being evil know how to give good gifts to your children mat       like as a father pitieth his children psalm  0     etc etc remarkable are the words of paul romans         here he says that the gentiles who had not the written law of moses were nevertheless a law unto themselves he says they did the work of the law by nature which showed it written in their hearts not indeed by perfect obedience to it but as he says by their mutual accusations and excuses touching the breaches of it in this sense we see many in our own days doing the work of the law even while they are in the act of disobeying it we can see the most infamous characters amongst men accusing each other and by their rapid exchange of the odious terms drunkard whore thief liar ungrateful etc we see them very quick sighted and very capable of doing that work of the law which consists in condemning the guilty now paul says they did this in his days by nature moreover  the apostle shows not only that the heathen had a sense of right and wrong but also that they knew the judgment of god against sinners romans      and when we consider how universally sacrifices prevailed amongst the heathen nations we see pauls testimony corroborated and we may conclude that a dread of future punishment ever haunts the guilty breast in a greater or less degree  there are two opposite extremes which some men run into upon this subject some deny the very existence of the law of nature whilst others contend for it is sufficiency to bring fallen man to happiness both parties are wrong the law points out our duty finds us guilty condemns us and there it leaves us  when we read the history of all times and nations  when we consider what daily passes before our own eyes and in our own breasts we find a melancholy proof of the scripture doctrine concerning our depraved state the most renowned of the heathen philosophers socrates died in the prosession of idolatry see rollins ancient history the chief man paul in the strictest sect among the jews was found disaffected to the true character of god   timothy      and christians unanimously say  in many things we all offend james       how then shall man be just with god hail thou sun of righteousness from the gloom of guilt and despair we turn our eyes toward thy chearing beams  section ii on the union between christ and his people if in tracing the lowly steps of immanuel from bethlehem to calvary we should view him as a single individual acting for himself alone much of the beauty of his sacred history would be lost to guard against this it may be useful to take some notice in this place of the unity or oneness of christ and his elect the inspired writers speak much of this union and illustrate it in a variety of ways    this union was foreordained  it was fixed upon in the divine mind before the foundation of the world see ephesians chap   throughout    this union began to appear under the old testament dispensation it was prefigured by various types even from the creation downward adam and eve genesis        ephesians         every high priest who bore the names of the twelve tribes upon his shoulders and on his breast exodus         every animal sacrificed in the peoples stead genesis        all these prefigured among other things the union of christ and his people the temple itself appears to have been a type of christ in such a sense as to comprehend his people john        ephesians         nor did this union appear to saints of old only in types and shadows the spirit of christ was in his people even before he came in the flesh   pet      and this spirit by testifying of christ fixed the faith hope and love of the saints in him john      heb       it is true that there is something peculiar in the gift of the divine spirit under the new testament dispensation nevertheless the saints of old were not destitute of this amazing gift    this union between christ and his elect was drawn still closer when the divine word was made flesh and dwelt among us john      for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of abraham at this time and in this way the eternal word became the son of god luke      and the brother of all gods children thus he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified by him are all of one father for which cause he is not ashamed to call them his brethren heb          adam was created the foederal head of his posterity  he stood as our representative and we were all in his loins so long as he obeyed we obeyed in him and when he sell we also sell in him this union prefigured that of christ and his people romans             this union is compared with that which subsists between the root stock and branches of a tree john       and with the union which is formed between the foundation cornerstone and superstructure of an edifice ephesians          and with the union which subsists between a husband and wife particularly that of adam and eve upon this account we are said to be members of his body of his flesh and of his bones ephesians    0  another union largely insisted upon in the word of god is that which we see between the head and members of one and the same living body ephesians         cor         where one spirit animates all the members and governs every motion of the body  this last comparison seems to carry the union of christ with his people to the greatest possible perfection  it approaches to the idea of personal identity indeed the spirit of christ dwelling in and informing and actuating all the members of his body the church forms such a wonderful union between him and them that he compares it to the oneness of the father and the son john             to the idea of union we must add that of a surety heb      a surety we all know is a bondsman or one who gives security for another so that if the debtor himself fails his surety must pay his debts prove          the debt we owe to god considered as his creatures is a perfect and continued obedience to all his righteous commandments but as we are not only creatures but sinners therefore justice has another demand viz satisfaction or atonement for the sin committed  if we carry the sentiments of this section in our minds the next will appear more beautiful and interesting  section iii a summary view of that important work in which every jot and tittle precept and penalty of the moral law are amply fulfilled in our divine surety when our first parents had sinned and thereby forfeited the divine favor and brought misery and death into the world then divine mercy began to unfold itself the seed of the woman should bruise the serpents head genesis      was the first gracious promise to sinful man sacrifices also were immediately appointed which served to cast light upon this obscure promise although this light was small when compared with ours yet it was sufficient to give hope to the guilty and we know not how far the spirit of christ might open their understandings to comprehend it is import certainly when they saw a lamb sacrificed in their stead and their shame and nakedness which sin had discovered hid by the natural clothing of the slaughtered victim genesis    0    they might comprehend something of the true intent of the promise and paul informs us that it was by faith abel offered a more excellent sacrifice than cain heb        at sundry times and in diverse manners heb     this first promise was repeated and further explained the light increasing more and more as the time advanced at length daniel fixed the time for the messiahs appearance and told his nation plainly what their long expected deliverer was to do viz make reconciliation for iniquity and bring in everlasting righteousness dan          when the fullness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem gal       at eight days old he was circumcised luke      thereby intimating that he became a debtor to do the whole law gal     at twelve years old he speaks of being about his fahers business and he speaks of this in such a manner as implies that he had been so employed before this time he mentions it as a thing which ought to have been so well known to mary and joseph as to have prevented that sorrow with which they sought and that amazement with which they found him  how is it that ye sought me said he  wist ye not that i must be about my fathers business luke         but although the child jesus was perfectly acquainted with his own divinity and although he was able to astonish all who heard him yet he went down to nazareth with joseph and mary and was subject unto them luke      in this state he spent the first thirty years of his life luke      during which time it does not appear that he wrought any miracle or manifested forth his glory john      joseph was a carpenter and there is reason to believe that the son of the highest worked at that trade earning his bread like a poor laboring man for he is called not only the carpenters son but the carpenter mark       every period of the redeemers life has a glory peculiar to itself a certain author very properly observes we are apt not to have high enough thoughts of the glory of christs private life yea it is impossible for us to have high enough thoughts of it the peculiar glory of this part of his work consisted in it is obscurity which set an eternal brightness upon holiness upon every duty and act of submission and obedience to god  another writer with less wisdom says as it has seemed good to the wisdom of the holy spirit to be very sparing in the history of his private life we must be contented to remain in ignorance of what is not revealed  that every thing which jesus said and did is not revealed to us is readily granted but this is true not only of his private but also of his public life john       the history of his private life is indeed given in few words but it should be considered that few words are sufficient to record the history of a poor working man in whose days there might be very little variety the disappointment which some men discover in finding so little said in scripture upon this period of our sureties life seems to proceed upon the supposition that his private life was more adorned and diversified with those shining acts which glitter in the eyes of men and commonly excite their admiration and applause than we have any account of in scripture and perhaps this way of thinking has it is foundation in the old jewish prejudice that it was inconsistent with the character of the messiah to be a poor carpenter but those who see the necssity of our sureties obedience to the moral law or eternal rule of righteousness will rejoice to find him thus employed  to find him spending thirty years of his humiliation in doing little else than fulfilling that law in a family connection and in that low and laborious situation to which the original curse had reduced fallen man genesis        those who view immanuel in all this acting as our surety  discharging the very debt in which we were involved will see a peculiar beauty and feel inexpressible satisfaction in the whole they will be ready to adopt the language of paul  we know the grace of our lord jesus christ who though he was rich for our sakes he became poor that we through his poverty might be made rich   cor       at length the scene changes  jesus quits his obscurity and enters public life then comes jesus from galilee to jordan unto john to be baptized of him but john forbad him saying i have need to be baptized of thee and come thou to me and jesus answering said unto him suffer it to be so now for thus it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him and jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and it lighted upon him and lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased mat          the son of god being thus announced an universal terror pervades the infernallegions mark        chap      and men join with devils to resist the sinners friend john      nevertheless he is obeyed whether willingly or by constraint by all sorts of beings the winds and seas and the inhabitants of the deep attend his word mat      chap       john      evil spirits abandon their human habitations mat        diseases of all sorts fly at his command mat        he gives the word and thousands of hungry men are filled with a handful of bread mat         chap         the blind see the lame walk the deaf hear the dead are raised and the poor have the gospel preached unto them luke      thus our surety went about doing good acts  0    yet in the midst of all he himself continues poor a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief isa          he continues poor he appears to have subsisted upon what some of his disciples were pleased to give him luke         but so deficient were these supplies that he has been obliged to work a miracle for tribute money mat       and we find him at times destitute of a place to lay his head mat    0   despised and rejected of men the few indeed who saw his glory as the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth john      worshipped him as their lord and their god mat      chap     chap      and       and       and         luke          john        chap  0    as do the whole church psalms       acts           cor     and all the angels in heaven heb     rev        yet even among these he acted as a servant luke       and washed his disciples feet john        but the chief of the jewish nation were continually reproaching him and thirsting for his blood he was reproached as a glutton and drunkard a friend of publicans and sinners mat       he was called a deceiver john      mat       a madman john      chap  0  0 a samaritan and possessed of a devil john      chap  0  0 they called him a blasphemer john  0    and excommunicated all who owned him as the messiah john         chap       several times they attempted to stone him john      chap  0    and        and once they led him to a precipice intending to dash him to pieces luke           a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief although jesus christ endured all his suffering with more than the patience of job yet he was not insensible or void of feeling one of those psalms psalm    in which we know jesus is the speaker gives us an affecting view of his feelings under the vile reproaches he met with from men thus he laments unto his father  they that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head they that would destroy me being mine enemies wrongfully are mighty then i restored that which i took not away  let not them that wait on thee o lord god of hosts be ashamed for my sake let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake o god of israel because for thy sake i have born reproach shame has covered my face i am become a stranger unto my brethren and an alien unto my mothers children for the zeal of thine house has eaten me up and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me when i wept and chastened my soul with fasting that was to my reproach i made sackcloth my garment and i became a proverb unto them they that sit in the gate speak against me and i was the song of the drunkard  the remainder of this psalm chiefly relates to what took place on the cross but this much evidently belongs to what christ suffered during his public ministry compare the  th verse with john       and the  th verse with john       having gone through the various scenes of private and public life having thus far continued in all things that are written in the book of the law and having already experienced much of that affliction to which sinful man is obnoxious he now enters upon the last awful scene in which he is to finish his work and thus fully discharge that debt which as our surety he had taken upon himself  the hour being come he withdrew to eat his last passover supper with his disciples after supper they left the city repaired to the mount of olives mat     0 and from thence into the garden of gethsemane mat       john      judas was now gone to the chief priests john       0 from whom he was shortly to come with an armed band jesus therefore left part of his disciples mat       at the garden door to wait their arrival and took peter james and john mat       to be witnesses of his passion as they had been of his transfiguration mat        and he began to be sore amazed and to be very heavy and says unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death tarry ye hear and watch and he went forward a little mark         and kneeled down and prayed saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done we are not warranted to conclude that these were all or near all the words which jesus now expressed they may contain the substance of all he prayed for at this time or at least of all which the disciples heard distinctly but from the circumstances of his retiring to pray and the disciples falling asleep while he was praying and his saying to peter when he returned from prayer the first time could thou not watch one hour from these circumstances i say it is evident that jesus continued a considerable time at prayer luke        having thus prayed he returned to the three disciples and finding them asleep he said unto peter simon sleep thou could thou not watch one hour watch ye and pray lest ye enter into temptation the spirit truly is willing but the flesh is weak mat     0  the sorrows of his soul still continuing he went and prayed again to the same purpose saying o my father if this cup may not pass from me except i drink it thy will be done mat        although the three disciples had been admonished in such tender accents by their suffering friend yet their eyes closed again before he had concluded his second prayer so that he found them asleep at his next return by returning thus frequently to his disciples he gave them opportunity to read his diftress in his countenance and gestures once more he leaves them and there appeared an angel unto him from heaven strengthening him and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling to the ground thus our adorable immanuel suffered unspeakable sorrows in his soul as long as divine justice at this time demanded and when he arose up from prayer and was come to his disciples he found them sleeping for sorrow luke         this circumstance shows that they were not quite inattentive to what was passing before them the grief they felt at the sight of his distress so overpowered them that they sank into sleep  judas having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and pharisees now came with lanterns and torches and weapons and jesus knowing all things that should come upon him went forth to meet them and said unto them whom seek ye they said jesus of nazareth jesus said unto them i am he immanuel thought proper to make the guard sensible upon this occasion that they could not take him without his consent and accordingly these words were spoken in such a manner that the whole band went backward and fell to the ground the end being answered he permitted them to recover then asked he them again whom seek ye they said jesus of nazareth jesus answered i have told you that i am he if therefore ye seek me let these pointing to his disciples go their way john       the soldiers or rather some of the servants of the high priest laid hands on jesus mat     0 and peter drew a sword smote one of them and cut off his ear then said jesus unto peter put up thy sword the cup which my father has given me shall i not drink it john    and jesus said suffer ye thus far and he touched his ear and healed him luke        all his disciples forsook him and fled mat         then the band and the captain and the officers of the jews took jesus and bound him john       and led him away to the high priest and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes mark       the high prist then asked jesus of his disciples and of his doctrine jesus answered him i spoke openly to the world i ever taught in the synagogue and in the temple whither the jews always resort and in secret have i said nothing why ask thou me ask them which heard me what i have said unto them behold they know what i said when he had thus spoken one of the officers which stood by struck jesus with the palm of his hand saying answerest thou the high priest so jesus answered him if i have spoken evil bear witness of the evil but if well why smitest thou me john           now the chief priests and elders and all the council sought false witness against jesus to put him to death but found none for though many bare false witness against him their witness did not agree together mark       at last came two false witnesses and said this fellow said i am able to destroy the temple of god and to build it in three days the high priest arose and said unto him answerest thou nothing what is it which these witness against thee but jesus held his peace mat         some of the council said unto him art thou the christ tell us and he said unto them if i tell you ye will not believe and if i also ask you ye will not answer me nor let me go luke         the high priest said unto him i adjure thee by the living god that thou tell us whether thou be the christ the son of god mat       jesus said  i am mark       nevertheless or as some translate it moreover i say unto you hereafter ye shall see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven mat        upon this the whole council exclaimed art thou then the son of god he answered ye say that or that which i am luke     0  then the high priest rent his clothes and said what need we any further witness mark       for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth luke       and they all condemned him to be guilty of death mark       then did they spit in his face mat       they blindsolded him they buffetted him mark       and said prophesy unto us thou christ who it is that smote thee mat       and the servants struck him with the palms of their hands mark         the priests and elders having thus condemned jesus they consulted together again mark      and resolved to carry him before pilate the roman governor that he likewise might pass sentence upon him without this they could not accomplish their purpose because the power of life and death was now taken out of their hands john       then led they jesus from caiaphas unto the hall of judgment pilate went out unto them and said what accusation bring ye against this man they answered if he were not a malefactor we would not have delivered him unto thee pilate said take ye him and judge him according to your law they replied it is not lawful for us to put any man to death john           pilate being obliged to proceed to the trial the jews began to accuse him saying we found this fellow perverting the nation and forbidding to give tribute to caesar saying that he himself is christ a king luke      then pilate entered into the judgmenthall again and called jesus and said unto him art thou the king of the jews jesus answered say thou this thing of thyself or did others tell it thee of me when the jews asked jesus if he was the son of god he answered directly i am but when pilate asked him if he was a king he first sets him right about the import of the question and then he answers it  the question which the jews asked needed no explanation  it was plain they intended to ask if he were the son of god in such a sense as would be blasphemy in any mere creature to this he could directly reply i am but as pilate intended or might be understood to ask if he were a temporal monarch therefore jesus entered into this explanation pilate replied am i a jew thine own nation and the chief priests have dilivered thee unto me what have thou done jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom was of this world then would my servants fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then jesus answered thou say that i am or that which i am a king to this end was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth every one that is of the truth hears my voice  pilate having found that jesus disallowed fighting and only proposed to erect a kingdom by bearing witness to truth he plainly saw that his kingdom could never interfere with the authority of caesar  what is truth said he and immediately went out to the jews and said i find in him no fault at all john           this exasperated the jews much and they were the more fierce saying he stirs up the people teaching throughout all jewry beginning from galilee to this place luke      mark informs us that they accused him of many things but he answered nothing pilate asked him again answerest thou nothing behold how many things they witness against thee but jesus yet answered nothing so that pilate marvelled mark         it is easy to see in pilate the great man in embarrassment he evidently dreaded condemning jesus for fear of what might happen in the next world but then he had measures to keep with the jews and with his master caesar and this at length had the ascendency at present perhaps he hoped to extricate himself from this dilemma by the next step he took  when pilate heard of galilee he asked whether the man were a galilea and as soon as he heard that he belonged to herods jurisdiction he sent him to herod who happened so to speak to be at jerusalem at that time  when herod saw jesus he was exceeding glad for he was desirous to see him of a long season because he had heard many things of him and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him then he questioned with him in many words but he answered him nothing luke        the expectation of this great man being raised so high his disappointment must have been very mortisying  the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused jesus  we are not informed particularly of what they now accused him but we may learn from the effect that they ran upon his having assumed the titles and honors of the messiah for the insults he met with were plainly in derision of that  and herod with his men of war set him at naught and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe and sent him again to pilate luke     0      pilate called the chief priests and the rulers together and in the hearing of the multitude he addressed them thus  ye have brought this man unto me as one that perverteth the people and behold i having examined him before you have found no fault in him touching the things whereof ye accuse him no nor yet herod for i sent you to him i will therefore chastise him and release him for of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast but the chief priest and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask barabbas and destroy jesus and they cried all at once away with this man and release unto us barabbas pilate willing to release jesus speak again unto them but they cried crucify him crucify him and he said unto them the third time why what evil has he done i find no cause of death in him i will therefore chastise him and let him go and they were instant with loud voices requiring that he should be crucified and the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed luke         when pilate saw that he could prevail nothing but that rather a tumult was made he took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying i am innocent of the blood of this just person see ye to it then answered all the people and said his blood be upon us and on our children then released he barabbas unto them and when he had scourged jesus he delivered him to be crucified mat         yet not without making other attempts to save him  the soldiers having received orders to crucify jesus took him first and scourged him then they put on him a scarlet or purple robe it is said that the ancients gave the name of purple to all colors that had any mixture of red in them consequently scarlet itself obtained that name mat       mark       john      and when they had platted a crown of thorns they put it on his head and a reed in his hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying hail king of the jews and they spit upon him and took the reed and smote him upon the head mat        0   pilate now goes forth again to the jews and thus accosts them  behold i bring him forth unto you that ye may know i find no fault in him then came jesus forth wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe and pilate says unto them behold the man when the chief priests and officers saw him they cried out crucify him crucify him pilate says unto them take ye him and crucify him for i find no fault in him the jews answered we have a law and by our law he ought to die because he made himself the son of god john         when pilate heard that jesus called himself the son of god he was the more afraid and went again into the judgmenthall and says unto jesus whence art thou but jesus gave him no answer then pilate said unto him speak thou not unto me know thou not that i have power to crucify thee and have power to release thee jesus answered thou could have no power at all against me except it were given thee from above  once more pilate sought to release him but the jews cried out if thou let this man go thou art not caesars friend whosoever makes himself a king speaks against caesar when pilate heard that saying he brought jesus forth and sat down in the judgment seat and he said unto the jews behold your king but they cried out away with him away with him crucify him pilate said shall i crucify your king the chief priests answered we have no king but caesar john          then delivered he jesus unto them to be crucified and they took the purple robe off him and put his own clothes on him and led him away to crucify him mat        by comparing the evangelists together it appears that when they first set out jesus himself carried the cross upon which he was to be crucified but as they led him away they laid hold upon one simon a cyrenian coming out of the country and on him they laid the cross that he might bear it after jesus john       luke        the cruel disposition which the jews and roman soldiers manifested forbids us to look upon this as an act of compassion toward jesus it seems more probable that jesus had sunk under its weight nor should we think this at all inconsistent with his divinity for although as god he supported the universe by the word of his power heb     yet as man he was subject to the feelings of humanity john     and if we consider the fatigue of the preceding night spent without sleep  the sufferings he had undergone in the garden  his having been hurried from place to place during his trial the want of food and loss of blood he had sustained  if we consider these things we may see reason to believe that he was not long able as man to carry the cross  as they led him to calvary there followed him a great company of people and of women who bewailed and lamented him but he said unto them daughters of jerusalem weep not for me but weep for yourselves and for your children for behold the days are coming in the which ye shall say blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bare and the paps that never gave suck then shall they begin to say to the mountains fall on us and to the hills cover us for if they do these things in a green tree what shall be done in the dry a green tree is an emblem of a righteous person and a dry tree of the wicked ezekiel  0    chap      the meaning therefore is if i who am righteous suffer these things for the sins of my people what shall be done to the man who must bear his own sins   when they were come to a place called golgotha they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall and when he had tasted thereof he would not drink and when they were come to calvary they crucified him  the appointed soldiers dig the ground wherein the cross is to be erected the nails and the hammer are ready the cross is laid on the ground jesus is stripped and lies down on the bed of sorrows they nail him to it they erect it he hangs upon his wounds bleeding between two thieves john       praying for his enemies luke       reviled by the mob mat        0 the rulers luke       the priests mark       the soldiers luke         the two thieves mat       mark       and  god his father forsook him mat         it appears that jesus continued in this situation for about six hours before he expired mark          during which time he did not utter many words so as to be heard by those who stood by but david informs us in what manner his mind was exercised  my prayer is unto thee o lord in an acceptable time o god in the multitude of thy mercy hear me in the truth of thy salvation deliver me out of the mire and let me not sink let me be delivered from them that hate me and out of the deep waters let not the waterflood overflow me neither let the deep swallow me up and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me hear me o lord for thy loving kindness is good turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies and hide not thy face from thy servant for i am in trouble hear me speedily draw nigh unto my soul and redeem it deliver me because of mine enemies thou have known my reproach and my shame and my dishonor mine adversaries are all before thee reproach has broken my heart and i am full heaviness and i looked for some to take pity but there was none and for comforters but i found none they gave me gall for my meat and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink psalm          my god my god why have thou forsaken me why art thou so far from helping me and from the voice of my roaring  but thou art holy o thou that inhabitest the praises of israel our fathers trusted in thee they trusted and thou did deliver them they cried unto thee and were delivered they trusted in thee and were not confounded but i am a worm and no man a reproach of men and despised of the people all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head saying he trusted on the lord that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in him but thou art he that took me out of the womb thou did make me to hope when i was upon my mothers breast i was cast upon thee from the womb thou art my god from my mothers belly be not far from me for trouble is near for there is none to help many bulls have compassed me strong bulls of bashan have beset me round they gaped upon me with their mouths as a ravening and roaring lion i am poured out like water and all my bones are out of joint my heart is like wax it is melted in the midst of my bowels my strength is dried up like a potsherd and my tongue cleaves to my jaws and thou have brought me into the dust of death for dogs have compassed me the assembly of the wicked have enclosed me they pierced my hands and my feet i may tell all my bones they look and stare upon me they part my garments among them and cast lots upon my vesture but be not thou far from me o lord o my strength haste thee to help me psalm        etc  it is done  the voice of our mediator prevails  our surety has paid the debt  the law can demand no more  justice is satisfied  jesus looking to his reconciled father said into thy hands i commend my spirit luke        thou have sent me to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness dan      and now it is finished john     0 and behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of their graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many mat           the jews because it was the preparation that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day besought pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away then came the soldiers and brake the legs of the first and of the other that was crucified with him but when they came to jesus and saw that he was dead already they brake not his legs but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side and forth with came there out blood and water the spear thrust into his side is thought to have reached his heart for the water issuing from the wound seems to show that the pericardium was pierced and that jesus had been some time dead or if he had not this wound was of such a nature as must have killed him and therefore as it was of great importance to mankind to be ascertained of the truth of christs death when john relates this circumstance he insists upon it particularly and mentions it as a thing which he himself saw and he that saw it bear record and his record is true and he knows that he says true that ye may believe john           when the even was come joseph of arimathea a rich man and an honorable counselor went to pilate and craved the body of jesus marst          nicodemus also came and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about an hundred pound weight then took they the body of jesus and wound it in linen cloths with the spices as the manner of the jews is to bury in the place where he was crucified there was a garden and in the garden a new sepulcher there laid they jesus therefore because of the jews preparationday for the sepulcher was nigh at hand john         this tomb belonged to joseph of arimathea it was his own new tomb which he had hewn out of the rock and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulcher and departed mat        0   section iv as the payment of the uttermost farthing completes the satisfaction which is immediately followed by giving a discharge therefore as our surety has now fully paid our debts it is expected that he should be discharged from the prison of the grave and also take possession of the reward of righteousness now the important question is brought to a crisis and the judge of all is called upon by both parties to interpose and give decision  jesus had called god his father in a sense which implied equality of nature john        chap  0  0   and accordingly he called upon all men to honor the son even as they honored the father john      the jews upon the other hand called this blasphemy  again jesus maintained that all men himself only excepted were sinners and that they could obtain the divine favor only through him john        chap          and  0     and      but the jews could by no means admit the truth of this they being ignorant of gods righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness could not submit to be saved by the righteousness of our incarnate god romans  0    they had no objection to a messiah who should tell them what good thing they should do to obtain eternal lise but they were offended at the thought of his being the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believes  these were the chief points in debate between jesus and the jewish nation and when jesus was dead and buried they hoped that this controversy was decided in their favor they argued in a triumphant and insulting manner even while jesus was nailed to the cross  he saved others let him save himself said they if he be the christ the chosen of god let christ the king of israel descend from the cross that we may see and believe he trusted in god let him deliver him now if he will have him for he said i am the son of god luke       mark       mat         this triumph was premature the decision of the question did not turn upon his coming down from the cross but upon his rising again from the dead this was to be the grand proof on either side if christ did not rife from the dead the jews were right in rejecting him as the promised messiah but if he did then all he taught is true and the jews were guilty of a murder the most atrocious that could be committed  this medium of proof had been previously fixed upon the jews more than once demanded a sign of his being the messiah and jesus referred them to his resurrection mat       0 john        they did not forget this as we shall see  jesus was crucified and buried on the jews preparationday that is the day before the sabbath john       the sabbath day commenced at sunset lev       and it was as much as they could do to to get the bodies from the cross before its commencement john         on the day after the day of preparation that is on the sabbath day which as was observed began when the sun was setting the chief priests and pharisees came together to pilate saying sir we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days i will rise again command therefore that the sepulcher be made sure until the third day lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and say unto the people he is risen from the dead so the last error shall be worse than the first pilate said unto them ye have a watch go your way make it as sure as you can so they went and made the sepulcher sure sealing the stone see dan      where a similar precaution is used by darius in the case of daniel and setting a watch mat         thus while the chief priests and pharisees very prudently guarded against fraud resolving no doubt to exhibit the body of jesus after the third day as an impostor they put the truth of his resurrection beyond all reasonable doubt by furnishing a number of unexceptionable witnesses to it even the roman soldiers whose testimony they themselves could not refuse for behold at the appointed hour the angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door of the sepulcher his countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow and for fear of him the keepers did shake and became as dead men mat         jesus without an angel could easily have opened himself a passage from the tomb but it was meet that angels should attend and open the door to their rising lord it was meet that his servant should dismiss a band of ruffians and send them terrified to tell their employers the awful tale there was also a propriety in the angels opening a free passage into the sepulcher for the friends of jesus and in waiting there until their arrival  very early in the morning upon the first day of the week the women came unto the sepulcher at the rising of the sun mark      bringing the spices which they had prepared luke      it appears that they were dissatisfied with the hasty manner in which upon account of the approaching sabbath the body of their lord had been embalmed so they came when the sabbath was past to do it properly and as they went along they said among themselves who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulcher for it was great they seem unacquainted with all that had passed since the evening of the day on which their lord was crucified when the disciples rolled the stone to the door of the sepulcher and departed and when they looked they saw that the stone was rolled away mark        and they entered in but found not the body of the lord jesus luke      upon this one of them mary magdalene ran to seek the apostles to tell them the distressing news finding peter and john she says unto them they have taken away the lord out of the sepulcher and we know not where they have laid him then these two apostles ran to go to the sepulcher johe  0      while mary magdalene was gone in quest of the apostles it appears that the other women having probably searched round the garden in vain entered the sepulcher a second time and saw the angel that rolled away the stone sitting within and they were affrighted mark      but the angel said unto them fear not ye for i know that ye seek jesus which was crucified he is not here for he is risen as he said come see the place where the lord lay mat        and as they were much perplexed thereabout two angels stood by them in shining garments and as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth the angels said unto them why seek ye the living among the dead he is not here but is risen remember how he spoke unto you while he was yet with you in galilee saying the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again luke       but go your way tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and behold he goes before you into galilee there shall ye see him as he said unto you mark      and they remembered his words luke      and they departed quickly from the sepulcher with sear and great joy and did run to bring his disciples word mat        after the women had departed peter and john came to the sepulcher to examine the truth of what mary magdalene had told them concerning the body of jesus being taken away and mary herself followed them peter and john having entered the sepulcher and not finding the body of their lord they seem to have believed as mary did that some one had taken it away as yet they knew nothing of his resurrection then they went again unto their own home  but mary stood without at the sepulcher weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the sepulcher and sees two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of jesus had lain and they say unto her woman why weepest thou she says unto them because they have taken away my lord and i know not where they have laid him and when she had thus said she turned herself back probably being affrighted and saw jesus standing and knew not that it was jesus jesus says unto her woman why weepest thou whom seek thou she supposing him to be the gardener says unto him sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou have laid him and i will take him away jesus says unto her mary she turned herself and says unto him master  calling her by her name with his usual tone of voice she knew him and would have embraced him but he declined this for the present giving her to understand that as he was not yet ascended she would have other opportunities for expressing her joy but that she must go immediately and tell his brethren etc john  0       while these things were passing the company of women who saw the angels at the sepulcher and who were despatched by them to tell the disciples what they saw and heard found some of the disciples and delivered their message to them amongst whom were cleopas and his companion luke          these women going in quest of some other of the disciples jesus met them saying all hail and they came and fell at his feet and worshipped him jesus says unto them be not afraid go tell my brethren that they go into galilee and there shall they see me mat       0  now these women had something more to tell before they could only say we have seen a vision of angels who said he is alive but now they could say we have seen him  while the women were going to spread these glad tidings some of the watch came into the city and showed unto the chief priests all the things that were done and when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel they gave a great bribe unto the soldiers saying say ye his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept mat          the priests could hardly be so stupid as not to know what judgment the world would form of guards telling what happened while they were asleep but absurd as this might be it was the best color which could be put upon the matter  the women having found their brethren told all things which they had heard and seen and they when they had heard that jesus was alive and had been seen and had spoken these things believed not mark     0    peter however who had been mentioned by name as one unto whom the news should be told mark      arose and ran a second time unto the sspulchre and stooping down he beheld nothing but the linen clothes and departed wondering in himself at that which was come to pass luke         the lords appearance to peter mentioned   cor      may have happened as he was returning from the sepulcher this second time for we are certain it took place on the day of the resurrection  after this jesus appeared to two of his disciples who were going to emmaus and a long and interesting conversation took place its length obliges me to omit it here but the reader may see it in luke     these two disciples returned the same evening to jerusalem where they found the eleven that is the apostles and others with them before they came peter had arrived with a confirmation of the report first given by the women and therefore the apostles accost these two disciples thus the lord is risen indeed and has appeared unto simon then cleopas and his companion relate what they knew and as they spoke jesus himself stood in the midst of them and gave them every demonstration that men are capable of receiving luke         john  0         but thomas one of the twelve was not with them when jesus came the other disciples therefore said unto him we have seen the lord but he said unto them except i shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side i will not believe  and after eight days again his disciples were within and thomas with them then came jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said peace be unto you then turning to thomas reach hither thy finger and behold my hands and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side  the sight of jesus must have been sufficient to prove his refurrection but the knowledge which he now showed of what was doing when he was absent in body brought his divinity so strongly to mind that thomas answered by saying unto jesus my lord and my god john  0        jesus having first by angels mat      and afterward in person mat     0 ordered his disciples to go home to galilee with a promise that they should see him there they went and when they were come to their respective homes they followed their occupations as usual and particularly the apostles who pursued their old trade of fishing upon the lake there were together peter thomas nathanael james john and two other disciples peter says unto them i go a fishing they say unto him we also go with you they went and spent the whole night without catching any thing when the morning was now come jesus stood on the shore but they did not know him owing probably to its being as yet somewhat dark and they being some distance from the shore jesus says unto them children have ye any meat they answered no he said unto them cast the net on the right side of the ship and ye shall find they did so and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes therefore john says unto peter it is the lord then they all made haste to shore found it even so and dined together in his company john  0  john observes that this was the third time that jesus appeared to his disciples john  0    he means the third time he appeared to the apostles in a body or company for this was the seventh time he appeared viz   to mary magdalene   to the other women   to peter who was the first man who saw him   to the two disciples going to emmaus   to the apostles thomas being absent   to the apostles again at jerusalem thomas being present and   now for the first time in galilee  after this he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once of whom the greater part were still living when paul wrote his first epistle to the corinthians   cor      this seems to be that appearance of himself upon a mountain in galilee which he had repeatedly promised to his brethren and unto which we read of the apostles going mat        it appears that the disciples returned after this to jerusalem from acts       compared with luke     0 it is plain that the discourses before his ascension related mark       and luke         were delivered in or near jerusalem besides he ascended from the mount of olives acts      here again he appeared unto them and how often he did so we cannot tell it is evident that he showed himself to the apostle james alone though none of the evangelists relate that appearance   cor      but we are told that he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god and being assembled with them commanded that they should not depart from jerusalem until they were fully qualified by the holy spirit to preach the gospel in all languages and nations  and he led them out to the mount of olives as far as to bethany about two miles from jerusalem john       and he lift up his hands and blessed them luke     0    acts        and while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven luke     0    acts        a cloud received him out of their sight luke     0    acts         god is gone up with a shout the lord with the sound of a trumpet sing praises to god sing praises sing praises to our king sing praises psalm         lift up your heads o ye gates and be ye lift up ye everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is the king of glory the lord of hosts he is the king of glory psalm       0  the chariots of god are twenty thousand even thousands of angels the lord is among them as in sinai in the holy place thou have ascended on high thou have led captivity captive thou have received gifts for men yea for the rebellious also that the lord god might dwell among them psalm          ephesians       blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world ephesians        we were by nature the children of wrath even as others but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he has loved us even when we were dead in sins has quickened us together with christ and has raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus ephesians       which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast and which enters into the holy of holies whither the forerunner is for us entered even jesus made an high priest for ever after the order of melchisedec being by interpretation first king of righteousness and after that king of peace heb       0 chap       sing o ye heavens for the lord has done it shout ye lower parts of the earth break forth into singing ye mountains o forest and every tree therein for the lord has redeemed jacob and glorified him self in israel isa         to the reader  believe in the lord jesus christ and thou shall be saved acts        part ii objections answered objection i the famous author of the age of reason says  the doctrine of redemption has for its basis an idea of pecuniary justice and not that of moral justice if i owe a person money and am not able to pay him and he threatens to put me in prison another person may take the debt upon himself and pay it for me but if i have committed a crime every circumstance of the case is changed moral justice cannot take the innocent for the guilty even if the innocent would offer itself to this we reply    this distinction between moral justice and pecuniary justice has no foundation in the nature of things justice is moral justice still whether it has to do with money or with murder when the moral law says owe no man any thing it delivers a moral precept and speaks the language of moral justice no less than when it says thou shall not kill what is it no crime to contract debts when we are not able to pay surely it is yet if my friend is willing to become surety for me however innocent he may be moral justice requires that he should smart for it    when a surety is admitted in any case his admission is founded not upon justice only but also upon mercy if i owe money and am not able to pay it and if justice admits of another person taking the debt upon himself and discharging it for me this is uniting justice and mercy together when my friend sees me in distress takes my place and discharges my debts this is an act of mercy  justice admits but mercy performs it again when my creditor demands payment of my surety his doing so is an act of justice so that in this case justice demands and mercy grants payment    from hence we may discover the principle upon which the office of a surety is founded it is ordained chiefly for the sake of harmonizing justice and mercy these two attributes in many cases seem to clash justice might require the law to be put in force against an unfortunate or dishonest debtor while mercy might prompt a judge to spare him either for his own or for his miserable familys sake what is to be done in this case if justice is heard mercy cries in vain if mercy prevails justice retires dissatisfied but by the interposition of a surety mercy and justice kiss and embrace each other does this render either attribute less amiable far from it it heightens their native charms  if justice had refused the proposal of a surety  a surety every way able to answer its demands would it not seem too implacable and upon the other hand if mercy had insisted upon the debt being cancelled without payment when the surety could well afford it would it not appear an enemy to justice and might not the creditor justly complain    having discovered the principle upon which the office of a surety proceeds to determine in any particular case whether a surety may or may not be admitted we must consider whether the circumstances of the case be such that all things considered the admission of a surety can subserve the mutual purposes of justice and mercy    we can now explain how it comes to pass that human laws can so seldom admit of a surety in criminal cases i say seldom because even human laws sometimes go this far as for instance when a crime is punished by a fine which is often the case a mans friend may pay it for him again sometimes when a crime is committed the criminal is set at liberty by finding sureties for his future good behavior and if he afterward is guilty of the same crime his sureties are liable to suffer in his stead and again national hostages are a very ancient and general expedient in this case it is universally allowed that when any person delivers himself up as the hostage or surety of his nation he is liable to suffer for the crimes of his country but as has been observed it is not always that human laws can admit of a surety in criminal cases this is not because our legislators condemn the principle itself for if they did how could they adopt it in the instances just alluded to but the reason is they find in certain cases the circumstances are such that a surety cannot be made to subserve the mutual purposes of justice and mercy or answer any good end but would rather be attended with many evil consequences for instance when murder is committed justice demands life for life and here it is impossible amongst men to make use of a surety because   who would willingly die for a murderer   if such a person could be found who gave him power over his life to dispose of it in such a way   there would be no security for the future conduct of the criminal and therefore it would only be depriving society of a useful member to give back one who might immediately commence his former destructive practices   it could not even serve the purpose of mercy because all that mercy might gain by the salvation of the criminal it would lose again in the death of his surety    for these causes we grant to the objector that in many cases of a criminal nature all the circumstances are so changed that moral justice cannot take the innocent for the guilty that is justice cannot under these circumstances admit of a surety but then when these circumstances come to be named not one of them can be objected to the suretiship of christ for instance   he had absolute power over his own life and a sovereign right to dispose of it as he saw good moreover having humbled himself to the state of a servant he acted not only by his own choice but in obedience to the commandment of his father   no individual beside himself sustained the least inconvenience from his undertaking he did not redeem his people that they might continue their pernicious practices but made it absolutely certain that they should leave them off and begin a life of righteousness the moment they should be made acquainted with what he had done for them their language upon this occasion is lord the half of my goods i give to the poor and if i have taken any thing from any man i restore him foursold   in substituting jesus in the room of the guilty all the ends of mercy as well as divine justice were fully answered myriads of men were thus raised from the greatest depth of guilt and misery to an eternity of holiness and happiness and although this cost our divine surety much yet in the end he obtained what he deemed an ample recompense he had power not only to lay down his life but also to take it again he saw of the travel of his soul and was satisfied he saw the eternal happiness of his people secured and this gave him infinite delight he saw every perfection of the godhead glorified in the highest and the foundation laid for eternal hallelujahs from all the blessed and he saw himself in his human nature crowned with that glory which in his divine nature he had with his father before the world was these considerations go to prove that it was perfectly consistent with justice as well as glorious to divine mercy to substitute jesus in the room of his guilty people to this we must add    it would not be consistent with justice to admit a sinner to glory without this substitution mercy might provide such a surety as justice could admit but mercy could not consistently with justice bestow happiness on the guilty without a surety no reason can be given why justice should refuse this surety but many reasons may be given why it should demand him for instance if the sinner had been saved without this surety the divine law would be made void the part of a subject is to obey the part of a sovereign is to keep up the authority of his laws though subjects neglect their part the sovereign may do his though the law be broken yet while that treatment is given to disobedience and obedience which the lawgiver has appointed the authority of the law is still kept up but if the sovereign neglect his part dispense with the execution of the law then the law passes away and in effect the governor resigns his authority and tolerates all manner of wickedness and confusion it is shocking to that reason which god has given us to see a magistrate without power over his subjects to see a parent without authority among his children or a master among his servants but this is nothing in comparison with beholding god destitute of authority among his creatures in other cases this want of authority would produce confusion only in kingdoms or families but in this case it would bring the whole universe into disorder the former would infer confusion only for a time but this introduces confusion to eternity  i shall conclude this article with two very opposite specimens of reasoning and leave the reader to his choice  mr thomas pain after telling his readers that no external evidence can at this long distance of time be produced to prove whether the church fabricated the doctrine of redemption or not adds therefore the question can only be referred to the internal evidence which the thing carries in itself and this continues he affords a very strong presumption of its being a fabrication for the internal evidence is that the doctrine of redemption has for its basis an idea of pecuniary justice and not that of moral justice  jonathan says as the character of the just god and the savior can no where be published but along with the doctrine of redemption i am assured by seeing the grandest character thence arising that the doctrine must be true for to suppose that the bare notion or idea of any thing greater than god could ever be any where imagined would be the wildest of all absurdities moreover it must be very evident that that view of god which the lower it abases the pride of man raises his comfort and joy the higher  which reduces man to the most unreserved dependence while it exalts him to the summit of all happiness could never be the contrivance of man whose strongest impulse is toward the gratifying of his pride and whose joy naturally rises or sinks according to the success thereof therefore when the doctrine of redemption and the character of god thence resulting are conveyed to my mind by the same testimony i have no room to doubt that god who alone can describe his own character is the testifier of both this doctrine continues jonathan while it proves all my former wisdom to be foolishness opens to me a new and more delightful source of knowledge throwing light upon a thousand facts that i could never account for before showing me a no less satisfactory than wonderful propriety in all the extraordinary circumstances attending the birth life death and resurrection of jesus and the ministry of his witnesses  it throws light upon all the ancient sacred writings and the extraordinary facts recorded in them from the creation downwards it sets my mind at rest as to all the difficulties about the divine character and the condition of man which occasionally pinched me before  i am now reconciled to the entrance of sin and death into the world and the whole dark side of things on account of the light that shines from the greatest darkness  i am now reconciled to the shade on account of the magnificent picture thence arising to my view in a word i thence perceive a no less amiable than grand uniformity of design in all the works of god from first to last whereas should i shut my eyes against the light issuing from thence i am immediately lost in an unfathomable abyss of  guilt despair and death  i am fully satisfied then in agreement with the apostles to hold this doctrine as the gospel the word and testimony of god and to call it by way of eminence the truth in opposition to every false gloss upon the scriptures and every false reasoning about the light or law of nature or about any of the works or ways of god  let this truth be my companion and i will not be ashamed in the presence of all the sons of socrates though joined with those of gamaliel    thus far jonathan  the objection we have now considered is supposed to come not only from deists but also from all those nominal christians who reject altogether the suretiship of christ as deists deny the authority of the bible and as the others pay but little homage to it is divinity i have hitherto avoided the impertinence of quoting that book in a way of proof when arguing with such persons it is necessary to meet them upon their own ground  the light of nature  the objections which follow come from a different people  people who admit in part the suretiship of christ and who profess a greater reverence for the word of god the question therefore and the medium of proof are both changed in the former case the question was can divine justice admit of a surety to act and suffer for sinful men in the present case this is granted and the question is what was the sinners surety bound to perform the former question was argued upon the ground of common sense but this is to be determined by the word of god not that we are now to lay aside the use of our reason only whereas we formerly reasoned from principles of natural light we must now reason from revelation  objection ii  we grant that christ died as our substitute but his conformity to the moral law is set before us as an example which shows that he did not obey this law for us in his life in the same precise sense in which he obeyed it for us in his death otherwise we should have been as fully freed from obedience to it in every respect as we are from it is penalty or curse  answer  his sufferings also are laid before us as an example john            peter        john      and if his sufferings may be both substitutional and exemplary why may not his obedience to the law be so also if it be said his sufferings are not exemplary in the same respect wherein they are substitutional i answer neither is his obedience obedience to the law considered as the condition of happiness is no more binding upon his disciples romans      than sufferings are considered as expiatory and this indeed proves that he did obey the law for us in the same respect in which he suffered for us that is as our surety for if he had not we should have been bound to obey it ourselves and that upon condition of obtaining happiness for obedience to this law is the unalterable condition upon which we may obtain eternal life but i need not say much in reply to this objection a babe in christ will see that it betrays great ignorance of the nature of christianity when we are told that if christ obeyed the law for us we cannot be bound to observe it even as a rule of conduct it is just like saying since christ has obeyed the law as well as suffered its penalty in order to give us a title to happiness therefore we are under no obligation to glorify god for his mercy  objection iii  the holiness of christs heart and life in conformity to the moral law was a necessary qualification of his own person  it qualified him for the work he came to finish as our substitute but it was not the very work itself  answer  if christ had not been made under the law to fulfill it as our substitute his conformity to it could not have been a necessary qualification of his own person immanuel would have been perfectly holy in heart and life if he had never been bound to obey those precepts which are proper and peculiar to mere creatures  to men  sinful men therefore when the incarnate god was made under the law it was to redeem not to qualify himself for redeeming thus the objection seems to form a flat contradiction to the word of god to set this in a clearer light let us consider   the law to which immanuel conformed   his conformity to this law   the dignity of the person who thus conformed to this law    the law to which our divine surety conformed is the very same law which his people were under he was made under the law to redeem them that were under the law the moral law may indeed be considered as the one law unto all gods reasonable creatures in respect of the principle from which obedience should proceed namely love but still this law has different forms according to the different natures and also according to the different circumstances of those to whom it is given so that in some respects the law given to angels and the law given to men will be different it will not be said unto angels  honor thy father and thy mother nor yet thou shall not commit adultery such precepts as these are not adapted to their nature  again the moral law will differ also according to the different circumstances of creatures of the same species i shall mention two remarkable instances of this which cast considerable light upon the question before us  the first is that remarkable difference in the moral duties of men which is caused by the entrance of sin the precept thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self although it be the same precept both before and after the fall yet it now binds us to do many things which would not have been our duty if we had never sinned for instance if we had not sinned this precept would only bind us to love the righteous for we and all our neighbors would have been of that description but since we have sinned this same precept binds us to love the unrighteous for we and all our neighbors are at least by nature of this character  another important difference in the moral law which depends upon the circumstances of those to whom it is given is the difference between this law considered only as a rule of life and considered as prescribing the condition of acquiring happiness this is not a fanciful but a real and important difference and the persons to whom i now speak will admit it they know that all men are by nature under this law as prescribing the terms and condition of acquiring happiness but the believer in jesus has a title to glory independent of his own obedience and he conforms to the law only as a rule of conduct    we are to consider christs conformity to this law and here we must observe   christ was made under the law not before but after the entrance of sin  not when it bound man to love none but the righteous but when it bound us to love sinners   christs conformity to the law was constant and universal that is he continued in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them   his conformity to this law was properly obedience that is submission to its authority this is plainly taught us when we are told that he was made under the law for that expression always imports the authority of the law over its subjects to which we must add   christ was not only bound to obey this law as a rule of life but in order to merit the reward of obedience this is what the scriptures usually intend by the phrase  under the law and there is no reason for understanding it differently when we are informed that christ was made under the law upon the contrary we have every reason for understanding the words in their usual sense for while he was fulfilling every jot and tittle of the law we see him not in the state of enjoying but of meriting the reward and he obtained it decause he had loved righteousness and hated iniquity heb         consider now the dignity of the person who thus obeyed the law he is not a mere creature like those upon whom this law is binding he is the independent jehovah jer       true he has clothed himself in human nature but he is the same person still the person who made the world who supports all things by the word of his power whose sovereign will is the supreme law of the universe  this is the person who was made under the law  a law adapted to creatures  mere creatures  creatures naturally below angels and made far lower still by sin  this is the person who obeyed this law  who obeyed it as dictating the terms and condition of acquiring happiness and shall we say if he had not submitted to this as our substitute he must have done so as his own personal qualification far be it  had man continued in his original purity and had our creator been pleased to appear in our nature his holiness would no doubt incline him to love his imperfect image in sinless man but this love would not be obedience to the moral law his appearing in human nature would not bring him so upon a level with his creatures that we might consider god and man as neighbors bound by the same precept and upon the same condition to mutual love therefore when immanuel was made under the law it must be that he might obey it as our substitute  this argument acquires additional weight when we consider our divine surety as made under the law after the entrance of sin we have observed that the holiness of immanuel would incline him to love his own image in sinless man but it would be perfectly consistent with his holiness to detest the whole human race after they became sinners and therefore to love sinful man in conformity to the moral law could never be essential to the holiness of our incarnate god to what end then was he made under it why must he fulfill every jot and tittle of this law why must he do this in such a low obscure laborious and sorrowful state why must he spend thirty years of his life in doing little else why must he do this in the form of a servant working for a reward why  because he was made under the law to redeem them that were under it  although the objector cannot prove his point without refuting the foregoing argument yet i am at liberty to say that this argument is not essential to the doctrine i contend for i mean it is not so essential as that the truth of the doctrine depends upon it  if it were not blafphemy i might grant for sake of argument that the incarnate god could not be holy if he had not been made under the moral law  if he had not obeyed that law in the manner in which we have seen he did obey it yet it would not follow from hence that he did not obey this law for us that is as our surety and in our stead for since this law could have had no claim upon him if he had not been made man  since he was made man upon our account  and since his obedience is of infinitely greater merit than that of all the elect put together therefore no good reason can be given why he might not obey this law for himself if such a thing could be necessary and for us also this alone is a sufficient answer to the objection yet we must remind the reader of what was said before and that we by no means give up the former argument for although holiness was essential to our redeemers sacrifice the obedience he yielded to the law was not essential to his own personal holiness he would have been perfectly holy if he had never been made under the law or bound to obey its precepts in the manner in which he did obey them  objection iv  if christ had obeyed the law as our surety and that all through the previous course of his life it would have superceded the necessity of his expiatory sufferings and death for the law has not a double demand but an alternative requiring either perfect obedience or the suffering of its penalty  answer  this objection is made up of truth and error connected together by false reasoning it is not true that our sureties obedience to the law could supercede the necessity of his sufferings and death because the wages of sin is death  it is true that there are some cases in which the law has not a double demand but an alternative but these cases are so essentially different from the case of christ and his people that it must be false reasoning which concludes that no more can be demanded in one case than in the other but we shall be more particular    if a man could be found who had continued in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them certainly he would not deserve to suffer the penalty because in this case no sin has been committed but it is equally certain that those for whom christ obeyed the law have sinned and this makes the difference    when a sinner has finished his course of trial and filled up the measure of his iniquity then the divine law consigns him over to hopeless misery the alternative does not run thus either obey the commandments or suffer the penalty and thou shall obtain the reward but rather thus obey or thou have forfeited for ever the promised reward and also subjected thyself to endless misery  if obedience to the divine precepts as a condition of life as well as suffering the curse of a broken law are not both required of the damned it is because their case is hopeless  they are utterly rejected and shut up in eternal despair  now i know of no other case but these two wherein the law does not make a double demand and these are each of them essentially different from the case of christ and his people in the first of the two cases mentioned the law does not demand the personally righteous to suffer its penalty because they have not sinned in the second case the law does not require the damned to obey its precepts as a condition of life because the prospect of a reward is totally cut off from them but the case of christ and his people stands thus  they have sinned yet they do not suffer the penalty they have not perfectly obeyed the commandments yet they obtain the reward due to perfect obedience this difference is of such a nature as to demonstrate the fallacy of the reasoning in the objection to see the truth of this let us take   the case wherein the law does not demand the suffering of its penalty and   that wherein it does not demand obedience to its precepts as a condition of happiness and let us reason from each of these cases to that of christ and his people in the first instance the argument will stand thus  the law does not require those to suffer its penalty who have obeyed its precepts and never sinned therefore it cannot require our surety to obey its precepts and suffer its penalty although we have sinned  in the second instance the argument runs thus the law does not require the damned upon whom the penalty is inflicted to obey its precepts as a condition of life because no reward of obedience is given or held out to them therefore the law cannot require our surety to suffer its penalty and obey its precepts although the reward of obedience is given to us  a man who cannot see into the fallacy of this reasoning i can only say of him that his case is lamentable others it is hoped will see that since the demerit of the damned and the reward of the righteous are both found in the case of a christian therefore the work of his surety must comprehend what answers to each that is the penalty and the righteousness of the law if not it is evident that the eternal law must be made void in one respect or other if our surety had not suffered for our sins and if nevertheless we were to escape the wrath to come it could no longer be said the wages of sin is death and if the commandments of the law are not obeyed for us and that perfectly and yet if we obtain the reward of perfect obedience where shall we find the obedience to which this reward is promised i speak to men who are not vain enough to say that they themselves have yielded this perfect obedience if thou will enter into life keep the commandments this is the language of that law concerning which it is said  till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled that this is spoken of the commandments of the moral law cannot be disputed without great perverseness as is plain from all that follows in the chapter mat     objection v  if christ answered this twofold demand of the law  if he not only suffered the penalty but also obeyed its precepts and that as our substitute how is it that the scriptures so frequently ascribe our salvation to his sufferings  answer  because it was chiefly in suffering the penalty of the law that he obeyed its precepts  while he was growing up as a root out of a dry ground  a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief  while he suffered poverty that we might be made rich  while he suffered shame and reproach that we might escape both  while he was in agony that we might rejoice  while he was stripped and scourged that we might be healed  while he was forsaken that we might be accepted  while  in a word while he bore all our griefs and carried all our sorrows he was thereby manifesting the highest love to god and man which is the very essence of the moral law or eternal rule of righteousness so that it is the same thing whether we say we are justified by his blood or we are made righteous by his obedience the penalty and the commandments must be distinguished but in the obedience of our surety they cannot be separated  they include each other  objection vi  it is granted that christ in suffering for sin manifested the highest love to god and man but why should this love be considered as a fulfillment of the moral law  answer    a side from his suretiship engagements i see no reason for considering his love in this light but since he stood in our place as our head representative and surety it was necessary he should discharge every debt we owed so far as to give us a title to the forfeited reward and therefore    we are expressly told that god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law gal     and that he came into the world to fulfill this law mat         which he could not do but by manifesting the highest love to god and man for love is the fulfilling of the law romans     0  hence also it is said the lord is well pleased for his righteousness sake he shall magnify the law and make it honorable and again christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believes isa       romans  0     objection vii  but if the inspired writers considered the work of christ in this light  if they saw in the work he performed as our surety not only the penalty of the law inflicted but also the righteousness of the law fulfilled then we might have expected to hear them ascribing salvation to this work considered sometimes in the former light and sometimes in the latter  answer  the thing which we might have expected has actually come to pass in the scriptures the righteousness as well as the sufferings of our divine surety every where meets our eye i shall here transcribe some passages after just observing that wherever salvation is ascribed to righteousness we may be sure it is the righteousness of our surety that is intended for it is not by works of righteousness which we have done that we are saved tit       adam he was the type of him that was to come for if by one mans offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one jesus christ romans           abel by faith he offered a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous heb        noah he became heir of the righteousness which is by says heb        abraham he is the father of all them that believe that righteousness might be imputed to them also romans        moses the righteousness which we obtain without works was witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteousness of god which is by says of jesus christ unto all and upon all them that believe romans           david he described the blessedness david described the effect and paul described the cause  david described the blessedness of the man but paul has described the medium through which this blessedness flows  the blessedness described by david is this  iniquity is forgiven sin is covered the meritorious cause of this as described by paul is righteousness imputed this was known to david also see psalm  0    psalm       of the man unto whom the lord imputes righteousness without works romans       isaiah behold my servant whom i uphold mine elect in whom my soul delights  the lord is well pleased for his righteousness sake he will magnisy the law and make it honorable isa          surely shall one say in the lord have i righteousness and strength isa        hearken unto me ye stouthearted that are far from righteousness i bring near my righteousness it shall not be far off and my salvation shall not tarry and i will place salvation in zion for israel my glory isa           every tongue that shall rise in judgment against thee thou shall condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the lord and their righteousness is of me says the lord isa         jeremiah behold the days come says the lord that i will raise to david a righteous branch and a king shall reign and prosper and shall execute justice and judgment in the earth in his days judah shall be saved and israel shall dwell safely and this is his name whereby he shall be called the lord our righteousness jer xxiii       daniel seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon the holy city to finish the transgression to make an end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness dan ix      christ think not that i am come to destroy the law or the prophets i am not come to destroy but to fulfill for verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or one one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled mat           the four evangelists they tell us of all things that jesus began both to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up into heaven for an abstract of which i refer to the first part of this essay  acts of the apostles in this book we have the substance of what the apostles preached unto sinners and by which they were to be saved in six of their sermons or discourses we find them careful to lay before their hearers not only the sufferings but also the righteousness of christ in these discourses he is three times emphatically called the holy one of god acts ii    chap iii      and xiii    and as often the just one acts    chap vii    and xxii    peter gives a short but comprehensive and beautiful description of his character when he says he went about doing good acts  0    and also when he calls him a man approved of god acts       if it should be objected that although these teachers represent christ as an holy just or righteous person yet they do not in these discourses expressly affirm that he wrought his righteousness in the capacity of our head representative or surety i reply neither do they in these discourses expressly affirm that he suffered in this capacity one answer will equally suit his righteousness and sufferings the truth is there was no necessity for the apostles to affirm in these discourses more expressly than they have done that christ obeyed or suffered for sinners because when they preached the righteousness and sufferings of christ as the ground of hope telling the people that through his name whosoever believed in him should receive the remission of sins acts  0    and that by him all that believe are justified from all things acts        when the people heard this i say as many of them as understood it would easily see that christ must have stood in the capacity of our surety for it is this that lays a foundation for our being justified through him  romans the doctrine of imputed righteousness appears in this epistle not only to be a doctrine of christianity but also to be one of the most important and fundamental doctrines of that religion for the sake of introducing this doctrine the apostle sets himself to prove that the whole world is become guilty before god romans read from chap      to chap      and he makes the forgiveness of sin romans       justification romans      and eternal life romans      depend upon imputed righteousness and when he bewails the case of his brethren the jews it is because they were ignorant of this doctrine romans    0   and chap  0      the righteousness which is imputed to the believer is worthy of being made so much account of the incarnate god is the lord our righteousness jer      the righteousness which is unto and upon all them that believe is the righteousness of god romans           cor      philip       pet     the righteousness which is bestowed as a gift and which is upon all men who believe is the righteousness of one jesus christ romans         this is the person who is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believes romans  0   and it is through his righteousness that grace reigns unto eternal life romans        although the scriptures in general and the epistle before us in particular are so very full and plain upon this yet some men will remind us in a way of opposition that faith is imputed for righteousness but the apostle must be understood in a way consistent with himself  it is a common thing with all writers to use one and the same word to express an object and the faculty or affection which regards that object hence the words  fear hope joy peace love etc are used indifferently to express the objects of these affections and these affections themselves god is called the fear of his people genesis       isa      because they sear him christ is our hope   timothy     because we hope for happiness through him he is our peace ephesians      because we enjoy peace with god through him etc so also the word faith is used indifferently to express the truth which we believe and our belief of the truth so that it is the same thing whether we say  faith is come gal      or christ is come  it is the same thing whether we say  paul preached the faith gal      or he preached christ  it is the same thing whether we say we are justified by faith romans     or by him all that believe are justified acts        it is the same thing whether we say  faith is imputed for righteousness romans     or christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believes romans  0     corinthians of him are ye in christ jesus who of god is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption that according as it is written he that glories let him glory in the lord   cor    0     if the ministration of condemnation be glory much more does the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory   cor      god who has reconciled us to himself by jesus christ has given to us the ministry of reconciliation to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and has committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christs stead be ye reconciled to god for he has made him to be sin for us who know no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him   cor          galatians when the fullness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons  and if sons then heirs of god through christ gal        philipians christ jesus being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in

things and do count them but dung that i may win christ and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which

clothed me with the garments of salvation he has covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments and as a bride adorneth herself with jewels isa lxi  0 thus we see how this doctrine runs through the whole bible  objection viii  the death of christ is that obedience by which we are made righteous christs death was a voluntary act of obedience to the commandment of his father so he says therefore does my father love me because i lay down my life that i might take it again no man takes it from me but i lay it down of myself i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it again this commandment have i received of my father the will of god which he came to do and by which his people are sanctified was the offering up of his body once by this act of obedience he at once fulfilled the law to the utmost exercising the perfection of love to god and man and satisfying all its penal demands upon his guilty people the spotless holiness of his heart and life qualified him for this obedience and the divine dignity of his person gave it infinite worth and efficacy see mr mcleans illustration of the commission given by christ to the apostles page        in his life says this author in another place he obeyed the law for us as our example but in his death he obeyed it for us as our substitute the holiness of his heart and life in conformity to the moral law qualified him for performing that obedience by which we are made righteous but in his death he actually performed it  and although i could have no hope from his death or mediation did i not consider him as perfectly holy and free from sin through the whole course of his life yet i do not find that the scriptures ascribe our justification directly to this but always to what he did in his death  answer  some things in this objection have been already considered viz what is said about immanuel qualifying himself in holiness by his obedience to the moral law and also what is said of his obedience to the law as an example i mention these particulars now only to make other parts of the objection more plain to the reader for i find that many persons who read the book referred to above do not understand the author upon the subject in hand the argument contained in the objection shall be considered presently but i shall first make a few observations upon the sentiment which that argument is intended to support    this sentiment understood in the most favorable light will stand thus  christ did not begin to act as the surety or substitute of his people until about the time of his death his foregoing obedience and sufferings were not substitutional but intended for our example and for his own personal qualification but in his death he suffered the penalty and also obeyed the commandments of the moral law as his peoples substitute and in their stead and if we ask how could he obey the commandments of the moral law in his death the answer is  in his death he manifested the perfection of love to god and man which is the end of the commandment and the fulfilling of the law    this appears to me to be a very dangerous sentiment it seems to approach so near the truth and it is supported in some instances by such plausible reasoning and by so able an advocate that those who are weak in the faith are in danger of being carried away by it  but the good shepherd has said  my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any pluck them out of my hand    this sentiment is i suppose perfectly new it is no new thing indeed to deny that christ fulfilled the commandments of the moral law in his peoples stead but it is of late that we have been told he did this in his death only and not in his life i cannot speak with absolute certainty upon the novelty of this sentiment but am of opinion that it was not thought of until the close of the eighteenth century it has not however come too late to find footing in the world for it seems to be adopted by several congregations in north and south britain and perhaps it may give birth to another denomination of christians    at times i fancy i understand this sentiment pretty clearly but at other times i find myself rather at a loss this uncertainty is owing to the principles upon which this sentiment is sometimes desended and from which it is advocates reason in order to oppose what they call the common popular doctrine for these principles seem to me as inconsistent with their own doctrine as with that which they reject for instance    christs obedience to the law is set before us as an example for us to copy after which shows they say that he did not obey this law as our substitute in his life  now these same people know that christs obedience in his death is also set before us as an example to copy after how then can they believe that he obeyed this law even in his death as our substitute    they tell us that if christ had obeyed the law for us in his life it would have superseded his expiatory sufferings strange  but waving all other remarks what is the reason that christs vicarious obedience to the law in his life should supersede his expiatory sufferings and yet his vicarious obedience to the law in his death should not supersede them  to this it has been replied  his fulfilling the law for us in his death includes his expiatory sufferings and therefore cannot supersede them but this answer leaves me just where i was to tell me that the suffering of the penalty is included in christs vicarious obedience to the precepts of the law is not to show me the use and necessity of this which is the thing i am inquiring after it is the opinion of the objector that if christ had obeyed the precepts of the law in his life as our substitute then his sufferings considered as expiatory would be superfluous seeing this is his opinion and seeing he professes to believe that christ did obey these precepts for us that is as our substitute in his death i am at a loss to conceive what necessity he finds for the sufferings of christ considered as expiatory to tell me that his obedience to the law in his death includes his expiatory sufferings is only to provoke a repetition of the question  why  why must this substitutional obedience include expiatory sufferings or seeing this obedience does in fact include these sufferings how is it that the former does not render the latter superfluous    when we plead for our sureties vicarious obedience and sufferings all through his life even unto death the objector tells us that it is impossible to show where the law makes this  double demand he insists upon it that the law has not a double demand but an alternative requiring either perfect obedience or else the suffering of its penalty i have considered this sentiment before and mention it in this place only to point out the objector s inconsistency  this way of talking makes it very difficult to understand what these people intend to admit one would think that what is here said makes as much against their own sentiment as it does against ours and when they are reminded of this their explanation only tends to involve their sentiment in complicated obscurity when we tell them that their own sentiment also infers a double demand of the law upon the sinners surety they seem inclined to admit that it does so but not such a double demand as we plead for and they say that the double demand which they admit may be reduced to a single one upon this i would observe    if they realy intend to admit that christ did at any time living or dying not only bear the curse but also sulfil the precepts of the law as our substitute this is the double demand we plead for the difference between the life and death of christ affects not the question concerning a double demand of the law for it is not length of time but the two things demanded which constitute the double demand if our surety had only to obey the precepts or if he had only to suffer the penalty of the law this would be but a single demand although he had been bound thus to obey or else to suffer all through life even unto death and upon the other hand if he was bound to obey and also to suffer for us this is a double demand although he had thus obeyed and suffered only in the hour of death    when they talk of reducing what they seem to admit to a single demand i am altogether at a loss to know their method of doing so if i were acquainted with their method of reducing i could try it upon my own view of this doctrine but as i do not my sentiment must needs remain as it is what theirs will look like after it is reduced i cannot tell but it seems that    to be consistent with themselves they must not only reduce a double demand to a single one but that single one must be an alternative in contradistinction to a double demand that is obedience to the precepts of the law including the suffering of it is penalty must be reduced to either one or the other of these two for they say the law has not a double demand but an alternative requiring either perfect obedience or else the suffering of it is penalty  but whatever obscurity may attend this sentiment in other respects one thing is plain viz it stands opposed to the belief of our sureties having acted in our name all through his state of humiliation  from the time he was made under the law to redeem until he said  it is finished i am not sure indeed from whence they date the commencement of his substitutional work  when he finished the righteousness which according to them is appropriated to his own personal qualification and when he began the other righteousness unto which our justification is directly ascribed but their argument seems to confine the latter to his death meaning thereby i suppose the whole of his voluntary sufferings from the time he was nailed to the cross until his resurrection taking the sentiment in this view we are now to consider the main argument upon which it rests it is said  the scriptures do not ascribe our justification directly to what christ did through the whole course of his life but always to what he did in his death to this we reply    the inspired writers do indeed and that very frequently ascribe our justification and salvation to what christ did in his death and considering his death as the completion of his substitutional undertaking it would be strange if they did not ascribe our justification to it but when the inspired writers ascribe our justification to the death of christ how does it appear that they intend to exclude as substitutional his foregoing obedience and sufferings  to ascribe salvation in all it is parts to the death of christ and to believe at the same time that christ acted as our surety all through his state of humiliation are not such inconsistent things as to render it impossible for an accurate speaker or writer to do both indeed i do not know an author of any note who held the doctrine i contend for but what does nevertheless ascribe our salvation to what christ did in his death i shall give a few instances out of many owen mercy pardon and grace could find no other way to issue forth from the heart of the father but by the hearts blood of the son witsius a right to all the blessings of the covenant of grace was purchased at once to all the elect by christs death mc laurin we must believe that salvation is the purchase of christs death hervey the death of christ procured the pardon and acceptance of believers sandeman ask a christian what is his faith the spring of all his hope he answers you in a word the blood of christ booth o remember that grace has erected her throne this forbids despair for her wonderful throne is erected not in the ruins of justice not on the dishonor of the law but on the blood of the lamb   now it is well known that these authors had no intention to confine the suretiship of christ to his death it is well known that they considered christ as the substitute of sinners all through his state of humiliation yet they ascribe salvation in all it is parts to his death in language as strong as that used by the apostles  the intelligent reader will readily perceive how far i intend this argument should go i have no thoughts of supporting any doctrine by human authority and therefore i do not quote these authors to that end it is sufficient if they are allowed to be men who knew how to express their own thoughts with propriety of speech and that they have actually done so upon this occasion and why should not this be admitted they considered the death of christ as the completion of his vicarious work and in this view they ascribe salvation to it is this to express their own thoughts improperly i suppose no one will say so what does this prove it proves that to ascribe salvation to the death of christ does not amount to a denial of his having acted as our substitute all through his state of humiliation and consequently when the apostles ascribed salvation to his death it does not prove that they intended to exclude as substitutional his foregoing obedience and sufferings  i may here remind our opposers of what certain of their own poets have said and which they themselves repeatedly sing viz  it is finished  this his dying groan  shall sins of every kind atone  millions shall be redeemed from death  by this his last expiring breath   the reasoner who should attempt to prove from this verse that the poet who made or that the persons who sing it consider nothing in the sufferings of christ as substitutional but his dying groan and last expiring breath would serve the poet and those who adopt his words as some men do the apostles    it is past dispute that the scriptures do in other cases  cases too which are closely connected with that in hand ascribe effects to the death of christ which belong also to the whole of his humiliation obedience and sufferings for instance christ is represented as saying therefore does my father love me because i lay down my life john  0    does this warrant us to say that laying down his life was the only thing for which his father loved him no verily not even though we should soften the matter by adding the words immediately and directly for all that christ did upon the earth were immediate and direct causes of the fathers love luke    0    chap      john      chap      and     0  again paul says jesus was crowned with glory and honor for the suffering of death heb     does this warrant us to say that his death was the only direct cause for which he was crowned was he not highly exalted for the whole of his humiliation obedience and sufferings phil       for loving righteousness and hating iniquity heb      for all that he did to glorify his father upon the earth john      certainly he was yet the scriptures ascribe it to his death therefore when the scriptures ascribe salvation to the death of christ why should we not understand them as including his foregoing obedience and sufferings to understand the scriptures thus is only to take them for their own interpreter and to explain what they say of the death of christ in one place by what we are sure they intend in another    when the scriptures ascribe salvation to the death of christ it cannot be with a view to exclude as substitutional his foregoing obedience and sufferings because it is impossible to find an adequate cause or end for this obedience or for these sufferings especially some of them without admitting that they were substitutional for instance what adequate cause or end shall we find for his dreadful sufferings in the garden and from thence to calvary if we deny that they were substitutional was it merely for the sake of setting us an example and qualifying himself in holiness that he began to be sore amazed and very heavy that his soul was exceeding sorrowful even unto death that he was in an agony and sweat great drops of blood falling to the ground that he was taken from hence bound smitten spit upon blindsolded mocked stripped and scourged  if the objector should admit that these instances of suffering were substitutional he must then abandon his argument and be reduced to the necessity of begging the question for these sufferings were no more undergone on the tree than were any other sufferings of our redeemers life and it must be noticed that the apostles not only ascribe our salvation to his last sufferings and death but also expressly to what he endured while hanging on the tree gal       but if the objector should go so far as to deny that the sufferings of christ in the garden and from thence until he was led forth to be crucified were substitutional he ought to provide a good reason for so doing which i am persuaded is absolutely impossible i conclude therefore that when the scriptures ascribe our justification to the death of christ it is not with any intention to exclude as substitutional his foregoing obedience and sufferings  but the objector has not only said that the scriptures always ascribe our justification to the death of christ but also that they never ascribe it directly to his foregoing obedience and sufferings we have therefore now to consider what authority he has for this part of his argument in doing this i shall   lay before the reader some passages of scripture which appear to ascribe our salvation to the sufferings of christ in general and   make some further observations upon the righteousness of our divine surety  first i shall lay before the reader some passages of scripture which appear to ascribe our justification and salvation to the sufferings of christ in general  poverty persecutions and temptations are remarkable instances of the sufferings of christ and the scriptures ascribe our salvation to each of them  poverty ye know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his poverty might be rich   cor     now christ became poor when he was born of a woman brought forth in a stable and laid in a manger he continued poor all through his life upon this earth and at length died in the most dreadful kind of poverty when any period of this state of poverty is contrasted with his original state and with what he had a right to enjoy as the son of the highest from the first moment of his birth it ought not to be esteemed a small matter we should also remember that a state of life such as our divine surety led in this world was part of the original curse pronounced upon sinful man  cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shall thou eat of it all the days of thy life thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth unto thee and thou shall eat the herb of the field in the sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it wast thou taken for dust thou art and unto dust shall thou return genesis              persecution let not them that wait on thee o lord god of hosts be ashamed for my sake let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake o god of israel because for thy sake i have born reproach shame has covered my face psalm        upon this text we have to observe   christ is the speaker   he is praying for his people who deserve eternal shame and confusion of face because they have sinned against god   the reason why this shame and confusion is not to come upon his people to whom it belonged is because their surety bore reproach shame covered his face now although this took place in its most eminent degree upon the cross it is plain from the context that christ is here speaking of all that shame and reproach which he endured upon the earth  it is past dispute with those who admit the authority of the new testament that the sufferings mentioned in this psalm upon the ground of which our advocate intercedes are the sufferings of christ in general compare verse   with john       and verse   with john       temptations in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful high priest in things pertaining to god to make reconciliation for the sins of the people for in that he himself has suffered being tempted he is able to succor them that are tempted heb         it is readily granted that the succor here mentioned includes that continual support relief and protection which the tempted christian receives from christ who learned by painful experience how to feel for his people but it is plain that this is not the only nor yet the chief thing which the apostle teaches the particulars which relate to the case in hand are   paul ranks the temptations which christ endured amongst his sufferings   these sufferings are amongst the all things in which it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren to the end he might make reconciliation for the sins of the people  now christ was tempted not only in his death but in all points like as we are heb      by what authority then do we exclude from his atonement all those temptations which he endured before his death and particularly those of which we read when he was led into the wilderness away from the habitations of men to be tempted of the chief of the infernal spirits in this horrid situation he continued during forty days and nights without food  how different this from the delightful abode of sinless adam how different from the proper habitation of adams lord this indeed is a fit situation for guilt and despair but how came the holy one of god in such a place  in such company  surely he has born our griefs and carried our sorrows isa     this chapter gives a comprehensive view of the sufferings of christ from first to last  from his growing up as a tender plant to his being cut off out of the land of the living it speaks   of the mean and despised appearence of the messiah while growing up as a root out of a dry ground isa        of the general hatred and contempt with which he should be treated isa verse     of the sorrows and griefs which were to be his constant companions isa verse     of his being wounded bruised and scourged verse     of his being brought as a lamb to the slaughter  taken from prison and judgment  and cut off etc verse     now the prophet was sure that all these griefs and all these sorrows were ours he knew that these afflictions could not come upon him without an adequate cause and although the jews in general thought that jesus of nazareth deserved them all although they esteemed him as one stricken smitten of god for his own sins and afflicted yet the prophet knew that he was no less a person than immanuel isa      the mighty god chap     and that his condition in this world was infinitely below and contrary to his own true character and consequently that every kind and degree of sufferings which he endured must be ours the messiah was presented to the thoughts of this prophet as growing up in the meanest condition a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief but says he surely these are our sorrows our griefs isa        he saw him wounded and bruised but when or wheresoever this was isaiah was confident it must be for our iniquities verse   he saw him scourged but he knew that these stripes were to be our healing verse   he saw him at length as a lamb brought to the slaughter and as a criminal led from prison and judgment to the fatal the accursed tree but he knew that in this as in every other instance it was for the transgressions of gods people that he was stricken verse      i think the man must be rather perverse who will insist upon it that this chapter speaks only of the sufferings of christ in his death or that all the sufferings mentioned are not referred to our sins as the cause and to our salvation as the end  our high priest in the days of his flesh offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he seared though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him heb       this chapter from the first verse to the ninth consists of two parts   a description of the office and duties of the high priest under the law verse      the application of this to the person and priesthood of christ heb verse    i do not intend to enter fully into the discussion of this remarkable portion of scripture my limits only admit and my design only requires that i point out such circumstances as go to prove that the sufferings of christ in general are included in his expiatory sacrifice and that our salvation is ascribed to his death on the cross considered as the perfecting and not as the only instance of his expiatory sufferings    the apostle is evidently speaking of christ under the character of a priest by which he leads us to consider all the sufferings he mentions in this place as belonging to the atonement made by christ for the sins of the people verse       the apostle mentions the time in which our high priest endured these sufferings viz the days of his flesh heb     now the days of his flesh are more than the hours of his crucifixion  the days of his flesh are the days of his humiliation wherein he appeared in the form of sinful flesh romans     a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief    the sufferings of which the apostle speaks in this place and which he represents as belonging to christs priestly office are of such a nature that we have reason to believe he certainly did endure them all through the days of his flesh  he offered up prayers and supplications with crying  with strong crying  with strong crying and tears heb     now compare this with the history of christs life given by the evangelists there we read of his sending the multitude away dismissing his disciples also and then retiring not to repose after the labors of the day but to a desert mountain to pray and continuing there until about the fourth watch of the night mat           at another time we read of his rising up in the morning a great while before day and departing into a solitary place to pray mark      and again we are told of his going out into a mountain to pray and continuing all night in prayer to god luke      now from these instances we should conclude that it was common for him thus to spend his nights indeed the evangelist in one place telling us of his retiring at night to the mount of olives says expressly  as he was wont luke        the last night which the savior of sinners spent in prayer to god he permitted three of his disciples to be with him and we know the awful account they give of what they saw and heard  this was in the garden of gethsemane i do not positively affirm that all his nightly prayers were attended with equal sorrows but this i know that the apostle speaks in a general way when he tells us of the state of mind in which our high priest offered up his prayers and supplications when he tells us they were offered up with strong crying and tears he does not appear to be speaking of what was done on some one particular occasion but he seems to be speaking in general of what he did in the days of his flesh moreover these prayers and supplications which our high priest offered up with strong crying and tears were a subject of prophecy and they are spoken of as being offered up day and night incessantly thus the redeemer weeps o my god i cry unto thee in the day time but thou hear not and in the nightseason and am not silent psalm      upon these memorable words i would make the following remarks   we are sure that jesus is the speaker   this bitter complaint cannot refer merely to the scene in gethsemane because that scene took place at night and the complaint is o my god i cry in the daytime neither can it refer only to what jesus suffered on the cross because he was taken down from the cross before sunset and the complaint is i cry in the daytime and in the nightseason   this complaint cannot well be confined to any one particular day and night because the words are more properly expressive of daily continued sorrow  o my god i cry unto thee in the day time but thou hear not and in the night season and am not silent this way of speaking calls to our mind what the evangelists tell us of his continuing whole nights in prayer on mountains and in solitary places and of this being his usual custom   it appears from this second verse of the twentysecond psalm that our redeemer had occasion more than once to use the words of the first verse viz my god my god why have thou forsaken me etc we have just now mentioned some considerations which go to prove that the complaint uttered in the second verse cannot be confined to the awful scene in gethsemane nor yet to that on the cross and if the second verse cannot be thus confined no more can the first as may appear from hence the two verses seem to be closely connected together and to form one complaint  my god my god why have thou forsaken me why art thou so far from helping me and from the words of my roaring o my god i cry in the day time but thou hear not and in the night season and am not silent  does not the suffering redeemer connect in this instance his unheard cries with his being forsaken of god and when he himself complains of crying thus unto god day and night continually shall we say he never had occasion thus to complain except during the six hours in which he hung upon the cross let it be far from christians to contradict their lord in any thing and especially when his sufferings are in question when he intimates in any particular instance that he suffered for our sins the least we can do is to acknowledge that he did so    and being made perfect continues the apostle he became the author of eternal salvation  and being made perfect this is just the form of expression which we might have expected if as we maintain the apostle had been speaking of our great high priest as gradually advancing all through the days of his flesh in the great work of atonement considering all the sufferings of his life in this light it was natural to add  and being made perfect  our great high priest was made perfect by his last sufferings on the cross where according to his own words he finished his work being thus made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation to all them that obey him by this one offering he has perfected for ever them that are sanctified there is no need of repeating this sacrifice like those which were offered under the law for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment so christ was once offered to bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation  i shall conclude what i have to say upon the sufferings of christ in the words of witsius not with any view to strengthen the argument by the authority of his name but because he expresses my own views more clearly perhaps than i could have done myself  i remember to have learned says he in the communion of the reformed church to the following effect  st that the death wherewith god threatened man for sin comprizes in its whole extent all that misery which by the justest despleasure of god has followed upon sin and to which the sinner man is obnoxious all his life the principal part of which consists in the want of the favor of god and in the keenest sense of the divine curse to be chiefly inflicted when it shall so please god  dly that christ by the interposition of his engagements for the elect took upon himself all that curse which man was liable to on account of sin hence it was that in order to the payment of the debt he engaged for he led a life in the assumed human nature subject to many vicissitudes of misery just like the life of a human sinner  dly that as god uses much forbearance with respect to sinners and moderates the bitterness of life with some sweetness of patience till the day of vengeance and of the retribution of his righteous judgment when the whole weight of the curse shall light upon the condemned sinner so also christ when in the form of sinful flesh had not always the same sense of the painful effects of the sins that were laid upon him but sometimes rejoiced in an eminent mixture of favor till the hour and power of darkness came when being called to the bar he had every thing dreadful to undergo  thly that as the death which consists in the separation of the soul and body is inflicted on the sinner man as the fad effect of the wrath of god so in like manner christ underwent the same death that in this respect also making satisfaction to divine justice he might remove all the curse of that death from the elect  thly in fine that as all those miseries taken together are what sin deserves so christ who by his engagement took upon himself all the debt of the elect did by all these miseries to which he was subject all his life satisfy divine justice so that taken all together they constitute the ransom which was due for our sins  all the sufferings which christ endured both in soul and body through the whole course of his life constitute his one and perfect satisfaction though it be certain that those were the most grievous sufferings with which he encountered on the last night and day and that what he bore in his body were far exceeded by those that oppressed his soul just as the whole of christs most holy obedience is imputed to us for righteousness though he gave an eminent demonstration of it when he was obedient in death  we come now  secondly to make some further observations upon the righteousness of our divine surety i do not intend to enter fully into the consideration of this glorious subject if i had ability suited to such a task my limits would not admit of it all that i intend is to propose one argument more taken from what the scriptures say of the righteousness of christ in reply to the objection now before us  the objector will not admit that christ obeyed and suffered all through his life upon earth as the surety or substitute of sinners he cannot find he says that the scriptures ascribe our justification directly to what christ did in his life but always to what he did in his death  in reply to this we have shown   that when the scriptures ascribe our justification to the death of christ it is not with any intention to exclude as substitutional his foregoing obedience and sufferings   that the scriptures do in many places ascribe our justification and salvation to the sufferings of christ in general that is to all the sufferings he endured in the days of his humiliation to these considerations we have now to add what we have before proved that our justification is ascribed and that  directly to the righteousness of christ this alone one might imagine is sufficient to decide this question but the objector has found out a new way to evade the force of this argument hitherto the question has been  is the righteousness of christ including his sufferings the immediate and direct cause of our justification this question being decided in the affirmative the dispute was ended the reason was there existed no dispute about what was meant by the righteousness of christ it was admitted upon all hands that the righteousness of christ is his conformity to the rule of righteousness or in other words the whole of his obedience to the moral law for men had not as yet learned to distinguish between his obedience to the precepts of the moral law in his life and his obedience to the precepts of the moral law in his death and to assign different kinds of influence to this obedience in the justification of the ungodly but by the help of these distinctions the objector can admit in words that our justification is ascribed directly to the rightcousness of christ and yet deny that it is directly the reader must impute the frequent repetition of the word  directly to the singularity of the sentiment i am opposing ascribed to the holiness of his heart and life in conformity to the moral law if the reader doubts whether this be a fair representation let him read the objectors own words page  of this essay so that it is not enough for us to prove that the scriptures ascribe our justification directly to the righteousness of christ we must also prove that the righteousness of christ is the whole of his conformity to that rule of righteousness under which he was made  which one would think is so self evident that it does not require and that it hardly admits of proof it is almost like attempting to prove that the righteousness of christ is  the righteousness of christ and perhaps some readers may blame me for saying any more upon a subject which is already so plain such as are thus minded may here close the book to others we shall propose the following remarks     the righteousness of which we speak is the righteousness of christ it is not the righteousness of the eternal word considered only as god and as the governor of the world but it is that righteousness which this person wrought in our nature after he was made of a woman and while he was under the law it is that righteousness of his which consists in a perfect conformity to every jot and title of the law if it be asked  is every action of his life from his birth to his death included in this righteousness i answer directly yes upon which i fancy i hear some exclaim  what did he conform to the ceremonial law as our substitute did he work miracles as our substitute  yes in so far as his conformity to the moral law was concerned in these things when he attended to the ceremonial law he did so in obedience to the command of god which is not a ceremonial but moral duty   cor vii    and while he wrought miracles he was going about doing good acts x    which is also a moral duty  but the moral law never bound us to observe the ceremonial law it never bound us to work miracles  true but it bound us to obey god and to do good to man and it is only in this sense that we consider the righteousness of christ as concerned in ceremonies and miracles  indeed these things are very inconsistently objected to us by the persons we now speak to they also profess to believe that christ obeyed the moral law as our substitute and how do they say he did this  by dying to redeem lost sinners  but the moral law never commanded us to perform such a work as this this was the greatest miracle of all yet if any one was to object this to them they would and very justly consider it as an impertinent cavil at least they would know how to answer it and one answer will equally suit us both neither party need be afraid if the only thing that can be objected to us is that christ obeyed the law for us in a different and far more excellent manner than could be expected from us  this is our glory the righteousness of our divine surety does not exceed that which was demanded of the elect more than his person exceeds their persons but who ever objected to the suretiship of christ merely upon account of the excellency of his person yea i have heard one man and only one go thus far i cannot admit the doctrine of imputed righteousness he said for this reason  the works of an infinite person cannot be imputed to one that is finite  but this seems to proceed upon a mistaken notion of the nature of that imputation of which we speak it is indeed impossible that any finite person should perform the works which are peculiar to one who is infinite and as the judgment of god is always according to truth it is equally impossible that he should so impute the righteousness of christ unto us as to judge that this righteousness is our own personal work this therefore is not what the scriptures teach neither is it what any christian pleads for  but it was not impossible for the eternal word who is an infinite person to take on him a finite nature to unite himself to his elect and become their surety it was not impossible for him in their nature and as their surety to obey every jot and tittle of the moral law and suffer its penalty nor is it impossible for god to impute this unto the persons for whom it was done that is it is not impossible for god to place it to their account and upon this ground to justify them from all things from which they could not be justified by their own personal performances this is not impossible but divinely true  the righteousness of our incarnate god is unto and upon all them that believe but neither he who wrought nor he who imputes this righteousneis nor they unto whom it is imputed ever mistake it for the workmanship of a finite person it is ours because it was wrought for us and is imputed unto us not because it is our own personal performance there is indeed such a close union between christ and his elect that because he died rose and reigns and because his righteousness is divine they also are represented as dead risen reigning and as made the righteousness of god but they are all this in him who is their head and representative to obey and suffer in the second adam is one thing and to do so in our own persons is another  considering therefore the nature and grounds of this imputation the infinity of the person of our surety is so far from making the imputation of his righteousness impossible that the reverse is true for had he been a mere creature he could have yielded no obedience to the law of god beyond what was necessary for himself much less could he make reconciliation for the innumerable sins of the whole redeemed company and work a righteousness which should be adequate to the demands of the law upon them all it was necessary indeed that he should be man for otherwise he could neither obey the precepts nor suffer the penalty of the law given to man but it was his divinity that gave sufficient worth and efficacy to the whole  there is then a likeness and there is also a difference between the person of our surety and our persons and there is also a likeness and a difference between what the law demanded of us and what he performed as our surety as the children were partakers of flesh and blood he also himself took part of the same as we were under the law he was made under it as the law bound us to continue in all things that are written therein he came to fulfill every jot and tittle of the law and he always did those things that were pleasing in his fathers fight and as we were exposed to the righteous curse of a broken law so the lord laid on him the iniquity of us all and he suffered the just for the unjust thus far there is a likeness but mark the difference we were mere creatures he was the great creator the obedience which the law demanded of us was only the obedience of mere men but his is the righteousness of god because we could never satisfy divine justice for our sins we were doomed to endless misery but he being fully able to do this his sufferings had an end    i think it has been proved that christ suffered for the sins of his people not only in his death but also through the whole course of his life consequently he must have stood as our surety all that time and if he did so in suffering the penalty of the law why not in obeying its precepts    i think we have also proved that the incarnate god had no occasion to obey the moral law for himself at least not in the manner in which he did obey it all through his state of humiliation consequently it was for us he did so and not for himself    although the love which christ manifested in his death is undoubtedly included in his righteousness and is the most eminent instance of it yet we cannot think that this was all he intended when he said he came to fulfill every jot and tittle of the law this expression evidently includes not only the  weightier matters of the law such as perfect love to god and man but also all  the least of those commandments wherein that love should be expressed and we find that the righteousness of christ does in fact answer to the most minute as well as the most important duties of the law it is universal and in every respect perfect neither the greatest nor the least precept was neglected by him he laid down his life for his brethren in obedience to the high command of his father and he was subject to joseph and mary luke      in conformity to the fifth precept of the law and it should be observed that he did all this because it was easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one tittle of the law to fail    christs obedience to the law was not only universal but constant nor was this unnecessary for although this law could have had no dominion over him if he had not been made under it to redeem yet after he was made under it he was bound to obey it in all points and to continue his obedience unto the end therefore all that christ did in obedience to this law is essential to his righteousness    i think it must be granted that the righteousness of christ taken in the most proper and complete sense of the word includes the whole of his obedience from his infancy to his death and why should we understand it as intending any thing short of this when our justification is ascribed directly to it but     we call upon the objector to produce one single text of scripture wherein the righteousness of christ must necessarily be understood as not including the whole of his conformity to the moral law or eternal rule of righteousness  i shall conclude this essay in the words of dr j owen  i cannot but judge it sounds ill in the ears of all christians says he that the obedience of our lord jesus christ as our mediator and surety unto the whole law of god was for himself and not for us or that what he did therein was not that he might be the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believes  especially considering that the says of the church is that he was given to us born to us that for us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven and did and suffered what was required of him  it is said that this obedience was necessary as a qualification of his person that he might be meet to be a mediator for us and therefore was for himself  but this i positively deny the lord christ was every way meet for the whole work of mediation by the ineffable union of the human nature with the divine which exalted it in dignity honor and worth above any thing or all things that ensued thereon for hereby he became in his whole person the object of divine worship and honor for  when he brings the first begotten into the world he says and let all the angels of god worship him again that which is an effect of the person of the mediator as constituted such cannot be a qualification necessary unto its constitution  whereas therefore he was neither made man nor of the posterity of abraham for himself but for the church namely to become thereby the surety of the covenant and representative of the whole his obedience as man unto the law in general and as the son of abraham unto the law of mofes was for his people and not for himself it was so designed so performed and without a respect unto the church was of no use unto himself he was born to us and given to us lived for us and died for us obeyed for us and suffered for us that by the obedience of one many might be made righteous this was the grace of our lord jesus christ and this is the faith of she church and what he did for us is imputed to us this is included in the very notion of his doing it for us which cannot be spoken in the true and proper sense unless what he so did be imputed unto us and i think men ought to be cautious that they do not by distinctions and studied evasions for the defense of their own private opinions shake the foundations of the christian religion and i am sure it will be easier for them as it is in the proverb to wrest the club out of the hand of hercules than to disposses the minds of true believers of this persuasion viz that what the lord christ did in obedience unto god according unto the law he designed in his love and grace to do it for them he needed no obedience for himself he came not into a capacity of yielding obedience for himself but for us and therefore for us it was that he fulfilled the law in obedience unto god according unto the terms of it the obligation that was on him unto obedience was originally no less for us no less needful unto us no more for himself no more necessary unto him than the obligation that was on him as the surety of the covenant to suffer the penalty of the law was either the one or the other which may be illustrated thus when the apostle paul wrote those words unto philemon concerning onesimus ver    if he has wronged thee dealt unrighteously or injuriously with thee or owes thee ought wherein thou have suffered loss by him put it on my account or impute it all unto me i will repay it or answer for it all he supposes that philemon might have a double action against onesimus the one of wrong or injury the other of loss or debt if he has wronged thee or owes thee ought hereon he proposes himself and obliges himself by his express obligation i paul have written it with my own hand that he would answer for both hereby he was obliged in his own person to make satisfaction unto philemon but yet he was to do it for onesimus and not for himself  some of the ancients disputed that the son of god should have been incarnate although man had not sinned and fallen but none of them once imagined that he should have been so made man as to be made under the law and be obliged thereby unto that obedience which he has performed but they judged that immediately he was to have been a glorious head unto the whole creation for it is a common notion and presumption of all christians but only such as will sacrifice these notions to their own private conceptions that the obedience which christ yielded unto the law on the earth in the state and condition wherein he did yield it was not for himself but for the church which was obliged unto perfect obedience but was not able to accomplish it  finis
