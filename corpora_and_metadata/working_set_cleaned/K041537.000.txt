a poem upon the death of her late sacred majesty queen anne and the most happy and most auspicious accession of his sacred majesty king george to the imperial crowns of great britain france and ireland with an exhortation to all true britons to unity  rege incolumi mens omnibus una est virg georg l   by mr dennis  london printed by h mere and sold by j baker at the black boy in paternoster row       price six pence  on the death of queen anne and the accession of king george to the crowns of great britain etc with an exhortation to all britons to unity those british bards appear to me to have sunk below the majesty of british verse who mortal painters have vouchsafed to invoke to assist them in their great designs to paint britannias woe when royal anne expired what mortal painter can suffice descend urania child of memory and jove o goddess of celestial imagry queen of immortal colors deathless strokes and graces that can charm the rudest minds speaking thou paintst with so divine a skill that gods and men are ravished with the draught and when thou dictatest to thy godlike sons thy influence makes the pens immortal draught victorious over the pencils dying toil goddess descend then and inspire my song that it with native majesty may rise high as the sacred spring from which it flows that i may painting sing britannias woe in such a moving such a melting strain that with concern the listening world may hear and in the doleful deathless chorus join and for the greater pomp of piercing woe muse show britannia to her mournful lyre lamenting all the virtues of her queen all the great actions of her wondrous reign in which the terror of the british arms was carried to germanias horrid alps their fame beyond the oceans farthest waves then let her wring her late victorious arms and rend the laurels from her sacred hair muse paint her woe accompanied with care and black mistrust and with tormenting fear fear of false friends fear of her factious sons paint her in direfulst consternations muse in dismalst expectation of the approach of vile and murderous idolatry of shameful slavery and endless woe but short o goddess be the mournful draught and short the lamentation of the song for lo the wondrous hand of god appears now muse begin a new and nobler strain thy colors vary and thy shadows change or let thy draught like holbins be all light draw what no mortal painter ever could draw and show britannia passing in an hour from fear to hope to joy to ecstasy to immortal ecstasy from killing woe for lo the wondrous hand of god appears britannias noblest sons that had till now been for whole ages into factions rent all in a moment by a secret force resistless seek their common countrys good unanimously hearts and hands they join unanimously with a noble fire their rightful king the royal george proclaim hark how the air with shouts of joy resounds with acclamations of blessed multitudes hark how aloud with one accord they cry in imitation of their godlike chiefs long live the royal george long may he live and happy may he reign bless him ye powers shower down your choicest blessings on his head blessings as numberless as those he brings to happy britains isle waft him ye winds ye billows gently in his passage rise and gently in obeisance to him fall let the calm ocean recognize it is lord and land him safely on the longing shore but who can ever the impatient longings paint of britons all on fire to see their king see how at his approach their eyes voice hands the unruly transport of their joy declare an entertainment worthier majesty and far more pleasing to the monarchs soul than all the pompous pageantry of state and vain magnificence of dying show the low obeisance and the prostrate bows that on all hands obsequiously are paid for these may flow from traitors and from focs but these the loyal subjects humble love and cordial joy declare and lo he comes and with him brings britannias other hope britannias other hope the other dread of gaul britannia seems to see with ravished eyes her godlike edward and his conquering son after three centuries return from heaven to execute the vast designs of fate hark how the air sounds with redoubled shouts and all the welkin rings with vast acclaim while the shrill trumpets with their silver sounds inspire a martial and heroic joy and our deep cannons formidable roar the ruler of the worlds vicegerent thunder bears the transporting tidings to the skies where angels louder hallelujahs sing and all the spirits of the blessed rejoice chiefly the souls of the triumphant slain who died to compass this auspicious day in blenheim and ramellias deathless fields with godlike william at their head once more for he who dying to great marlboroughs care consigned themhere himself commands them there he men and angels in transporting joy surpasses to behold this sacred day williams each action and his every thought all the long labors of his anxious days and all the restless slumbers of his nights were destined to secure this sacred day his daily image and his nightly dream for this great william lived and reigned and died but whither muse do thou transported rove immortal child of memory and jove return to his vicegerent here below and to the king thy eyes and thoughts confine on whom the eyes of gods and men are fixed behold him well with thy immortal eyes that thou may paint him to the gazing world paint him with native majesty adorned but heightened with a thousand great exploits performed upon pannonias wondering plains where he for twenty years victorious fought against the foe of all the christian world even then the great defender of the faith and champion of the almighty under him spotless religion will be still secure in spite of all the attacks of rome and hell muse paint no terror on his regal brow but love and majesty together blend and let him look a king resolved to rule over his subjects hearts even god himself the almighty ruler of the universe remains unsatisfied with all his power unless he has the hearts of those he rules terrestrial rulers his vicegerents called if they over senseless matter only reign are but dramatick kings to rule over souls over intelligent immortal beings is true dominion true imperial sway muse paint the king a monarch not by halves but let him reign over all his subjects hearts a king who reigns by parties is a king only of half his subjects and the lord who has the affections of the other half is truly king of that let royal george possess them all let him deserve them all by his just gentle and impartial sway and that the king may rule over all our hearts grant him thou god of concord and of love grant him the glory to unite those hearts heal our divisions and our factions calm and as thy great creating power at first from warring elements composed the world so from our jarring factions may the king form an harmonious and a glorious state that britain like thy heaven serene within may send its lightning and its thunder forth taffright and punish an offending world daughter of jove mother of harmony exhort thy britains to fraternal love it is our divisions that have made us weak and to the nations scandalously vile but mutual love will make us once more strong with neighboring nations will retrieve our fame and place the balance of the christian power in royal georges formidable arm unite then britains join both hearts and hands the barbarous distinction of vile names for ever be removed be britons all and look with indignation and disdain on the vile artifices that had power to divide those whom heaven and nature meant when it disjoined us from the rest of men should be within our selves for ever one the true britannick tory and church whig names that debase the majesty of verse odious distinctions mean but the same thing a king by law from doing harm restrained but boundless in his power of doing good over all persons over all things supreme except superior and imperial law a people free and ruled by laws they make proud to be subjects scorning to be slaves a church in its own excellence secure abhorring violence abhorring blood and mean mistrusts and vain fantastic fears relying firmly on established law and promises divine which have decreed that all the rage of earth and rage of hell against its sacred power shall never prevail the true britannick tory and church whig mean naught but this and therefore should be friends and the dissenter from established rites the sober scrupulous conscientious man in principles politicals the same with both the other since they then all three in interest and principle are one let them be three by barbarous terms no more but by asfection one and one by name let them all three be to each other true as to the original compact they are just and to their countrys constitution true let the dissenter venerate the church and let the church breathe naught but heavenly love toward those who differ from her sacred rites as surely knowing nothing can create danger to her but want of love divine for those who quarrel with our countrys laws and with our frame of government for those who would be too much bound or too much free those let us now endeavor to reclaim since they were born our brethren and our friends then let the few of old republics fond know that our manners profligately vile can never consist with democratick sway that they require the curb of regal power though justly we tyrannick rule disdain ye wretches who desire unbounded sway would ye be governed well or governed ill what fool what brute would not be governed well the aesopian frogs when they desired a king one active and benificent required and all the sounding bog whom instinct taught the right which nature gave with one accord deposed the lumpish useless lifeless log and croakd to heaven for help from the devouring crane now view the earth from london to japan take a survey of its most boundless lords let it be sultan sophy czar mogul whoever governs well he rules by law by written or eternal law he rules the law promulgated in human hearts even the great ruler of the universe governs by written or eternal law and none he favors and chastises none but for observing or transgressing law but in hereditary realms how few are qualified to rule by reasons law perhaps not four in ten successive kings the rest must govern then by stated rule or they must govern ill whoever in realms hereditary then declare for boundless power and boundless kings they for ill government in terms declare and are to all their fellow subjects foes and traitors to their kings for stated law which alone makes the safety of the ruled makes the sole firm security of kings and never prince in kingdoms ruled by law while law prevailed by freeborn subjects fell but thousands where unbounded power prevailed have fallen by their own nonresisting slaves while feeble principle to natures power gave way and passive canting doctrines failed as roman and as turkish records tell where slaves upon unbounded lords depend upon those slaves the unbounded lords depend let him then who for boundless power declares either recant or own himself a foe to prince to people and to human kind and if he dares to own himself that foe let him by prince by people and mankind an universal outlaw be proclaimed and like devoted noxious creatures used but if repenting he desires a king a king the just executor of law instead of an unjust and baleful tyrant the bloody executioner of will by that desire he royal george demands for none of all our regal race but he dares rule by written or eternal law for one in romish superstition bred and disciplined to barbarous tyranny will scorn all bounds and make his power his law but royal george even in his native realm where he was less restrained by written law yet there with justice and with mercy ruled his comprehensive reason was his law to his hereditary subjects dear the common tender father of them all who his departure for britannia saw with the same grief and the same horror struck that wretches left on greenlands horrid strand see the departure of the lord of day the exhaustless source of warmth and life and light with joy ye britons under such a king unite and grow indissolubly firm to the two ancient kingdoms of our isle james i james gave one monarch anna gave one law for george the happier union is reserved the union of affections and of hearts that union makes both king and people blessed makes him the greatest most renowned of kings and us a people worthy such a king goddess to whom it is given by fate and jove to bring back what is past the present to record the future to foresee and to unite whatever has been and is and what shall be let thy loud britons see with ravished souls what wondrous blessings will on britain flow under the king united to itself while he with justice and with mercy rules with plenty we and liberty obey that union in the king will place a power a formidable but a legal power on which our western tyrants will look pale and all his subjects look with cheerful hue for he with the same awful bounteous voice with which he sets to each proud tyrant bars and says as god does to the oceans waves here fix thy bounds here stop thy aspiring course will make fair liberty immortal here will make his subjects blessed secure renowned woe to that guilty tyrant who shall then provoke him to resume the dreadful sword to lead his britons and his germans forth to meet bright victory on belgian plains where they have often the radiant goddess met where often the radiant goddess has been pleased to bless and crown the union of their arms what vengeance will that impious tyrant urge what hideous and amazing ruin draw on his accursed and devoted head in vain he shall new fortresses erect as giants mountains upon mountains hurled to threat religion and assail the skies the king like jove shall crumble them to dust with his avenging thunder and his son as once he did on audenards wondering plains shall like the god of war among them rush while dread before him and amazement march and slaughter and destruction stalk behind what numerous triumphs shall we then behold upon the land upon the astonished main again great marlborough to the german alps with old victorious squadrons shall be sent the german alps shall tremble at his march and from their summits shake the eternal snow another deathless blenheim shall be fought and in its field another emperor saved another glorious ramellies succeed and fifty forts and provinces entire which perfidy and fraud and impious gold could scarce in fifty guilty years acquire shall in one hour before the conqueror fall orford once more great neptune shall affright and make him apprehend as at la hogue that joves descended in celestial fire to exhaust and to devour his watery realm our impious foes shall from all seas be driven nor shall the ocean which confines the world britannias fame and victories confine both shall to new astonished worlds extend to imperial mexico montezumas golden coast and peru atabalipas more precious shore and both the aetherial andes shall ascend where on the skies the ambitious earth confines britannias victories and fame like them shall reach the stars and terminate in heaven our ships shall over the atlantic ocean range from florida to the far southern cape where the two seas their names and waves confound in triumph the pacifick billows plough from california to rich chilis shore shall captivate the vessels of both floods their forts demolish and their towns destroy ravage their carthagene and porto bell and panama and royal lima spoil confound the hope of the aspiring gaul and teach the proud castilian humbler thoughts return with the vast treasure of the west and bring home riches to amaze the world dreadful alas shall spread that war and wide infecting sea and land with purple die but short shall be its transitory rage and it shall end in victory and fame eternal fame to britain and her king and then a glorious everlasting peace crowned with domestic quiet shall succeed and brood over britain with her downy wings to hatch felicity and plenty here then the wise conduct of the best of kings will shine and then his godlike bounty flow the rich with flowing plenty will overwhelm employ and nourish our yet numerous poor our manufactures will increase and raise our commerce will improve and will extend and to our side incline the ponderous scale while he the oceans undisputed lord will call divine astrea from the skies and causeher sacred laws to be observed as strictly on the rude tempestuous main as they are observed on calm britannias shore as they are observed in her own native heaven the numbers of his subjects he will augment diminished much by three devouring wars extend our culture and improve our soil will make the ocean now the worlds great wast it self a fertile and a bounteous soil while his bold britons plough the furrowed deep and reap a plentiful and living harvest at home the rich shall jocundly sit down in the cool shade of his own branching vine and with its juice make his poor brethren glad but when this glorious long continued peace shall advance commerce to its utmost height base poverty and baser passions then for ever shall be banished from our isle the riches of the earth the joys of heaven shall overflow britannias blissful plains the eastern and the western world shall vie which shall add most to our increasing store the merchant shall in sparkling ruby drink and under golden canopies shall sleep and balmy shall his slumbers be and long the happy shepherd with his rural crook shall the dumb kingdom under him survey and while his heart distends with pride and joy shall see his wanton and his fatning flock the source of all his countrys wealth and power under their ponderous fleeces proudly pant while numberless and covering all the plain to the shrill music of his jocund pipe under his ravished eye they still increase and hourly multiply the whistling hind shall sow the faithful glebe with sanguine hope large interest to extort for what he lends and for mild seasons and a gentle reign shall praise aloud the goodness of the king and the indulgent clemency of heaven fair liberty shall like the british oak the long lived oak grow tall and branching spread and virtue under liberty grow strong for ever property shall be secure the public credit be forever fixed the buisy britons like industrious bees shall drive the idle drones from forth their hives and idleness be deemed the source of every vice pernicious luxury shall be restrained by wholesome and by sumptuary laws that none his patrimonial lands may waste and so by dire necessity be urged to sell his country and his king betray unmanly customs and contagious vice and fraud beyond the ocean shall be driven and faith and every virtue dwell secure devotion to the heaven of heavens shall soar upon the flaming wings of charity and fall again in blessings on mankind while vile mistrust and vain fantastic fear and envy hatred malice rage revenge shall take their flight to tyrants courts abroad or take their flight to hell and plague the damned no passion but the heavenborn passion love among britannias happy sons shall reign no passion here but love shall reign and joy the lawful and the charming child of love each noble art shall flourish as in days of great augustus or great alexander goddess to thee a temple well erect and annual honors shall be paid to thee peace owes its noblest ornaments to thee distinguished merit owes its chief reward and virtues self its immortality thy tuneful sons their raptures shall employ to celebrate the blessings and the joys of this renowned and everlasting peace thy noblest sons their transports shall employ virtue and public spirit to advance and great and public actions to record and to reward with everlasting fame to extol the godlike patriot to the skies to fix on traitors an eternal brand and on the venal vile accursed pens that with their lies intoxicate the crowd and make the beasts run dangerously mad while from immortal merit they detract heroic victories heroic deeds to which its happiness their country owes its safety spirit strength and high renown on these a brand eternal shall be fixed eternal laurels on our heroes heads a different hero to each godlike bard and a peculiar province shall be given but their heroic transports all shall join redouble all their raptures and their flames to celebrate the kings auspicious reign and his immortal name to extend as far as his high conduct brave and just and wise will fair britannias happiness extend finis
