honorable sir william young one of the lords of the treasury and knight of the most honorable order of the bath sir the great and noble of all ages have and ever will be marked out by writers of every degree to patronize their labors and as public fame though sparing of her favors has distinguished you in an age of politeness wit and learning among other eminent virtues that exalt the mind and dignify human nature i am sufficiently justified to the world in the choice of my patron but must depend on your known candor for thus presuming without your leave yet i have this for my excuse exalted merit is free to the consideration of all men and where excellencies shine every man has a right to admire  though praise is the just due of merit and all the world would join with me while i grew warm in yours yet as i know your nature more inclined to deserve than receive it i shall ease you of that pain and in silence wonder where words must fail  the people of mexico every year offered something to their emperor in token of vassalage and frequently among things worthy the notice of a king he received even sacks of common earth from those persons who could not afford a nobler offering but they like me did what was in their power with an expression in their language which signified i would it were more worthy of your acceptance i am assured from your goodness to find pardon for this freedom though i add to my presumption by subscribing my self  your most obedient humble servant  the preface the following sheets are a detail of fortunes i have run through for many years and however extraordinary they may appear i shall give you the circumstances for truth yet this i must own they lay by me undigested and i had never any intention to make em public if an old acquaintance had not taken my loose papers from me and declared if i would not digest em he would  the shipwreck of my friend mr castelman the dangers he underwent together with the descriptions of pensylvania and philadelphia the capital of that country i hope will not displease the reader there are no embelishments nor one step out of the road of truth i believe every one that knows him will give him the character of a person of the greatest probity as the post he is in will sufficiently testify  the adventures of captain robert boil etc i was born at a seaport called boston in lincolnshire my father was captain and owner of a merchantship that traded to the west indies but was cast away homewardbound upon the rocks of silly and but one man saved of his whole crew my mother and i were at an aunts in london when the unhappy news of my fathers death arrived  i was too young to feel my loss but my mothers grief soon broke her heart and left me a poor helpless orphan not ten years of age it is true i had a tender aunt that was in pretty good circumstances who took care of my education i soon learnt to read and write a good hand i understood a little latin and was perfect master of the french tongue which i had been learning from my infancy my mother being born at paris where my father married her very young and brought her to reside at boston  by that time i had reached fourteen years of age my aunt told me it was time for me to think of some trade desiring me to choose what i liked best and she would provide for me accordingly said she if i might advise you i would have you study the law under the tuition of your uncle  but i told her i did not much care for any calling that must owe its prosperity to the misfortune of others and at last i chose that of a watchmaker as imagining my self to have a good mechanical head accordingly i went upon liking as they call it and my master and i agreeing very well i was bound with the usual forms and found civil usage from him in respect of my birth and the misfortunes of our family  my aunt paid forty guineas which was reckoned at that time a great price but he was one of the top of his business and besides to find me in clothes and other necessaries during my seven years apprenticeship  the first half year we agreed very well but within that time my master had married a wife of a pretty good fortune and a large share of ill nature in a months time she began to tyrannize over my master as well as me and soon proved as the saying is the gray mare to be the better horse she brought it to that pass at last that i was obliged to go on all her halfpenny errands and carry her book to church of a sunday after her i bore this tolerably well but not without complaining to my aunt who advised me to make my self as easy as i could for she feared speaking would do no good  i went on this way for a whole year and then to complete my misfortunes my poor aunt died of a dropsy this indeed was the greatest shock of all my life for while she lived i felt no want of father or mother she left me  00 l and my uncle  to be my guardian i shall forbear mentioning his name not out of regard to him but of his children who have proved a sweet grafting from a sour stock and as good as he was base  my shrew of a mistress continued her ill nature to me and one accident made her prove outrageous  my master had a vast trade and vented a great many watches beyond sea one day he had a large parcel of them to go on board a ship bound for lisbon the vessel lay at deptford and my master was pleased to take me along with him in the boat  before we were got to limehouse my master called to mind that he had forgot a silver watch that he had purposely made for the captain of the ship he landed me at ratcliffcross and desired i would be expeditious in going for the tide running downwards i could get to the exchange sooner on foot than by water against the stream then to take boat at billingsgate and follow him to the ship  i ran almost all the way and i believe got to the exchange in half an hour when i came home i found no body in the shop but my fellowprentice who informed me my mistress was above i went immediately up stairs for the watch for my master told me he had left it in his own room being he had wore it several days to prove the going of it but found the door shut standing a moment to consider i heard a mans voice speaking to my mistress in a low key and i soon understood by their dialogue that love was the subject they talked of i listened some time till i found they had left off discoursing and were entered upon action  now at the head of the stairs the maid had left a stepladder that she had used in the morning in nailing up some valens to the windows in the dining room and there being a glass over the chamber door i had a great mind to see who it was that was doing my masters business in his absence thereupon i fixed the ladder very softly against the wainscot by the door and up i got but leaning toward the window in order to see into the room my weight made the ladder slip and the top sliding against the door burst it open and in fell i into the room ladder and all with no little noise  the loving couple were mightily surpised you may be sure and were in such a fright that they had forgot what they were a doing but i saw enough to convince me that my master was in a fair way to get to heaven purely upon my mistresss account  after our surprise was over and every thing put in order again between the gentleman and madam i ventured to tell her my errand she gave me the watch with a hearty good box on the ear and told me she wondered how i had the assurance to come up without knocking but added she i believe you rather came upon some knavish design and had intended to rob your master if i had not been in the room with my physician that came on purpose to see how i did  it was plain enough what physic she was taking yet i made my excuse to her that i went to remove the ladder and it fell out of my hand against the door and burst it open but i told her i was sorry i had disturbed her made my honors and walked off taking no notice that i had seen any thing i took water at billingsgate and followed my master  in the boat i began to ruminate with my self whether i had best keep this accident a secret or disclose it to my master at last with many pros and cons with my self i resolved to acquaint him with it partly to be revenged on my mistress for the blow she struck me and on the other side not to let my honest master be kept in ignorance of her usage of him  when i came on board the captain commanded me with my masters leave to sit down at table with em we dined heartily the wine and punch went merrily round and my master the captain with two more that were passengers began to be in high mirth when word was brought that the captains lady as the messenger called her would be on board in an hour to take her leave of him my master upon this message began to be merry with the captain i wonder said he that you seafaring men will venture upon wives why so replied the captain why so returned my master because in my opinion it should put you in mind of cuckoldspoint as you went by water your absence gives em such a convenience that i believe few let slip the opportunity why answered the captain may not your wife even now be doing you the favor has she not time enough do you imagine the things soon done and if they have an inclination watching and restraint will do no good many an alderman has been cornuted while upon change and i knew a parsons wife that seldom went to church but took time by the forelock and while the husband good man was taking care of his flock the good woman at home was at her occupation with her gallant a rich young farmer but the parson one afternoon being taken suddenly ill with a giddiness in his head was conveyed home before he had begun his work and there soon found the occasion of his pain for he had been breeding horns as children breed teeth a little unkindly but however the parson having witnesses enough of his promotion in the herd of cuckolds went to law with the farmer and recovered  00 l damages and yet he has been heard often to say that his wifes tenement was never the worse  this story occasioned some other much to the same purpose at last my master and i the tide being turned took our leaves of the company and wished em a good voyage coming by cuckoldspoint my master cried robin why dont you pull off your hat to the gentleman in the window yonder i pulled off my hat very orderly but saw no body at which my master fell into a great fit of laughter and cried i had been very courteous to the horns i then understanding his meaning told him that it was only for married men to show their complaisance that way and being a little piqud at the affront i thought put upon me said i believed most married men were or would be in the list of cuckolds why how now sirrah replied my master do you think i am or shall be a cuckold why truly said i sir i have but little reason to believe my mistress a saint more than any other woman and to inform you farther of what i have seen to day i beg you would be pleased to go to some public house that we may not be observed by the watermen my masters color began to change upon this and being very impatient to be informed of what i knew ordered the waterman to land at ratcliffcross and wait a while  we went to the ship tavern and had a private room where i declared to him the whole truth after many questions and answers between us i soon found he believed all that i told him for he turned as pale as ashes and the tears stood in his eyes i then was sorry i had disclosed it to him remembering the inimitable shakespeare he that is robbed not wanting what is stole let him not know it and he is not robbed at all after some time being silent my master broke into many extravagant words and threatening actions and at last i ventured to tell him i thought him in the wrong to grieve at what could not be called back and i wondered the world should unjustly cast upon the man the ignominy which was properly due to the woman for her licentiousness  after some time he began to be more calm and made me this compliment robin said he i have observed in thee a more than common understanding prythee tell me in what manner i shall behave my self in this affait i thank you sir said i for your good opinion of me and were it my own case i would not take any notice of it till i found her in the fact or such circumstances that even she her self could not deny and for these two reasons   whenever it comes to an open rupture you will have but an uneasy living and   that she may take it into her head to deny it and then the whole weight of her anger will fall upon me and truly said i i have too much of her ill nature already to bear any more with any manner of patience  my master resolved to follow my counsel and intended to make his wife believe he knew nothing of the matter  my master could not imagine who this gallant should be by my description for i had never seen him before we went to our boat and so home when we came in my mistress asked my master if robin meaning me had been telling him any stories stories child answered my master what stories he has told me nothing nay no great matter said my mistress but i gave him a box on the ear this morning when he came back for the watch you had forgot and i did not know but he had made some complaint but i am sorry for it and will make him amends one time or other this she said so loud that i might hear  the next day when my master was gone to change she came up into the workhouse as we called it up three pair of stairs and took an occasion of sending my fellowprentice on some concerted errand when he was gone out she sat down upon his chair and looked me in the face for some time well robin said she i am very much obliged to you that you did not take any notice of the accident that happened yesterday to your master and to make you amends for your silence i give you this broad piece to buy you a pair of gloves with this promise that you and i will never disagree again i received her money and told her i should never take any farther notice of it she called me good lad and left me  my master had not always an opportunity of talking with me at home so he appointed me every sunday after sermon in the evening at some tavern or other that we might talk about the matter at our first meeting i told him the story of the broad piece and the discourse my mistress and i had together i showed him the money and he soon knew the piece to be his wifes from the particular fairness of it being the same he had some time ago given her for a pocketpiece  now said he robin i am fully convinced of the infidelity of my wife for notwithstanding your former story i had some faint hopes it might have been a tale of thine raised out of malice to thy mistress from her indifferent usage of thee  but now to find out this spark that i may reak my vengeance on him first for to own my folly robin i must tell thee i cannot find i shall ever be able to hate this ungrateful woman some time after my master was pretty well convinced that his wife had been with her spark to the mulberrygarden and my master had discovered who he was he proved to be a young attorney of cliffordsinn the next thing we consulted about at our weekly meeting was how to give em an opportunity of pursuing their amor at home in order to this my master gave out to my mistress that he should be obliged to go as far as st margarets in kent to look after some goods that were landed there in order to avoid paying custom for them and he feared the affair would not be so well managed if he was not present  the tuesday following was chose for the day of his setting out my master gave me public orders to go to several places in his absence to look after the workmen for there are several trades belonging to the making of a watch on tuesday morning my master got on horseback in order as my mistress and the rest of the family thought to pursue his journey but he went no farther than islington and returned putting up his horse again and went strait to the place of our rendezvous  as soon as my master was gone my mistress called me up to her and asked me if i had time to step a little way for her i told her twas impossible being i had some work to finish that i was obliged to carry out immediately then she begged i would call her a porter which i did and one of my particular acquaintance one well to pass in the world for a city porter in those days was a very beneficial employment there being then no pennypostoffice i told him what he should do that he must go to my mistress and receive the letter and then to an adjacent alehouse and wait till i came to him accordingly he received the letter and went to the place i appointed i did not let him wait long but ordered my matters as if i was going about my masters business and went to the porter from thence i took him along with me to my master where we opened the letter and found it as follows  dear tom it is an age since last i saw you the cuckolds gone out of town for a week therefore meet me at the old place by six this evening here we were at a stand for we could not imagine where the old place was unless the mulberrygarden at last we resolved to send the porter to the spark and bring the answer to us to see if that would give us more light in the affair accordingly he went and returned with his billet we made bold to open it and found it contained these words  my life i dont think the old place convenient being a brother lawyer has discovered something of our intrigue therefore i will wait on you before the time that we may concert measures accordingly i am glad your beast is out of town well add another antler to adorn his brow as soon as i have the happiness to see her who shall eternally command yours   when my master perceived that the scene was to be opened at his own house he began to demur but after keeping silence a little time he spoke to me to this purpose robin this letter has in some sort confounded our design for what i intend to act i would not if it could be avoided put in execution at home for fear it should make too much noise for added he smiling though a man has the misfortune to be a cuckold yet he would not have all the world know it i told him i was glad to see him so merry upon the occasion but begged he would not keep the porter any longer for fear of some accident he thanked me for my care sealed up the letter again and sent him away with it when the porter was gone my master ordered me to go home again and observe how matters went there and as soon as ever the spark came to send the same porter back to him with this notice that the work was ready to carry home whenever i thought fit  i had not been at home a quarter of an hour ere my gentleman came in a coach he went up stairs but did not stay a moment came down again whispered the coachman and drove into cheapside i was at a loss how to behave my self but my mistress ordered another coach to be called when i found that i sent for the porter and told him secretly that he must dog that coach let it go where it would and be expeditious in bringing me word my mistress came down in her hood and mask in her hand and went off in the coach i looked after her as far as i could see her and obserd the porter to jump up behind the coach i immediately went to my master and acquainted him with the business he hurried me home again for fear the porter should wait for me and ordered me to bring him when he came to the popeshead tavern because he would be nearer home  the porter did not return in two hours he told me that the coach drove to york stairs in york buildings and there they got out and took a pair of oars he went in another and followed em till they landed at lambeth and dogged them into the whitelyon inn there he staid some time to see if they intended to go from thence he walked into the kitchen and drank a mug of ale and in a little time one of the waiters came in and told the cook the gentleman and his wife had bespoke a roasted fowl and some fish for their dinner and had ordered clean sheets to be put to air for as soon as they had dined they designed to go to bed being the stage coach was to call them up at one the next morning  i did not think it altogether so proper to take the porter to the popeshead to my master but went alone where i found him with another gentleman a stranger to me when i had given him an account we took coach all together and drove to the horseferry westminster took boat and landed at lambeth we all went into the whitelyon the back way and i went to the drawer as we had before concerted and asked if there was not a gentleman and a lady that did design to lie there all night to wait for a stage coach in the morning he answered in the affirmative but added they were that moment gone to bed that they might be the better able to rise in the morning i asked him which room they lay in for that i had business of great consequence to communicate to him why that room up one pair of stairs answered the drawer and pointed at the door well said i fetch me a pint of wine i will drink a glass and then go and wait on them  the drawer ran down for the wine and in the mean time i beckoned my master up stairs we went i set my foot against the door burst it open and there we soon perceived the loving couple playing at rantum scantum i shut to the door again and stood guard that no one should enter my master laid fast hold of my naked gentleman and with the assistance of his friend threw him upon his back clapped a pistol to his breast and swore he would shoot him if he offered to stir or cry out then my masters friend took out a box of instruments and with a pair of scissars for that purpose soon deprived him of what senesino and several italian singers want as well as our spark the thing was done so suddenly that i believe my gentleman hardly knew his loss till he felt the blood trickle about his legs he made several attempts to get up but to no purpose my master told him he had better be quiet for fear he should be worse served but in my opinion that could hardly be the surgeon for it proved my masters friend was no other had all his implements about him he managed his needle his plasters and salves and finished my gentleman and would have had him gone home something lighter than he came but he proved so weak with loss of blood and the pain together that he fainted away  my mistress had hid herself behind the curtain and did not so much as say one word but in all her concern she took care to dress her self and when she had done she sat upon the bedside next the wall and seemed to be in deep discontent  we had got my gentleman to himself again by the help of the drawer who soon found how matters went when we had done my master said to his wife madam i must confess i was to blame to disturb you in your diversion but i own my fault and will endeavor to mend it by leaving you together to solace your selves and so i take my leave  upon this we marched down stairs paid for our wine and went to our boat that waited for us and landed at the stillyard my master was very uneasy all the way home and we could not get one word out of him he went up stairs locked himself in his room and remained alone several hours i would have been willing to have diverted his melancholy but did not well know how i should go about it  near seven a clock in the evening he called me up stairs and asked me if i had heard any thing of his wife i told him no nay said he if she has any shame left she will hardly attempt to come home again in haste after some time he went out and did not come home again till twelve a clock he asked me still after my mistress and understanding we had no news of her went to bed  the next morning he ordered me to send the porter to lambeth to learn how they behaved themselvos when we had left em he returned and told my master that the gentlewoman went away as soon as she found we were gone and left the gentleman there who was so weak that he remained there still and had sent for several of his acquaintance  in the afternoon my mistresss mother came to my master and they had a long discourse and afterward went out together but i was never more surpised in my life when he came home the same evening with his wife and mother he vouchsafed to tell me the next day that his wife resolved never to be guilty of any fault again and by her submission and the entreaties of her mother he had resolved to take her home once more sir said i if you can forgive her no one else has any thing to do with it but added i i fear i shall feel the effects of her displeasure no answered my master that was one of my conditions with your mistress that she should take no notice to you of past transactions and truly she kept her word for she would not so much as look at me  she continued very reserved for a great while and never went out but to church of a sunday  in the latter end of the same year my master began to be out of order and the physician advised him to go into the country for the air and accordingly he took lodgings at hampstead where my mistress used to go twice or thrice every week to see him and my master told me when i went of a sunday to wait upon him to give him an account of the business of the shop that his wife had been so tender of him in his illness that he verily believed he should never have any occasion to blame her conduct again i told him i was as well pleased as he was  about a week afterward my mistress went in and out very often and feemd to be very busy giving orders to my fellowprentice for taking her a place in the hampstead coach as usual this happened on the tuesday and i saw her no more that week  when i went to my master on the sunday following he asked me if my mistress was out of order being he had not seen her since the monday last nor i since tuesday said i but i thought she had been with you for she took a place in the coach in order to come to you that day and sent out several bundles to be carried as she usually did when she was coming to wait on you  my master was so confounded with what i told him that he did not offer to speak for some time and the sweat ran down his face like drops of rain at last said he robin i fear all is not well my wife has certainly undone me come hope for the best said i  well my master resolved weak as he was to go for london immediately we took a coach and soon got home and there to our great sorrow found my mistress had robbed my master to the value of five thousand pound in bank notes and money with six and thirty gold watches and seventeen silver ones besides her own wearing clothes my master at this loss sunk down upon his bed i went and fetched some of his neighbors and friends to comfort him while i ran up and down like a madman to see if i could get any tidings of the thief  i went to give orders at the bank to stop payment but to my great sorrow found the money had been received four days before i came back to acquaint my master with my ill success and found him alone and gone to bed when i told him i could not hear any tidings of my mistress and that the money had been received he cried robin it is not the money that grieves me but the ill usage of my wife it is that has got to my heart and never to be removed till death i sat up with him a great while till he told me he began to be sleepy and ordered me to retire but as i was going from him he took me by the hand and bid me good night i found by his pulse that he was in a fever and begged i might call a physician but he said he should be better on the morning if not he would send for one finding him willing to rest i left him and went to bed  as soon as i waked in the morning i put on my gown and went to see how he did but found him so weak and faint that he had not strength enough to lift up his head i was immediately running to fetch a physician that lived hard by our house but my master called me back and told me it was too late for said he i feel my last moment approaching he ordered me to sit upon the bed by him he took my hand in his which burnt like fire and said robin my wife has killed me i could have born any other misfortune with temper if thou ever should see her tell her from me that i forgive her and that i beg she would reform her life but also let her know that she was the death of me i told him i would not have him talk of dying for an ungrateful woman that did not deserve the least regard but to cheer up his spirits and let me go for a physician no said he all physic or counsel comes too late  i have that within which baffles all their art sure means to make the soul and body part a burning fever and a broken heart he had no sooner repeated those lines but his speech failed him his eyes closed and he expired only with a sigh  i must confess i was inwardly shocked and the spirit of revenge rose in my soul against the barbarous cause of his end  when i had a little recollected my scattered thoughts i went to a cousin of my masters that lived in cheapside and desired he would come and take care of his affairs for my own part i could not compose my self for two or three days at last i went to my uncle and desired he would let me have twenty pounds to buy me mourning for i did intend to wear black that my melancholy outside might conform with what i felt within out of respect to my masters memory mourning bob answered my uncle why if thy masters friends will not give it thee it is my opinion thou ought not to think on it yes sir added i i think it my duty for though my mistress used me ill my master always was civil to me but my uncle told me in plain terms that i should not have a farthing i told him i wanted but my own but he replied when he thought i was of years enough to manage my money my self perhaps i might be trusted with it but at present he would take care of it for me  i was very uneasy at this affair for it began to look as if he intended to cheat me of it and i did not stick to tell him my sentiments in a civil manner but to no purpose i left him with a very heavy heart and came home i went to bed in the utmost confusion of thought yet notwithstanding my discontent slept till morning i got up about six aclock with a scurvy idea of my future fortune about eight my uncles man brought me a letter from him in which he begged my pardon and told me it was only to try my temper the man gave me ten guineas by his order and farther told me that his tailor would be with me immediately to take my directions and accordingly before the fellow was gone he came took measure of me and told me he would be sure to bring my clothes home by twelve aclock the next day and he kept his word with me  in the mean time i had provided my self with every thing else with the money my uncle had sent me and the same evening waited on him to return him thanks bob said he i had only a mind to try your temper and i find thou art fathers own child a chip of the old block  he would have me stay to sup with him and among other discourse he asked me what i did intend to do now my master was dead for he did not suppose i was master of my trade enough to follow it i replied i knew enough to recommend my self to any other master without paying any more money my uncle replied i needed not be in such haste but take some time to consider of it and in the mean while i should live with him and be heartily welcome and to make his actions agree with his words he gave me five guineas more for pocketmoney and gave directions for me to be with one of his clerks a goodnatured young fellow that was a schoolfellow of mine  i was very glad of the occasion living with my uncle in great tranquillity the space of a month and all the time he seemed to be very fond of me never denying me any thing that i asked him  one sunday morning before churchtime he called me to him and after many professions of friendship asked me if i had never done any business for my master out of the watchmaking trade i pretty well guessed at what he meant and answered him in the affirmative very well said he i must send you as far as gravesend tomorrow about the same affair and if i executed my commission dexterously he told me it should be the better for me  the next morning i got up and my uncle sent me with a letter into pall mall to a client of his and returning with an answer found him taking his leave of a gentleman that looked like a seaofficer as soon as their compliments were over my uncle dispatched me away to billingsgate and gave me instructions what to do i was to enquire for a ship called the success capt stokes commander at gravesend and then to follow his directions  as i was talking with my uncle my bedfellow thrust a book into my pocket and told me that would divert me in the boat if i had not company that i liked i did not much regard what he said but went about my business got into the gravesend boat which put off upon the instant and had the fortune to light of good company and one young man that was going to the same ship as i was  we were very merry all the way with little stories we told among our selves we got on board the success about two aclock in the afternoon and the first person i saw was the same man that i found with my uncle in the morning he took me by the hand and carried me into the cabin and set a piece of ship beef before me when i had dined he informed me my things would be on board immediately i told him it was very well not suspecting any thing afterward the captain went out and left me alone in the cabin i got up and looking out of the cabin window found the ship was under sail at first i began to be surpised but yet was so ignorant that i thought we were sailing up the river while i was ruminating on the matter the captain came and told me my things were ready for me whenever i would i went out but how was i surpised when i saw my trunk that i left at my uncles with all my clothes in it i was in such confusion that i had not power to utter one word for some time at last recovering out of my surprise i asked him the meaning of what i saw meaning child replied the captain why what is the matter would you go such a voyage as we are upon without necessaries what voyage returned i why to virginia replied the captain at that answer i sat me down upon my chest and burst into tears and had such a combat in my mind that bereaved me of the power even of thinking for some time the captain indeed did all he could to comfort me at last i fancied it might be only a jest but to my sorrow found by all their discourse it was but too much in earnest  the captain declared that my uncle had bargained with him for my passage and that i was to be delivered to a relation i had in charlestown upon the continent of america i asked he name but he told me one that i had never heard of before  when i found i was certainly betrayed by my arbarous uncle i fell upon my knees and begged the captain to put me on shore and i would find some means to pay the sum he was to have for my passage he answered he was too well paid already to let me go on shore again and further added i had nothing to do but to make my self easy for i was not likely to set my foot in europe till i had first seen america  i found it was to no purpose to entreat any further it is true i had no aversion for the sea but rather an inclination and if my uncle had made any proposals to me concerning such a voyage and properly prepared it is ten to one if i had not accepted it but in this manner to be kidnappd for it was no better and then the dread of being parted with as a slave when i came thither shocked me prodigiously but being naturally of an easy temper eight or ten days pretty well wore off my apprehensions and i began to be contented with my wretched fate i set my self with all my diligence to learn the mathematics as also the work of a sailor and quickly attained to some knowledge i soon ingratiated my self with most of the crew who instructed me in all they knew  i mentioned a book my uncles clerk put in my pocket as i left the chambers that morning i was trepanned which for the first three or four days i did not remember but putting my hand in my pocket to feel for something else i took it out and found in it a letter directed for me which was as follows  dear bob when you went to st jamess this morning supposing i would have read it the day i received it i overheard my master discoursin with a captain of a ship and i learnt that h intends to send you to virginia i could not understand the particulars but enough to know the bargain is made my friendship to you and the barbarity of your uncle obliges me to give you this i hope timely notice i shall leave the management to you but whatever steps you take i am not to be in the question and i thought of this way to acquaint you with it fearing i should not have the opportunity of speaking to you farewell till i see you again which i hope in god will not be long  a m   this letter made me curse my fate again for if i had had the good fortune to have read it before i was on shipboard i might have prevented my uncles design but it was my destiny and therefore i submitted to it  we met with nothing in our voyage till we came near the canaries when one evening we heard several cannons fired as we supposed two leagues from us our captain altered his course in order to avoid a rencounter with an enemy for our ship carried but ten guns and twenty men besides passengers but notwithstanding the captains care as soon as ever the morning dawned and the fog was cleared up we found our selves within half a mile of a rover of barbary we were all mightily surpised for the gally made up to us with sails and oars being to windward of us our captain advised us to surrender immediately but the sailors were for fighting and were confirmed in their opinion upon sight of another vessel bearing down upon us whom they knew to be spanish by her colors all our guns were immediately brought to the starboard side and every body ready to engage passengers and all who were willing to preserve their liberty  the rover by this time was just upon the starboard bow and prepared to board us we had some hand grenades on board with several other stores for our fort at charlestown and a gunner as one of our passengers he ordered several men into our maintop with grenades and followed himself and as soon as ever the gally came near enough our men at the helm bore away and fired our guns upon him which raked em fore and aft and did much execution our gunner above in the top threw in upon them with his grenades which we could perceive put them into much confusion but all this would not have availed if they had not perceived the spanish man of war bearing upon us they did not make any farther attempts to board us but they fired their cannon and gauld us with their small arms  i had gotten a musket on board and had discharged it as i thought for it flashed in the pan and the noise of the other pieces deceived me i charged again but then found by the rammer that my piece had not gone off however i was resolved to fire it i stood upon the larboard gunnel just upon the forecastle to be as far from the enemy as i could and fired my piece but being double charged and a stubborn jade gave me such a bang that threw me over the side of our ship my foot hung in the fore change for some time but struggling with my head downwards to raise my self up my foot disentangled and i fell plum into the sea  although i had learnt to swim in england yet the fright the smoke and all together took away my understanding and i found by my struggling that i had got within ten yards of the rover and she that instant bearing away before the wind they did me the favor to stun me with a stroke of one of their oars and took me on board them  they rowed with all their strength and the wind being in their stern they insensibly left the success who flatted their sails and laid by till the spanish ship came up with her and then we could perceive em both making after the rover  the captain of the corsair was an irish renegado and as soon as he was out of danger he sent for me into the cabin and asked me several questions concerning our ship where she was bound and who i was for he took me for more than a common sailor being i was not in a sailors habit i told him my story as i have related in the foregoing sheets he shook his head and with a smile said i was very ready at a lie sir said i i am so far from lying that i jumped overboard on purpose to come to your vessel rather than to stay with them choosing to be a slave nearer home than to go i dont know where with the knave that trepanned me and to convince your honor of the truth for i honored him much here is the letter which my uncles clerk slipped into my pocket in a book for by good fortune i had the letter and book in my pocket when i fell overboard at reading the letter he was convinced he said of my sincerity and thou shall see added he notwithstanding the bad opinion is held of us renegados that you shall fare the better for your confidence in us sir returned i this accident may convince you that i thought very well of your honor for as soon as i saw your honor upon deck giving command i thought you had the look of a gentleman though by the by he had a damned tyburn face  i clarkt him up so well with your honor that he began to fancy himself a hero indeed he ordered my chains to be taken off for they had done me the favor to provide me some as soon as ever they had got me on board and told me that if i would turn mohammedan i should have command under him i answered him i hoped he would give me some time to consider of it ay ay time thou shall have half a years time to consider of it returned the captain he carried me out upon deck and told my story to his crew who were mightily pleased with the relation and saluted me after the moorish manner by bowing their heads and clapping their hands across upon their breasts  there were several other english renegados that were officers in the galley but most of the common sailors were natural moors the captain told me that he did design to make for sallee with all the expedition he could for he had engaged with a spanish man of war the night before and had suffered very much in both his vessel and crew but he told me he would soon be out again for he had another vessel ready in sallee road to put out to sea we had before night lost sight of the success and spanish man of war that had so luckily freed her from the infidels clutches and we steered for sallee  ten days after we discovered the african shore within five leagues west of sallee road and the wind favoring us we anchored in the harbor by six in the evening the captain went ashore but ordered me to remain on board till the next day  i must confess i began to have some hopes of seeing my own country again but yet did not know how to bring it about however i resolved to trust providence  the next morning my master sent for me on shore by a young renegado sailor born at london whose christian name i learnt was francis corbet but had exchanged it for mustapha a good intelligent young fellow and one that was a perfect master of the mathematics the reason why he did not accompany the captain in this voyage was a violent fever when he set sail i asked him why he could forget the savior of the world to turn mohammedan he told me that he was only one from the teeth outward and he thought it better to trust god with his soul than those barbarous wretches with his body i thought it was a pretty free declaration to one that was an utter stranger to him  as soon as we were landed i had the whole town of sallee staring at me for the captain of the rover had taken care to spread my story among em and i had as much respect shown me by the people of the town as he had he took me home to his own house and used me with much civility for a week or ten days during that time he had carried me twice or thrice to his country house about six miles up the river it was a very pleasant place situated in a little wood with the river running round it and no approaching to it but over a drawbridge at this house his wives lived for i was informed he had several  observing his garden i told him it was but indifferently kept he answered it was for want of a gardener none of his slaves understanding that art i offered him my service but told him i did not pretend to be a gardener but i was assured i could soon make amendment to it with the help of some of his servants he ordered me to take as many as i thought fit and added he because i am impatient to see it in a better condition i will leave you here i told him i begged to be excused now because i should want several things for my designs if it be tools said he or seeds of all sorts i have em here upon which he carried me into a little house meant for a greenhouse where i found every thing that was wanting with a large quantity of european seeds and roots i told him i was satisfied there was every thing that i should want the captain ordered me a bed to be made in the greenhouse and an old eunuch that understood french very well to wait on me with a strict order that i should have every thing i asked for but i was not to approach the house in his absence upon any account i told him i had no curiosity that way and did not doubt but i should show him something that would please him the next time he came which was to be in  0 days  as soon as he was gone i went to work for gardening was what i always took delight in both theoric and practic  i drew out plans ordered my workmen and in six days time brought it into some form i perceived in the middle of the garden a puddle of water which i gave directions to be drained and found that it had been formerly a fountain but was only choked up with filth by neglect i asked the old eunuch if he had ever known it to play and he answered in the negative neither did they imagine it to be any such thing for his master had bought the estate of an old spanish renegado four years before and he told him it had been a fish pond i examined about the river and found the head of the pipes stopped with rubbish which i cleared and by degrees the water worked through into the fountain and out again through another conveyance i observed that there had been figures upon it by the pipes i asked my eunuch if he had ever seen any such things he told me there were several lying in a back yard on the other side the house i went with him and found four small figures of tritons and a neptune in his chariot drawn by seahorses i ordered them to be brought to the fountain and fixed them on first stopping the water and then letting it loose again finished my fountain which played admirably out of the shells of the tritons which they seemed to blow with from the nostrils of the horses and the trident of the neptune the workmen were astonished to see with what expedition i had completed it and imagined i had dealt with the devil the next morning the eunuch came to me before i was up and desired i would give him the key of my chamber and be contented to be a prisoner till he came to me again i was a little surpised and asked him the reason he told me he could not give me any being it was beyond his commission accordingly he locked me in and went away i began to ruminate about this accident but could not imagine the cause i had no way to look out toward the garden being the windows of the greenhouse looked over the river into the wood and the back which frontted the house had only painted windows for ornament not use in about two hours my eunuch came and released me and we dined together i used all the rhetoric i was master of to find out the secret but to no purpose he only added that i must be in the same condition again the next morning this was still more surprising and i began to think by degrees i should entirely lose my liberty the old eunuch imagining my thoughts assured me there was no harm meant to me this afternoon was my last days work and in three days more i expected the captain about an hour before night i perceived another eunuch of the house talking earnestly with him that used to attend me who immediately came to me and told me he must beg me to retire to my chamber that instant upon which i readily obeyed knowing it was to no purpose to contend  i was upon the tenters to know the reason of my confinement whilst i was employing my thoughts about it i heard the voices of women it surpised me at first but i soon sound that was the reason of my being made a prisoner when the eunuch came to bring me my supper i told him he need not have made such a secret of what i was locked up for for i had found it out and then told him that i had heard womens voices in the garden did you said he surpised i will take care they shall keep their tongues within their teeth for the future he said no more but immediately went out and soon returned and told me i should hear no more of them i was confounded with this odd proceeding and my curiosity began to be more and more raised  when i was left alone i began to examine my room where i was to see if i could find ever a peephole and by good fortune found one made by time and ill weather under the penthouse i upon the instant of my discovery made all the use i could of it and soon perceived three women in the walk with their backs toward me they were in a turkish undress with their necks bare one of them above the rest seemed to me to have a better shape and air than commonly the women of morocco have i dont know what came over me but i seemed impatiently to expect their nearer approach at last my desires were answered for as soon as they had spent some time at my new fountain they directed their steps toward my confinement and when they were near enough i could distinguish them to be three handsome women but one of em that seemed to be very melancholy surpassed the other two at least in my opinion she seemed to be about twenty fair to a miracle and much like an englishwoman she did not seem to converse with the other two but followed them with an air of contemplation and i could observe her sigh often i never till this moment had the least regard to any of the female sex no more than good manners and decency required but i found my self in a moment full of aching tenderness for this strange woman though i had no time for thought till the ladies were retired i then began to reason with my self and found love like destiny was not to be avoided and the more i thought the more i was plunged in this tormenting yet pleasing passion yet i thought it was very odd to fall in love considering my circumstances i had nothing to hope and all to fear i was poor a prisoner and a stranger far from my native country in want even of necessaries and to complete my misery sunk in one hour an age in love every new thought seemed a thorn to torment me yet notwithstanding all these difficulties a beam of hope would now and then shine through the thick clouds of despair and encourage me to love on from this thought i began to think with reason if a lover can be called a reasonable creature how i should manage my passion i began to reflect the moors were jealous of their women even to a degree and did not in the least doubt but my irish renegado had learnt that part of their manners at last i pitched upon an odd expedient i determined to show to my captain an utter detestation of all females and in truth the usage my poor master met with from his wife very much lessened the regard i owed the sex and try what that would do this thought seemed to give me some satisfaction and as soon as the eunuch came to release me i begged he would sup with me that evening he accordingly promised me and came immediately with my supper and brought under his garment a bottle of excellent greek wine i must confess i was surpised and pleased for as i knew the moors are restrained from wine i did not expect any there the eunuch told me smiling that he had brought that cordial to make me amends for the loss of my liberty for though added he mussulmen are not allowed to drink wine we very well know you europeans seldom eat without it and our master meaning the captain is not so strict a mussulman but he drinks much himself and procures privately great quantities for his own use i told him i thought mahomet ordered his followers to abstain from wine because an immoderate use of it generally turned to immoderate passions but to take it sparingly gave health and vigor to the body and cheerfulness to the spirits he agreed with me in my sentiments and showed he approved of them by drinking to me notwithstanding my endeavors to hide the trouble of my spirit my kind eunuch took notice of a concern in my countenance and cheered me up with repeated glasses and imagining my confinement caused that alteration told me he would not have me take to heart the small abridgement of my liberty for as soon as his master arrived i should not be restrained any more for the cause would cease by the confinement of the ladies to their several apartments i told him with a seeming joy that i should be mightily pleased when that should happen for i abhorred the sight of them women were my utter aversion and had been from my infancy and that aversion was aggravated by the knowledge of their perfidy and i thought it the greatest curse could fall upon that noble creature man not to be born without them upon this i told him the story of my master and mistress and several extravagant tales of my own invention which painted that beautiful part of the creation in the color of the devil my companion praised me for slighting the sex and backed my stories with as many of his own knowledge between our familiar talk and our greek wine he began to be very loquacious he told me his master after the mode of the moors had several wives beside a captive that he had lately taken that seemed averse to his passion and all the rhetoric he was master of could not prevail he did not know he said what countrywoman she was but she spoke very good french i imagined this could be no other than that sweet creature i had seen i changed color but to put it off said a pox take all the sex dont let us talk of them any more i am afraid said he you love to converse with the men and that makes you slight the women i did not immediately understand him but he soon explained upon it and then i was no longer ignorant i told him it was of such a beastly nature that i was of opinion those persons that used it should be treated worse than beasts why replied he it is so common here that it is reckoned only a piece of gallantry well said i i hate that action even worse if it be possible than the sight of the female sex the old man and i parted like two friends but before he went i told him he need not give himself any great trouble to lock me in for the future for i would take care of my self well well said he and shook his head i believe i may trust you as soon as he was gone i went to bed not to sleep for i had thought enough about me to keep me waking i began to conceive a great deal of hopes from my dissimulation i spent the whole night in thinking of a thousand expedients to forward my designs till i had thought of so many that they were all confused like a skein of silk pulled the wrong way at last with the fatigue of thought i fell asleep till sunrising nor awaked till i heard voices in the garden i ran immediately and barred my door on the inside for fear of being discovered at my peephole huddled on my clothes and ran up where i saw my lovely charmer reading in a book walking by her self in the alley that led to my prison the other women were got about the fountain admiring the playing of the water she drew nearer me but what was my pleasing surprise when i heard her repeat the following lines in english   my grief lies all within and those external manners of laments are meely shadows to the unseen grief that swells with silence in my tortured soul i must confess the transports i felt were beyond expression she had such a softness in her voice and yet so musical that it made my blood thrill through my veins in short during the time i beheld her i was in such an ecstasie that all my cares were forgot she turned up the walk again but i followed her with my longing eyes till she was out of sight i then turned them into my imagination and there beheld her still  i was convinced she was an english woman and kept in her restraint against her will i soon resolved with my self to find some expedient to let her know i would serve her all that lay in my power if she was disposed to accept it  i had staid so long fixed at my peephole that the old eunuch knocked at my door which soon roused me from my pleasing thoughts and put me upon another task which was to dissemble i suffered him to knock twice or thrice before i let him in at last i opened the door when he had called to me to give me to know who it was as soon as he was entered i began to exclaim against him in a friendly manner said i you promised me yesterday that i should not be troubled with the tongues of those female devils and i have been so plagued with them for an hour together that i was obliged to shut my door and run up stairs to be free from the sound he smiling told me the fumes of the wine which he drank overnight had drove it out of his thoughts but he would be sure to give them a caution to hold their tongues for the time to come but then added i i may be surpised by them when i little expect em no said he i will take care to send or bring you word when they are disposed to walk in the garden again i thanked him for his caution he told me he did design to come and dine with me that day for added he i shall not have another opportunity a great while for the captain has sent word he will be here tomorrow without fail accordingly he came with a roasted pheasant and some boiled rice attended with another bottle of greek wine  notwithstanding my new passion i eat and drank heartily but my eunuch got almost tipsey and the fumes of the wine getting up into his head he desired he might repose himself on my bed for a while which i granted him well knowing if he had been found out we might both have suffered for tasting the juice of the grape i had much rather he had gone within the house to have slept for i could not even think to the purpose while he was there but he soon got into a sound sleep which i found out by his snoreing i then ventured to take pen and ink and wrote the following lines  to the english lady madam i have observed your melancholy air and other circumstances speak you a prisoner here the person that writes this is your countryman and though in the same distress yet has a heart and hand to do you service i flatter my self it will one time or other be in my power to effect our liberty if you have no thoughts that way i am persuaded you have too much generosity to do one a prejudice that would venture any thing to serve you you know the consequence if this note should be discovered therefore i beg you would destroy it as soon as you have perused it and if you will favor me with an answer with your sentiments of what i have wrote you will find a string hanging on the north side of the garden house to which if you fix your letter i shall be ready to prevent discovery of what may hurt you and him whom you may freely command   i had not the convenience of sealingwax or wafer therefore i folded it up and directed it to the english lady when i had finished i began to have odd and confused notions of the success of it perhaps said i to my self she may be contented with her fortune or be afraid to hazard any attempt toward her liberty she may also imagine i am set on purpose to betray her and therefore to show her innocence may discover me to the captain i was in a hundred minds sometimes i resolved to burn the letter but at last love prevailed upon all my reasons to the contrary and i resolved to try the success of it the first opportunity  in reasoning with my self and writing my letter i had spent three hours and therefore i thought it high time to awake my eunuch who started up frighted out of his senses when he had recovered himself he thanked me for breaking his rest for he was assured he was wanted within and he nicked his time to a hair for before he was got half way the walk for i immediately got up to my peephole i saw the ladies at the farther end he talked to them some time and then left them to go into the house  they saunterd about the garden a good while till at last two of them sat down by the fountain and the english lady continued her walk toward my apartment now my blood ran its swift course and the whole frame of my body felt violent emotions i thought this was a fair opportunity and yet was fearful to make use on it but mustring all my spirits i ventured and when she was within twenty paces of the greenhouse i darted the letter and by good fortune it fell in the middle of the gravelwalk so that it was almost impossible to miss on it but had it happened otherwise i had time enough to run down and take it up before any one else could discover it she continued her walk and when she came at it she kicked it with her foot once or twice and at last took it up she was reading in a book as she was the day before i could perceive her open it and spread the note upon her book so that no one could tell but that she was reading it is not possible to express the anxiety i lay under all this while but i began to be a little more composed when i observed her tearing the letter into very small pieces and scattering them in several places of the garden she had not walked far but she returned and viewed the greenhouse with a great deal of regard and to my imagination wanted to come to the north side of it as mentioned in the note yet seemed fearful often looking back and not fully confirmed in her resolution at last went unwillingly to the rest of the ladies this gave me some hopes that she received the letter kindly and that i should hear from her soon  i observed she sat by the fountain very intent upon her book which did not much please me in about a quarter of an hour she got up and came toward the greenhouse again when i saw her coming i ran down stairs and fixed a packthread to the top of the window for fear if she should take courage and come to that side not seeing the packthread she might be startled and persuade her self there was nothing in it i had placed it and got to my peephole before she had reached the south side but coming close to the wall i could not see her by reason the smallness of the hole cut off my sight but in less than a minute i discovered her walking back again and sometimes turning to view the place of my retirement as soon as she had got to the top of the walk for i had not power to stir before i went down and pulling in the packthread found a piece of paper tied to it i untied it with a great deal of expectation and impatience and found these words wrote with a pencil upon a clean leaf of a book which i suppose she had torn from that she had been reading in  i was much surprised when i perused a note i found in the walk of the garden as believing it directed to me i confess i am a person in distress but know not how to take the word of a stranger and one i never saw who perhaps is no more than a spy upon my actions and what the note contained may be by order of him who pretends to tyrannize over me because i am in his power and seeks this way to find out my inclination for pretenses to use me worse therefore i will expect a farther assurance in half an hour from the same place and i will take an opportunity to convey my real sentiments back again  the joy i felt at reading this note cannot be expressed in words i sat me down and wrote the following answer  madam to tell you my motive to serve you may convince you of my sincerity which i will let alone till i have the favor of speaking to you if ever i am so happy you have heard no doubt of the person that the master of this house brought from sallee who is the same that is willing and proud to serve you by him that died upon the cross for our sins i am sincere in what i write to you and if i cannot serve you it will be the greatest grief can happen to one who shall ever be yours  r b   when i had wrote this i went to the usual place and saw my charmer very near me i threw it down as before she readily took it up and walked back again tearing the note when she had read it as she did the former and went into the house just as she was got within the gate the other eunuch came out not my friendly eunuch and as he was walking along i observed him picking up the pieces of the torn notes if any one had observed my countenance at this action they might have discovered the utmost confusion there i thought we were certainly undone and could not tell how to behave my self i sometimes repented of the affair but yet i always found my concern was more for her whom i loved than for my self as soon as he had picked up all he could find he returned with my hearty curse and wishes that he might be obliged to swallow them down his throat for a penance  i dont know when i should have recovered out of my fit of confusion if the sight of my bliss had not done it she went to the fountain sat her down upon the margin and spent some time there then rose and made to my apartment she took two or three turns with a book in her hand but at last went out of sight as before i staid till i saw her in the walks again and then ran down where i found another writ with ink as follows  i am convinced of your sincerity and shall wholly rely upon your endeavors to help me if we succeed and get our liberty i have it in my power to reward you when we arrive in england as we are two unhappy persons i should not be displeased to see the man that i own an obligation to even in his intention to serve me i have liberty enough i mean as far as my bounds and am not overclosely watched the captain who took me prisoner has hitherto used me very civilly and is only troublesome when he tells me he loves me i have kept him from being too violent by showing him a little civility sometimes but how long he will continue within the limits of modesty i cannot tell it is that makes me dread his presence and the sooner i am out of his power the sooner i shall breath the air of content which is the wish of  your humble servant   at the reading of this paper my heart ran oer with contentment and had it not been for he fear of what would happen about the pieces f the letter that were picked up by the cursed eunuch i should not have known how to have ontaind my transports but the thought of at like water on a fire dampt my joy i ast my time between hopes and fears till my unuch came to sup with me i had torn my etter into many pieces and had disposed of all e fragments that had any writing on it but wo or three small bits that were vacant of ords lay under feet as soon as ever my euuch spied them he picked them up and said  did not do well to tread upon paper for added e if achmat had seen you meaning the other unuch he would have been in a strange pason he has chid the lady that my master ought home last very severely for throwing pieces of paper about the garden well knowing it could be only she that had dont because the rest were all mahometans and know the virtue of it i asked the reason of all this bustle about a thing we europeans put to the most servile uses he told me with some entreaty at last that all true mussulmen have a great deal of regard for bits of paper because the name of god or their prophet may be wrote upon it and they have a tradition that when they are called out of purgatory at the day of judgment to be inhabitants of the everblessed mansions there will be no other way to come to their prophet mahomet but over a large redhot iron grate which they must walk over barefoot and therefore upon the instant as they are going to step upon the grate all the pieces of paper they have picked up during their residence in this world will run and place themselves of their own accord under their feet so that they will be enabled to get to their prophet without much difficulty this whimsical story set my heart a rest and we supped cheerfully emptied our flas of wine which held two quarts and took ou leaves i went to bed and felt such a calm i my mind that i did not lie long awake bu continued sleeping till ten aclock the next day i was surpised and vexed i had rested so long when i considered perhaps that i had lost sigh of my love i dressed my self and took a wal in the garden finding the coast clear as  thought the sun being pretty warm i retir to a little shade made by a few laurel trees but was much surpised to find her that was eve in my thoughts sitting under the shade in  thoughtful posture she turned her head at the noise i made in approaching her and was running away i plucked up with much ado courage enough to speak to her madam said i i would not have you be under any apprehension if i had known you had been here i would not have disturbed you i will only inform you that i am the person that has vowed to serve you to the utmost of my power sir answered she i am not at all displeased at this interview which is merely chance on the contrary i am pleased to see the person whom i once hope to be obliged to for my liberty and wish we could often meet that we might consult about the means madam answered i if you will condescend so far i dont doubt but to find opportunities enough i told her of my plot with the eunuch and i had some hopes it might produce something she approved of my design and my conduct hitherto she added that she would take hold of all opportunities to walk in the garden where i had informed her i could see her without being seen and so we parted for fear of being discovered she went into the house and i went back to my dwelling and in less than half an hour the captain arrived he came to fetch me to dinner and told me i had worked by magic or i could never have done what i did he told me he thought himself much obliged to me and that i should find it i answered him i was convinced it was but my duty to serve him with every thing in my power and that if he pleased i would make farther improvements he made me a great many compliments his way and declared he would leave it to my better judgment  by this time dinner was ready and i was ordered to sit down at table with him for though he had turned mohammedan yet he eat as we do in europe not on the ground upon carpets as the asiatics and africans do we had our dinner dressed after the english fashion and we drank plentifully of his greek wine he told me he had a dispensation from the mufty to drink wine and smiled i answered i believed the crime was pardonable by mahomet if it was drank with moderation for my part i dont think said i religion consists in castigation and penance and i am convinced that an upright man let him be jew turk or christian may find his way to heaven we had several discourses at dinner about religion but i soon discovered the captain knew very little of any and i am of the opinion there is very few of the renegados think of religion their motive to change is ease and interest but this is a digression  when dinner was over we walked in the garden and i showed the captain what improvements i had designed to make he approved of every thing i said and informed me that he had heard from mirza the eunuch my abhorrence of women but he advised me to keep my sentiments secret for when you abjure said he the moorish women will make you feel their resentments but it is odd continued he that one of your youth and make should take such an aversion to the female sex i told him i had very good reasons for my hatred and even my mother was odious to me though she brought me into the world well but added the captain time and a fair face may make great alterations i told him i was very well assured i should carry my resentment to the grave i fancy said he i have an english woman a slave of mine that i have lately taken would make you change your sentiments if you saw her sir answered i i would be willing to stand the trial to convince you of the contrary though i would as soon look upon a serpent with my will well said he i have not learnt the strictness of he moors in keeping women without being even or if i had your aversion to them would onvince me i have not much to fear he desired me to walk awhile in the garden and he would be with me again immediately upon this e left me and went into the house and reurnd in five minutes come said he i have ordered y women to walk in the garden and you and will abscond behind these laurels where we ay see them and not be seen we had not sat ong before we could perceive three women oming toward us the two first were very andsom a little inclining to fat one seemed to e about thirty and the other twenty one accoring to my guess and not so fair as our english women but the third was she i looked for all my circumspection could not avoid my feeling a udden flow of my blood rise into my face which my captain observed well said he when hey were walked out of hearing i have taken notice of your disorder and perceive your real aversion is unsurmountable which i am not sory for being it will add to your liberty i have o occasion to have you confined when they walk in the garden for i fancy added he laughng you will shun em fast enough just answered  as i would a creeping snake unless it were to estroy em and that the regard i have for you would prevent the last said the captain is your countrywoman one that i took in a ship my ast voyage but one bound for the island of zant i liked her so well that i refused her ransom that amounted to five hundred pounds and her charms have overcome me so much that  would willingly enjoy her with her own conent for compulsion palls the joy i have given er twenty days to consider on it and when that times expired if she will not consent i am resolved to force her  lord said i in a seeming passion how can you take such an extraordinary trouble for a thing that does not deserve the least regard if the rest of the world were of your mind said my captain the women would have but a scurvy time on it now it is to me amazing replied i that men should take pains live hard and run all hazards to come home and spend all the fruits of their labor on such trifles that perhaps have not the least tenderness for em especially in these hot counties where women are given to be amorous and yet have but one man to sometimes a dozen of them and more when perhaps a dozen men would hardly satisfy one woman why replied my captain that is the reason they are so strictly guarded we pretty well know what they expect now if i had not had this aversion to women i returned i have a secret without witchcraft to make a woman dote upon a man how said the captain have you such a secret if you will let me know it i will not only give you your liberty but amply reward you besides sir said i i thank you but as for disclosing the secret it is what i never can do yet it is in my power to prepare you a chemical liquid which put into white wind will do the business though it will take up a great deal of time and be very expensive as for the expense replied the captain i shall not value it but in how long time can it be done not under one hundred days after projection answered i upon this he paused some time a hundred days is a great while yet i think it is better to wait for her consent than to force her so far said i i think you are in the right and further added i you may continue her affection as long as you think fit by now and then adding some of the chemical drops into any liquid she shall drink after she has taken the first prescription  the captain seemed mightily pleased with my project and asked me what the charge would be i answered i feared it would be about two hundred pounds in this country though it would be much cheaper in england where the things that i should want were easier to be had but i told him i could not give a just account of the charge till i saw the prices of the things i should want i told him i was afraid i should find it a difficult thing to get a still for that was the first thing i should want he answered me he did not question but i should easily procure every thing i wanted for money and he would take care i should not stand in need of that he farther told me that several jews in sallee had all manner of drugs and he believed every thing else that i should want for fear of the worst i told him i should not want my drugs these fifty days though i should want the still immediately and liberty to go into the neighboring woods in the nightime being there were several herbs that i must gather by moonlight and when the moon was in its full in the increase or decrease according to the nature of the herb i wanted he told me i should have all the liberty i required not doubting i would make any wrong use of it i told him to be more secure he might send who he thought fit to guard me no returned he i will leave you to your self but you may take who you will with you of my servants if you want their assistance i told him i should stand in need of some of em sometimes well said he you shall go up with me and take what money you have occasion for so accordingly we went into a little closet where was a strong box which he opened and took out two hundred and fifty spanish pistoles said he if there is not enough you may have more i told him i was assured there was too much well said he well reckon after the affair is over and because it will be so long about i will even take another cruising voyage that i may not think the time tedious i was very glad to hear him say so because i should have the better opportunity to work my design though i dissembled my joy and told him i should be sorry for that for i should often have something or other to give the woman he designed me to work upon well said he mirza shall take your directions upon saying this he called mirza to us mirza said the captain you must observe this persons orders whatever he commands you to do you must obey with as much exactness as if you were serving of me this he told mirza in the moorish tongue but explained it to me in english mirza also told me in french the commission his master had given him and farther added he hoped i would often command him to visit the wine cellar i told him we would not want i advised the captain to let me go to town to enquire for the still as soon as possible and to be known to those people that sold the drugs why if you will replied the captain well go immediately upon which i consented he ordered a horse to be sadled for me and i went into the greenhouse to prepare my self and luckily for me i did for i found a note fixed to the string which my fair correspondent had taken opportunity of leaving when she walked in the garden by the captains order the contents were as follows  sir i take this opportunity to acquaint you that the tyrant captain is arrived and has given me twenty days to consent to his abominable love i hope you will believe me when i tell you it has almost taken away my senses the time i fear is too short for us to effect our laberty and if we do not succeed before the fatal day i shall be the most miserable wretch the earth contains let me hear from you and if you can give me the least glimpse of hope to lull my sorrows fail not to cheer the heart of  yours   how lucky was it for me to find this note it might have fell into the captains hands and then we had been in a fine condition i had time to write but a short answer which i threw on the ground and pulled in my string it was this hope every thing write no more till tomorrow i locked my door and took the key with me  when we were on horseback our chief discourse was concerning charms philtres and witchcraft i convinced him there was not any such thing in the world and my compound was the only thing that could do what was desired he asked me if i my self had ever tried the experiment i told him more than once and related the following tale to him off hand  there lived in our neighborhood a rich old man and very amorous but deformed to the last degree he was roundshoulderd broadfacd bleareyed shortnosed and his mouth as wide as his face was broad a pretty object as one should see this old gentleman fell in love with a very pretty woman a mercers daughter over against him but seemed to be the very offspring of pride and nothing less than a lord should be her husband being well assured her charms would conquer every one that looked upon her she could not bear the thoughts of the old gentleman and whenever he talked of his passion treated him so ill that he was almost distracted i went to visit him one day as i often used to do for before his lovefit he was wont to be very good company and would make as free with his deformity as any body else would do but i found him now in such a condition that i began to pity him i used all the arguments i was capable of to bring him to reason but it was the same thing as to stem a torrent at last i called to mind this elixir which i had never tried before this occasion i was pretty well convinced of its virtue from what i saw it was composed of though the chief ingredient is calcined gold  this wonderful arcanum was found out by an uncle of mine that had studied the secrets of nature sixty years when he was dying he called me to him and gave it me in writing with the most sacred conjuration that i should never reveal it nor cause it to be wrote till i thought my last hour near and to destroy that which he gave me in ten days for fear it should be found by accident and that ten days would be sufficient to imprint it in my memory i give it into your hands said my dying uncle because i find thy understanding exceeds thy years and thy aversion for women will never let thee make an ill use of the valuable secret and further added that the charge would deter me from doing it upon any slight occasion i took it from him with a sacred promise not to disclos it till on my deathbed for if my uncle had recovered i must have delivered it up to him again but he expired in half an hour  i so far pitied the old gentleman and also having a desire to try the experiment that i told him i had it in my power to make the lady as fond of him as love could wish if he would go to the charge he told me he did not value the expense but he had no faith in charms i convinced him at last went to work and accomplished my affair the quantity i made would serve a hundred years and i had a bottle in my trunk when i was trepanned aboard which if you had had the good fortune to have taken would have saved you time and money  when i had brought my old gentleman a bottle of my stuff he seemed even then to have little faith in it but i bad him have patience till the trial all he had to do was to convey about forty drops in a glass of white wind fasting that said he to me will be a difficult thing for i know she hates me neither will she stay in the company where i am however i told him i would do my endeavor to find an opportunity so i ordered him to keep a small bottle in his breeches pocket for it must be warmed naturally with the heat of the persons body that is to give it and in two or three days i prevailed upon a relation of mine to invite the lady to drink tea with her i acquainted my old lover that he should come in as by accident and bring a pint of white wind as a taste of a parcel he was to dispose of every thing happened as desired the old gentleman came in and got an opportunity of conveying some of the drops into a glass of wine and i had the satisfaction of seeing her drink it this passed off and we parted but the poor woman in less than ten days was distractedly in love with the old gentleman who took his opportunity enjoyed her and after despised her  now the nature of this elixir is that if the dose is not renewed every time the moon is in the full the object beloved will sink into dull indifference again  my captain told me he thought i might have made my fortune by such a secret i replied i had forgot to tell him that my uncle made that one of his articles that i should never sell a drop of it and i assured him i would always keep my promise  our story brought us to town and i was very much pleased for i was both tired in inventing lies to amuse him and riding after the moorish manner with ones knees almost to ones mouth and there is no altering the stirrups  we alighted at the captains house he sent about the town and in an hour bought a complete still he went with me to the jews that disposed of drugs and by good fortune and a good memory i remembered the names of a great many sorts i laid out some money then and told him i should want a great many other sorts and larger quantities of this jew i borrowed a crucible through the captains interest to melt the gold as i told him the things were ordered immediately to the country house the captain desired i would make no delay so i returned and got home just by sunset i immediately ran to my greenhouse to see if the piece of paper was there but i found it was gone this pleased me  i went to bed and rose early in the morning and seemed to be very busy about the garden i sent for my eunuch out of the house and told him what i had undertaken for the captain but i farther added if he did not now and then give me his company attended with a bottle of the juice of the grape i could not possibly go through with my undertaking he answered me smiling that he had orders from his master not to disobey me in any thing but added i i have a harder task than all this for i am compelled to have some discourse with the woman i am to work upon to find out her temper for according to her disposition i am to add or diminish several of my ingredients nothing could have prevailed upon me continued i to have undertaken this hateful task but the hopes i have of liberty for that is the agreement between the captain and me if i succeed in my design which i am in no doubt of i should be glad returned the eunuch you might meet with what you desire yet i should be sorry to lose your good company i shall with some regret answered i part with you but desire of liberty and indeed of revenging my self on my unkind uncle which is natural to us mortals will make me as expeditious as i can in my work i ordered him to let me have a couple of servants to go with me into the fields that night to carry the herbs i should gather and he told me they should attend me  i now began to think of acquainting the lady with some part of my design and therefore wrote her a note to this effect  madam i hope to have the honor of conversing with you without fear and even with the consent of your tyrant i have laid a scheme for our liberty that with the blessing of god i hope will succeed you will smile when i tell you i am to understand natural magic but i shall think nothing difficult if in the end i can serve one who may ever command  yours   in less than an hour i saw the ladies coming down the walk i ran immediately up to my peephole and observed the mistress of my heart sauntring the same way she used to go as soon as i had discovered her in the walks again i ran down and found a note in the room of mine at first i was uneasy imagining she had not taken mine away which contained to this purpose  i am something revived at your short sentence i found upon the ground yesterday i learnt your going to town with the captain by a discourse between achmat and mirza for i understand the morisco tongue enough to pick out the sense of what they say yet i had not ventured to write for fear my note should have miscarried if i had not seen you talking to mirza out of my window only consider my time is very short and if there is no other way to avoid the captain i must fly to death as my only refuge think of it and farewell let me have an answer the soonest for doubt and expectation are but lingering torments  i wrote her the following answer  madam i will write to you no more and beg the favor you would desist from giving your self any farther trouble i will have the pleasure of talking to you openly tomorrow and let you into the whole scheme i have laid for our liberty but let me beg you to be cheerful though reserved in your countenance when we meet for fear we should be observed   she came to the old place in an hour after she had brought the last with another note as she told me afterward but reading mine she did not leave it behind her  after my eunuch and i had dined i went into the neighboring wood with two of the captains slaves that were blacks i loaded them with herbs of several sorts any thing i could lay my hands on and ordered them to carry em into the garden i had taken care to tie every particular herb with a string so that there was no danger of mixing these i hung in bundles upon the branches of several trees in the garden and out we went again in short i gathered a good horseload of different sorts and some i laid upon the banks and others i covered with earth that it looked as if i was about business i could hardly forbear smiling sometimes when alone notwithstanding my anxiety for the success of my design to think how soon i drew in the credulous captain then i began to be in a thousand fears of his discovering my intention to some of the moorish physicians for though generally ignorant yet they would soon have found i was but an impostor  while i was amidst my fears the captain arrived whose sight gave me some trouble he came up to me looking about him at what i had done why this looks like work said he yes sir said i i am willing to begin that i may make an end the sooner but sir i must entreat one favor that you would not impart the secret to any one of your family but mirza nor to no one else upon any account whatsoever if they seem inquisitive tell em i am only distilling some simple waters for your closet i like your advice answered the captain and will be sure to follow it the reason of my coming down now was to take my leave of you for i design to set sail tomorrow morning early for i am informed of a rich vessel that will be in our latitude in ten days from a prisoner that is lately taken belonging to spain i cannot tell how long i shall be out but i hope by that time i come back i shall find every thing in readiness sir i returned i dont fear but to accomplish my design before you come back well said he do you think you shall want any thing else i told him nothing but now and then a gallon of sea water well said he i shall leave mustapha behind me in town who shall obey you in whatever you shall command well said he farewell and shook me by the hand i will just go in and give em a fresh charge concerning you and then to town again i was very glad to hear him say so and he was as good as his word for in half an hour he took horse he shook his hand at me as he went by me and i heartily wished it might be the last time we might see one another not as i could complain of my treatment for he had used me very handsomely and if it had not been in regard to the business of my love i should not have wished him ill  mirza came to me and told me his master had given em so strict a charge to observe my directions that if i had a mind to dispose of his estate twas his own fault for we must not disobey you yes answered i if ever you find me requiring any thing foreign to this affair i will give you leave to deny me but there is one thing i must command you since i have the power and that is to come and sup with me and bring some of the nectar along with you for i am really fatigued with stooping and walking in the sun when i gathered those herbs well returned mirza i believe i shall not find much difficulty in obeying your commands and i have one favor to beg of you which is that you will lay your injunctions on achmat that he may partake said i not today mirza another time with all my heart nay replied mirza it is not out of love to achmat that i desire it but that he may be as deep in sin as my self for if he should ever discover me i cannot tell the consequence well returned i well find an opportunity the hour of supper being come mirza arrived with a couple of flasks we eat and drank so heartily that mirza was incapable of helping himself but was so inebriated with wine that i began to repent of my plying him so fast i was forced to drag him and lay him on my bed but how to conceal it from achmat was my greatest care for i did not doubt but he would be wanted and accordingly it so fell out for about twelve aclock at night he came and knocked at my door i was up and thinking of my design i opened the door and understood by his signs that he wanted mirza i let him know by signs that i had sent him to gather me some herbs by moonlight he was satisfied and went back again now mirza kept the key of the gate so that my story was feazable enough  about four aclock in the morning mirza waked but frighted out of his wits to find it morning though i soon composed him by letting him understand how i had managed achmat he returned me a thousand thanks and told me he should never be able to make me amends i asked him how i should order it to see this woman for i could not go to work till i had conversed with her and yet by heaven and paradise said i i shall be more concerned at the interview than at any thing which ever happened to me and that was but truth for my mind was perplexed between hope and fear joy and anxiety i pity you indeed said mirza and i wish i could any way ease you of the trouble well said i then let her come alone into the garden as i am sprinkling my herbs by and by for i think one woman is enough to plague a man oh said mirza all men are not of your mind but i will leave you and hope to find you in better humor when i see you again  i had ordered a slave to bring me some water and a large quantity of salt to mix with it only to amuse em with this i sprinkled the herbs i had gathered and i was very busy about nothing  i saw presently after the idol of my soul and mirza running before her when he was near enough to me to be heard he said i must beg you to excuse my waiting on you for a little while for my not being in the house last night as usual has let my business so increase upon my hands that i must make use of all opportunities to regain lost time i told him i would not be his hindrance but was very sorry i could not have his presence upon this occasion for i should be in a very great dilemma he made me no answer being the lady was within hearing but returned into the house  as soon as the coast was clear i accosted her with a great deal of timerity madam said i the happy time is come that i may tell you without fear or danger how much you may command me sir returned she i am convinced of your sincere desire to serve me and as i have wrote to you in one of my notes if heaven prospers our wishes and we arrive safely in england i hope it will be in my power to reward you madam said i the success will amply reward me for all my trouble and as one climate gave us birth it is my duty to do all i can to serve you if i had no other motive but if you please let us consult now we have time by the forelock how we shall order our affairs sir replied the lady i am convinced your understanding wants not to be instructed and if you please i will be rulld by you in every thing madam said i have you any objection to be disguised in the habit of a man for added i we may so accomplish our liberty with more ease i have no objection to it answered the lady but how will you procure it please to leave that to me i returned and in less than ten days i hope we shall be out of danger i then informed her of the scheme i had laid which she mightily approved and told me she thought my understanding outwent my years i told her some accidents in life new edged our thoughts and if we succeeded the inspiration came from her i observed she blushed at my discourse yet did not look as if she took ll what i had said but i was much concerned to see her change the discourse i did not think t proper to declare my self any further hoping when i had affected her liberty gratitude would befriend me in her heart i observed by her conversation she had a large share of understanding and a happy turn of wit in short this nterview had fixed my heart entirely hers i had everal times thought of inquiring into her forune and how she was brought into her unhappy slavery but desisted till we had more leiure she told me she feared we should make ur conversation too long not said she with a look that shot through my heart as i am oppressed with your company but for fear we may be observed i told her i believed we should not have many more opportunities therefore i begged her to be ready in a few days to leave this hateful place she answered me that she would wait with some impatience my commands and any hour should find her in readiness she farther added that she wished she might be as ready and as willing at her last call i begged her to cast off all melancholy thoughts and trust to providence upon which we parted with this her answer that she was ever resigned to the will of heaven and whatever should happen she would do her endeavor to make her self easy even if it was the miscarriage of our design  when she was gone i soon found the sight of her increased my passion if it was possible for love like mine to suffer augmentation but it was love alone that worked miracles of old it was love that roused me from supine slavery for i must own once more if it had not been for this fated passion i should never have attempted any thing to regain my liberty but even my love slumberd now and then that industrious diligence might wake and i was resolved to put the design in execution with all the expedition imaginable for fear of accidents i went on amusing the house with variety of works for my preparation and i was continually ordering the slaves to town for one thing or other to strengthen their opinion  mirza came to me soon after at his approach i did my endeavor to put on a countenance with little satissaction of mind but i am apt to believe i did it but aukwardly for as the face is the index of the mind i am of opinion a person of nice judgment and observation may discover a false passion with as much ease as a jeweller would distinguish the different species of stones if we may call them so well said mirza your fiery trial is over but i perceive by your countenance your chagrine would willingly wear off if you would but suffer it why truly said i i have two different passions struggling in my mind that is joy and grief i am pleased to think i shall succeed in the affair i have undertaken and yet grieved that i must be compelled to suffer the torment i endure to help the operation consider the reward replied mirza that is to follow i changed the discourse that i might not be put to the trouble to speak against my conscience any longer i told him i should be obliged to go to town for salt water out of the sea and other necessaries that i should stay for why replied mirza you may send for salt water without being at the trouble of going your self i told him i was obliged to go in person because i was to take it out of the sea when the sun was in a particular altitude nay returned mirza i am only concerned upon my own account for i have engaged achmat to dine with you today with a great deal of trouble well returned i i will not disappoint you i will stay one day longer to oblige you he returned me many thanks for my condescension and went into the house to prepare things accordingly  all the while he was absent i was contriving my scheme when dinner was ready mirza brought it in accompanied with achmat he had taken care at several times to bring wine and had placed it in a vault in the greenhouse achmat made his moorish honors and we all sat down mirza begged i would call the wine a cordial that the captain had given me but i might have called it what name i would for achmat did not understand me for mirza was my interpreter and with much persuasion we prevailed upon him to taste it but when he had drank one glass he seemed to like it mightily and soon asked for another and in short plied his hand to his head so often that he was obliged to get up and played such pranks danced and sung and rolled about that it put us in a fright for fear some one should hear the noise he made which to remedy i made him drink more till at last he dropped down and fell asleep we laid him upon my bed and did not intend to disturb him  i told mirza now we had accomplished this great affair i had a mind to go to town even then for the sun shone and perhaps it might not the next day and i was willing to take the first favorable opportunity he told me what i pleased now the jobb was done accordingly horses and slaves were provided me and away i went for sallee when i came to town i found mustapha at home who congratulated me with the favor i had received from his master and farther added that he had given him full charge to obey me in whatever i should command i told him i should want his assistance immediately with a small boat only he and i and i begged him to take his quadrant with him for i should want his art a little we took the boat he had provided me and rowed out of the bay till we came to a small promontory where i desired him to take the elevation of the pole when he had so done we lavd water into a vessel we brought for that purpose and went home again from thence i went to the jews and begged he would furnish me with a moorish habit for my present wear for the people of the country do so stare at me said i being in a different dress from them that it makes me ashamed he provided me with a very handsome one which i had packed up carefully that no one should observe what it was i bought several trifles of him that i had no occasion for and at several times other rich habits but one thing particularly that i hoped i should want which was a pint of liquid laudanum  i went to mustapha and ordered my things to be got ready while that was doing i endeavored to sound him to know whether he had any thoughts about his liberty for i remembered at our first meeting he declared himself as i thought very frankly but in all his discourse now i found him of a wavering uncertain temper and therefore i thought it the wisest way to keep my design to my self and go another way to work i took my leave of him and went home i unloaded my horses and took particular care of my bundle of things my salt water i put into shallow pans in the sun which in a days time produced small quantities of salt i did not want to try experiments yet i was pleased to see the operations  i began to set my still on work the next day but was soon interrupted in my progress by the hasty arrival of mirza said he we have brought a fine house upon our heads yonder is achmat will not be contented without more of the francks cordial the moors call all europeans francks i asked him how he ordered him when he waked after i had left em he told me he was so greedy after the precious liquor that he drained the empty bottles and he believed if mahomet himself had made him a visit and achmat had got a bottle to his nose he would not have bid him welcome till he had seen the bottom well said i you know the liquor is not mine but i will stand by you in the consumption of it well if you please then said mirza well trouble you with our company tonight with all my heart said i so we agreed to sup together mirza farther added that the ladies had a mind to see my still at work i told him they might do as they thought fit but i would get out of the way and accordingly he went to fetch them the moorish women came down the walk in a hasty manner to observe it but the english lady came alone as usual i had got on the other side of the laurel trees and took care to appear in her sight as soon as she saw me she cautiously approached me and told me softly she wanted to have a little talk with me i answered her we had an opportunity very favorable and then let her know how the other women were employed beside we had the laurel walk between us and i was out of sight from every body else she told me she had something particular to mention to me said she we shall certainly want money to accommodate us with many necessaries in our dangerous voyage i told her what money i had saved for our design but that we should certainly have occasion for more if we were obliged to go for spain that was one of the reasons said she why i wanted to confer with you it is in my power to procure a considerable sum and though it is not so much as i have lost by the captain yet i have even a scruple to take clandestinely from him what i may say is my own justly i soon removed her scruples and then she farther told me what was in her power to take was chiefly in jewels which would be better for concealment and carriage than money by this time she observed the other ladies coming toward her which she informed me of upon that i took my leave and absconded when they were gone off the walks mirza came to me to release me as he called it and told me the ladies were mighty well pleased with the view of my work and materials i told him i hoped they would not give me that trouble often he answered he would take care for the future  now the crisis of my project was very near i went to town the next day and took mustapha for more water and farther added i should want him a night or two hence to procure water by moonlight he wondered at my proceeding but his master had told him that i was something very extraordinary and suspected me of magic but he also informed him that i was using my art for his benefit i told him i had several materials to wash in the sea water in the full of the moon which was at that time and then i should give him no farther trouble from thence i went to my jews again and privately procured several sorts of dried provisions as neats tongues biskets dried fish wine and a small puncheon of water and several other necessaries all to be ready at a moments warning  when i had provided every thing i went home again and got an opportunity the same day to speak with my mistress i desired she would be ready about twelve aclock at night with every thing she had a mind to take with her she told me she could not tell how to escape the vigilance of the eunuchs for said she they lock me up every night when they go to bed nay every day when they are not with me i desired her to leave that to me i invited mirza and achmat to sup with me that night for i told em i was obliged to sit up to watch my work being it was coming to a head and that i was to go to town before day they complied with my request with a great deal of joy and the hour drawing near they locked up the doors of the house and came with a great deal of contentment in their looks we sat down and i plied them with wine till they thought they had enough for the finishing stroke i desired em to drink one cup of a liquor of my own distilling which they soon complied with i went and fetched a bottle of brandy that i had procured on purpose in which i had conveyed a large quantity of laudanum to be ready for this occasion i gave em each a good large cup which they swallowed but did not very well like the taste i told them i had distilled that liquor on purpose to keep the fumes of the wine or cordial as achmat would have it out of the head they were very well pleased if it would have that effect yet desired another glass of wine to put the taste out of their mouths which i complied with the liquor soon had its desired effect and a profound sleep locked up all their senses i with some fear took the keys out of achmats pocket and went directly to the house and at last found the right key that opened the place where my treasure was reposed though she found her self at liberty yet she shook with timorous apprehensions i encouraged her all i could and brought her the disguise which i had provided for her while she was getting ready i retired out of decency and got out my horses and an italian slave whom i had two or three times taken to town with me he understood a little french and i had observed something in his countenance that spoke him worthy of a better fate i had not once mentioned to him any thing of my project for fear of any accident but i had ordered him to be ready to go with me that night when i came back i found my mistress ready and something impatient i informed her she must submit to another disguise she asked me what that was i took out a paper of ombre and told her she must permit me to rub it over her face and hands which i did but the pleasure of touching her flesh in that gentle manner perfectly put me in an ecstasy which she observed for i could not help softly squeezing her hand she did not seem displeased at my transport but yet i thought the occasion she had to make use of me made her bear with me as soon as we were ready we went out but i first locked the doors and left em as i found em my mind was confused between hope fear joy and terror and i did not doubt but the lady was in a worse condition but all my task was to comfort her when i had helped her up on horseback i called for the italian slave and we both mounted for i would not let him walk on foot as usual  when we were got safe from the house i began to ask the italian slave several questions as where he was born how long he had been a slave and so forth i found by his answers that he had no hopes of liberty for he had sent several letters to his friends in italy and never could receive any answer then i began to come nearer the matter and gave him some hint of our design but with this addition even death should not deter me from the execution he had hardly patience to hear me out but begged he might share the same fate with me and if he got his liberty through my means he should never forget the obligation but i might be master of that life i should be the means of saving for added he to live in slavery is but to be always dying the worst of deaths i soon found by his manner of expressing himself that he was sincere in what he said at last i told him all my design which he mightily approved of and said every thing was so well concerted that with the blessing of god it could not miscarry  when we arrived at the captains town house we found mustapha waiting for me i had considered we could not do without him yet i would not venture to mention our escape till we had him safe upon the sea i ordered every thing into the boat and to hide my disguised lady i told mustapha that it was a young gentleman that had been bit by a mad dog and i had brought him to dip him in the sea by the desire of his friends that lived in the neighborhood in the country which was allowed to be the only cure  when we had gained the main sea i began to open my design to mustapha but was something surpised to hear him call out for help i immediately drew a pistol out of my pocket for i had procured several pair held it to his breast and threatened him with death that moment if he offered to open his mouth i added that we had gone too far to stop now and i believe if he had made any resistance i should certainly have dispatched him when he found resistance would signify nothing he sat him down and wept bitterly i was really sorry to see him so much afflicted and comforted him all i could and to encourage him i told him as soon as we arrived at magazan a strong port belonging to the portuguese upon the afric coast where i had designed to steer our course he should not only have his liberty but i would reward him with fifty pistoles for the pains he should be at i further added i would not have given him this trouble if i could have found a possibility of doing without him he seemed to be satisfied and promised us all the help he could i told him we would make the best of our way to magazan not being above twenty leagues south of sallee he seemed very much pleased our voyage was to be so short for the wind was fair and we hoped to arrive at magazan in two days at the farthest i had provided every thing that was necessary for a much longer voyage and when we had directed our course and were settled in our way i desired the lady to take some refreshment and compose her unsettled thoughts for we were now out of all manner of danger i said this only to comfort her for i was even in fear of the captains ship or some other moorish vessel meeting us by chance and the italian put into my head another fear that as i had declared i was never at magazan nor did not know where it was situated he was not assured but mustapha might steer his course to some place that was possessed by the moors i gave mustapha a hint of it with a promise of a quick dispatch if he betrayed us but he assured me there was never another port between that and magazan after we had refreshed our selves i entreated the lady to acquaint us how she came into the power of the captain now we are something at ease said she obligingly i shall inform you with pleasure  the history of mrs villars my fathers name was villars an eminent merchant of the city of bristol my mother died when i was very young so that i could never know the loss of her the care of my father attond for the want of my mother he gave me all the education that was proper to our sex but before i was sixteen my father died the grief and sorrow i felt for his death was not recompensed by an estate of two thousand pounds a year which he left entirely at my own disposal besides several valuable jewels of my mothers my fortune i suppose brought me many admirers but as i was a stranger to love i had no inclination to marry yet being pestered so much with their company and courtship i retired to a country house near the sea side and as i did not care to see any of my suitors so whenever they came i always left word i was gone abroad or out of order and in a little time i got clear of their impertinence  i had the misfortune to be a woman of business though young for my father had several vessels at sea the captain of one of the ships that traded to turkey brought me a bill of lading and i happened to please him though more than i knew till afterward in short he fell desperately in love with me but hearing my aversion to matrimony never declared his passion to me yet by bribes and presents gained over to his interest a maid that lived with me who for a hundred pound had placed him in a closet in my bedchamber i came and undressed my self as usual and went to rest but i had not been long laid ere i found a person pulling down the clothes and attempting to come to bed to me i was prodigiously surpised and frightened as any one would imagine i called for help but no one came to my assistance for the maid had taken care of that i got out of bed with much ado and attempted to open the door but found i was locked in i used entreaties to the wretch who was disguised in such a manner that i could not know him for he had got a mask on but all to no purpose he seized me and i was so faint with struggling that he was very near accomplishing his barbarous design when my other closet door flew open for i had one at each end of the room and there came out another man disguised my fear could not be well increased but i was in such a terror that i did not well know whether i was really alive  the person who came out last seized immediately on the other who let me go to defend himself i ran to the door and fear adding to my strength i burst it open but how or which way i cannot remember i ran to the maids chamber and the noise and confusion we were in alarmed the men servants i had slipped on a gown and when i had got all the men together i told em the reason of this alarm they immediately armed themselves and ran up to my chamber but the persons were both gone in searching the room we found a piece of a mask on the ground and a handkerchief marked l k with stains of blood in several parts of the room we could not imagine who they were and i was so very much confused and frightened that i did not examine the bottom of it that night but went to bed in another room very ill with the fright though not before i had given order to two of my men servants to watch at my chamber door  i searched the closets of that other room and under the bed before i would venture and it being a room where my father used to lie it had a bar on the inside so i and my maid went to bed notwithstanding my fatigue frights and fears i fell asleep and when i woke in the morning found my self very well i began then to think reasonably of my last nights adventure and easily judged that one or both of my maids must be in the confederacy for my door never used to be locked on the outside before i sent for all my servants up men and maids and related to em the nights adventure but they brought me word that mrs susan was not to be found i sent to examine her room but i was informed all her things were gone we all concluded that she was the occasion of the last nights plot i did not think fit to send after her rejoicing i had escaped such a base conspiracy till going up into my own chamber i found a diamond necklace a ring my gold watch and about sixty guineas in money taken away my escritore broke open and a bill of five hundred pounds that was due taken away i immediately sent to bristol to stop payment but was told that my maid had come as from me for the money and had received it several hours before we made the strictest search we could for her but all to no purpose so i gave it all for lost six weeks passed on and no news concerning my maid one morning as i was walking in my garden a sailor brought me a letter which was to this purpose  madam i heartily repent of my infidelity to you when i committed that base action i took shelter on board of a ship that belongs to my brother and now lies about six miles off where the bearer will conduct your ladyship if you will be so good to come away immediately the reason of my repentance and sorrow though a sincere one is at the approach of death by the accident of a fall down the hold of the ship where i broke my left leg and fracturd my scull so that i have been senseless for two days but god granting me my senses again though with the information that i cannot live four and twenty hours has through his mercy convinod me that to expect pardon from him is to restore what is yours with a sincere confession of the fatal nights adventure that corrupted my honesty and will be the cause of my death and farther if heaven will grant me the blessing of seeing you i may put you in a way to prevent something of ill that may happen to you  your repenting servant susan prichard p s i beg you to keep it private and to amuse your servants that you bring with you you may tell em you are going on board the turkey ship to see the present the turkey merchants are sending to the emperor of constantinople the bearer will conduct you     now i had heard of one of the turkey fleet that was obliged to put into the road by a violent storm and that it had a sedan made with lookingglass of a very curious workmanship designed for a present to the turkish emperor i asked the sailor several questions concerning the letter and he answered me bluntly he could not tell any thing about it but that there was a young woman who had fell down their hold and had almost killed her self and that they did not expect she could ever recover i resolved to go along with him but to take two men servants and a maid with me i walked to the waterside which was about a quarter of a mile from my house and there i found a ships boat with eight oars and very handsome i stepped into it with my servants without any hesitation and put off in about an hour and a half we came along side of the vessel they manned side for me and i was handed up and led into the cabin where i found my maid upon a pallatbed in one corner of it as soon as she saw me she attempted to rise but seemed not to have strength enough and fell down again i desired she would not put her self to any pain but compose her thoughts that she might be the better able to inform me of what she had promised me in her letter o madam she cried with hesitations sighs and ready to faint every moment you do not know what i feel at the sight of you you bring into my remembrance the transaction of that fearful night but i hope your goodness will forgive me i shall put into your hands what i have wickedly robbed you of and since i am going out of this world i am assured your goodnature will prevail for my pardon i told her i forgave her freely and i hoped heaven would do so too she thanked me but said she found her self so ill that she entreated leave to rest from speaking a minute or two to gather a little breath  i waited with some impatience but she remained so long silent that i really thought she was expired upon that supposition i called to her and she answered me but faintly well madam said she as i find you impatient to know what i have promised you i will tell you as well as i am able  captain bourn had for many months a great passion for you but finding you averse to matrimony he tampered with me and offered me such large sums of money that beat down all my guard of honesty and overcame it quite he gave me a hundred pounds besides other valuable presents to admit him into your closet before you went tobed which accordingly dazzled with the luster of the gold i did you know what followed and if he had not been prevented by the sudden appearance of another person out of the other closet would have compassed his design said i eagerly pray do you know who the other person was yes madam returned the wench it was mr lawrence kendrick your former suitor and guardian conveyed there for the same base intent by your ladyships woman how cried i amazed are you assured of that madam pursued she when you got out of the door mr kendrick seized upon mr bourn and they struggled together some time but mr kendriks mask falling off captain bourn knowing him cried is it you in short they soon came to an ecclaircisement and went down stairs unperceived by any of us in the hurry where he declared to the captain that he had prevailed upon mrs ellis your woman for a good sum of money to convey him into the closet which she did unperceived of any thus said i may ill intentions be ever frustrated  when she had finished she begged me to have a little more patience while she got a little more strength and she would restore me my money and jewels i was unwilling to wait long yet thought fifteen hundred pounds too much to lose for my necklace ring and watch were valued by my father at a thousand pounds i believe i had been full three hours on board and wanted to be at home again and after she had kept silent some time i made bold to disturb her once more i called to her and told her i had a great way to go and i was afraid of catching cold she begged i would ring a bell that hung by my hand which i did and the sailor came in that brought me the letter pray said the maid is my brother ready to come in yes answered he and has been on board this half hour it is very well said she upon that she raised her hand and unpinnd a shutter that fell down and let light enough into the cabin which was dark before but i thought her illness was the reason of that but to my eternal amazement i saw her rise from the palate as well as ever i saw her in my life before i had power to speak captain bourn entered i could not presently dive into this mystery i hope captain said i at last that you repent of your rash and bold attempt yes madam answered he that i did not succeed in it but i hope i have it now in my power to finish my design i asked him what he meant he told me i should soon be informed and if i would not consent to his embraces he would certainly ravish me that very night upon this treatment i began to call for my servants but the faithless susan told me they were taken care of and safe ashore yes madam returned the captain they are twelve miles behind us by this time and desired i would look out of the cabin window which they had just before opened i cast my eyes behind me and too soon perceived that we were a considerable distance from the land i did not look long for the sight took away my senses and i fell down in a swoon and when i came to my self it was far in night but i was so faint and ill that my feeble limbs would not support my body grief attacked me so violently that it was thought by every body it would soon overcome me by next morning a strong fever seized me and all that i remembered for six weeks was that i was put to bed with the wretch that betrayed me to attend me but the condition i was in really wrought upon her and produced a true conversion she lamented more than i and cursed her self a thousand times  when i had recovered my senses i was wore away to a skeleton and sure never any one in my condition found any relief but death but it pleased the divine being to work another miracle and insensibly restore me to my former health of body but a mind involved in the most cruel torture past imagination  when i found the maids repentance real i freely forgave her the captain in all this time had never come near me but only to enquire after my health as susan informed me but when he perceived i had regained my former health and beauty as he called it i was tormented with his beastly addresses he told me if i would consent to marry him and forgive the crime he was guilty of he would immediately steer for england which he could reach in a few days i considered i was in a wretchs power who by what he had done already would stick at nothing to gain his ends i therefore resolved to flatter him by the advice of my maid who notwithstanding she had brought me into these distresses i had taken into my former favor in one of his troublesome visits i told him if he would immediately restore me to my liberty i would upon the instant make him my husband when we could procure a proper person to tie the knot he answered me that the only way to secure me to him was to have possession of my body beforehand and continued he if you think the action criminal i will soon cure your conscience by the license of the church for said he if you intend what you propose you will easily comply and nothing else will convince me of your sincerity i will give you one day to consider on it but continued the wretch if you refuse to submit by fair means i tomorrow by force will enjoy you so i leave you to consider on it and saying this left us in the cabin i had desired susan to conceal our reconcilement from the captain which she artfully had done and in his discourse would often throw in a word or two in his behalf  when we were alone i gave my self over to my sorrows and thought of nothing for several hours but my unhappy circumstances we both continued silent a considerable time nor indeed had i power to speak though heaven had indud me with that fortitude that i had resolved sooner to die than to submit to his cursed proposals i told susan that i had determined to put an end to all my sorrows by death and when that fatal hour arrived of his limited time i would plung a knife i had concealed for that design into my bosom this resolution once more renewed our griefs and we mingled tears together we wept so much that the fountains of our eyes were dry and we again remained silent at last susan broke it with a speech to this purpose  madam in the confusion of my thoughts i have chose out one that has some probability of success but it will at least convince you of my repentance and the desire i have to restore you that peace i have barbarously broke the captain yet thinks me in his interest and if we can contrive it i will submit to his loathed embraces in your room which shall be managed in this manner you shall treat with him upon it tomorrow morning the articles shall be these first that he come in the dark and stay no longer than one hour with you and last that he shall not repeat your familiarity till you are joined by the priest  i must confess this proposal gave me a dawn of hope and if we could but succeed in it i should not fear his farther passion when we were landed for i knew it was easy to find protection when once on shore in england and i thought the contrivance feazible enough for we were much of the same age and no perceived difference in our make at least in the dark  she left it to me to manage and i resolved to put on a more composed countenance at the captains next visit which was soon after though he had given me longer time to consider when he came in he begged my pardon for interrupting me but he came to make me a present he said and put a little box in my hand desiring i would open it which i did where i found my jewels and money i restore you that madam continued he and would not willingly be obliged to you for any thing but your person and even all your fortune shall be at your own disposal and the moment you consent to my desires i will deliver you a paper that shall oblige me to sign whatever terms you shall think fit to make me i paused a short time but indeed it was to think what my tongue should utter so foreign to my heart  captain said i you take the only way to gain your point and i must confess this show of generosity though it is in your power to force em from me again seems a little to lessen the ill opinion i have reason to bear against you if you will please to allow me one half hour to think a little i will give you my final answer tonight he seemed very much overjoyed at my discourse and showed it in an extravagant unpolite manner thanked me and went out  i did not want that time to prepare what i had to say but i thought it was better than to come into it on a sudden the time expired the captain came in with an expecting face i bad him sit down which i found by his countenance he took as a good prologue sir said i i have fully considered every thing and if you will comply with a few articles you shall have possession of what you desire tonight articles madam i will sign to a blank replied the brute if you please i told him they were only verbal ones first said i i will have no light in the room secondly you shall stay with me but an hour and lastly never to expect any more favors till we are lawfully married madam returned the captain you so overjoy me that i dont know where i am i will comply with all your articles and you have made me the happiest of mankind he said a great deal more fulsome stuff that was as nauseous to my ears as a plague sore to the sight he left us with a hope i would not long defer his happiness it was well i was in a dark corner of the cabin for had i been in the light he would have perceived the confusion in my countenance  the hated hour drew near and susan with a sincere grief and tears running down her cheeks laid her self in the captains loathed bed i was really grieved at the sacrifice she was going to make me for i was convinced she had no loose desires about her the captain entered in the dark and was as happy as a false imagination could make him i must confess i was in a thousand frights and fears lest the girl should have been discovered but every thing succeeded too well and the captain rose within his limited time and went out  as soon as he was gone the poor creature got up from her guilty scene well madam said she all drowned in tears i hope i have convinced you though to my eternal cost of my repentance and sincerity but i hope heaven will pardon me and not lay the crime to me or you when fatal necessity was the only cause i gave her all the comfort i was capable of and told her i did not think it impossible to oblige him to marry her when we had him in our power on shore and that formality would obliterate all melancholy thoughts how replied susan no madam though i have done all this yet it was only to serve you and before i would be his wife or indeed any mans wife i would submit to the most servile offices of life to support it and if the captain knew how we had deceived him and would offer to marry me to atone for his fault i could not consent for i loath the very thoughts of him well then susan said i when we have overcome all difficulties and worn off the remembrance of our sufferings i will settle a competency for life that shall put thee above all fear of want madam replied susan that is all i shall desire and then i will go to some corner of the world live retired and repent of all my past crimes and follies i told her she needed not do that she might notwithstanding what was past live with me no madam that can never be returned susan for you must of necessity to clear your own reputation divulge the secret and then with what confidence shall i be able to look upon any one i told her it would be esteemed as an action wholly virtuous without one spot or blemish all i was capable of saying could not alter her resolution but she persisted in retiring from the world and living recluse and i desisted from speaking any more upon the subject  it had been much happier for us both if we had never entered upon the argument for we had not remained silent a moment before the captain entered with a light in his hand and the utmost fury in his countenance thou devil said he to susan and have thou betrayed me wretch after what i have done for thee but i shall study some way to have ample vengeance on thee and for you madam i shall give you still the same terms and time i first proposed but that past expect not the least hope for i will enjoy you though the moment after death should seize me when he had done speaking he went out but it was a considerable time ere we came out of our surprise  we were convinced that he had listened and overheard all our discourse though we spoke but softly and we feared to utter our thoughts to one another as imagining he would overhear us still but susan at last broke out in these words good heaven i hope the punishments i am bound to suffer will atone for all my offenses if it will make my peace with thee i will undergo all the torments in the world in that blessed hope i had not words to comfort her for the thoughts of my own condition tied up my tongue but the pain of thinking nothing could exceed i prayed to god to bring me out of this misfortune or give me force of reason to suffer with patience a dissolution from this world when susan heard me she told me she could see no path to lead us through this labyrinth of misfortunes but through the gate of death and added she since we must die once the sooner we leave this troublesome world the sooner we shall find rest  death still bore to me a frosty sound however i soon resolved upon it but the manner of it was what most confounded me at last we both thought of drowning and had resolved whenever the captain came to accomplish his wicked intent to throw our selves out of the cabin window will you so said the captain who had overheard us again for grief had taken all caution from us but i will soon prevent that he immediately took hammer and nails and nailed the shutters so close that it was not in our weak strength to undo them after he was gone we spent the night in prayer and just before the morning dawned we understood by the rocking of the ship the noise of the sailors and the loudness of the wind that we were in a prodigious storm this gave us hopes that the ship would be cast away and that god had heard our prayers and would not let us lay violent hands upon our selves nay deceiving hope was ready to enter our thoughts that we might be cast away upon some shore and receive assistance when we least expected it the storm lasted the whole day and part of the next night but as it sensibly abated so our fears increased the captain gave us another visit well said he madam i hope you have had sufficient time to consider of my proposals and i am now come for my final answer said i heaven has given you an answer by raising the storm and if you have the least notion of a divinity you will find twas his voice that spok to you in that tempest to desist from such a base attempt nay madam if you imagine you can preach me from my design preach on a gods name wretch that thou art said i how can thou mention that sacred name and yet have such thoughts as he abhors i fancy madam returned the brute your ladyship feels the influence of the moon and for fear i should catch the infection i will leave you for a while but with a word by the by if you dont consent the next time i come by hell since you will not let me mention heaven i will not only ravish you but every sailor in the ship shall do so too if they think fit and i believe they are sharp enough set to fall too upon worse food than i shall set before them  he said a great many more gross things that would only become his mouth to utter and to convince you madam that i will do what i say said he i shall begin with mrs susan come mistress said he to her now i have had the first cut of you i will let my sailors go to dinner with this he forced us both on the quarter deck and called all the seamen about him here my lads said he i have but two dainty bits and i will give you one among you that you may not think i am over greedy the sailors stard upon one another and did not well know what he meant till he told them in terms plain enough with promises of reward to him that would prove the greatest rogue susan fell upon her knees and entreated them not to take pattern from their barbarous captain but to pity a poor unfortunate woman reduced to the fatal necessity of living no longer some of the sailors made sport with her misery while others began to pity her one blunt fellow cried damn it i love a woman well enough but dont care to have her forced upon me it is like eating against ones stomach beside said another i suppose there is some reason of the captains liberality or he would not part with her i observed one of them that stood at some distance taking notice of what was done without seeming pleased i thought i knew his face too and he appeared above a common sailor by his looks and cleanliness i had not till now appeared publicly i was determined to speak to him and to crave his assistance as soon as he saw me he seemed amazed and cried bless me madam how came you here i told him i was betrayed by the captain i was informed said he that he had two ladies passengers for zant but i little thought you were one of them for i was not on board till an hour after you arrived i begged he would take me under his protection which he swore with a great oath he would or the captain should cut his throat madam added he i am mate of this vessel put in by your honorable father and had been captain if it had not been for the tricks of that rascal pointing to the captain  the sailors were so divided between themselves that they had not proceeded to any violence with susan and she remained leaning upon the side of the ship all drowned in tears the captain had all this time been laughing at the disputes of the sailors but perceiving the mate in conference with me came up to him and with a faucy tone asked him what business he had with me i have no other business answered the mate but to protect her from your ill usage you impertinent coxcomb cried the captain i will teach you to intermeddle with my affairs and upon saying this he lifted up his hand and struck him but the mate soon returned his blow with interest and knocked him down upon the deck the sailors came and parted em but the captain swore that blow should cost him his life he upon the instant ran into the cabin for some instrument to dispatch him as was supposed but the mate followed him close and knowing his violent temper barred the door of the cabin so that the captain remained a prisoner  the mate took from his own cabin which was near the captains a cutlass and put himself against the door and swore he would be the death of him that first attempted to release him and bad none of them offer to stir till they had heard what he had to say  the sailors had cast off all thoughts from susan to hear what the mate could say who declared who i was and by what means i was betrayed on board when the sailors found i was their mistress and owner of the ship they soon began to repent of what they were going about and declared they would serve me with their lives when i found i had gained most of em on my side i told em my story at length only concealing susans affair with the captain and they seemed all prodigiously amazed and stood gaping upon me like so many statues  the captain in the cabin was all this time swearing cursing and making a noise at his restraint i told the mate if he thought fit we would release him yes madam if you please said he out of the great cabin but we must confine him somewhere else well knowing his turbulent spirit would never be easy i told him i would be guided by him and if he pleased to accept of the command of the vessel if it was in my power to give it him it was at his service he returned me a great many thanks and told me he would be very faithful in his commission we released the captain out of the cabin but as soon as he came upon the deck he was seized with a great deal of difficulty irond and confined to another cabin he raged like a madman at this treatment but all to no purpose i told him he should want nothing but his liberty neither would i prosecute him as his crimes deserved when we arrived in england  i desired the mate to make for bristol with all the expedition imaginable with a promise that i would recompense every common sailor with double the wages they expected for their voyage they all huzzad at the news and one and all promised to serve me with their lives the mate told me the wind was against us in our course but that he would ply it to windward as they call it in expectation of its changing i asked him whereabouts we were and he told me very near the streights of gibraltar and should have been at zant by that time but that they were hindered by contrary winds and drove back by the late storm i told him how the captain had deceived me in telling me we were not six days from the english coast  susans joy cannot be expressed at our happy deliverance and you may he assured i was as well pleased as she was though it did not appear outwardly so much besides i considered the mutabilty of the things of this world and we were soon taught by experience the uncertainty of humane affairs for before the evening we were chased by a rover who soon came up with us and took us after an obstinate resistance though we did not lose one man but the barbarous captain who was killed in the place of his confinement without being in the action  the captain of the rover was the same we have now made our escape from he never would tell me what became of susan and the crew madam said mustapha i can inform you they and all the crew were ransomed for a thousand pound and their ship given them again they did their endeavor to ransom you but to no purpose for they could never learn what was become of you    mrs villars thus ended her relation only added that the captain fell desperately in love with her and would never hear of her ransom though he treated her with decency allowing her every thing but liberty with the convenience of a study of books which the captain had procured by his piracy and ever left in her closet her jewels and other things of value that he had taken out of the ship  when mrs villars had finished her story i returned her thanks for the trouble i had given her sir returned she thanks will not recompense me for the pains i have taken i shall demand the same satisfaction from you i told her i should readily obey her commands but i begged leave to give her the relation in french that our italian might partake for i design with your leave to insist of the same from him sir replied the lady i would have related my unhappy story in that language if you had given me the least hint but however i will go once more over again if you please in french at least the chief circumstances that we may more engage the person to declare how he has shared the same fate with us i begged she would give me leave to take that trouble if it were only to let her see i had imprinted in my memory what concerned her so strongly that i could repeat every circumstance she gave me leave to proceed on which i told her story over again in french to the italian when i had finished she gave me thanks for the pains i had taken though i had not been so long in the relation yet i made up the time in descanting upon her danger and hard fate that a lady of her birth beauty and estate should be so far forsaken by fortune as to be reduced to wretched slavery  i then began my own story from my birth to our present state though in what related to my passion for the lady i did not directly explain yet i gave her hints enough to understand she was the idol of my soul and though love like hope does often deceive us i thought my obscure declaration did not displease her  we then desired the italian to proceed in his relation he sighing told us he was too much obliged to me to refuse me any thing though it would call to his remembrance transactions that would bring tears into his eyes after some pause he began to this effect  the story of the italian slave i was born at the city of rome renowned for its grandeur and antiquity and i may say without boasting of a noble family but had the misfortune to come last into the world and the youngest of five sons and two daughters my father had a plentiful fortune but before his death he had much weakened it in giving dowries to my two sisters who were both married far above their fortunes though not equal to their birth but riches now balance every thing and weigh down birth and humble virtue and he that has most gold is the greatest man  we lost our mother in our early days and my father followed before i was ten years old having settled all his estate on his eldest son to keep up the grandeur of the name and left three brothers of us to depend on him  my father in his lifetime gave us an education suitable to our birth and family and my brother to give him his due completed us two of my brothers he procured posts in the army for who both lost their lives in one glorious campaign the other dyed young  it was imagined by every body that had the privilege to think for me that their deaths would be of no small advantage to me and it had for some years the appearance of it my brother had attained to his thirtieth year without once ever thinking of marriage but an advantageous match being proposed it was thought convenient for him to pursue it the lady that was designed for him he had never seen but he was informed she was young rich and beautiful he was brought to the sight of her and fell violently in love with her at the first visit and his passion increased every moment the day was fixed for their nuptials by the father of the lady which was to be the easter following i had attained to my eighteenth year and no provision made for me and it was thought that this match would not bring me the least advantage  one day my brother told me he had procured me the post of captain of the popes guards and though it was far beneath my birth yet i was pleased with it that i might have the means to subsist without being subject to the caprice of fortune and the dependence of a brother of an uncertain temper my brother having some urgent affairs that called him hastily out of town he gave me a letter to deliver to his mistress which was to excuse his sudden departure  as soon as he was gone i went to execute his commission and being known to be the brother of the intended husband had the liberty of presenting the letter to the ladys own hands but what misfortunes did that interview cost me i no sooner saw her but i lost my heart and the regard i owed my brother was of no force against her charms i observed she perused the letter with indifferency which did not displease me yet i so far overcame my growing passion as to add something to the excuse my brother had wrote i observed in our conversation that the proposed alliance was not very pleasing to her and she at last frankly told me duty more than inclination would make her comply with it i told her were my brothers condition mine and i had been acquainted with her sentiments i should not have the fortitude to support my ill fortune yet should have so much regard to her whatever were my troubles not to be obliged to duty but inclination  she told me with a rising blush those espousals never prosperd where the hand could not bestow the heart i agreed with her sentiments but added i feared her heart was already given where she could not bestow her hand  sir said she i have ever been a friend to plaindealing and truth appears so amiable to me that i neither will nor can deny it to you o happy man cried i whoeer thou art fortune has shed her happiest influence on thee and it is not in her power to make thee miserable when blessed with so much consenting beauty sir returned the lady the person you esteem so happy is ignorant of my inclinations for him and fear will make me conceal the secret and the chief reason why i disclose it to you is that you would inform your brother for added she with tears if i am forced to wed him i shall be for ever miserable her grief touched me to the heart and she observed the sorrow in my face i perceive said she the love you bear your brother affects your breast madam said i since you have made me this frank declaration i also will be free and utter all my heart the grief you see rising in my face is owing to the torments of my soul the very moment i beheld your charms love shot me with his sharpest pointed dart and all the hope i have is cold despair she observed my declaration with a great deal of satisfaction and remained silent some time viewing me steadfastly upon which i cast my eyes upon the ground sir said she with an unconfirmd voice i hope you are sincere in what you say for the supposition of it will draw another secret from me which is this the reason why i cannot love your brother is that i have long since given my heart to  you the first time i saw your face it left its peaceful mansion of repose and fled for shelter to a strangers breast the joy i felt at this free declaration so transported me that i knew not whether i dreamt or no but being convinced of the reality i threw my self at her feet and uttered all my tongue could express slowing from a sincere heart she told me she had resolved on death before she would consent to wed my brother and informed me also that her passion had been increasing upwards of two years the first time she saw me was taking my leave of my brothers when they were going to that campaign from which they never returned in short we were as much in love as ever any two were  we agreed to meet the next day at the same place where i had the liberty of coming as her brotherinlaw that was to be  i was impatient for the next day imagining time to have no wings but the happy moment came at last we talked of nothing for several hours but our mutual love at last we fell on the ungrateful subject of the approaching nuptials and how we should prevent em i proposed to her running away and tying our selves fast by the sacred bond of wedlock though said she i will never be any ones but yours yet we must consider of futurity i know your fortune is but small and mine though a large one depends upon my father i will find some means to defer the marriage you may do your endeavor to dissuade your brother for i fancy fortune more than beauty has gained his heart i assured her to the contrary and that he was very much in love with her we both wished it had been otherways but resolved to love on we parted though we had not resolved on any thing and appointed to meet the next day in a private corner of the town at an acquaintance of mine that i could confide in though i would not trust him with the secret well knowing a matter of importance inslaves the person that discloses it i told him i had an intrigue with a person of quality that i must be obliged to carry on at his house which he consented to very willingly we met according to our appointment but an hour before the time prefixed not willing one should be before the other she came alone too for she would not trust any of her servants we met there every day and one time above the rest love being pregnant in both our eyes i took the happy opportunity and was blessed in the possession of all i wished on earth but enjoyment was so far from palling my desires that it rather increased em we lived in all the delight of love for a month but then came the bitter to all our sweets my brother arrived and the fatal day appointed for the marriage aproachd we had given our selves up so entirely to love that we did not think of what was to come or if the intruding thought did creep in we would immediately lull it to rest like a froward child  when we parted it was with such a regret and sorrow that foreboded our ill fortune the father of my mistress had ordered every thing for the nuptial solemnity with the greatest magnificence but two days before it was to be solemnized it was reported all over rome that don antonio grimaldis only daughter who was my mistress was taken dangerously ill i was not displeased at the rumor as guessing her design my brother was never from her and i was pretty well assured the sight of him gave her a great deal of pain one day finding my brother very melancholy i asked him if it was the indisposition of grimaldis daughter that occasioned the gloom i observed in his countenance he replied she was the cause of what he felt he farther added that he thought her sickness counterfeit only to avoid him and that he had many reasons to believe she had given her heart to another i used many arguments with him to leave her and that she was not worth his farther thought but he assured me it was not in his power to hate her i began to reflect with reason on the conduct of my love and found i had involved my self in a very dangerous and troublesome affair but notwithstanding all my reasonings i found my self more and more in love and absence which cures a light passion added strength to mine for i had not seen her in fifteen days i was resolved at last to visit her and took the opportunity when my brother was with the pope in his closet i found it no difficulty to gain admittance knowing who i was but notwithstanding all my endeavors could not get an opportunity of speaking to her there being a great many visitants i took an occasion of feeling her pulse and we had the happiness of moulding our hands for a moment i durst not stay long for fear my brother should come while i was there and yet i had resolved to inform him of my visit which i did the first time of our meeting but added that it was curiosity and to oblige him that i gave my self that trouble he thanked me and asked me what i thought of her indisposition i told him i could not answer for the state of her heart but i was assured that her body was in a violent fever this i said a little to undeceive him for since he could not be persuaded to abandon her i thought it would be more to our advantage to make him believe it was a real indisposition he went to make her a visit that evening and at his return told me i had given him true information for the physicians had ordered her to be let blood and that she was in a dangerous fever and her father designed to send her into the country the next day i was mightily pleased that he was deceived as well as the father and i did not doubt but she had persuaded the physicians to favor the deceit  accordingly the next day she was conveyed in a litter to a country house of her fathers two leagues from rome upon the river tyber i flattered my self that her being in the country would give me a fairer opportunity of conversing with her but though i tried all the methods imaginable i could not find the least glimpse of hope in above six weeks time i was perfectly like a mad creature and all my friends particularly my brother took notice of my uneasiness but i kept the cause of it entirely to my self  any one that is a judge of love and has ever been in my circumstances may guess at what i felt all i could learn of my mistress was that she continued very ill my mind was tortured with a thousand imaginations sometimes i thought her false and that it was her own desire which kept me from seeing her at other times i fancied she was really indisposed  a month more slipped away and i was as unlikely to see her then as at first one morning my brother came into my chamber before i was dressed he seemed overcomplaisant to me and expressed a concern for the alteration of my temper i fancy said he brother that love has forced himself into your breast and that the object of your passion has no regard to the torments you endure i excused my self to him that love had no concern in my humor but rather an inward indisposition of body he said many kind things upon that occasion promised to assist me all he could and left me  as soon as he was gone i dressed my self and got on horseback in order once more to try my fortune and i had taken a resolution to see my mistress whatever hazard i should run  when i came upon the skirt of a wood within half a league of the place where i was going i was surrounded by a dozen men on horseback who notwithstanding the resistance i made got me down bound me and carried me into the wood i imagined em to be thieves by their proceeding but they never once attempted to take any thing from me which altered my opinion and i began to think they had a design upon my life  the state and uncertainty of my love made death look like a friend  they kept me in the wood till the dusk of the evening then clapped me into a litter and traveled hard all night the next morning i was put into a boat and hurried on board a vessel that lay a league off at sea as soon as they had received me they weighted and set sail and the person that seemed to have command in the boat proved to be the captain of the vessel  they carried me bound into his cabin when we were alone he gave me a paper which i soon knew to be my brothers handwriting and in it an open letter whose hand i could not tell by the direction upon this the italian took em both out of his bosom see said he the fatal scroll which has robbed me of all joy in this life and which i have kept during my captivity  the first letter he read was to this effect  i will not call thee by the name of brother that thou have basely forfeited but know the hand of heaven hangs over thee to punish thy unfaithful dealing with one who thinks it the greatest curse on earth that our parents should be the same the enclosed letter came into my hands by the honesty of her that was commissioned to bring it to thee who abhorring thy guilty commerce with her ungrateful mistress has discovered thy scene of villainy know after thou have read this prepare to suffer for thy ingratitude an hours space is the length of thy life and i think death too small a revenge for the wrongs thou have committed against  hernando alvares   the other was as follows  to antonio alvares life of my life i have resolved to hazard every thing to let you know the state of my body and mind though body life and heart are entirely thine yet i fear death will rob thee of em my counterfeit illness that day you saw me without having the happiness of speaking to each other brought a real distemper upon me and my fever took away my understanding i hope i have not in my ravings declared the secret of my soul the sight of your brother retards my health and the hopes i have of my recovery is once more to see thee thou darling of my heart i have prevailed upon one of my women with presents and promises whom i hope is honest to deliver this to thee our private meetings i fear will prove fatal to me for i find our commerce if i survive will make me a mother but for fear it may touch me more in what thou art to suffer if known to be the father death shall release thee from that danger   upon the reading of these two letters different passions swelled in my soul my heart was torn with agonies for her i loved and my breast was fired with revenge against my unnatural brother for as he had shook off all brotherly love i thought it was but justice i should do so too  i sat a considerable time in the utmost agony not for fear of death for i must confess i had not the least thought about it the captain of the vessel seeing me in that condition spoke to me after this manner sir though i am well paid by your brother to end your life yet i have so much compassion for your sufferings knowing your crime to be only love to mitigate your sentence i will put you into a boat with two men to conduct you and every thing that shall be necessary upon this condition that you will give me your word and honor not to appear at rome in forty days  i thanked him for his kindness gave him my word and told him it was not in fear of death but only to disappoint my barbarous brother immediately a boat was hoisted out and every thing that was needful for a months voyage my two men were paid for the voyage beforehand and we left the ship i i ordered em to steer for leghorn because there i could be furnished with every thing that i wanted from my sister who had resided there two years with her husband a nobleman of florence but the wind not proving favorable we were drove out of our intended course and had it not been for a french vessel bound for malta who took us up we had certainly perished and happy for me had it been my fate to have had a wave for my winding sheet for two days after we were received on board a corsair of barbary met with us and took us all prisoners  i made no extraordinary appearance being i was always disguised when i went to the house where my mistress lay indisposed hamet the name of our irish renagado valued my ransom but at two hundred pounds i wrote to both my sisters several times and laid before em my unhappy condition but never could hear from em so that i either feared my letters had miscarried or they were willing to forget an unhappy wretch like my self though to say truth i never received any hard usage from hamet therefore if the divine being will favor us in our escape i will faithfully send him my ransom    when he had ended his story we condold with one another for our misfortues had a resemblance by this time the day began to dawn and mustapha told us we should reach magazan before night we were all mightily overjoyed because we expected to be a day longer in our voyage i begged the favor of mrs villars to let me cleanse her face from the ombre which she consented to i was filled with contemplation of her beauty but was roused from those pleasing thoughts by the appearance of several lowering clouds that seemed to threaten us with a hurrican frequent in those parts and though they seldom last long yet they might prove dangerous to our small vessel  mustapha advised to make to shore but i could by no persuasion agree to that but ordered him to hold on his course for magazan but the tempest rose so suddenly and so violent that we were obliged to leave our selves to the mercy of the waves and we did not know which way we drove for the dark clouds had almost formed another night  our boat was a new stout boat and bore the weather very well but it frightened mrs villars very much and i had no other regard but for her the tempest continued for near half the day and when it grew calm and cleared up we were not in sight of land by good fortune i had provided a compass and i ordered mustapha to steer due south the same course we kept before the storm began which was before the wind but though we had sailed several hours south we could not discover any land mustapha advised us to put to windward back for he did not douht but we had overshot magazan in the storm  we were preparing to tack about when we discovered a sail within half a league of us for it was hazy weather notwithstanding the storm was over or we should have perceived her time enough to have avoided her we kept upon a wind and it freshning upon us our sail split and we found it was impossible to avoid the ship who gained upon us every moment we thought it our wisest course to lie by and wait for her now all the hope we had was that the vessel would prove a ship of europe i desired mrs villars to conceal her sex and begged the favor of the italian and mustapha to keep the secret the ship was near us and to our surprising joy hoisted french colors we immediately put on board because they lay by on purpose  we were soon informed monsieur pidau de st olon was on board the ambassador from the king of france to the emperor of morocco to treat of peace between the two crowns i immediately begged to be brought to the ambassadors presence who received us very kindly i told him all our stories but concealed that of mrs villars for fear of any accident he used us very civilly and promised us his protection he said his affair would not detain him long and he would be sure to gain safe conduct for us into our own country  i returned him thanks for his generous proffer and begged he would command my life to see how readily i would obey him he told me since i was willing to oblige him he would soon put it in my power to serve him  i have said he lost three of my retinue in the voyage two by sickness and one drowned by accident you will just make up that number and you need not take any care for habits i will provide for you the fourth person in your company i believe you will be satisfied should be taken care of on board our ship for his landing on the african coast may prove prejudicial to your affairs i was mightily pleased with his proposals and communicated it to mrs villars and our italian gentleman mrs villars told me she was entirely under my conduct and the italian thought he should have a better opportunity of getting into his own country from mequinez than france i would not suffer monsieur st olon to cloth us as he proposed for i had procured of the jew four rich suits of european clothes for a trifle which i designed for mrs villars and my self for we intended she should put off her moorish dress the first opportunity  the ambassador provided a cabin for mrs villars and me and he seemed mightily taken with her youth and beauty as a boy and he would often say nature had mistaken her designing her for the fairest of the softest sex these encomiums made me very uneasy fearing he should find out the truth but i understood afterward he had not the least mistrust  he treated us very splendidly at supper considering we were at sea when the ambassador went to rest mrs villars and i retired to the cabin allotted us what a sensible pleasure did i feel to have the happiness of her company alone without the fears and terrors of offending any one she perceived a satisfaction in my countenance that spoke the joy of my heart and by her discourse that ensued she was in some fear lest a guilty thought had worked that change  mr boil said she i hope you know what regard to pay my sex and do not wrong the good opinion i have conceived of you i own the greatest obligation to you and i am not displeased i am in your power while you use that power with moderation i had hardly the patience to hear her out madam returned i be assured your own soul shall not be more pure than my thoughts but yet i will take the freedom to declare no person in the world has that command over me as you have i must own you have it in your power to punish me by slighting a heart full of the most tender regard for you and all i ask is only leave to hope if i am denied that the utmost of my resentments to you shall only be in hating life which will be a burden not able for me long to bear it would be base in me returned mrs villars to give tormens where i am obliged i think to disguise our thoughts is an art better lost than learnt and to deal frankly with you i cannot find in my heart any aversion for you which is a declaration if you knew my temper ought to satisfy you i said all the tender things i was capable of in return for this great blessing and our conversation lasted several hours i told her at last i was well assured she wanted rest and whatever pleasure i took in her company i would deprive my self of it and leave her to her repose  she seemed very much concerned that i was obliged to leave her alone well knowing i should not get the convenience of a place to rest my self  i told her there was not any fatigue i would not undergo for her with pleasure i left her and night soon slipped away in pleasing imaginations i was surpised to see her who was ever in my thoughts come out of the cabin dressed madam said i to her i hope you have had nothing to disturb your sleep she obligingly answered me nothing but the thoughts of your waking and therefore she desired i would go and repose my self in the cabin and i think said she it is my duty to watch now i excused my self and told her it was but for one night more for in all probability we should land the next day and provide our selves with better accommodation  we went into the cabin together and our conversation chiefly centered on love she told me at last she would leave her acknowledgments to me till she was more at liberty and in her own country for fear i should imagine the need she had of my service should make her declare her self in my favor when i found so fair a beginning i was resolved to push my fortune till with many entreaties vows and oaths of my fidelity she owned to me she had a tender regard for me when she saw me first for she was convinced of my love at our first conversation not continued she that i had any understanding in the art of love but i knew the hazard you had put your self in to serve me could have no other motive but that passion and the more i thought of it the more i found my heart inclining to believe you  those persons that have felt the soft passion may make a judgment of the transports i was in at this declaration i kissed her hand a thousand times and pressed it to my heart she begged me to curb my transport for fear of being overheard or observed for continued she you may remember in my relation of my misfortunes how near we were suffering by such an oversight this kind caution bridled my tongue but could not command my eyes they spoke the language of my soul  our silent conversation was disturbed by the joy of the sailors in discovering land and we thought it prudent to wait on the ambassador and congratulate him upon it he received us very kindly and told us he was pleased upon our accounts that we might recover on shore the fatigue of the sea and our captivity the captain told us we should come to an anchor before dinner in the port of mammora i was mightily surpised to find we were got to the south of sallee and found that the tempest had drove us back beyond sallee several leagues this we still esteemed a greater happiness and if mustapha had not been guided by me we had missed the good fortune of meeting with the french vessel and of course made the port of sallee whether we would or no upon this thought i began to imagine that mustapha as understanding the mathematics knew where we were and consequently had designed to betray us i communicated my thoughts to monsieur st olon and he came into my sentiments he immediately called the captain of the ship and ordered mustapha to be strictly guarded in his absence and if any moors came on board to prevent his seeing of them but desired that he might want nothing but his liberty when we came to an anchor the captain was sent on shore to acquaint the moors with the arrival of an ambassador from france and presently the fort saluted him with one and twenty guns which was returned from the ship gun for gun the governor of mammora in an hours time came on board attended who saluted our ambassador and begged he would have patience to stay in the ship till he had acquainted the emperor his master with his arrival the ambassador invited him to an entertainment and though i observed he refused wine yet he and his retinue swallowed the punch so fast that their heads proved as light as their heels when they went on shore again the cannon of the ship gave em a salvo which was returned by the fort as soon as ever they were landed the next day an order came from the emperor that we should immediately repair to mequinez the place where the emperor resided  the next day the ambassador set forward with his whole retinue among which were mrs villars the italian and my self dressed richly after the european fashion we were provided with dromedaries to carry us all but the ambassador who was presented with an arabian courser within a mile or two of mequinez we perceived the king at the head of his army in a great plain at first i thought it a mark of respect to the ambassador of france but found it was purely accident for our guide led us out of the way to avoid em  when we arrived at mequinez we were led to a house belonging to the french consul or rather a house he had hired for that occasion before we were well entered the house a guard of moors was fixed upon us and strict orders given not a soul should stir out not even the ambassador nor consul i thought this an odd proceeding and sometimes imagined it was upon our account as fear is an expeditious painter but my timerity vanished when monsieur st olon informed me it was the moorish custom not to let a foreign ambassador give or receive visits till after his first audience  mrs villars and i had one apartment allotted us with but one bed in it after the moorish manner she told me she could not bear the thoughts of my watching every night and begged i would go to rest with the italian but we found he was provided of a companion one of the retinue and there was no help for it i always retired when my mistress undressed herself and gave her time to go into bed i then with a quilt laid my self down on the floor but was far from taking any repose the thoughts of the woman i loved being so near me naked in bed kindled such a desire in my breast and the pain i took to smother it perfectly burnt me up i would have my readers excuse me if they are disobliged at any part of my story because i am only relating matters of fact  the next day when i rose from my boarded bed i retired to give the loadstone of my desires time to dress her self when i entered the room again she observed my countenance very attentively and told me she was grieved to find in my features something that spoke a disordered body which i am sure said she is for want of rest but added she i beg it as a favor you will immediately undress your self and go into bed and try to repose your self and i will make your excuse to the ambassador i refused it a great while but in short she forced me to comply with her commands i went to bed but new thoughts again attacked me and drove sleep away mrs villars had retired and staid about an hour when she came in again she stole softly for fear of disturbing me my mind was so violently agitated that i really began to be out of order and feverish which she observed and came to the bedside and with a tender inquietude asked me how i did i took hold of her hand pressed it to my lips and thanked her for her kind care of me alas she cried you are very much indisposed and i am the cause of it upon this the tears ran down her cheeks like morning dew on roses her tenderness gave me all the joy imaginable and as she leaned her head over me weeping i pressed her soft lips close to mine which plunged my soul in ecstasies of joy she blushed at my freedom yet still begged i would try to sleep i told her it was impossible while she was there upon this she was going to retire in haste but i caught her by the soft hand and told her if she went out it would be a greater impossibility for me to rest she conjured me by that love i professed if it was not a falsehood to declare to her the torments of my mind she insisted so much upon it that i told her the secret of my heart she fell upon her knees and begged i would not mention it any more for she owned her self so much obliged to me there was not any thing in her power she could refuse me but that i begged her pardon and had resolved to suffer death sooner than to have disclosed my malady but i would be ever silent upon that theme till she commanded me to speak my dear boil said she i am not ashamed to call you so stay till we arrive in england and i here vow to make you mine whenever you shall command me upon saying this she joined her lips to mine not considering that in endeavoring to suppress my flame she poured oil upon it and made it burn the fiercer i told her true love was above nice formality and that marriages were made in heaven said she i hope they are but beg by both our loves to drop this theme i told her i would though death should follow i remained silent for some time while tears stopped her speech we were interrupted by a messenger from the ambassador who came to invite us to dinner for he always did us the favor of dining at his table i begged to be excused for i found my self a little indisposed the messenger had not been gone a moment before the ambassador came in to enquire after my health and brought his physician with him who feeling my pulse told him i was in a fever but bleeding he did not doubt would give me ease i told him i should be better in the morning if not i would take his advice the ambassador would have mr villars as we had named her to dinner with him who had endeavored to compose her self while they had been in the room as she was going from me she squeezed my hand and said endeavor to compose your self to rest and you will soon be better  they retired and left me to my own thoughts which were various and disjointed mrs villars did not stay long she came in softly as before expecting that i might have been asleep when she found i was in the same disorder she burst into tears and cried will nothing satisfy you but my undoing no madam said i i will fight with my desires and am resolved to conquer or die she staid with me till supper and our whole discourse was upon the passion of love when she came back from supper i had got up and had dressed my self but the combat in my mind had really disordered my body which she soon saw she begged i would go to bed again and she would watch me i told her the world should not prevail upon me to break her rest nor even she her self who was more to me than the world i had sat me down upon the bed and mrs villars came and sat down by me we remained silent a considerable time at last she took my hands in hers and pressed me by the fingers  mr boil said she i have overcome my self i cannot see you in this torture of body and mind and not contribute to your ease here solemnly swear to be my husband and do with me what you please i hope you are a man of honor and that is what i rely upon nothing in this world could have transported me so much as those few words did i fell upon my knees kissed her hands and did i know not what madam said i you have made me the happiest man the world contains and if i thought my heart and tongue did not agree in what i am going to say i would pull em both out this moment when i had said this i fell on my knees and made this short vow thou god that know the heart of man i do beseech thee punish me with eternity of torments if ever i prove false to this darling of my soul who before thee i take as the greatest blessing to be my lawful wife and here i swear said she kneeling to take no other to my bed and heart and with this kiss said she i seal the sacred union i told her nothing could be more binding and the priest could but confirm what we had done already  now the tender moment was approaching to crown my joys with all i wished on earth kings on their thrones to me seemed poor and base and i would not have changed to be the monarch of the universe i begged my dear bride i might be her bridemaid as well as husband and that she would give me leave to undress her said she my love my life my husband i am to obey you in every thing that is in my power and when i fail in my obedience may i be miserable in the loss of you i was too eager to say any thing in return but i undressed her put her to bed and you may be sure i did not stay long behind the veil of night was drawn round us and i plunged into a sea of pleasures too delicate for words to express  the next day the ambassador saw contentment in both our faces and congratulated me for the recovery of my health never was there so tender a wife and the longer i had the happiness of enjoyment the more my love was raised the next day the ambassador was to have his first audience and we were all to be in readiness by seven in the morning i got up early and dressed my dear wife in a new suit of clothes on purpose for this occasion the governor of alcassar hamet addo riffy was to be our master of the ceremonies who attended us with several moors of quality and a troop of the kings blacks as guards we set forward about eight aclock in this order   twelve of the moor guards   several of the nobility two by two   the ambassador with hamet addo riffy on his right hand preceded by two trumpets and kettledrums the post of honor is on the left among moors because you have the command of their sword   twentyfour gentlemen of the ambassadors train two by two   twelve french slaves that carried the presents   twelve more of the guards and the order was closed by a moorish mob that abused us with their tongues all they could nay some of them attempted to throw stones but were bastinadod by the guards we were all on foot though the kings palace was a mile from the place where we set out  i was mightily concerned at the fatigue my dear wife underwent for it was violent hot though we had the best on it for going next the ambassador who ordered we should do so we had some shelter from the umbrella that was carried over his head  we entered the palace through the marble gate so called from two marble pillars that adorn it and from thence immured with white walls and black guards on each side we arrived at a stately pavilion where a halt was commanded till the king was acquainted with our arrival we waited some time but at last saw him coming mounted on a white horse through one of the avenues that led to the pavilion his guards who had lined that passage on each side bowed down to the ground as he passed along he made but a very indifferent appearance as soon as he came to the portico he gave a lance that he bore to one of his guard got from his horse and squatted down upon the floor without any thing under him he had nothing in his dress to be distinguished from the rest of his subjects but was muffled up to the eyes with a chocolatecolour handkerchief that did not seem over clean his legs and arms were bare as to his age he seemed to be about fifty of a very tawny complexion and very lean his hair black inclining to gray of a middle stature with hollow cheeks and eyes black a small hooked nose and thick lips some of his courtiers sat down on each side of him bareleggd and bareheaded and behind him stood a black with a great fan in his hand not only to cool him but to keep off the muskitos a small fly very troublesome in most parts of africa  mahumet ben addo otar his chief minister and favorite was the only person that stood  as soon as the emperor had squatted down on the floor he repeated these words in arabic three times tay buon which is as much as to say you are welcome a common expression when they are addressed to by a foreigner then our ambassador made a long speech in french prepared for that purpose which was only a panegyric upon both kings fulsome enough but the french deal much in wordy compliments the interpreter when the ambassador had done read the same in arabic to the emperor the speech was very long in french and arabic but the emperor heard it out patiently which was reckoned a good omen he also excused himself that he did not admit him sooner to his audience it being their ramadan or easter when the compliments were over the ambassador presented all his retinue to the emperor but i observed he took a particular notice of my wife and eyed her several times which gave me a great deal of uneasiness for it is as dangerous to be a handsome man as a handsome woman in morocco if the brute of an emperor should have a fancy for em  i longed to have an end of our audience  after we were presented the ambassador ordered his presents to be opened and spread before the emperor which consisted of fine arms made at paris several english watches and cloth two persian carpets and two pieces of gold and silver brocade the emperor in return gave the ambassador four young slaves three of em french though he took em all for the same nation but the other was an englishman and the same person i mentioned in the beginning of this relation who went in the same boat on board of the success i was very much confounded at seeing him well knowing he was on board when i fell out of the ship i longed for an opportunity to confer with him though i could not perceive by his looks that he knew me but that might be from my change of habit and the suns tarnishing my complexion  the emperor rose when he had given the slaves mounted and rode off and we went home in the same order as we came there only the chief minister mahumet ben addo otar accompanied the ambassador as far as the marble gate i informed my dear wife when we came to our lodging the anxiety i was in when the emperor eyed her she told me she had made the same observation with much uneasiness for said she i had not the presence of mind upon the instant to imagine my self a man however we both wished our selves on board and the embassy well over and then we might make ourselves merry with our fears  the next day our fears were much increased for hearing a noise in the street we went to look out to know the reason and discovered hamet our irish renegado with several prisoners manacled we soon retired again but learnt by other people that they were going to the emperor that he might make his choice the sight of him renewed our fears as i said and we resolved immediately to get leave to go on board for fear of some unlucky turn of fortune  i upon the instant went to wait on the ambassador and declared to him what i had seen begging leave at the same time we might be suffered to go on board he told me he would comply with my request for mr villars and the italian but begged it as a favor that i would stay with him for he should have great need of my assistance and if any thing should fall out he would engage for my liberty though the request cut me to the heart yet it was neither prudence nor good manners to refuse him i gave him my promise to obey his commands but begged he would not insist upon my going abroad but as seldom as possible i went to my wife my readers perhaps may smile at my calling her wife but i will assure em we thought our selves as much married as if the parson had executed his holy function nevertheless we did not intend to neglect that ceremony the very first opportunity and told her the ambassadors request and my promise she agreed with me in the reasonableness of it but yet could not forbear shedding floods of tears at our we hoped short separation the next day was designed for their journey but the ensuing night was spent with sighs tears and a lowness of spirit that looked ominous yet we parted and for several hours i could not bring my mind to any peaceable form to wait on the ambassador but he sent for me at last and told me the reason of his desiring me to continue with him was this   the king his master had commanded him to make some observation of the customs and manners of this part of africa and added he i have observed in you a capacity fit to assist me in the design i told him he might command me in any thing that lay in my power and that i took it for an honor he would think me worth his employment  we had notice the next day from the person that attended my wife with the camels that he saw them safe on board which gave me some comfort i begged the ambassador to give me leave to speak a word or two with one of the slaves that the emperor gave him he ordered him to come before him where i desired he would tell me how he came into the hands of the moors he was prodigiously surpised to see me there and could hardly believe his eyes for it was thought by every body that i had either been killed or drowned as indeed it was very improbable to think otherwise he informed us that three days after the success parted with the spanish man of war another algerine rover met with them and took em after an obstinate fight the captain and several others being slain in the battle it was his good fortune to be bought for the emperors use i call it good fortune said he because i was presented to the french ambassador and am now in hopes of my freedom  i told the ambassador in french what he said and he was pleased to say that to oblige me he would take him into his protection i remembered mahumet ben addo otar was ambassador in england he came to visit the ambassador often and understanding english i gathered several good hints for his design for he was courteous enough though an enemy in his heart to the english  i think it will not be much amiss here to give the reader a succinct account of the customs and manners of the moors of fez and morocco and we will first begin from their last revolution  muley ismael the present emperor of morocco pretends to derive his birth from mahomet himself he was son to muley xerif king of taphilet but was succeeded by muley archyd who died with a debauch he made among his courtiers  his unexpected death in      gave room for many of his family to raise rebellion in their several provinces but muley ismael being the greatest favorite of the people and of an enterprising temper proclaimed himself king of taphilet and seized his brothers treasures which are the sinews of war his nephew muley hamet gave him the most trouble for he had gained a party and declared himself king of sus and morocco had several battles but at last was overcome as well as the rest and ismael was settled the peaceful king of taphilet morocco and fez i have given a description of his person already his empire spreads from north to south four hundred leagues from east to west upwards of a hundred and fifty  there are three strong places possessed by the europeans on the coast of afric first magazan on the ocean by the portuguese and on the mediterranean melissa and ceuta by the spaniards they had two more strong holds larache and mammora but the present emperor drove them out shamefully and tangier once belonged to the english who abandoned it a few years ago first demolishing the fortifications  the emperor has but nine seaports in his whole dominions viz sancta cruz safy sallee mammora larache arzilla and tangier on the afric ocean zaffarina and tetuan on the mediterranean though tetuan is two leagues within land to begin in order as they are named sancta cruz or the holy cross is the first port to the southward the town is about a mile in length and a quarter broad the chief merchants are jews who trade with england and holland their vent is hides dates copper and beeswax  safy or sophia appears next a town situated on a hill but drives a larger trade than sancta cruz  sallee situated    leagues s w of cape spartel it is divided into two towns the old and the new it is called by the natives arbat there is a very good harbor and a strong castle well stored with guns if the moors knew how to make use of them the town is large and well inhabited but the walls are all demolished i observed the ruins of a church the steeple yet standing a noble fine gothic building the chief trade of this town consists in the prizes that are brought in by their galleys  about seven leagues more to the north stands mammora once possessed by the spaniards it stands in a bottom surrounded with mountains which renders the air very unwholesome by reason of the excessive heat but the bay is fine large and secure from all winds this town is generally the high road to mequinez the present capital of morocco  the next port northward is larache a town of a pleasant situation and strongly fortified but to the eternal infamy of the spaniards delivered up to ismael after a siege of five moons two thousand soldiers and a hundred officers taken prisoners a sufficient force to have defended it against the whole powers of muley ismael for they neither wanted provisions nor ammunition but we shall leave them and their cowardice and go on to  arzilla or azilath about twelve leagues more north a place only famed for tobacco which they seldom trade abroad for having sufficient vent for it among the natives of morocco and as we have but little business with it well come to  tangier as fast as we can a fine large wellfortified city when in the hands of the english but since they have left it and razed the fortifications the moors have not thought fit to repair it  the next zaffarina is a place of very little note and therefore we shall make no observation concerning it  the last is tetuan a town six miles within land without any fortification the inhabitans came originally from the province of andalusia in spain as indeed did most of the moors on the seacoasts of africa they are white men pretty well civilized very kind to strangers and christians and pay but little regard to the emperor of morocco  as to the nature of the inhabitants they are most of a tawny complexion of a lazy idle disposition and cursed with all the vices of mankind mistrustful to the last degree false jealous and the very picture of ignorance they style themselves mussulmen or true believers yet their word is not to be relied upon on any occasion the moors are generally but indifferent soldiers and but seldom brave they are often famed in the spanish histories for men of gallantry but i could never find them inclined that way they manage a horse it must be confessed with a great deal of dexterity they abominate the christians for the very word signifies in their language dog and are continually seeking means to destroy them mahomet has taught em in his alcoran that all of his faith who dye fighting against the christians immediately enter into paradise in triumph nay even their horses if they did in battle are immediately translated into heaven for they hope to have the pleasure of riding there as well as on earth  though poligamy is allowed yet they must marry but four wives and must settle a dowry upon them and if they ever put em away they must return their dowry along with em but they may keep as many concubines as they think fit though they have this privilege when they can please em no longer they sell em to the best bidder so that the women of morocco in my opinion have but a sad time on it yet the husband is obliged to keep all their children they esteem idiots and naturals to be saints if they are men for they believe the women have no souls and are only formed for propagation they will not allow em to enter their mosques because they esteem em incapable of being received into heaven yet they say their prayers at home and on fridays resort to the places of burial to weep over the graves of their deceased friends clothed in blue which is their mourning they hire professed mourners to grieve and cry at the graves of relations and howl over them as i have heard the irish asking them why they would die when they were provided with every thing that was necessary in this world their time is spent in eating drinking sleeping dallying with their women horses and prayers for they never learn to read and are forbid gaming and even their prayers are hurried over so slothfully as if they were asleep  they have usually a string of beads in their hands like the roman catholics and to every bead they have a short prayer which as they repeat they drop through their fingers the prayer consists only in the different attributes of god as god is great god is good god is infinite god is merciful the emperor of these wretches only differs from his subjects in a larger propensity to their ill qualities with the addition of a degree of cruelty and avarice i was told that during his twenty years reign he had murdered with his own hands twenty three thousand men nay i am apt to believe the truth of it for he put forty seven to death in the one and twenty days we were at his court  every nation is amazed to find his subjects so submissive and patient under so excessive and cruel a tyranny but they should understand bating their want of power that they are taught to believe if they fall by the hand of a king who is a xerif which signifies mahomets successor they immediately go up to heaven and if there is any that would not willingly be sent to heaven before their time they are sure to fly him when he is clothed in yellow which is his color of murder and he generally dies it of a bloodcolour before he goes to sleep  as i was viewing some new buildings one day near the kings palace i perceived him giving directions to some of the workmen there were several carts drove by his slaves with materials for his building and as they passed him he bastinadod some for going too fast while others thinking to mend that fault were drubbd by him for going too slow one poor creature trembling for fear of what would follow went bowing before his cart but the emperor wounding the horse in the flank he gave a spring tumbled the wretch down and drove over him another following him ran to assist his fellow but the emperor threw his dart and struck him in the shoulder the slave drew it out and upon his knees presented it to him again which the emperor when the man had got some distance from him darted into his chine the fool drew it out once more and covered with blood gave it to him back again but as he was stooping he fell down with loss of blood at the barbarians feet who did him the favor to pin him to the earth through his back  i was so shocked at the sight that i could not recover my self for a good while afterward i thought the poor fellow was a fool for if it had been my own case i would have returned it through his body the first time for he was sure of dying and i think it would have been some satisfaction to have sent the author of my death the same journey  this king used to murder his slaves upon the least complaint from the moors which they would make out of hatred to christians but the wretch finding his slaves decrease too much took another method and when the next complaint was made he killed the slave the person complained against but ordered the complainant immediately to pay him double the price he cost him or find him two more slaves in his room that instant which he was obliged to do but this proceeding stopped their mouths for the future  they say he has a great deal of wit and courage is very active and expert in riding and hurling the dart he drinks no wine because his religion forbids it but when he takes opium or drinks a certain mixture that he makes himself compounded with brandy cinnamon cloves anniseed and nutmegs woe be to him that comes in his way he is much addicted to women having no less than four hundred concubines he has one hundred and eighteen male children alive and about two hundred females one of the males whom he designs for his successor and which he had by a black who advises him in every thing and is reckoned a politic woman he has named muley zeyden his revenue consists in presents from the governors of his provinces and the arabians who live in huts about his dominions when he has a mind to squeeze he sends for a governor from his province who knows well enough what he is sent to for and therefore provides accordingly so that the emperor fleeces the governors and they fleece the people so that there is no one rich but himself and yet he does not know what use to put his treasure to but hides it in secret places and the person that assists him in the concealment is sure to lose his life for his assistance  mequinez the capital and the place of his residence was formerly but a small village but now it contains six hundred thousand inhabitants and the streets are so crowded there is hardly any passing along it is but a mean city very ill built and if there falls any rain the dirtiest place i ever set my foot in for there is no pavement in the streets and when it is dry the dust is ready to choke one the kings palace is indeed a very large place almost four miles round including his gardens but it is very ill contrived here you shall see a fine pillar added to support an old ruinated place and yet he employs most of his time in building in short it looks like gold lace upon a hopsack  his stables are the most regular building in all his palace but that is no wonder for the moors even reverence horses and one that has been a pilgrimage to mecca has as much veneration as the pilgrim himself the king had one of these horses which i have seen always finely caparisond and a slave to attend who carried a pot and a cloth to keep him clean all the horses that are thus sanctified are usually freed from all manner of service and if the owner cannot afford to keep it which often happens there is a pension settled upon em by the mufty  the jews drive a great trade here but they pay sufficiently for that privilege for they are obliged to wear black caps that they may be distinguished and notwithstanding their great trade they are but scurvily used for if a child insults em it is as much as their lives are worth to resist  the women of morocco i mean all that i had the fortune to see were very handsome fine large full eyes round faces and every feature exact they are very amorous and dexterous in contriving methods to satisfy their desires  a gentleman of our retinue told me he had got an intrigue with one of the moorish women daughter to a governor of a province and his manner of going to the appointment was in disguise she sent him by a french slave of hers a complete womans dress which are generally all alike and their faces are all muffled up to their eyes so that they are often met by their own husbands in the street without being known by this dress he got admittance as a lady coming to pay a visit and then they are very secure for it is the custom whenever a man even the husband finds a pair of womens sandals at the door of his wifes chamber he must retire for it is the greatest affront they can put on a woman to enter her apartment when they have that warning to the contrary he told me she was a delicious creature and mistress of the whole art of love it is no wonder if they give themselves up to love when perhaps there are twenty or more according to the capacity of the person that keeps em sharers in one single man and they must be contented to stay for due benevolence till their tyrant pleases to send for em  the habit of the men is generally white which is a color they extremely delight in with a red cap on their heads that is the married men for all the youth from the prince to the beggar before wedlock go uncovered they are close shaved under their caps excepting one lock upon the crown of their heads which they never cut off being they are taught by that lock mahomet is to draw em up to their imaginary paradise they only shave under their chins but suffer their beards and mustachoes to grow which they take a particular pride in the length or largeness of and he that is well bearded must be a wise man  their shirts are made like shifts only the sleeves are so long that they hang down over their hands under the shirt they were linen drawers that reach down to their knees for their legs are always bare their shoes are made without heels like irish brogues over the shirt is a vest without sleeves which they surround with a silk scarf of what color they please except green which is a color sacred to mahomet their emperor and the clergy in this they thrust short daggers or knives over all is a garment which they call a hayick about five else long and four broad which they wrap round em as we do our cloaks some of the meaner sort especially in the country wear strawhats of their own make their dresses are all alike only some add a gold or silver fringe round the border  as for religion they rise early and late to prayers but only like children do it because they are ordered their mufti or head of their religion is reckoned the first in the empire and disowns the emperors authority but yet he finds means to fleece him as well as the rest of his subjects who obey him out of fear for if there was one person found to love him it would be as strange a sight as one of their monsters  i could not forbear smiling to see the providence of the moors walking one day about a mile from mequinez it began to rain prodigiously i got under a tree to shelter my self from the tempest but i observed several of the natives undress themselves with a great deal of precipitation make up their clothes in a bundle and sit on em stark naked and all their care was to keep em from the wet leaving their naked bodies exposed to the fury of the storm when it ceased they walked a little way till their bodies were dry and then dressed themselves if a man were to do so in england he would be counted a madman or a fool yet i must own i thought em in the right for be the storm ever so violent yet when it is over they pursue their journey with dry clothes on their backs but they have one convenience they are dressed and undrest in half a minute nay i am informed those that travel on camels or on horseback have a convenience covered with an oiled cloth in which they thrust their clothes on the like occasion and ride naked i fancy to meet an army in a storm would create a terrible fright and do as much execution to an ignorant body as their offensive arms and force em to seek for safety in their heels  the emperor is able to raise an hundred thousand horse and fifty thousand foot when they are to make war among themselves they go very unwillingly into the field but when they oppose the christians they do it with a great deal of cheerfulness because they expect indulgences for the expiation of their sins when they are ready to give battle they range their armies after this manner they divide their horse into two bodies and place one at each wing the foot is in the middle so that the whole forms a crescent or half moon before they begin the battle they give a great shout then make a short prayer and fall on without much order very furiously so that they soon overcome or are as soon put to flight break but their foremost ranks and you put their whole body into confusion  i have said before that no person is rich but the emperor neither do they take the methods to be so or if they are their greatest wisdom will be to conceal it for if once known they are sure to lose all their wealth  no foreign coin is current in morocco except spanish pieces of eight which are only received by weight but the jews will secretly take any coin and i suppose dispose of it again with the same circumspection they receive it they have but three sorts of coin current among em the first a ducat of barbary gold second a blanquile of silver and last a felowze of copper the image of the emperor is not allowed to be put on their money being expressly forbid by mahomet in his alcoran but they stamp em with arabian characters their way of reckoning is by the ounce  these are the heads of what i observed in my small stay among em the ambassador informed me he was in some fear that his embassy would not succeed for he said he found little else but delays excuses and nothing of sincerity among em we were informed that the emperor designed to go speedily upon an expedition against the moors of the province of oran who had newly revolted and put to death their governor for his avarice he having extorted from em vast sums of money and the inhabitants after his death chose one of their own province to command em this hastened our ambassador in his legation to get an answer one way or other but we were informed the king designed to set out the next day upon his expedition and yet the ambassador had not his audience of leave this made him and us very uneasy for we could not stir from mequinez without the emperors express leave but about seven in the evening the ambassador had orders to come and take his last audience which was the ninth of june      we went in the same manner as we did at first but we were informed by our interpreter that the king was in a very ill humor and that he had but an hour before killed two of his chief blacks by stabbing em with a dagger he continually wore at his girdle  we entered the palace further than the first time where we waited a full half hour at last the emperor approached richly dressed and finely mounted upon a white barbary the saddle and other accoutrements wrought with gold and precious stones in several places he was this day in his yellow or fatal vest and sprinkled in many places with the blood of those he had slain and i thought his countenance had something more of horror in it than at our first audience he had a spear in his hand set round with pearls on the top and a cap with estriches feathers waving in the wind all his attendants had fled his presence at the notice of his having on his yellow vest and he had only about a dozen of his guards waiting upon him trembling but the alcaydes and other great men crept about us during our audience  the emperor begun with his old compliment of youre welcome but his looks and his words i thought did but ill agree the ambassador used many arguments with him to bring his embassy to a happy issue but to no purpose the ambassador told me the king was a person that had not the least regard to his word and even disowned a letter he had written to his master the king of france therefore said he well take our leave of this country of monsters in two days for the king had signed his departure with all his retinue  i was very well pleased with this his resolution for now i should once more see that treasure of my soul whose absence had robbed me of all joy i even thought these two days the longest of my life but at last they were past and we set out very merrily at least i did and all the rest of the retinue though i must own i could not answer for the ambassador for i believe the ill success of his embassy had a little chagrind him i did my utmost endeavor to divert his melancholy upon the road which he took very kindly we lay in tents the first night which the ambassador had taken care to provide us and provision likewise for there is never an inn between mequinez and mammora  we rose the next day very early that we might avoid the heat of the sun when we came within a league of the town we saw coming toward us our italian and by the melancholy in his looks i began to tremble with apprehension of some accident as soon as he approached us after paying his obedience to the ambassador he addressed himself to me said he in french  i wish some one else would have taken my commission upon em for what i have to tell you will cut you to the heart the various troubles in my breast locked up my tongue so that i had not power to ask him any questions in short said he your mistress is forced away from us through the treachery of mustapha at hearing this fatal news i dropped senseless from my camel nor came to my self till we arrived at mammora i was a thousand times going to destroy my self and i believe i had done it in the height of my despair if i had not been withheld in short the ambassador was no longer ignorant of my cruel loss for in my ravings i had called her my dear wife he seemed amazed at the discovery and reproached me in a handsome manner for not trusting him with the secret i was not in a condition to beg his pardon neither was there any one could give me comfort i was carried on board where i inquired in what manner she was taken away  the captain informed us that mustapha had made his escape out of the cabin window by swimming i did not tell any one of it said the captain because i thought it would be to no purpose for i imagined there could be no other ill consequence to attend his escape but merely the loss of him he had been gone three days when on the fourth there came on board us the governor of mammora the fugitive mustapha and one hundred soldiers who immediately seized on the young gentleman whom they said was a woman and wise to a renegado of sallee it was in vain to oppose em especially when i found by her breasts that she was really a woman they took her on shore notwithflanding all her cries shrieks and lamentations which pierced our very hearts they put her on board a saick and set sail immediately steering south as we suppose for the port of sallee this gentleman meaning the italian took it upon him to acquaint you with the unhappy accident but added he i believe it is not possible to regain her the ambassador was so good as to offer his assistance in what lay in his power i begged he would be pleased to lend me a boat with some hands to work her he very willingly granted my request and told me he would lend me the ship but he feared it might occasion a more public quarrel  he lent me ten hands four patareros and sufficient small arms with every thing that was necessary my kind italian would accompany me and the rest of the company went voluntary we spent but little time in fitting out and the wind proving favorable we set sail and made very good way the saick had not pursued her voyage above five hours before us so that we had hopes of getting up with em i encouraged my companions who labored incessantly we sailed and rowed all night and when the morning dawned we gained sight of a vessel which we did not doubt was that we sought for we labored hard to come up with her and gained upon her every moment before eight aclock we came a long side of her and i soon discovered mustapha giving orders about the engagement i drew out a pair of pistols and shot him dead the rest fired upon us but notwithstanding all their opposition i jumped into their vessel followed by the italian and five more of the men and though they were superior in number yet we soon made em ask for quarter i upon the instant inquired for her that was always in my thoughts but to my great grief was informed by an english slave at the oar that she was taken on board of a galley by captain hamet our irish renegado and they assured me it was impossible for em to be overtaken unspeakable was the sorrow i felt at this relation and all the satisfaction i felt was that i had rewarded mustapha for his treachery we steered our course back but i was more dead than alive in the voyage  when we came on board the ambassador condold with me for my misfortune and entreated me to take comfort i told him death was now my only comfort and i hoped he was not far off  our italian had agreed for his passage on board a vessel in the bay bound for rome he begged that i would accompany him into italy and when he had settled his affairs he would if it lay in his power come back to sallee and do his endeavor to find what was become of mrs villars i thanked him for his offer and told him i would accept of it i had effects enough having all the money and jewels we brought from hamets country house we took leave of the ambassador and gave him abundance of thanks for his civilities and went on board the vessel that waited for us we set sail immediately and in two months safely arrived at rome where our italian did not care to go publicly on shore but stayed till the darkness of the night favored our landing  we had all our goods disembarkd and took a private lodging in an obscure part of the city where we were sure of being concealed we asked our landlord who was a frenchman about the news of the place he told us a great deal of idle stuff which signified nothing to us at last by the advice of the italian i inquired of him if hernando alvares were in town or no he answered me that he had been dead above two months and had left a noble estate behind him i asked him if he had not left a wife to possess it no said he  about three years ago continued our landlord he was to have been married to a beautiful young lady an heiress to a vast fortune but his brother stepped in between and gained her affection some say they were married and others not but she was delivered of a fine boy don hernando took a barbarous revenge of his brother as it is reported he bribed a captain of a vessel to put a weight about his neck and drown him in the sea but to make amends for this inhuman act he has left his vast estate to the son his brother had by the lady and has chosen his holiness the pope for his guardian pray said i what is become of the young lady he answered me he could not tell but it is supposed she was gone into a nunnery  the italian while our discourse lasted had turned his face to the window that we might not perceive the disorder of his countenance as soon as our landlord was gone he turned to me and embraced me said he my dear friend let what will happen to me i shall have it in my power to serve you with my fortune and so much i think my self obliged to you that if half will buy your mistresss liberty you shall command it i returned him the acknowledgments his kind proffer deserved but told him i could not expect to be so happy he bid me not despair i begged he would not mention any thing of my affairs till his own came to a lucky issue  the next day we procured our selves habits after the mode of rome and resolved to go to grimaldis country house to hear if it were possible some tidings of isabella  antonio had dressed himself in a mean habit and appeared as my servant it being but six pleasant miles we had resolved to walk it we entered a village within half a mile of the place and resolved to dine at a poor inn there to gain some intelligence i went for a french merchant and don antonio passed as i said for my servant and interpreter and informed me of the discourse that past between em that gentleman meaning me says he to our host has some business to communicate to don antonio grimaldi for we knew of his being there our innkeeper told us it would be a difficult matter to talk to him about business now for he was that very evening going to set out with his daughter in order to put her into a nunnery at naples for all his persuasions added he cannot prevail upon her but she is fixed unalterably in her resolution this news you may be sure hastened our departure but we did not well know how to disclose the secret we had to unfold  don antonio as not doubting isabellas affection to him was fearful lest an abrupt discovery should have some strange effect upon her we therefore resolved that i should first appear and break the matter by degrees for he had informed me that she spoke french very well when we approached the house antonio stood at some distance while i went up to the door alone the porter and i not understanding one another i had like to have returned as wise as i came but at last a servant in the family happening to understand french came and ended our sputtring at one another i informed him i had a secret of the greatest importance to declare to donna isabella he told me he would acquaint his lord with it the servant went in and immediately returned with a grave old gentleman that seemed to have been weeping he asked me in french what i had to say to his daughter for she did not care to speak to any one i begged that i might be brought to her presence and did not doubt but that i had something to say to her which would not displease her don antonio grimaldi gravely smilld and shook his head no no sir said he you have nothing to give either her or me comfort unless you could revive the dead i answered him he did not know what i could do but i told him the longer he delayed my seeing her the longer he deferred their own happiness well said he i have no hopes but you shall see my daughter to convince you that nothing in this world can make us happy  he led me through several stately apartments all hung with black and though it was high noon yet the suns light was excluded and dim twinkling lamps usurped his room at last we entered a chamber where sat the fair forlorn i stopped a moment to behold her and notwithstanding a fixed melancholy on her countenance beauty triumphed there she was caressing an infant she had in her arms the father entered first and told her in french that a gentleman of france had a secret to communicate to her that would banish her melancholy the gentleman returned the lady may promise impossibilities but rather than expose him i would beg him not to open his mouth upon that subject madam said i i own my self a physician but i pretend to cure the mind as well as the body and to acquaint you with what you know already you mourn the loss of a gentleman that you imagine was drowned at sea but i can assure you he escaped that danger and is now a captive in barbary pining under the severest want and all the hope he has of freedom is through your means  the lady upon this looked wishfully upon her father and said dear father dont endeavor to deceive me any longer you know i have your promise and my times expired my dear child i am amazed as much as you can be returned the father for by all that is holy i never saw this gentleman in my life before and am so far from believing him that begging his pardon i fancy there must be some very great mistake in it upon this i related to them all his story from the beginning to our meeting in barbary  i found my relation had staggered her faith a little for a pleasing hope rectified by powerful fear rose in her beautiful face and she threw her self at my feet notwithstanding all my endeavors to the contrary dear sir said she do not show me this light of comfort to put it out and plunge me into eternal darkness madam said i by heaven and heavenly powers i have seen him within these two months and what i have related to you his own mouth informed me and having gained my liberty i made him a promise to see his friends in italy and inform them of his condition the transports and ecstasies that took possession of both their souls cannot be expressed by words they embraced me kissed me called me their preserver unlookdfor happiness said isabella heaven thou have heard my prayers and does my dear antonio live i will immediately imbark for barbary and fetch him thence my self even all that i am worth my precious boy shall sell his fortune too to redeem his father o my young antonio heaven has restored thy father from the dead said she to her child and i hope we shall see him again the pretty innocent mingled his tears of joy with theirs after their first transports were over they again embraced me and begged i would put em in a way to pay me the obligations they owed me then they proceeded to enquire which way they must go about to accomplish his liberty i told em i had a servant waiting without that i intended should accompany the persons they would send to manage the affair they seemed to reproach me for letting him wait without and were immediately sending for him in i begged they would give me leave to go for him my self being he was a foreigner and they would find it a hard matter to make him understand them upon this i ran out and called to antonio and told him in few words how things stood he followed me close at the heels i went into the room first and as antonio grimaldi was giving him his hand to lead him in he fell upon his knees before him isabella casting her eyes upon him gave a shriek and cried out it is he it is he himself my dear antonio joy took away her speech and she fell down in a trance he ran and caught her in his arms kissed and embraced her and at last brought her to herself imagination must make up the discourse between em he told her at last when words of sense took place that he was obliged to me for his liberty for he had sent several letters to his sisters but never could get any answer they informed him that both his sisters were gone to reside at venice with their husbands and that was the reason his letters never came to their hands now said antonio if my friend meaning me was but happy it would complete my joy but to find a wife a son and father kind when i had many reasons to think the contrary must have some alloy or it would not be possible for me to bear it  antonio upon this related my unhappy story and they all lamented my hard fortune he afterward inquired of his dear isabella concerning her own sufferings which she readily began  said she that day you left me the troubles of my mind wrought so much upon my body that the physicians declared i was in a violent fever and advised my father to send me into the country which he accordingly did the next day the thoughts of being so far from my dear antonio increased my malady and my father had little hopes of my life my fever after having brought me to the brink of the grave left me and my father imagining it was the approaching marriage had wrought this sudden illness told me one day that if it was that which lay so heavy upon my spirits he would remove it by giving me the power of refusing to be the wife of hernando alvarez i thanked him and told him he had taken the only way to restore my health and that if i was forced to wed him i should be for ever miserable he was the tenderest of fathers and informed me he would never force my inclinations the kindness my father showed me worked so much upon me that i began to recover  your brother used often to visit me in my illness which retarded my health my father seeing it would never be in my power to like him very frankly told him so and begged that he would discontinue his visits for he was resolved his daughter should never give her hand where it was not in her power to give her heart they parted with many words between them but my father persisted in his resolution  i began to discover that i was with child and a new sort of an illness seized me i knew this was an accident that could not long be concealed therefore i resolved to let you know my condition and i gained my woman by several promises of a reward to deliver a letter to you but she betrayed me to your brother which i suspected from her not appearing i therefore declared the truth to my indulgent father he was very much enraged at the discovery but paternal love prevailing over his passion he forgave me and promised to make me happy with my dear antonio these promises made my sickness vanish and i had no other disease but what attends breeding women my father went to rome to enquire for don antonio but could not get the least information of him this gave me a new shock but what bitter agonies did i feel when i received a letter from your brother with a copy of that i had written to you enclosed which was as follows  ungrateful woman yet i will no more upbraid thee but let thy crime be thy punishment he that betrayed me i will not call by the name of brother he has paid for his ingratitude with his life i only give thee this notice that thou may feel some of those pangs thou have thrust into the breast of  hernando alvares   the reading of this letter sunk me down and i called for death as my last and only hope i resolved to refuse all food and had starved my self to death if a good priest had not convinced me by his arguments my soul was in danger and i should be guilty of a double murder my self and infant i lingered on in a restless state of unhappiness till the time of my delivery came which i prayed to heaven to end with my life but it pleased the almighty power to spare me to be happy  the sight of my precious infant called to mind the loss of his father but i resolved to banish all thoughts of death that i might take care of his tender years but i begged my father to give me leave to go into a nunnery with much importunity he granted my request on this condition that if i continued in that mind at the end of two years i might do as i thought fit though i thought the time an age yet i unwillingly consented  my father used means with the pope to have your brother called to an account for your death and it had gone hard with him if we could have procured any witnesses but for want of that he was acquitted in a little time a heavy and deep melancholy seized him and he professed so sincere a repentance that even i almost forgave him he begged he might see the child which my father made me comply with he shed such abundance of tears over it that my father wept for company and spoke so tenderly of the loss of his brother that wiped off all suspicions of his repentance since thou have lost a father said he through my barbarity it is but just that i should prove a father to thee he frequently came to see him though i could never be prevailed upon to accept of a visit at last his grief seized him so violently that he was given over by his physicians when he was upon his deathbed he made his will and bequeathed my little antonio his whole estate leaving the pope his guardian he died full of repentance for his crime and no doubt his soul took her flight to heaven  the generous antonio could not refuse some tears to the memory of his repentant brother but joy succeeded sorrow the pope was acquainted with the story who sent to congratulate their happy meeting nothing but mirth and pleasure ran through the villa which increased my sorrow  don antonio told me one day that he did not think he had a right to rejoice without me and now said he i have nothing to afflict me but what you feel therefore will bend my thoughts if it be possible to relieve your grief i can procure a friar of my acquaintance to go to sallee one that knows the nature of the business we shall send him about being he has often gone to redeem captives well send for him and you may give him what instructions you think fit i thanked him and was very sorry for the trouble i should give him but was resolved to accompany him my self he told me he would not have me go by any means for i could be of no manner of use in the affair but rather a hindrance and if i should be once discovered might fall into the same state we both lately escaped from and perhaps meet with much worse usage than i had before his advice was so reasonable that i resolved to take it whatever violence i did my self the friar was sent for bad his commission and instructions given him and withal to spare no cost antonio told him whatever he gave should not be thought unreasonable  he was to have a thousand crowns for his expenses and two thousand more if he succeeded  the friar undertook his voyage with a great deal of alacrity and gave us great hopes of his success by his willingness and he embarked the next day for genoa that port being the properest place to get a vessel for barbary we wished him a good voyage and recommended him to fortune  don antonio did all he could to divert my melancholy we often went a hunting shooting fishing and visiting the ladies in short he made me partake in all the diversions italy could afford but though i seemed often to be diverted yet i had always my condition too much at heart to be merry we viewed all the rarities and antiquities of ancient and modern rome i must confess these amusements lulled my sorrows often but when i had time for reflection they rushed upon me with the greater force  i shall not trouble my reader in describing places treated on by pens far above my weak capacity but only give a short description of naples whither don antonio would have me go i was not much averse to the journey though a pretty long one and we set out with a very handsome equipage donna isabella with her little son accompanied us but don antonio grimaldi was obliged to attend the pope to settle the affairs of his soninlaws estate i was obliged to appear cheerful if it was but in complaisance to don antonio  we arrived at naples in three days without meeting any thing extraordinary upon the road certainly never any city in the world can boast a finer situation add to that their buildings are sumptuous every private house seems a palace and every palace looks like the court of a king the streets spacious a mild air and free from tempests strong both by art and nature in short if i was obliged to live out of my native country which every man is fond of naples should be the only place it has a wall kept in very good repair with three castles almost impregnable the chief is seated on mount erasmus so called from a chapel dedicated to him but if it is erasmus roterdamus i cannot imagine how the roman catholics came to have such a particular regard for him when it is very well known he was no great friend to them at least he was a scourge to their absurdities in his writings  this is not only a safeguard to the city and adjacent country but might prove its scourge in      it was blown up by lightning penetrating to the powder room which mightily damaged the whole city the second is castello nuevo or the new castle built by charles king of naples this castle commands the haven and is generally the viceroys dwelling the third stands on the southeast corner of the city built upon a little rock joined to the continent by lucullus the roman and is sometimes called by his name but oftener castello del ovo or the castle of the egg from its form they have also a fine arsenal for their galleys very well kept and furnished with great store of ammunition but i think the mole the most extraordinary piece of work being it defends the haven from the stormy south lined of each side and paved on the top with noble square stones and in the middle a fine large fountain of marble the whole extent is five hundred paces and ten in breadth the inhabitants often boast of the antiquity of their city founded twenty years after troys destruction and called by the ancient poets parthenope which virgil does sufficiently testify in his georgics ille virgilium me tempore dulcis alebat parthenope studiis florentem ignobilis oti   this city has suffered many revolutions but none more extraordinary than that in    0 when a poor fisherman without shoes to his feet in five days time commanded the whole power of naples and might have lived in that grandeur if his mind had changed with his exalted state but he was still a fisherman his shortlived fire blazed too fierce to last and he fell a victim to the rage he himself began  their churches are noble structures and beautified with paintings by the best hands their women are most of em beautiful but my heart had no room to think of them  the city is governed by very wholesome laws but one particular article adds much to the quiet of it none are suffered to wear swords but those of the garrisons so if there is any rencounter in the streets a bout at fistycuffs generally ends the dispute though bravos are to be hired to do a murder here as cheap as at rome and men of honor too for we heard of a quarrel between two neapolitan gentlemen where one according to custom hired a bravo to murder the other and gave him his reward beforehand but it so fell out that some friends to both parties reconciled the two gentlemen the person that had bargained with the bravo for the job sent to him and told him of their reconcilement but that he might keep the money the other told him it was not in his power to return it him but he was above receiving money without doing his work and therefore the gentleman must of necessity suffer death he entreated him and used many arguments but all to no purpose when he found nothing would prevail he told him he would immediately acquaint the gentleman with his design which he did accordingly notwithstanding the bravo the same evening found his opportunity and left the other gentleman for dead upon the mole though he recovered after a lingering illness but the bravo had the impudence to go to the other when he found the gentleman was in a fair way of recovery and told him he begged his pardon that he had not been as good as his word but he would take care and mend his hand very quickly in short he was found so resolute in the matter that the gentleman was obliged to hire another of the same trade to give him a cast of his office and dispatch the bravo before he could execute what was designed and the next day he was found dead at the very door of the gentlemans house he had intended to assassinate waiting as it was supposed for an opportunity to do his business  after we had viewed every thing within the city we went to see the much famed vesuvius or the burning mountain a league and a half east of the city the neapolitans call it the bedchamber of the sun because he appears to them first from the top of that mountain round the bottom of it is the richest spot of ground in the universe i will not except even the mines of potosi for the yearly vintage produces twelve hundred thousand ducats the middle of the hill is very pleasantly shaded with chestnut and several other fruit trees the mountain has a double top that to the north terminates in a plain finely cultivated the other toward the south which is the volcano rises much higher  when we had gained the summit we descended gradually into its bowels by large steps cut on purpose it has in times past done much damage to the country round it by its sudden eruptions but now it forebodes nothing but rain when the top is envelopd with clouds  when we had sufficiently satisfied our curiosities at naples we took a tour to putzol or posuolo through a hollow of a rock a mile in length and no other light but what came in at both ends and one in the middle from the top of the rock this subterraneous passage is paved with stone all through and the narrowest part of it is ten yards over about the middle is a small chapel dedicated to the virgin mary we visited all the rarities of the place particularly virgils tomb which is almost covered with ivy they told me of a laurel tree that sprouted naturally out of it but not to take from that incomparable man whose works are everliving laurels i could not see any such thing we also viewed the lake agnano so called from the multitude of serpents or snakes that fall into it from the pendent mountains the water is of two different qualities that tasted upon the surface is sweet or fresh but that taken deeper is of a brackish taste supposed from some minerals that inviron it  on the south side of the lake stands a natural stove which is called st germans stove but we had not curiosity enough to enter it nor faith enough to believe a ridiculous fable that is told concerning it though it is reported a saint declared it for a truth which i shall put down here and leave my reader to judge of it himself st german was advised to repair to this stove to cure him of a dangerous malady when he came there he found the soul of a very pious man that he knew tormented with the heat of the place st german as understanding the language of souls asked him how so good a man as he was in his lifetime came to be condemned to such a severe punishment the soul very civilly answered him that it was for siding with laurentius who opposed symacus in the popedom but he was convinced that his prayers would fetch him out of that hothouse st german prayed heartily you may be sure and got the soul of the man from out thence but where it went after no one could tell but the place was called ever after st germans stove  to the east of the bordering mountain is a place they call the cave of death for whatever thing of life ventures to the farther end they say immediately drops down dead though a person that lived in a neighboring village ventured in often for a reward when he came out again he was all of a sweat and hardly able to stand for five or six minutes when he had recovered himself he took a dog out of a bag he had brought with him and by the means of a wooden instrument made for that purpose thrust him in to the very end and drew him out dead to all appearance when he had remained some time for us to view him he took him up by the fore legs and threw him into the lake agnano where he recovered immediately swam out and ran away from us don antonio told me it was a hard matter to get a dog there for as soon as ever they saw a stranger they would run away into the woods and sneak home again when they were gone which was the reason the person that went in always secures one for the occasion  a mile farther we went to the court of vulcan a place unpleasant enough continually smoking and such hot vapors arise from the pores of the earth that it almost overcame me in some places water bubbles out of the cavities and if we threw a stone into it it rebounded back as if you had struck it against a pavement but the place is reckoned to cure a great many distempers especially to make women pregnant and to cure diseases of the head and eyes donna isabella was carried over it in a sedan but i believe she did not want it upon the score of barrenness as you may understand in her story  we spent six weeks in this not unpleasing entertainment and don antonio being pretty well satiated as well as my self we went back again to rome  and now my melancholy gained such ground upon me that it was not in the power of dissimulation to hide it don antonio and all the family expressed a great deal of trouble for my sorrow and i am well assured there was not any thing in their power they would have refused to have given me quiet but the minds disease baffles the physicians art at last a letter arrived from the friar which gave us no other account but that he was safe returned to genoa and intended to embark for rome in a few days this lame account quite disheartened me for now we had not the least hope being we all agreed if he had succeeded he would have been forward enough to have acquainted us with it the knowledge of this cast me quite down and my body was forced to submit to the troubles of my mind a strong fever seized me and brought me to the brink of the grave and though i wished for death yet like common friends he fled from me in my neeessity  don antonio and his lady seldom went from my bedside and had i been a brother to em they could not have regarded me more but nature in spite of my misfortunes prevailed and i gathered strength even against my will they had informed me in my illness by my importunity of the fryars arrival and that he had not succeeded in his negotiation but yet they had not told me all the particulars i desired the friar might be sent for and conceal nothing from me of what had past accordingly he came and gave me the following relation sir said he in french as soon as i arrived at sallee i met with hamet the irish renegado he received me at first after a brutish manner but when i declared i came to pay him his demand for one of his slaves that had made his escape he began to be less sour in his treatment he said a great many handsome things concerning don antonio but when i began to mention you he fell into a violent rage and vented bitter reproaches against you saying you were a vile impostor had basely deceived and robbed him doubly of his mistress and his money i told him i came to ransom the lady and pay for whatever damages you had done as for the lady said he she is food for fishes long ago for rather than she would submit to me she threw her self overboard before we had gained the port when i had taken her out of a saick one of my slaves had brought her in from mammora and in spite of our endeavors to the contrary sunk for ever to the bottom and is she gone said i o proof of virtuous love happy had i been to have embraced the same fate  the relation of this killing disaster took away my senses for some time but when i had recovered he went on i had some hope at first that this was only a fiction of his own but i found in the town that it was no secret and every body declared that it was truth a jew confirmed me in it whom you had bought several things of for your voyage he told me that hamet arrived without any woman with him for he saw him land in a very ill humor and had complained of him for assisting you to his superior at mequinez and he received a sufficient check from him i was too well convinced of the truth and therefore hastened my departure and am very sorry i could not succeed but it was not in fate and i hope you will calmly submit to the will of heaven who sends these afflictions for trials  the good friar gave me a great many wholesome admonitions but i was not in a state much to observe em i now began to be careless of the world because there was nothing in it since the death of my dear wife worth my notice i had no thoughts of returning to england though i had opportunities enough but took a resolution of going to some remote part of the world imagining the farther i was from my native country i should be the further removed from my anxiety but alas sorrow is too constant a companion and there is no parting with it but by death  i begged don antonio if he heard of any ship bound for a long voyage he would acquaint me with it which he promised me to do after finding persuasion had no effect on me two months passed away and no news of a ship when i began to be very uneasy and told antonio i would even make a voyage to genoa where i could not well sail of a vessel when he found nothing could stay me he asked me to what part of the world i would choose to go i told him i did not much care where why then said he if you please my father and i will fit you out a ship of what burden you think fit either for war or traffic i thanked him and told him i would have it for both if he pleased and i would be their supracargo if they thought fit to give me so great a trust in short a ship of two hundred and fifty ton was bought of an english merchant at naples a stout new vessel that mounted six and twenty brass guns and we manned her with a hundred hands most english who understanding i intended for the south sea were glad of the opportunity don antonio took care to provide every thing necessary for traffic and i was made captain and supracargo i told him i hoped i should in a few years bring him a good account of his lading he obligingly answered me that he hoped i would come home reconciled to my self and he should think himself very happy the worst of it was we had no commission neither would i suffer antonio to procure me one for we resolved like englishmen to fight only with the enemies of our country  i christened my ship the isabella out of respect to antonios lady and hoisted english colors on board when the day came i was to go on board there were tears shed on both sides i could not without some regret part with so good a friend as antonio had proved to me and i am very well convinced that they were as sincere in their sorrow  we set sail from ostia where our ship lay ever since she came from naples the second of march      with intention to steer our nearest course for america our ship proved an excellent sailor and we made the streights mouth in twelve days from our first departure when i beheld the coast of africa it brought fresh to my memory past transactions and i longed for an opportunity to be revenged on the moors the next day our men discovered two sail bearing down the wind upon us we thought our selves too well provided to run away though we kept on our course and perceiving but one of em that followed us i asked my men if they were willing to speak with that vessel and they cried one and all they would with all their hearts we prepared for an engagement with all the expedition imaginable for fear she might prove of barbary we hoisted our english colors and they did the same when we found that we lay by that we might be informed of the news in england but as soon as ever they came along side of us they plucked down their english colors and hoisted those of morocco in their room calling to us to surrender that instant or it should be worse for us we were a little surpised at first in being disappointed but notwithstanding this my men desired i would begin the fight we had not opened our ports yet and i ordered my men not to do it till i gave em the word i sent a man to busy himself about the halliards of our ancient that the rover might imagine we were going to strike we were well provided with small arms and all manner of warlike stores i ordered every man to their posts but not to appear till they heard a whistle upon which they should open their ports and fire both great guns and small arms the rover thought us long in striking our colors he therefore called out to us again and told us if we did not strike that instant they would pour a broadside into us just upon that i blew my whistle my men obeyed my orders punctually they burst open our ports thrust out their guns and gave em a broadside with a discharge of their small arms this put em in much confusion as not expecting any opposition and i am certain we killed a great many of their men for imagining we should be their prize without fighting they had crowded upon deck all their hands  i had tacked about and given her another salute before they returned us the favor but they were not long backward but poured in upon us very fast my men did their business very well and the fight continued half an hour with the utmost fury i began to fancy we should have but dry meat as the sailors say and looking upon their quarter deck i soon spied the renegado hamet giving directions at the sight of him i was both surpised and pleased but my soul was filled with an unusual fury we were so near that i could hear every word he said though i could not understand him because he spoke in the moorish tongue as we were tacking about and charging again i showed my self to him i told him he was the only man in the world that i hated and that very day he should be in my power or i in his or death should put an end to both our lives he seemed surpised but gave me a great deal of abusive language i encouraged my men and desired em to fight bravely for if we fell into their hands we should have no mercy i had fired my piece at random before that is at the first person i saw but now i levelled all at hamet and he the same at me at last i had the good fortune to fetch him down at this sight i could not forbear giving a shout of joy which so affected those that were near me and understood the business that they fought like so many furies and after an obstinate fight of two hours they struck to us we gave god thanks for our victory and i immediately went on board em where we had made a terrible slaughter they having lost by their own account ninety seven men  i asked some of the men what ship that was which stood aloof from the engagement and they informed me it was a prize they had taken a few days before laden with wine and other commodities i then thought of a stratagem to get her into my power i ordered our ship to strike her colors and then we hoisted those of the moors and took our ship in tow when the prize saw us in that posture she imagined the moor had conquered and made all the sail she could to come up with us so that we soon came near enough to send our longboat armed on board her  there were but twelve moors on board besides prisoners that were put under hatches when our men had taken care of em i went to em and ordered the prisoners to be released desiring the person that was the master to come upon deck the moors had not taken any of the lading out of her she was a ship of ninety tons bound for leverpool laden as i said before with portwines and several jars of oil i told the master he was at liberty to pursue his voyage when he thought fit the poor man was some time before he could believe what i said to be real but when he was convinced he returned me the thanks suitable to the present i had made him yet he would make me a present of a couple of hogsheads of wine two jars of oil and two of raisons besides six of each to the ships crew i had lost seventeen of my men in the engagement and eleven wounded which i supplied by taking as many of the slaves they had on board of hamets ship all by their own choice and the rest that did not care for so long a voyage i recommended to the master of the prize who promised me to land em all in england  we pillaged the corsair and found very good booty we had out of her to the value of two thousand pounds in goods which i entered in the ships books for the use of the company we did not know well how to dispose of her crew and though they deserved death yet in cool blood i thought it was inhumane and i considered they never had injured me so i released em by the consent of the whole company with this agreement that they should make a present from me to mirza the eunuch of fifty pound in their moorish money which he that had command over the rest swore by mahomet to perform when we had taken every thing that was needful for our voyage out of her we let her go and pursued our course  we touched at the canaries or fortunate islands to take in fresh water and turned the lading we had taken out of the corsair into money and i shared it among the sailors reserving a fourth part for my self and owners as i called em i gave the men by lotts leave to go ashore where they soon disposed of their money for things they wanted but the chief of their commerce was for wine and brandy knowing we had a long voyage to make  we were obliged to leave the place sooner than we designed by reason our pilot had unfortunately killed a portugueze and the governor threatened to have our ship stopped if we did not surrender him up i understood that the deceased had been in the wrong and therefore rather than run the hazard of losing him we set sail from thence the tenth of april the castle fired several guns with shot to stay us but we did not regard it but kept on our voyage  we met with nothing worth notice till we made the island of st vincent one of the cape verde and came to an anchor in ten fathom water in a fine gravelly bottom  these islands are the hesperides of the ancients the natives are blacks a poor miserable people they brought us a few tortoise which we exchanged any trash for and they were contented the rivulet of fresh water would hardly supply us it being almost dried up but we had wood enough the whole island is not above two leagues and a half in length and half a one in breadth very barren of fruit grass or roots and even animals i saw only a few wild asses and some goats which were too nimble for us or so far off that they were not worth our wasting powder and shot  the island of st anthony about two leagues to the north is a wellinhabited island belonging to the crown of portugal we resolved to go and anchor there but the wind proving fair we pursued our voyage passed by the island del fogo in the night and we could perceive the volcano burning like the flame of a glasshouse twenty days afterward we passed the aequinoctial line with the usual ceremony of ducking all those persons that had never been there before but i bought off the best part of the delinquents for an anchor of brandy  the next day we buried two of our men who died of the wounds they had received in the fight but all the rest happily recovered we gave em three guns and committed em to the waves  in the latitude of twenty two we saw a great number of fowls and therefore judged we could not be many leagues from land which we discovered soon after to be the island of ascension about two leagues to the north but we passed by it and in two days more anchored in six fathom water at the island of st catharines about half a mile from the main land of brasil  this island lies in twenty seven degrees thirty minutes of south latitude it is almost a continued grove of trees and but thinly inhabited by portugueze and a few blacks they are in want almost of all the necessaries of life besides provision which is plentiful enough such as it is the inhabitants are courteous enough and would not take money for any thing we had of em but linen and woollen and after i had got every thing that was necessary for the ship i sold em goods to the value of four hundred pounds which i received in pure gold they never have peace with the indians of the continent and being so very near they have often formerly made inroads and carried off the inhabitants but they have prevented such attempts for the future by building several redoubts where they keep constant guard  they pay no other taxes but the churchtythes which they will be sure not to lose and for religion they had but one friar when i was there and all his business was as i was informed only to receive his tenths  a frenchman told me a pleasant story of one of the inhabitants an industrious fellow that had ten children but notwithstanding his industry found it a hard matter to bring both ends together at the years end though the worst of his grievances was the priests tithes and his money he often endeavored to persuade the father to forget him a year or two but all to no purpose one day the father paid him a visit in order to receive his dues the poor man told him ingenuously he had it not in his power to give it him but he still insisted at last he told him he had but one way to procure it and that he feared the church would not allow of the friar told him he was the best judge of that if he would tell him what it was why said the man a person that lives on the continent has several fat pigs of a very fine breed now said he i could bring one over with me unperceived of any one as i come from my daily labor and such a one naming a neighbor will give me a good price for it the friar paused some time but at last gave him this answer it is certainly a sin to steal but yet it is a greater sin to rob the church of its due and therefore i will absolve you but bring the pig to me for if it is worth so much to your neighbor it is worth as much to me the man told him he would be sure to bring it him that night and the friar said if he was not at home he would leave word with his servant to take care of it now the friar had no constant dwelling here for they are sent from lagoa a town upon the continent about ten leagues to s s w and their tithes were usually sent there in a small bark kept for that purpose the priest took care to be out of the way that he might swear he knew nothing of the matter if it was found out at the time when the man was to come with his pig but gave his servant a strict order whatever was brought should be immediately carried on board and taken a great deal of care of  when the time came the man was as good as his word and brought to the priests house his promise in a handbasket the servant obeyed his masters orders and went to carry it on board but before he could get to the harbor what he had in his basket began to cry out the poor fellow was very much frighted to find he had got a child in the basket but fearing by the charge his master gave of it he was deeply concerned in the affair made all the haste he could on board and the vessel setting sail that night he went with his charge to lagoa where he very secretly delivered it to the brotherhood  the priest at st catharines thought his man had robbed him and made his escape being he was missing so long for he had carried a great many other things on board before the child the imagination of this made the father very uneasy and the wind continuing fair he embarked on board a vessel and arrived at lagoa the day after his man but what was his surprise when he found he had got a sucking child instead of a sucking pig he told the rest of his brethren the affront that had been put upon him and they resolved to send the bantling back again but either for want of due care or through the fatigue of the sea the child died when the friar came back to st catharines he ran openmouthed to the poor man and swore he should be excommunicated for playing tricks with the church the man told him he was forward enough to have his tithes so having ten children and finding nine too many to keep he was resolved he should have his due and have the tenth and farther added if he offered to make any more stir about it he would acquaint every body with his encouraging him to steal from his neighbors  the father finding the man had too much understanding to be priestridden thought it his best way to hold his tongue but the secret was disclosed and the poor priest led a sad sort of life for whenever he came for his tithes many would merrily ask him if he would have his tithe pig in short the friar was shamed out of the island and the fraternity were obliged to send another man in his room who very often hears the story of the child though much against his will  we anchored at first within a bowshot of the island of parrots in seven fathom water but we were informed the best place to water our ship was two leagues beyond the island of st catharine we had our present wants supplied from the continent though not enough to water the ship so we resolved to steer for the watering place in the bay of arazatiba  we steered between the island and the continent and all the way on each side we discovered a beautiful prospect of houses environed with natural woods and groves which gave the eye a vast delight when we approached the bay of arazatiba we perceived a ship with english colors with her anchor apeak in order to discover who we were i immediately hoisted english colors but prepared for an engagement as imagining her to be french or some english pirate for there was war between the two nations but i found it was a privateer commanded by captain dampier who made me a visit after having hailed us when he was on board he used many persuasions to engage me to consort with him and follow the business of privateering but i told him i had other affairs to manage after i had treated him handsomely with what the ship afforded he took his leave and invited me to dine on board his vessel the next day i gave him my promise to wait on him and i accordingly went where i was very handsomely treated and there we agreed two days after to make an entertainment jointly for the officers of both ships on shore and the day after that for the rest of the crew  in order to this i commanded a large tent to be pitched capable of holding fifty persons and we strove who should send the most materials on shore for our feast we had the music of both vessels but mine proving to be the best as being italians gave the most delight not but they joined in consort and agreed very well  after dinner captain dampier told me though he could not oblige me with italian music yet he had an english eunuch that sang admirably he added he could not answer for his judgment but he was very well convinced he never heard a finer voice in his life the person was brought in but my readers may guess at my surprise when in the person of the singer i discovered my mistresss lawyer whom my master and his friend had equipt for a fine singer i knew him as soon as ever i saw him but i perceived by his behavior he had no knowledge of me neither was it very possible he could have known me because he had never seen me but once and then he had too much concern to make any observations but the occasion had imprinted in my mind a lively idea of him  he sung admirably well and with good judgment i asked the captain how he came to be an eunuch he told me he could not inform me neither could he ever prevail upon him to let him know it we were very merry for several hours and i may safely declare that during that time i had buried my inward malady  i told the singer i believed i could let captain dampier into the secret of his castration if he would not be offended at it he seemed very much concerned and blushed but imagining i knew nothing of the matter he gave me his consent to say what i thought fit yet with the utmost chagrine in his face as believing he was only going to be the jest of the company  but when i began to name my master and entered into some part of the story i found him in the utmost confusion insomuch that i pitied him and told him i would not proceed any farther without his consent he told me in bad french for he had observed that the captain and i sometimes talked to one another in that language that i was very welcome to tell his unfortunate story but not to so many auditors for added he i perceive you know it very well i gave him my word only to tell the captain for which he thanked me but i told him in return that he must let me into the rest of his story which he promised to do the captain and i with my quondam lawyer took an opportunity of leaving the company and walking a little way up the river side where i informed him that i came to the knowledge of his story by the porter that dogged him for i did not think it convenient to let him know that i was a person concerned and that seeing him go into the coach in lombard street i remembered his face again he gave us his story in the following manner  i was bred up to the law by my father an attorney of lincolns inn who dying left me a small estate which i soon spent in none of the best company i had no thoughts of business till drove to it through the utmost necessity but finding want approaching began to open my eyes i took chambers in cliffordsinn and resolved to stick to business i soon found clients enough through the credit of my father and understanding the rough as well as the smooth part of the law i got money enough to supply even any extravagance i had ever been a very great admirer of the female sex and had the good fortune or rather the ill to succeed in most of my amors  the first time i ever saw the fatal cause of my misfortune was at st dunstans church which to my shame i must own i too often frequented without devotion our eyes often told us the language of the heart i got the opportunity of sitting in the next pew to her but had never once disclosed my passion  one sunday as the clerk had set the psalm she begged i would lend her my book saying she had left hers at home when she had done she returned it me and thanked me i had resolved with my self to have waited on her out of the church but was prevented by the person that was afterward her husband when i came home i pulled my prayer book out of my pocket but perceived it would not shut as usual which put me on examining it i found a note pinned to the last leaf which i had not observed before the contents were to invite me to an assignation that evening at six  i was very punctual and found her there before me i begged her pardon for making her wait which she easily granted with a gentle reproach and we soon came to a right understanding for that very night before we parted i had what i wished the sweet which was followed by the worst of bitters  she told me she had long had a passion for me which though she resisted all she could got the better of her modesty and forced her to declare it she informed me too that she was speedily to be married to the man that led her out of church though it was much against her inclination but she was obliged to comply with her mothers commands  we had many meetings sometimes at my chambers till i was taken too much notice of by some of my neighbors and when she was married we often met at different places and she as often made me handsome presents he then related how he was discovered at my masters house by one of the prentices meaning me but as he concealed his face by turning it to the window he could not remember him he also related all that i have declared in the former sheets and added that when the operation was over his mistress as knowing him of no farther use to her left him without speaking a word when i had recovered strength said he to write i sent for some of my intimate friends and among the rest a surgeon i told him my misfortune and was examined by him but i was obliged to stay at the inn several days at last though almost a miracle i was perfectly cured and returned to my business but my story getting air i was made the scoff of every body that saw me till in short my life became a burden to me and i took a resolution to go to some part of the world where no one should know me and getting acquainted with captain dampier he favored me so far as to enter me steward i had learnt to sing when i was young and my voice growing clear by my loss is much improved i had kept my misfortune a secret to all the crew if i had not received a wound in my thigh by an indian arrow on the coast of florida a year ago for the surgeon coming to dress me when the extreme anguish had taken away my senses perceived my condition and disclosed it to the company but i have the good fortune not to be flouted at  when the story was finished we joined our company again and ended the day in mirth and jollity the next day my crew went on shore to regale themselves for captain dampier and i had altered our resolution of sending both companies together for fear of quarrels and disorder and his crew went on shore the following day  about noon as i was reading in my cabin i heard the report of several pieces upon which i ran out and went my self to the topmast head where i perceived my men who were filling our casks at the river of parrots surrounded by a multitude of indians i upon the instant let slip our cables and having a strong sea breeze steered full into the rivers mouth at all hazards ordering every man to his arms and to load all our great guns with musket ball by good fortune the tide was almost at the highest so that we came on broadside the rivulet where our men were defending themselves they had made a rampart with the empty casks and had kept off the indians with their pieces but just as we came they had spent all their ammunition and had resolved to submit to the indians but as soon as they perceived us they took to their heels and ran toward our ship and the indians after them but we soon stopped their career by firing our double and round which killed em above fifty men and put the rest to flight we took our men on board and intended to fall out of the river but found the tide turned and before we could get out our ship ran aground so that we were obliged to wait till the next tide i was very uneasy at this accident and ordered my lieutenant to take the boat and acquaint captain dampier with it  in the mean time not to be idle i armed twenty men and ordered them to guard the rest while they filled our casks which was accordingly done and with the longboat brought on board i would not let them be hoisted into the ship for fear of hurting her now she lay aground though it proved to be a clayie bottom  an hour before night we perceived an indian running very swiftly to us who called to us in portugueze to fetch him aboard as soon as he was in the ship he told a man that understood portugueze that the indians to the number of a thousand designed in the middle of the night to attack our ship and that they would come down in canoes for they very well knew we could not get out till tide of flood  this man whom we took for an indian was a portugueze the indians had taken prisoner a year before and understanding their language learnt their resolution and while they were calling their number together he took his opportunity to make his escape i ordered him to be told he should be rewarded for his intelligence i immediately called all the officers together to consult about the danger and we agreed to send to captain dampier for help who came with fifty men well armed and by his advice as soon as it was dark we landed six of our cannon and raised a small battery without any noise or bustle these were pointed up the river slaunting two of our guns were loaded with double and round in the stern of our ship the rest of our men were ordered in close coverts on each side the river with directions to let the indian canoes pass em and not to fire till they were all gone by  every thing was concerted and settled and every man ordered to his post to expect the charge and we had contrived it so well that none of our fires could hurt one another  about one aclock in the morning we could hear their paddles in the water and soon after perceive em silently falling down the river to the number of two hundred canoes we let them come within fifty yards of our ship before we fired but when we began we made such a terrible slaughter of em that i pitied em we took one canoe with twelve indians and their chief among them when the morning dawned we were amazed to see what havoc death had made the very shores were stained with blood and we had not lost one man of either of our crews the portugueze who gave us notice i rewarded with a hundred pound and two new suits of clothes both linen and woollen and we made use of him for our interpreter he told us we had one of their caciques among the prisoners and a man of great power among the indians i ordered him to ask him the reason of his enmity to us since we had never offended them he told him that he took us for spaniards or portugueze nations they hated from the barbarous usage they had met with from them but he was sorry he had molested us being he was convinced we were englishmen and enemies to the spaniards as well as themselves but however he would pay sufficiently for his ransom if we would spare his life and accordingly we agreed for a hundred weight of gold dust and twenty in ingots and he ordered one of his retinue to fetch it in the mean time we took the advantage of the tide and fell down to our old station  the next day at noon two canoes arrived one with the gold and several persons of quality that came to wait on their king and the other laden with fruits and provisions which i had equally parted between both ships companies i took the ingots for my sharers and the dust was divided among us according to our allowance captain dampier and his crew were mightily pleased with their dividend and once more pressed me to accompany them but i gave em a flat denial for the present with this hope that when i had visited several places in the south sea i would return to st salvador and wait two months for them there  we put the indians on shore and the next day weighed anchor again saluting captain dampier with    guns who returned the like number and we steered our course with a fresh gale for the streights of magellan i intending to pass through those streights into the south sea for i was of opinion it would shorten our voyage and then my curiosity strengthened that opinion but i was advised by my lieutenant to venture up to buenos airs a town belonging to the spaniards where he assured me we might drive a very good trade underhand with the merchants i communicated the matter to the whole company who unanimously agreed it was the best course we could steer so we kept in with the shore and steered for the rio de la plata or the river of plate which we reached in twenty days without any accident as we had war with france and spain i had hoisted french colors that we might have the liberty to trade with more safety  buenos airs is situated above fifty leagues up the river of plate which above the town receives the name of paraguay and takes its rise many leagues up the country which is possessed by a numerous nation of indians who sometimes trade with the spaniards but oftener murder em when they can meet em conveniently for the spirit of revenge is sucked in with their milk and handed down from father to son so that they imagine it to be a very meritorious deed to dispatch one of them and they are generally rewarded by their cacique for it  the town of buenos airs takes its name from the excellent temperature of the climate and its pleasant situation they have commerce with the ships of europe not above once a year which bring em the necessaries they want and in return ease em of their gold that being a metal less esteemed than iron which proves more useful to them when we were within two leagues of the port we came to an anchor in a little creek in eight fathom water a sandy bottom we did not care to go nearer the town for fear the governor should have taken it in his head to have hindered our going out again  though we were not in sight of it yet we had canoes on board of us in an hour after our anchoring and some of note came incognito to be informed what we dealt in one of them told me he believed it would be no difficult thing to dispose of my cargo if i thought fit to make the governor a small present accordingly i took his advice and sent my steward in my name with a piece of holland and half a dozen pieces of italian silks which he received as a very valuable present and sent me word he would not in the least molest me provided i did not deal too barefaced i understood him and therefore was very cautious selling but to one at a time nor would i suffer another to enter my ship till the former was dispatched  in two days i got rid of all the cargo that i intended to part with to a very great advantage and then i allowed my men liberty to do what they thought fit with what they had which gave them a general satisfaction the next day i invited the governor on board with some of the principal merchants and entertained them in my cabin and in return i was to dine on shore at the castle but i left a strict order with my lieutenant how to behave himself if i should be stopped for i knew the spaniards to be unfaithful people  when we landed i observed the town made but a mean appearance consisting only of two streets built in the form of a cross and surrounded with a mud wall the castle it self made but an indifferent figure but however i was very elegantly entertained the governor seemed to have less of the formality of the spaniard than ever i met with in any of them when i took my leave of him he made me a present of two indian slaves and a bar of gold that weighed three pound two ounces when i came on board i called a council to know what course we should steer next for as to traffic i had no pretense to go to the south sea being all my cargo was already disposed of we debated for some time and at last we all agreed to go for the south sea upon the score of privateering we communicated our intentions to the company and they all seemed very much rejoiced at the resolution i had taken  now i began to repent i had not joined with captain dampier for i wanted men for any notable exploit but i did not despair of meeting with him in the south sea we weighed anchor and steered for the streights of magellan with a fair wind one morning my servant waked me and told me that a sail bore down upon us and the lieutenant desired to know how to behave himself i rose upon the instant and by the help of my perspective saw it was a vessel with english colors but i imagining they were put up only for a show i caused french colors to be hoisted which soon was answered by the same in the ship that pursued us i ordered every thing to be prepared for an engagement without any hurry commanded my men not to appear upon deck and kept on my course with crowded sail that our pursuers might imagine i was willing to get from them yet i ordered it so by false steering that they gained upon us about three in the afternoon they were within half a league of us firing every quarter of an hour a gun to leeward to let us know we were to take them for friends  i ordered our men to tack about hoist up english colors and bear upon em we soon perceived we had much surprised em but notwithstanding they kept up their french colors and seemed to prepare for the engagement though they were much inferior to us when we came along side i haled em and after owning they were french commanded them to surrender but was answered with a broadside which we returned so fast that they soon struck and called for quarter i ordered the captain to come on board who informed me that his vessel was called the felicity belonging to monsieur de gennes and had been separated from the fleet three days before i used the captain very handsomely for the sake of monsieur st olon the french ambassador i gave him a letter and a small present for that gentleman and dismissed him without taking any thing from them i found this action did not please some of my men and not caring to have them uneasy i summoned them upon the deck and told em the obligations i had to the french ambassador acquainting them as this was a ship of war there was not much to be expected from em therefore i told em i would share five hundred pound among em to make em amends for their disappointment but not one of them would accept a penny and in return i told them i did not intend to make any more such compliments to the french if ever they came into my power again they were very well pleased with my declaration and some of them praised my generosity for though most sailors are rough and blunt in speech yet they can in their way admire a generous action as well as other men  our officers were under some apprehensions of meeting with the squadron of monsieur de gennes which being a fleet of five sail would certainly be too hard for us and we were informed by the captain of the felicity that they were sailed for the streights of magellan i found their fears very reasonable and it would be a foolhardy action to encounter a force so much superior for though life was burdensome enough to me yet humanity obliged me not to hazard the lives of so many men that were not out of love with this world so i resolved to wave my curiosity and make for le maires streights which in five days time we discovered known to sailors by three rocks called the three brothers from their likeness to one another  we found a strong current setting northward and an unusual tossing of the ship but we got through the streights in two days with safety and made for the south sea  the next day we discovered the magellan clouds so well known to sailors which convinced us that we were over against those streights that run into the south sea these clouds are always seen in the same degree and the same orbicular form we kept on our course not intending to come within sight of the continent for fear of a discovery and the weather favored us it continuing very hazy  about an hour within night we heard the sound of a trumpet which we conjectured must be on oard of some vessel because we were well assured we were not near enough the land upon which i immediately gave orders to put out all our lights and steer our course that way we heard the sound which sounding often gave us true notice of their course and in half an hour though pretty dark we gained sight of em but their mirth was soon changed when we got up with em thrust out our guns and hailed em we understood they were spanish and i ordered em to be told if they did not upon the instant lie by and send their commander on board i would immediately fire upon em they very readily complied with my orders hoisted out their boat and the captain came on board me whose name was don juan villegro and his ship the wildfire he was employed by the viceroy of peru to carry condemned persons to baldivia which is the residence of most of the rogues of america but we were also informed they had the real situado on board which is a sum of money so called that is sent from the viceroy of peru to pay and cloth the garrison as well as to repair the fortifications of baldivia this sum usually amounted to four hundred thousand crowns but we could find no more than two hundred and fifty thousand but then to make amends for the deficiency we met with a great many valuable east india goods brought from thence by their manilla ship for the merchants always put their supply for baldivia in the ship that carries the money to pay the garrison that being the only time to dispose of their goods  this prize made my men mad with joy and i feared it would make em think they should have enough and consequently desire to return home but i soon found it had the contrary effect and they all expected from this earnest of good fortune riches enough in the voyage we proposed to make em for ever  i treated the prisoners handsomely which were fortysix including fifteen felons who were well pleased to have changed their masters expecting better usage from us than from the spaniards of baldivia where they were designed there was one roberts an englishman among them who i have been informed has been executed since for piracy him two frenchmen four spaniards and the trumpeter i entered in my books to reinforce my crew understanding their crime was only suspicion of piracy therefore i was convinced they were good sailors but i did not know how to dispose of the ship and the rest of the crew if i should give em their liberty they would of course alarm the country and if i kept them with me provisions would fall short for they were victuald but for a months voyage  the spanish captain being informed of my fears told me by an interpreter that he had received such handsome usage from me that he would upon his honor steer to what port i thought fit and report if i pleased that i was sailed back again for the north sea i told him though i could rely upon his honor he could not answer for all the rest at last i thought of a stratagem to deceive the spanish captain as well as the other prisoners as follows in the first watch of the night the prisoners being all under hatches i came to our sailors upon deck and told em the ill consequence of keeping or letting go the prisoners and therefore concerted with em that they should pretend a mutiny the next day and all declare for going back through the streights into the north sea when the first watch was relieved i acquainted the other moiety of the company and then retired to rest but my slumbers were broken with visions of my dear mrs villars i dreamt i saw her in the arms of the renegado hamet struggling and calling out on me for help and before i could come to her assistance death had freed her from the barbarous wretch this dream had brought to my mind all my afflictions and i cannot tell how long i should have continued feeding upon my sighs if i had not been alarmed with shouts and noises upon deck i ran out to see what was the matter and found my men as was designed in their feigned mutiny i had forgot at first and was much alarmed but recollecting i carried on the cheat and grief had so seated herself on my countenance with thoughts of my dream that one of the quarter masters told me afterward my looks were enough to deceive all the world  the spaniards had leave to be upon deck all the day and care was taken to let them into the secret at dinner i told the spanish captain for he and the merchants always eat with me that i thought his speeches yesterday were prophetic for i was compelled to comply with my obstinate crew and sail for the north sea again he replied he wished me happy wherever i went and to carry on the deceit we steered our course back again  in the afternoon roberts came to me and told me that one of the spaniards who was willing to stay with us would undertake to bring me ten thousand pieces of eight in ten days if i would let him have the prize upon what roberts said i sent for the man and had him examined by roberts who understood spanish very well the spaniard told me he would not have me enquire into the matter till it was done and for the better security i might send who i thought sit with him provided he had one of his companions that was to help in the design accordingly i ordered twenty hands and to obey the spaniard in this expedition as if he were their captain  we agreed to wait for them the limited time in the same degree we parted from em i informed the spanish captain by an interpreter that his countryman was gone upon some secret expedition and as soon as he returned we would pursue our course he answered whatever he had undertaken he was of the opinion he would succeed in it for he had certainly as much cunning as any person in the world he had been condemned to baldivia once before and had made his escape from thence and he did not doubt but he would get from them again if he had been carried there the second time and farther gave me some hints that he might deceive me in this undertaking  i began to be in some fear of having a knavish trick played me and would have recalled the vessel if it had not been too late but hoping for the best i resolved to cruise till the time appointed was expired  i had clothed my two indians that were presented me by the governor of buenos airs in european habits very handsome and instructed them in the english tongue they very readily learnt and i gave them all the tender usage imaginable which they were obligingly sensible of and i believe they would have sacrificed their lives to have served me i found them very handy and docible and very goodnatured which convinces me if mild methods were used with them they might be very easily wrought to be friends to the europeans especially the english and i think it is great pity such a vast body of people should be ignorant of the divine being that formed the universe though the spaniards it is true send missionaries among them to inculcate christianity yet they generally neglect their holy functions and strive all they can to enrich themselves by laying exorbitant taxes upon the poor indians and i have been informed that in some parts of america all the wealth they get is delivered to the mission reserving to themselves only what is needful and that but from day to day i had my two indians made christians one by by the name of robert and the other joseph being mine and my fathers names and i hope in the sight of god laybaptism will suffice especially when we had not the happiness of the other form and it is not impossible if they lead good lives they may find the road to heaven as well as if they had been christened in a church by an orthodox clergyman  three days before the time i expected my spaniard back we discovered two sail making up to us which made us prepare for an engagement but we soon perceived it was our prize with another vessel the spaniard came on board and informed me that he had been something better than his word for he believed that in money and in goods he had brought to the value of  0000 dollars he gave us the following account by roberts last time i was prisoner at baldivia i was compelled to work for one don sancho ramirez a sordid covetous jealous malicious wretch one that used to deal in merchandise it was his usual method to wait at a country house near the sea for the arrival of the real situado ship which was the same i had taken and then go privately on board to deal with the merchants the knowledge of this made me undertake this expedition as well to get money as to be revenged on the old villain for the stripes he has often given me without any provocation when we arrived within half a league of the place we perceived a bark riding at anchor i began to demur as fearing we might be discovered but at last resolved to proceed let what would happen the bark weighed and made toward us which occasioned another surprise but my fears were soon over when i perceived don sancho upon deck he hailed us and desired we would slacken sail that he might come on board accordingly we ran into a small creek and came to an anchor i did not appear at first but let the other spaniard that went with us personate the captain and instructed him accordingly as soon as he came on board he inquired for don juan villegro for that gentleman used to command the real situado and was answered that he was very ill and could not sail this voyage then he inquired for the merchants telling him that the governor had discovered his usual practice of dealing first with them therefore he had contrived to meet us in one of his own vessels that was ready laden for buenos airs and only staid for our arrival to set sail i was glad to hear of that because i intended to make prize of it the spaniard invited him into the cabin while i went on board his bark with ten men armed and secured it there being but five men and a boy in it the rest of the crew were on shore  i cut her cable and our own and made out to sea again when we were under sail i came on board and showed my self to the old don and in a few words made him understand his condition i thought at first we should have been obliged to have buried him for he looked for a great while like one that was dead but i recovered him a little by showing him the box that contained his heart and soul i mean his money he did his endeavor to fly at me to be revenged on me but he was held but to give him a little more comfort i read over to him his bill of lading and told him plainly i would not deal with him if his goods did not answer his bill when he found he could do no good by passion he told me he would give me half his money if i would restore him his ship and cargo i was very well as i was i told him and since i had got it all in my possession i would have no more dealings with him only the odd ten thousand pieces of eight more for his ransom he was so thunderstruck at this that he did not so much as offer to open his mouth to speak but kept so long silent that i fancying he would never speak again took him upon deck that he might behold the lovely prospect of the water for by this time we were out of sight of land his heart then began to melt and he fell down upon his knees and begged he might have his liberty notwithstanding we had robbed him i was in a very great passion and ordered him to mollify the word and call it overreaching which with much chastisement he did but i told him he was obliged to make your honor one visit and accordingly i have brought him to wait on you  i must confess i could not help admiring the spaniards ingenuity and yet i did not greatly relish the action for though it was lawful prize to us yet i thought it was downright robbery in him however i gave him the thanks our interest required and further told him by roberts our interpreter that he should be very well rewarded for his undertaking  the old spaniard was brought on board us more dead than alive and understanding we were english he spoke to me in that language and begged he might be set at liberty i told him he need not apprehend any thing for he should have his liberty and civil usage he thanked me as well as his grief would give him leave and i invited him to dine with me which he did accordingly the same day  i ordered the cargo out of the bark which was very considerable and most of the provision because i feared it would be what we should want the other vessel as belonging to the king of spain and one who could pretty well bear that loss i intended to keep for our selves the bark i restored to don ramirez with several bales of goods that would prove of small use to us though of value to him nay i would very willingly have given him all his goods and money too if it had not been for wronging my crew for as i said i looked upon it as gained by fraud however i ventured to give him back twenty thousand ryals which did not amount to mine and my owners share he returned me his acknowledgments by giving me a very handsome ring that they had not taken from him and told me he ever thought the english generous enemies  i caused all the prisoners to be put on board the bark and took my leave of em they returned me abundance of thanks for my kind usage and vowed if ever fortune should send any of our countrymen among em they should fare the better for my sake i must own i was not displeased with their acknowledgments a man feels a secret pleasure within himself when he has done a humane action when on the contrary if a person has been guilty of baseness horror and remorse gnaw his inwards  the day after i had parted with the prisoners i summoned all my men upon deck and told em what the spaniard had done for em and advised with em what recompense i should make him we soon agreed he should have five thousand pieces of eight his companion five hundred and the rest of em entered to a share of the booty we had before taken accordingly i sent for em and told em what i intended the spaniard returned me suitable thanks in french for he had been informed i understood that language i found in his discourse a ready turn of wit and humor and of a person that had read mankind he did not seem to be above thirty years of age of a free and open nature having nothing of the stiff formality of the spaniard though born at sevil in old spain i told him i expected a short account of his life he readily answered he should be proud to comply with my desires but he begged i would defer it for some time till he might be a little more used to my conversation for said he smiling mine has been a very merry and odd sort of a life and therefore till i have more freedom i shall desist because i shall lose the spirit in telling it  we steered our course toward panama depending that our prisoners would spread the report of our going back again for the north sea in thirty six degrees and forty five minutes we discovered a vessel steering the same course i ordered the prize to chase her and before night she took her it was a bark laden with tallow and hides bound for la conception i repented the taking of her for we soon found she was but a heavy sailor and therefore could not keep company with us and it was not proper for us to let em depart  don pedro aquillio which was the name of of our intelligent spaniard told me he would undertake to dispose of the cargo and bark to a good advantage if i could tell how to dispose of the men which were but four that is three indians and a spaniard the indians were very well pleased to be received as servants on board yet we allowed em a half share in our future purchases the spaniard we intended to detain on board till we had made our cruising voyage and then release him so depending on don pedros ingenuity i let him go off with the bark with three spaniards to assist him having his promise to return the next day we were then within five leagues of la conception and therefore resolved to remain in that station till his arrival keeping mamelles de biobio or the dugs of biobio two rocks so called in view  the next day we perceived him coming with a pirogue a small spanish boat with one sail he brought me a handsome present of fruit and enough besides for the whole crew well said he i have made but an indifferent bargain i have brought you but twenty thousand pieces of eight the old rogue of a governor would not give any more he told me that the governor of la conception engrossed all the tallow and hides and forced the retailers to give him his own price so he went boldly to him and sold him bark and cargo  don pedro advised us to cruise for the manilla ship which was daily expected his advice was approved on all hands therefore orders were given to wood and water the ships for the voyage and accordingly we made for juan fernando and arrived there the fifth of september      it being a remarkable day with me it lives in my memory for the loss of my journal by an odd accident hinders my keeping a regular account we spent but two days in wooding and watering and killing goats which are there in great plenty  there are three islands that bear the name of juan fernando the first discoverer though there are no other inhabitants on them than goats there is a noble bay on the north side of the island capable of containing five hundred sail where you anchor at sixteen fathom water a sandy bottom we left it with a favorable wind for our design and made farther up the coast january the first and it was feared we had missed our booty for the manilla ship generally arrives at acapulco about christmas however we resolved to coast about for twenty days longer and if we failed of her to return into the north sea with a design to cruize down the coast  we kept out of sight of land for fear of being discovered  on the sixth we perceived two sail and accordingly gave em chase don philip assured me it was the manilla ship and a guardship along with her we called a council immediately where it was resolved the bark should attack the manilla ship while ours was to engage the man of war and this was the reason don pedro gave for it that the manilla ship was so very unweildy the bark could play round her and being so small she was out of the reach of their cannon for they could make no use but of those upon their upper deck the man of war seeing we gave em chase slackened her sail to stay for us imagining we should both attack him but he found himself mistaken our pink past him without firing a gun but as soon as ever we came along side we gave him a broadside with a loud huzza he soon returned it but we plied him so close that he began to make off but we followed him close at the heels and coming under his starboard quarter gave him another broadside which brought his mainmast by the board upon which he immediately struck  the sea being very smooth though a handsome breeze of wind we manned our longboat and i went on board with forty hands well armed when i came upon deck i ordered the spaniards to be taken on board and secured under hatches but i was much surpised to find but sixteen men in the ship besides eight that were killed and not one that appeared like an officer among em but we were soon informed the captain had ordered one hundred and fifty of his men on board the manilla ship as soon as they had discovered us in the morning because her crew were most of em sickly  we imagined our small vessel must have warm work on it being not above thirty five hands in all so we resolved immediately to cut off the rudder of the man of war and leave her for having lost her mainmast she could not follow us to do us any damage and six of her men we took on board us who finding we were english seemed very willing to serve us and i promised em their share in the booty if we succeeded these six men were old christians as they call themselves and they value themselves very much upon it despising the creolians we made all the sail we could after the manilla ship and soon overtook her for our small vessel had kept her very well in play though she had warm work on it and her rigging was very much shattered though they had not lost a single man but she was obliged to fall astern to mend her tackle i ordered em to send me twenty men on board which i was obliged to lie by for i had brought all my guns to bear on one side and did not fire one till i came under her stern and then i poured em into her and tacked about to charge again i observed a boat busy about her stern but could not imagine what they were doing however i resolved they that were in it should find a difficult matter to get on board again but i was much surpised to find it my own boat with don pedro in it who had taken the occasion in the smoke of our first broadside to nail up the rudder so that the ship could not tack about he made what haste he could on board the bark which had now mended all her rigging and got under her stern and as fast as the manilla ship sent men to clear her rudder he prevented em with his smallshot in the mean time we ventured to come along side of her notwithstanding her monstrous bulk and gave her such entertainment that they called out at last for quarter and struck their colors i ordered all the officers to come on board which they did i received em all very civilly and immediately after went on board the prize i was amazed at her vast bulk she had seven decks and built so strong that not one of our shot had gone through yet they had above sixty men killed through their ports and other vacancies and what was very surprising we had not one and but two wounded  they had above one hundred men sick on board em so that the ship looked like an hospital it was very richly laden and valued at   00000 dollars and upwards we found but little money on board besides the plate belonging to the governor of luconia one of the philippine islands who was coming home to his own country being a native of mexico  though this was the richest prize that ever was taken yet we did not know well what to do with it it would be an impossibility to work her into the north sea or back again to the east indies without farther help for we had more prisoners by two to one than we had sailors on board so we once more advised with don pedro who counseled us to send to acapulco and have the ship and men ransomed we all thought it would be both difficult and dangerous don pedro told us there should be neither and he would undertake to do it but however as it was a thing of very great consequence we desired he would tell us in what manner it should be done why as thus said he i will take the bark with the captain of the spanish man of war the quondam governor and one or two more of the best quality who shall make the case known to the city of acapulco and no other way but by letter for i will suffer but one of them to go on shore and i will take care to order it well enough to give you notice if they should send any force against us though there is no danger they should for added he they have no man of war within two hundred leagues of em that which was taken being all they had to guard their coast we were well satisfied with his reasons and gave him leave to proceed as he thought fit and accordingly the next day he set sail with those persons mentioned along with him and by the advice of all we followed him being very well convinced by the spaniards themselves there was nothing of force to be apprehended i had fitted up the spanish man of war again and resolved to keep her and dispose of the bark therefore as soon as we came within sight of land i ordered every thing to be taken out of her and put on board the spaniard who we found was a very good sailor  the day following don pedro came on board with several merchants and persons of quality to treat about the ransom of the prize and we agreed for   00000 dollars after we had taken several bales of rich goods out of her the money was to be paid in six days and we were to stay where we rode for i did not much care to trust em too far  in the mean time we sent all their sick and wounded on shore the bark we disposed of for provision and other necessaries and took the opportunity of waiting for the money to water our ships at the time appointed the money came and we surrendered the ship to the spaniards now we agreed by joint consent to go home for we were all rich enough and every one of the crew thought so yet we resolved to touch at st salvador on the coast of brasil and make our way through the magellan straits as well to take in some refreshments as to dispose of the rest of our goods and careen our vessels  accordingly we put our design in execution and made the best of our way for the straits of magellan and discovered those noted clouds which are a sure guide to sailors the third of may we found the weather extremely cold and the mountains covered with snow but we were well provided with good liquors and all convenient clothing we anchored in port famine formerly called knights bay by the dutch in a voyage      with a fleet of five sail where meeting with many troubles and to eternize the memory of the voyage it being the first the dutch made to those straits the admiral knighted six of the officers by the title of knights of the furious lion the oaths they received at the ceremony were never to do or consent to do any thing against their honors or to prejudice their present voyage to expose their lives for the service of their commonwealth and to do their utmost in driving the spaniards from their golden world they were installed on shore with a seagreen garter and a table built with their names engraved on it  we saw several of the inhabitants who were easily prevailed upon to come on board us but i could find nothing extraordinary in their height as is fabulously reported the tallest i could see among them did not exceed six foot they are certainly a poor miserable people but very harmless and i am apt to believe all former stories of their monstrous height and cruelty to be fables  we got through the straits once more into the north sea and by degrees came into a warmer climate but a terrible storm overtook us just as we were in sight of pepys island which drove us within sight of port desire upon the continent and therefore we thought it the safest way to run into the bay which accordingly we did and came to an anchor in seventeen fathom water  at the south side of the port lies penguin island so called from a multiplicity of those birds resorting there our men went on shore and in three hours time brought on board five hundred of the fowls and several thousands of their eggs which proved delicious food they are called penguin not from their fatness as some authors affirm but from their whiteness mixed with black they are about the bigness of a goose weighing between nine and fourteen pound and though their chief diet is fish yet they have no fishy taste their skin is very thick their bill is like that of a raven though not altogether so crooked their neck is short and thick and the rest of their body resembles a goose excepting the wings which are only two stumps covered with feathers which they make use of in swimming their feet are black like those of a swan they breed in holes of the rocks which are so numerous there is no walking hardly for fear of falling into them when they walk on shore it is upright with their wings hanging down so that they appear in that posture like small pigmies we staid but two days here and then steered our course for rio janeiro or the river of january intending to touch at st sebastians first and if we did not succeed there to sail for st salvador when we arrived there the portugueze would not admit us to enter the bay but fired several guns from the forts laden with shot to deter us from anchoring we could not imagine the meaning of it but however we left em in that humor and steered for st salvador and in one and twenty days we discovered praya de zumba a place very easily known from a number of white spots which appear like linen hung out to whiten or dry  we past fort st anthony and saluted it with eleven guns which returned us an equal number without the charge of shot and came to an anchor within half a league of the city which we also saluted with eleven guns and received but seven in return  by advice of the officers we shared among the sailors a thousand pieces of eight a man which pleased em exceedingly the next day i went to wait on the governor who received me very civilly and desired i would dine with him we were very magnificently served and a band of italian music played all the while after dinner i made my presents which he accepted of very kindly but when i came to treat about our commerce he flatly denied me telling me it was against the king of portugals express orders to suffer any trading with foreigners i begged his pardon if it was not to be complied with he would have returned my present but i pressed him to accept it in so obliging a manner that he did and told me in french that since he saw my generosity he would comply with me he immediately sent for several merchants and took em into his closet where they stayed some time when they came out again the governor told me those gentlemen would go on board and view our commodities and if we could agree he would be answerable for the money one of the persons seemed to be of a more free and open disposition than the portugueze generally are though most of the inhabitants of st salvador affect the manners of the french we soon made an end of our bargain and my merry merchant would oblige me to go ashore and sup with him that night he pressed me so heartily that i could not refuse him and accordingly i went with only my two indian servants who began to be understood in english  when we arrived at the merchants house i was surpised to find it so magnificent he led us into a handsome summer house in the garden where he told me we were to sup and said he to convince you that you are welcome i will bring my wife and daughter to keep us company which is reckoned as a thing extraordinary among us but added he i have been in england and france and i find the women are not the less honest for having their liberty i told him i thought constraint did but whet their inventions to gain their desires said he i am of your mind therefore give em all the liberty they desire and i cannot find i have had any reason to repent it  in a little time he ushered in the two ladies his wife and daughter both very beautiful and notwithstanding the heat of the climate very fair the wife seemed about five and thirty the daughter about sixteen and they both spoke very good french our conversation was kept up with all the spirit i was capable of i soon discovered a great deal of wit in them both and made em my compliment in finding ladies so extraordinary in so remote a part of the world  when we had supped the merchant whose name was don jaques told me it was his custom to provide beds for his guests as well as supper and after we had walked a turn or two round the garden we all retired to our several apartments  the next morning we drank chocolate together and i invited don jaques with his wife and daughter to dine with me on board the next day which he consented to i now begged leave to be gone but it being very hot he had provided me a silk palanquin which is a thing like a hammock with a canopy over it carried by two blacks with each a rest to hang it on while they take breath this is all the vehicle in use at st salvador by reason of the unevenness and steepness of the situation  i prepared for them with all the magnificence i could the next day and when they saw the variety of dishes dressed after the english manner they were mightily pleased and to add to their satisfaction the music i had on board played several elegant pieces accompanied with the trumpet i had got from on board the spanish prize for notwithstanding his being trumpeter to the garrison of baldivia yet he was better pleased to be where he was we drank the king of england and the king of portugals health several times with the discharge of our cannon and when the time for their going on shore came i fastened a small present of several sorts of silk upon the wife and daughter don jaques perceived what i was about and merrily said that is not fair we did not pay you for your company yesterday and yet i believe it was as valuable as that you received today at least in my opinion i shant answer for the ladies said he they are both capable of speaking for themselves i received many compliments on all hands but not dealing much in them i am very willing to forget em  in a day or two after don jaques came on board and told me the money for the goods was ready but i should not have it unless i came my self to receive it i accordingly went with him and he made me continue there all night where we had the conversation of the ladies as before  when i was going away the next day he told me he should soon find if any thing else besides money had the power to bring me to see him i told him to convince him of that i would come and dine with him the next day which accordingly i did after dinner i expressed a desire of seeing the most remarkable places in the city which he complied with and ordered two palanquins to carry us  the city of st salvador the capital of brasil is situated in the bay of all saints in    degrees    minutes southern latitude it is divided into two towns the upper and the lower the streets are strait and pretty broad but most of them very steep and all the goods are hoisted in and out of the vessels by machines for that purpose it was formerly under the dominion of the spaniards but taken from them by the dutch in      and pretty well fortified by them yet notwithstanding that the spaniards retook it the next year i could not learn how long the portugueze have possessed it but they all agree upwards of fifty years they have made it a regular fortified place and very strong having five forts besides the castle well stored with cannon and other ammunition and small arms for ten thousand men this is the usual seat of the viceroy of brasil but when i was there it was without one though he was expected every day  the cathedral is a magnificent pile of building finely adorned and painted after the modern manner the jesuits church is a noble structure all of european marble with a fine organ the pipes gilt there are many more fine churches twenty in all besides several convents and monasteries  this place is also the residence of a bishop who has a handsome palace and for the reverend the clergy i never saw such a number for the bigness of the place any where as benedictines franciscans carmelites augustins capuchins dominicans and barefoot friars though i think most of the people i saw there wore no stockings there are three nunneries well stored with nuns but not to be seen nor hardly any women in the town but common whores or black slaves for the portugueze lock up their wives and daughters as carefully as they do their money and would have none look upon them but themselves except my friend don jaques which is something the more extraordinary  it is a place of great trade to guinea and other parts and is accounted one of the richest cities in the king of portugals dominions by moderate account there may be about  0000 whites or i should say portugueze for they are none of the whitest and about treble that number of slaves  don jaques would make me take five days up in viewing the several parts of the city and obliged me to be at his house without going on board during that time some part of the day we played at ombre a game mightily in vogue among the spaniards and portugueze and a very entertaining game for three invented by the jealous spaniards for that number to prevent any clandestine doings between two but alas i believe there are more opportunities gained than lost by it  we had provided every thing we wanted now and began to prepare for our departure  don jaques was very sorry to lose me he told me and indeed it was with some regret i left him for his civility had drawn from me a friendship insensibly i went to take leave of the governor who made me a present of american sweetmeats and begged i would dine with him which i could not in good manners deny when dinner was over don jaques was so obligingly pressing for me to sup with him the last time that i could not refuse but i begged he would excuse my staying all night and he gave me his word he would not press me i sent one of my indians to order the boat to fetch me at ten that evening  when the time of my stay was expired i took my leave of don jaques and the family after having forced him to accept of a gold watch and the ladies a present of each a diamond ring that i received from the governor of luconia for my civility in returning him his plate and jewels when we took the acapulco ship in the south sea  well said don jaques i see you will pay for your board in spite of my teeth i had taken leave of the wife and daughter before who had left us in tears i must own i thought my self very much obliged for their tenderness and it drew such a deep melancholy upon my face with thoughts of my dear wife that don jaques imagined it was grief for parting with him and his family i did not take any pains to undeceive him well said he i see a friendship may be contracted in a few days as well as love especially where there is a harmony of souls  we had agreed to correspond together and i had undertaken to send him some european goods if it pleased god to guard me safe to europe i had continued longer with don jaques than i had intended to do therefore whatever violence i did my self i took my leave don jaques tenderly embraced me and was so much overwhelmed with grief that i could not forbear sympathizing with him but i ordered his servants whom i had liberally rewarded for the trouble i gave to shut the door to prevent their masters going any farther  i walked toward the port very melancholy though with some precipitation but was roused out of it by one of my indians crying master take a care take a care i turned about and saw four portugueze pursuing us i made a stand and drew my sword took my cloak from my indian and put it across my arm to defend my self the better they all four attacked me at once but my indians whom i had ordered to wear swords on shore fell upon em furiously and dispatched two of em immediately and i had made a shift to drop a third though not without receiving several wounds the fourth ran for it but my indians being as nimblefooted as does soon overtook him and dragged him down the hill by the hair of his head while he cried out all the while misericordia misericordia the noise we made had brought up my boats crew who were all armed with pistols and cutlasses and the guard coming in the mean time and seeing my indians dragging the fugitive fell upon us but my crew and indians charged em so furiously that they soon put em to flight though treble our number though this availed us but little for the whole garrison was coming down upon us i then ordered my crew to resist no more but submit to em for as we were innocent i did not much fear to come off clear  the bustle had roused don jaques and his servants who were soon informed of the condition i was in and he came in good time to interpose his authority for the portugueze began to be outrageous but the governor had sent a gentleman to bring us before him and accordingly i went accompanied by don jaques but the wounds i had received bled so much that they were obliged to carry me to don jaquess and send for a surgeon my hurts were not dangerous but i was very faint with loss of blood  don jaques waited on the governor and informed him of the condition i was in but the governor not understanding who was the aggressor ordered a guard of soldiers at the door of the house where i was my boats crew soon got on board and alarmed both the ships who immediately weighed and came close to shore where they had prepared to fire upon the town if i was not released instantly i understanding the matter sent one to inform them that the guard was set upon me to secure me from the insults of the portugueze till the truth of the matter was discovered this would not serve their turn but a hundred of em with the officers and don pedro landed all well armed and vowed to wait the event on shore the governor did me the honor of a visit and inquired into the cause and i informed him as well as my weakness would permit me when they had examined the dead portugueze they found one of them was nephew to the deceased viceroy upon the discovery of which the portugueze began to be very much exasperated and were hardly restrained from rushing into the house and tearing me to pieces for though they did not regard the nephew yet they had a great veneration for his deceased uncle who behaved himself with a great deal of candor in his post and the inhabitants mightily regretted his loss the governor appeased their fury by telling em i should have no favor shown me if i were guilty let the consequence be what it would and immediately a court was summoned to try me though it was midnight and i was carried there in a palanquin weak as i was but i was obliged to send for my lieutenant and tell him that there was no danger and also ordered him to send the crew on board again when we came to the place of justice the governor ordered me a seat but the business was soon ended for the portugueze we had secured owned that his master had designed to murder me because he was informed i was his rival in the beautiful donna bianca which was the daughter of don jaques i was very much surprised as well as don jaques at this report and we both declared it was only a jealous suggestion of the gentleman which every one came into and the grounds he had for it was my often frequenting don jaquess house upon the score of friendship only and lodging there  the governor handsomely dismissed me and told me he was very sorry i had been detained from my affairs i returned that i was as sorry to be the cause of so unhappy an accident in a country where i had received so much civility  don jaques begged i would go back to his house and stay till my wounds were well but the governor took us aside and said to us in french i know don jaques it is your friendship for the captain that makes you desire his company but if i might advise you i would have him go on board upon the instant for though he is very innocent as to the matter yet i doubt some of the deceaseds friends or relations which are numerous not having regard to justice will contrive some method to dispatch him out of the way for most of the portugueze are jealous malicious and revengeful and very seldom look into the merits of the cause  i thanked the governor for his kind caution and don jaques notwithstanding his friendship could not but come into what he had said i therefore ordered my self to be carried on board that moment it being broad day the governor and his guard would accompany me to the waterside but don jaques would go on board with me in the boat he told me he had some thoughts of coming to reside in england for said he i have enough and therefore i will in two or three years more leave off traffic and live quiet in the world but he begged i would write to him as soon as i arrived in europe and let him know the place i had chose to live in for added he let it be where it will if it is ever my fortune to arrive safe in europe i will take another voyage only for the hopes of seeing you i returned him the acknowledgment due to so much friendship and we parted with tears on both sides  as soon as i had got on board the wind being fair we weighed and stood out of the bay when we were out at sea a letter was brought me written in french the translation of which is as follows  sir i was resolved to make trial of you before i suffered my heart to choose you for a friend and i am so well convinced of the sincerity of your soul that i will confide in you a secret dear to my repose i had an amor with a beautiful lady before i was married that produced the bearer of this letter i have kept him concealed from my family hitherto but the person i trusted with his education and this secret being dead i feared i should find some difficulty to conceal him any longer here therefore depending upon your good nature and friendship i have ventured to send him to you with sufficient to bear his expenses in his education which i would have suitable to the estate i have in my power to give him i shall ever own this obligation and always think it my greatest happiness to subscribe my self  your sincere friend and servant jaques de ramires   i must own i was very much surpised at this epistle and could not imagine his reasons for concealing it from me i ordered the person that brought the letter to be conducted in and immediately entered my cabin one of the beautifullest boys i had ever set my eyes on he seemed about fifteen his hair fair and long curling down his shoulders in short every feature so exact and uniform and so innocent withal that i was amazed at last i took him by the hand and embraced him and told him for his fathers sake he should be as dear to me as my own son but finding he did not answer me for i spoke to him in english i repeated the same in french he returned me thanks and said he did not doubt but he should find it so  after some time he delivered me a casket in which were jewels to the value of five thousand pistoles and a little box which contained a thousand moidores i told him i would take as much care of them as if they were my own  these sir said the youth are designed to bear my charges then ordering another box in had it opened and told me what it contained was a present from his father to me when i examined it i found six silver dishes and three dozen of plates of the same metal a dozen of knives forks and spoons in gold and half a dozen of gold sweetmeat plates in a larger box was variety of all manner of conserves and cordials and i was informed he had made small presents to every officer in the ship and to the common sailors a weeks fresh provision with liquor in proportion i was amazed at his bounty for his present to me was what a prince might have received i thought it was my duty to show all the kindness i was capable of to the son of so generous a father therefore i ordered him a fieldbed in my own cabin and his behavior was so engaging that i felt as much tenderness for him as if he had really been my own child and having skill in surgery i trusted him with the management of my wounds though i had a very good shipsurgeon who supplied him with what he wanted my hurts which were not dangerous soon healed and i recovered my strength again i could not prevail upon young don ferdinand don jaquess son to go often upon deck he said he would rather choose to stay in the cabin where he had french books of his own and some of mine to entertain him for i had taken my opportunity to procure several at st salvador and among the rest a french and english grammar and dictionary which mightily pleased don ferdinand for he had a great desire to learn english i gave him all the helps i could and he in return instructed me in the portugueze language so that in a short time we could discourse in either  we had resolved to steer our course for the island of tercera the capital of the azores and after fifty days sail we discovered the peak of one of the islands of azores which is called pico from the mountain it is in the resemblance of a pyramid and may be discovered as many leagues off as the pike of teneriff for we were then by observation thirty leagues off from it and yet could see it distinctly  in two days more we discovered the island of st michael we were all pleased that we had entered that part of the world we call europe the birthplace of most of us and what pleased us more was that we had made all our fortunes  august the   th      we anchored in the bay of angra the capital of the azores in the island tercera i cannot give any great commendation to the port being i think it a very indifferent one we did not design to stay long only to get some water and some fresh provisions for we were informed there was no riding out a storm there we got in what we wanted with all expedition we could while the weather was favorable  the city is seated at the bottom of the bay under the brow of a hill called monto de brasil or the brasil mountain but for what reason so called i could not be informed it is very well fortified having two strong castles and eight batteries besides with guns of thirty pounds shot but it is very indifferently garrisoned having no more than two hundred men in pay and most wretchedly supplied having no clothing for three years  the town is very agreeable having a stream of water running quite through it which drives several miles for the use of the public and almost in every quarter are public fountains of excellent tasted water from this place are brought the finest canarybirds though less than those of the canaries yet they exceed em far in the excellency of their pipes  money is very scarce here and consequently every thing cheap i bought two months biscuit for the ships much cheaper than in any port of europe corn is their chief commodity which they send to portugal but for any other trade i believe the king of portugal gets but little advantage  i was grown such a proficient in the portugueze tongue that i could make a shift to be understood and by understanding that language soon found a gate to the spanish tongue by the help of don pedro who had learnt to speak english very fluently we got acquainted with one of the fathers of the cordeliers who showed us the churches and other things of note in the city the cathedral is a very handsome building and well painted which goes by the name of st salvador and there is no danger of missing that title and st anthony every where among the portugueze there is no less than twenty besides the cathedral with four monasteries and four convents that have each their chapel beautifully adorned when we had got what refreshments were wanting we set sail for the straits intending to touch no where before we were got into the mediterranean and because we met with nothing extraordinary in our voyage to gibralter i will to divert the reader give him instead of bearing of coasts changes of wind and unexpected storms the life of my companion don pedro aquilio which he related to us during the voyage in the following manner  the life of don pedro aquilio my father residing in france when the commotions were ingendring between the king and the parliament was made fast to the interest of cardinal de retz by marrying one of his neices of a very great fortune he had a hand in most of the secret transactions of those times and wading too deep in those seas of trouble was obliged to retire to his native country he foreseeing what would happen took care of his affairs accordingly sold his estate in france and sent my mother to sevil the place of his birth whither he soon followed the king of spain having a very great regard for him gave him several offices of honor and prosit and when i was born i was son to the first man in the city my father by living so long in france had contracted the manners of the french and the formality of the spaniard seemed as strange to him as if he had been born in another climate he had several children though none survived but my self when i had years enough over my head to fear the prejudice of education he took a resolution of sending me to the college of the four nations in paris to complete my studies and the first thing i learnt was to shake off all the customs of spain which was soon done for they had taken but small impression in my mind because i found my father was averse to em i contracted a friendship with several young french noblemen of my own age for parity of years is the first step to friendship  when i had reached my fifteenth year i began to think of a mistress to complete my studies and as i found it was a method among my companions to supplant each other in their females without any animosity i set my self so willingly about it that out of half a dozen madonas i made my self master of six of em this occasioned many plots and contrivances to regain the flying fair ones though i perceived most money laid out in presents had a prevailing force with em we had our allowance paid quarterly and getting all my companions into gaming i had the good fortune to strip em all they seemed to be a little uneasy in losing their mistresses and money too and my telling em as i had got the females i should have the most occasion for the money signified nothing but they all begged it as a great favor that i would lend em half what i had won to be repaid the next quarter which to oblige em i complied with and to play we fell again but fortune changed her amiable looks from me and i soon lost all i had won with my own share too the fickle dame favored one of the company that would not lend any of us a penny this chagrind the rest very much but to prevent any more importunity he went away to his own chamber leaving room in all our pockets for the devil to dance a saraband for we had not one cross to keep him out and what was our greatest mortification the holydays were approaching that used to give us the opportunity of rambling into the country the person that won our money happened to be the last that was added to our society and though he had not been long among us we began to be tired of him as much from his odd humors as his effeminacy i at last thought of a project to be revenged on him and it was very much approved by the rest of my companions the holydays being come we designed for our country rendezvous but he that bore the purse would not go with us without we could produce every one so much money this put us to our shifts again but my man who was an arch wag begged that i would accept of what he had for i had been so lucky as to have paid him his wages before my loss i accepted of his offer and took from him ten lewis dors we contrived it so well that they were shown to old sir snip from every person of our society well said he sixty lewis dors will do our business but who should be pursebearer was what he cavild at and not caring to trust any of us and we resolved not to trust him he pitched upon my man to be cashkeeper for us all and accordingly he put down in his pocketbook so much money in bank received of such and such persons when in reality he had but twenty lewis dors  when we had contrived every thing we took horse and rode six leagues that evening to the place where we designed to put in execution our project we had agreed to pay every night the expenses of the day and have it set down in my mans book but when he was called for as we had concerted no man was to be found there was strange enquiry made to no purpose and we all agreed he had taken the opportunity to rob us and run away with our money all that we had to do was to beg of snip to discharge the house but he declared he had not half a pistole in his pocket which we knew very well for he had sewed all the rest into his wastecoat since it falls out so unluckily said i dont let us make known our wants to the house but go to rest and consult tomorrow i lay with snip for fear he should take it into his head to sneak off in the night when i found he was fast asleep i bundled up all his clothes and threw them out of the window to my man that waited for them  when morning came i desired him to rise that we might get all together to consult but no clothes were to be found he began to storm and swear but all to no purpose for not one of his oaths would bring back a rag of his clothes he told us in his ravings that he had lost so much money sewed up in his wastecoat we upbraided him for his covetousness in not letting us share with him but it did not signify any thing he threatened to go to the provost and have the landlord secured and would have dont if he had not been naked  after raving to no purpose he was obliged to go to bed again to avoid catching cold he asked us what he should do in his condition but all the advice we gave him brought him no consolation  he was very tall and large made and we used to call him in ridicule the infant he proposed to sell his horse to cloth him but being so much out of size there was not any thing to be had ready made that would fit him this was still worse and worse and though the horse was sold for twenty pistoles we contrived it so that my landlord seized the money for his reckoning this put him almost beside himself and he was ready to expire with vexation  i pretended to be much concerned at this usage while the rest of our company laughed at his misfortune i seemed to be very angry with them and told em i would do my endeavor to remedy every thing i made em acquainted that i had just called to mind a person a friend of mine that lived in the town much of the infants size and i would go to borrow a suit of clothes for him he seemed very much rejoiced at this for he resolved as soon as ever he was dressed to take up the landlord and swear the robbery against him  i went as he supposed about his clothes and after staying some time below i went up with a bundle and seemed very much concerned that i could not succeed i told the infant the gentleman was gone to lions about business of concern and had carried all his clothes with him but i had brought him a masquerade habit that he had left behind him  he expressed some satisfaction at the sight of it that he should not be confined to lie in bed but said he if it were not only for the name of clothes a man might as well go naked for there is no stirring abroad in this dress  it was the habit of a satyr that we had made on purpose for the occasion before we left paris when we had equipped him it was as much as i could do to keep my countenance at the figure he made and he seemed very much dissatisfied with it but however he wore it for the convenience of not lying in bed  when we were at dinner we had many contrivances to get away but none feazable  i told em at last i had thought of a design would certainly do our business and make up our losses if the infant would consent to it he readily replied he would stick at nothing to do that why then said i if you will suffer your self to be shown in that habit as a monster newly arrived i will answer for the success of it  after much talk he agreed to do it on this proviso that his face should be disguised i told him i would step to my friends house for the mask that was made to the habit i returned and gave it to him and he was soon satisfied with the project  notwithstanding the bustle we made none of the house but the landlord knew any thing of the matter and the next day it was given out about the town that a monster was to be shown in the afternoon we had procured a chain and other materials to carry on the joke and when the time came to show away we had such a concourse of people to see our monster it being in the holydays that our profit gave us some satisfaction for when the time of showing was over our money amounted to three and twenty pistoles and the monster behaved himself so well with our instructions that he gave a general content  we had taken care he should appear so fierce that none should approach near enough to discover the deceit we had a great deal of diversion at the ignorant peoples suggestions one country fellow asked how old he was i told him four years three months and five days lord bless me cried he out why by that time he comes to be twenty no house will be able to hold him  in fine we showed him so long that our money mounted to upwards of one hundred pounds which pleased our infant so well that he desired to continue a monster all the time of the holydays but we resolved to carry the joke no further though we did not tell him so  we left the infant chained to the post of the window as usual went down to my landlord and gave him instructions how to behave himself we took care to satisfy him very well for the trouble he had been at  we all rid away to the next village and putting up our horses returned on foot one by one back again to the inn and stole up stairs unperceived by any one but the landlord the infant finding we staid longer than ordinary began to make a great noise which my landlord hearing sent up one of his servants that knew nothing of the secret when the infant saw him come in he made several signs to him but as the fellow knew nothing of the jest he did not much like the action of the infant but ran down to his master frighted out of his wits  we had made peepholes in the bordering room where we could perceive every action of the infants but he was so very much enraged that he sat down biting his nails for vexation for he began to perceive the trick we had put upon him after sitting melancholy some time he rose up and endeavored to undo the chains but as they were tied close behind and made fast to a staple in the wall all his efforts proved vain all our care was to contain from laughing which was a very hard task when he found he could not free himself rage entirely possessed him and the noise he made with stamping and rattling his chains brought up several of the servants armed who opened the door cautiously but notwithstanding their valor ran away as soon as they perceived his menacing action and tumbling over one another took the shortest way down stairs  when we thought he had mortification enough we sent my landlord into him with a good horsewhip and a letter in his hand as soon as he had got within the door he spoke after this manner in a landlordlike tone i was pretty well assured at the beginning that thou were a rank cheat but now i am convinced of it i will chastise thee first and reason with thee afterward like other criminal judges punish first and enquire into the demerits of the cause afterward that justice may not wait for any body  these words were followed with some smart strokes and the dialogue soon began to be in much confusion for between the roaring of the infant the bawling of my landlord and the smacking of the whip it was a continual jargon of noise and we were obliged all of us to own our host executed his commission to a hair  when he had a little recovered himself he began to reason with his patient who that he might the better hear him laid himself down on his palate to condole his afflicted body but their questions being very long and the answers but short consisting of two monosyllables ay or no i will not trouble you with the relation  after their dialogue was over he gave him the letter which discovered our design upon him he was thunderstruck at our combination and uttered such imprecations of revenge that my landlord was obliged to answer him with his whip which soon reduced him to reason  we began to be tired with our infant and so put an end to our diversion and his torture by sending him his clothes though some of our company would have had him gone to paris in that trim  in a few days after the frolic was over he commenced a suit of law against us all for a robbery but the judges finding it only a trick of mirth fined every one of the defendants six livres apiece and every one to pay his own costs this but enraged the infant the more and he began to meditate a more pernicious revenge for now he appeared the ridicule of the whole city and he could never stir without a train of boys at his heels  the first instance of it was as follows my servant having some intrigue on his hands had made bold with my clothes to carry it on and coming home pretty late was shot through the back with a pistol ball just as he was entering the college gates though it was well meant the poor fellow escaped with life yet he lay dangerously ill for several days he could give no account of the affair at all not having seen the person that wounded him but the accident made me very uneasy for i was convinced the favor was meant to me this made me cautious how i ventured out of the college for it was easy to imagine it was a proof of the infants resentment who had left the college upon the loss of his trial  i began now to repent our confederacy against him and wrote him a note to assure him of my contrition with my share of the money we had taken from him he received the cash and sent me word he heartily forgave me imagining him sincere i ventured into the city and soon frequented my old rendezvous but i had so much regard for my self as to get to college betimes  one night as i was going home four men in vizor masks rushed out from behind a wall of a house that was building they all fired upon me and ran away as soon as they had discharged their pieces i must confess at first fear made me imagine my self no man of this world but by degrees getting over my apprehension i found i had not got any hurt this accident to me seemed prodigious for they were all four so near me that several grains of the powder stuck in my face but i was brought out of my labyrinth of thought when i received the following letter the next morning  sir i must own my self one of those unfortunate men that for want of better employment receive money as the price of blood though this i can say with a clear conscience i never have yet put my trade in practice yesterday morning i was sent for to the house of monsieur gomberville commonly called the infant who employed me to take away your life and that he would be sure of the execution made one of the four that fired upon you last night but as i had the ordering of our arms i took care nothing should be put in em that was hurtful the acquaintance i had with your noble father made me the more cautious concerning his son i beg in justice to me you would keep your chamber and cause it to be reported that you are dangerously wounded i need not caution you to be careful of your self for the infants malice seems to me implacable we never have any words made of these things because we know how to revenge our selves therefore let no one else know the contents of this and be thankful for your life from  jaques marriot   when i had read the letter i ordered my servant to bring the bearer before me where i soon found by his manner of talking that a little money would be very acceptable to the sender and therefore i sent him ten pistoles with my humble service giving him to know that i would exactly comply with the contents  i began now seriously to think on the danger i had inconsiderately drawn upon my self for an innocent frolic and that it would be but ill trusting to the infants resentment i gave out that i was dangerously wounded and the better to carry it on i got a surgeon a friend of mine to visit me frequently  when i had kept my chamber long enough for the time of my cure i ventured abroad but never without four or five of my friends for a guard and came home in very good time  during my confinement i received letters of condolement from several of my mistresses and when they heard of my recovery as many of reproach for not coming to visit them as usual one in particular and my favorite fair was very pressing for a meeting and her chief reason was to pay her with my presence for the affronts she had sustained from the infant upon my account i sent her word i would not fail waiting on her the sunday following after dusk accordingly when the time came i stole out without any of the college marks on and arrived safe at my madonas  after supper and two or three bottles of hermitage we went to bed and when we had made our selves as merry as we could in the dark i addressed my self to sleep but notwithstanding my willingness to receive the gentle god he still flew from me and several hours passed without closing my eyes  about midnight i thought i heard whispers in the next room which very much alarmed me but my fears were trebly increased when looking through a chink of the door i discovered the infant and four other fellows with masks in their hands spreading sawdust on the floor and on the table lay several sacks  i soon imagined what their preparations meant therefore consulted my safety as well as i could in the confusion of my thoughts  i went always well armed since the last rencounter having two brace of pistols in my pockets a good cutting sword and a stilletto but i was confounded when searching for my clothes where i had laid them none could be found i now began to think of death seriously and beg pardon sincerely of god for all my sins for i knew it would be madness to think of escaping naked as i was without any thing for my defnce in the chaos of my thoughts i remembered a closet which had a window that looked into the seine and though it was three stories from the river yet as i could swim i thought it better to trust providence by leaping into the water than those cutthroats i stole softly to the window but to my great consternation found it too fast for me to open but by good fortune in groping about i found my clothes i put em on with a great deal of precipitation and having prepared my arms resolved not to die alone  i waited some time before the chamber door opened when it was open i could perceive em coming in with masks on and the foremost with a darklanthorn i did not think fit to wait till they should discover i was not in the bed but rushed on the first and shot him dead on the spot and in two seconds of a minute dispatched two more one with my sword and the other with one of my pistols and had made as quick work with the other two but they fell on their knees and begged for mercy which i granted on condition that one should tie the other which was readily complied with when that was done i bound the other my self and coming to secure my false mistress found her expiring in the bed she had breath enough left to tell me she had been caught in her own trap for designing to poison me in the wine i drank the servant had mistaken the bottle and given it to her  i asked her the reason of her hatred to me being as i remembered guilty of no fault she told me the infant had informed her that i was false to her which converted her love to the most implacable hatred i must own this woman was mistress of my heart and i had several proofs of her sincerity but she was of a temper composed of fire and fury she further told me that i had raised her rage to that height that she was resolved to put an end to my life her self not caring to trust her revenge to any hands but her own  she begged i would forgive her and immediately expired i examined my two intended murderers and found they were servants to the infant and compelled to what they did therefore i resolved to pardon em  i thought once of going to the provost and give him a particular account of the action but one of the fellows informed me he was a near relation of the infants and had a very great love for him which made me apprehend his passion would overcome his justice therefore i resolved the next morning to set out for spain which i put in practice before day and gave my man orders to follow me  i left paris with this reflection that from the meanest triffling accident often dreadful effects followed and a woman once provoked was the most dangerous enemy a man could have  i met with nothing extraordinary in my voyage to cales but when i arrived at sevil i was informed my father who was governor of that city was at his country house about six leagues off  though i was very much fatigued with my journey i resolved to wait on him that night i hired a mule for i had my servants clothes on and set out but my beast being none of the best tired with me about a league before i came to the villa where my father resided  i left him in the adjacent village and pursued my journey on foot as i was willing to get to my fathers house i made all the speed i could and though it was very dark i knew the way perfectly  i overtook two men in a narrow lane that called to me asking why i had stayed so long and where was don lewis  i fancied there was something of villainy going forward by the name of don lewis being he was an inveterate enemy of my fathers i did not answer em immediately which brought em upon me they soon found their mistake they asked me where i was going at that time of night i told em i was going to saragoza to my friends for i had served a gentleman in cadiz that had discharged me for getting his maid with child and i was obliged to walk all night being i had not any money to pay for a lodging i answered a great many other questions with the same truth and simplicity and after talking some time two more came up to us and asked the others who they had got with em they went all together and after a little talk one that seemed to be the superior came up to me and told me if i would make one of their enterprise that night he would not only reward me well but take me into his service but if i refused after he had disclosed it to me they would murder me upon the instant  i told him i would stick at nothing to get bread why then said sir gravity my name is don lewis i have a mortal hatred to ferdinand aquilio governor of sevil i have waited many years for my revenge but never could get an opportunity to execute it till now he has received one of my servants into his house as a domestic who this night will open the door to us where i shall quench my hatred of him with his blood and further to dispatch all fear of resistance i can assure you there are but two more servants in the house whom my fellow has made drunk which shall be ordered so as if they had murdered their master  it was well for me that darkness covered the hemisphere or the old devil could have discovered the confusion in my countenance but notwithstanding my consternation i told him i should be proud to serve him in this or any other adventure gramercy said the old one and here is something to encourage thee clapping a handful of dollars into my hand  i will leave you to guess the confusion of my thoughts at this declaration and i was casting about in my mind how i should prevent this intended villainy  when we arrived at my fathers we found the treacherous villain wating for his master as soon as ever he saw us he cried softly to don lewis i am glad your honor is come but don ferdinand is in his closet and does not intend to go to bed tonight because he is to be at sevil early in the morning and he has shut his closetdoor why then said don lewis well break it open but returned the servant he has arms always ready in his closet and i fear the enterprise will be a little difficult for he is a tough old blade  upon this account a small pause ensued which gave me leisure to think and to the old one i uttered my thoughts  sir said i submit this business to me and i will inform you how i design to execute it your servant shall accompany me to the door of his closet and knock and as soon as ever he opens it i will give a good account of the old gentleman  thou counsellest well replied the old don and i will reward thee accordingly when the work is done and i shall deserve it thought i to my self if my intention succeeds  upon this resolve we went into the house and the fellow conducted me up stairs very softly the closet was at the end of a large room the door of which i bolted on the inside with one hand and plunged my poniard to the heart of the fellow with the other who dropped dead at my feet at the noise he made in falling my father cried out who is there and rushed out of his closet with a pistol in his hand i replied it is i your son  you may imagine the surprise my father was in at this sudden appearance and to see one of his servants weltring in blood and dead before me sir said i banish your surprise and go with me into your closet where i will inform you of this sudden and unlookdfor appearance and must farther add that the hand of providence by me has saved you from death  my father followed me into his study without speaking where i declared in as few words as the time would permit all that had befallen me that night and we soon came to a resolution what to do  we took each of us a blunderbuss with a brace of pistols went down the back stairs and came in upon em a way they little expected i came first into the hall as we had concerted  as soon as the old wretch saw me he cried well my lad have thou dispatched the villain yes sir said i and have dragged him down that you may behold what i have done when he heard that he gave a leap for joy and came running forward to view the pleasing sight but words cannot express his looks when he saw my father confronting him with a bluderbuss in his hand he stood motionless as if he had been turned to stone  the other three endeavored to make their escape but i discharged my blunderbuss and stopped two of them with my hasty messengers the report of my piece made don lewis fall down as imagining himself slain the third person finding it impossible to escape became desperate and like a stag at bay defied us he pulled out a stilletto and ran upon me like an angry lion and notwithstanding i shot him in the breast with a brace of balls wounded me in three several places i grappling with him we came down together upon the body of don lewis who with our weight began to cry out and that moment had been the last of my life if my father had not ran to my assistance and with his sword nailed my antagonist to the pavement  the report of our firearms had wakened the two drunken servants of my father who came half frightened out of their senses by this time don lewis had recovered himself and seeing death before him fell down upon his knees and implored my fathers mercy  thou base man replied my father how can thou expect to live after thy barbarous attempt upon his life that never wronged thee he told him he did not expect to be forgiven only to be allowed a priest and confession and he would die with a hearty penitence for his sins  wretch cried my father thou may see how heaven abhors thy fact by blasting thy design this man thou see before thee whom thou did employ in thy black design is my own son whose coming hither was like an angel sent from heaven to my assistance i see returned the don the seal of providence is upon you and i heartily repent the crime i intended to commit and if you will forgive me and forget what is past i will esteem you as the saver of my life and to unite our friendship i will match my daughter with a noble dowry to this your son and may they ever live happy  my father was too much a gentleman to murder in cold blood though he had sufficient excuse on his side if he had done it on the other hand his daughter was a very great fortune even beyond his hopes  after some small pause he made him this reply sir you know within your self that you have forfeited your life by the law in so basely attempting mine but as i can forgive any injury designed me if you perform your first promise i am resolved to forgive all that is past sir replied the other transported with joy i am so much obliged to you for my life that i will not stir out of your house till i have signed articles of agreement and i must farther add that nothing sets my shame more before my eyes than this your goodness  my father begged he would take a particular care how he gave way to hatred which by the way only commenced in my fathers getting the better of him in a lawsuit and was heightened by the kings conferring on him the honor of the government of sevil which don lovis had some hopes of  we took care the next day to let the country know that those fellows that were killed had attempted to rob our house but we having timely notice had prevented em by their deaths  the old gentleman was as good as his word for articles of agreement were drawn up between em and i had leave to visit the lady when i thought fit but i was obliged to go back to sevil to put my self in an equipage suitable to the occasion and don lewis followed after with his daughter  i must confess i was charmed with her person at the first interview and the day was fixed for our nuptials which rejoiced the whole city of sevil that two of the noblest houses were going to bury in oblivion their long enmity  i took the privilege of an intended husband in my visits to my designed bride and in her conversation found she had no aversion for me at least i thought so and i promised my self the utmost felicity in her enjoyment  one morning about a week before the intended wedding i came early to wait on her but was informed she was not come out of her chamber therefore i resolved to take a walk in the great piazza of the city to give her time to dress her self but as i was going out i observed the maid to my mistress conferring with a country fellow the sight of me i observed gave the woman some confusion my heart told me i was concerned in their interview therefore i went to the corner of the street and waited till their dialogue was over which did not keep me long for the fellow soon parted with the woman and went out of the gate that leads to cordova  i had my man with me whom i acquainted with my fears ordering him to dog the fellow and get out of him by fair means or foul his business at don lewiss house and i would follow after him on horseback  away ran my man and i soon got my horse and overtook em about a league and a half from sevil when my man got sight of me i observed he took a little basket from the countryman and ran away over the fields with it i fancied by that he had succeeded in his commission so turned my horse and followed him  when i had overtaken him we went behind a tuft of trees a little out of the road where he told me he had made the fellow believe he was sent by teresa the name of the maid he was conferring with to give him notice that he would be pursued by a cavalier and forced to deliver what he had received from her and perhaps be in danger of losing his life and that he had orders to consult with him for his safety  the countryman being none of the wisest soon discovered the whole affair to my man and at sight of me delivered the basket to him and ran to a public house in the next village to wait till he could get clear of me where my man was to bring him his basket again in the basket were four melons and in one of them we found a letter very artificially put up which i took out and with terror of mind read the contents which were as follows  life of my life and treasure of my soul i received yours which gave me all the consolation my disconsolate heart was capable of receiving but the fatal moment is approaching when i must give up this body to another person but without a heart which always dwells with you and be assured unless ill usage force it thence shall ever dwell in the mansion of your breast but my soul grieve not for maugre my tyrant husband i will find time to see the darling of my eyes and in the pleasure of those dear arms forget the dull embraces of a husband let ten be the latest this evening when you shall find at the usual place with longexpecting love your  isabella   i was thunderstruck at the reading of this letter yet blessed my providential stars that guided me to this black secret before the priest had joined our hands and though a spaniard my resentment did not rise to jealousy but my fancy ran upon the enjoyment of this false fairone without the marriage chain and what prompted me the more to it was a postscript to her letter wherein she bad him come in his usual disguise and in the dark in order to the accomplishment of my design i went into a neighboring house and wrote the following letter which was put in the melon in the room of the other  my love i have not time to write my self i am so guarded by my father and my tyrant husband that is to be so that i am obliged to employ teresa dont come to the usual place till you hear from me which shall certainly be tomorrow adieu thou life and soul of  isabella   now all the hopes i had were that the fellow knew what disguise this amorous spark wore and where was the place of rendezvous  i left it all to my servant who had cunning enough to outwit twenty of the countryman after i had delivered him his commission i went back to sevil full of hopes and fears and in two hours my man arrived he gave me a description of his converse with the countryman which was diverting enough and how happy they were in escaping my hands  he informed me the amorous gallant came disguised in the habit of a peasant and was admitted through the back garden of don lewiss house by the maid who always attended the hour and conveyed him to her apartment in the dark which was according to my wish and by description of the sparks person we were not unlike as to proportion or age and darkness would conceal the rest  i soon provided my self of the habit i was to wear and impatiently expected the coming hour which came at last though the intervening ones seemed the longest of my life  i did not wait long before i was admitted by the toofaithful confident we went over the garden to a small room at the entrance of the house where i soon discovered my false fairone though in the dark she was undressed and disincumberd of every let to enjoyment i found by her eager kisses and embraces there was no parlying required so i even fell to and fed very heartily my partner in pleasure seemed to like what was prepared for her and before we parted gave me to understand i had done wonders and much beyond her expectation  when we had dallyd away about four hours in our feasting the maid came to tell me it was time to part which we did after snatching another morsel  i went immediately home was soon in bed and had no want of any provocative to sleep  when i arose in the morning i began to weigh maturely the last nights adventure but could come to no resolution as to the forming my behavior to my false mistress but i resolved to be determined by hers  i went to visit her about noon and found her more than ordinary civil to me  in short i was so charmed with the sight of her that i resolved to give her another visit in my disguise the same night and all i had to do was to be first at the place  when the time came my conductress was as ready as before but going softly in she clapped to the door a little too hastily and fastened my coat in it and to give me the more uneasiness she the same moment dropped the key out of her hand and though i could see where it lay yet i could not stoop for it because my coat was secured in the door  after groping about some time she took it up and opened the door to release her prisoner but on the very instant my rival appeared and finding himself there before he came rushed in and fastened upon me  the maid at the sight of two sofias clapped to the door in a fright and ran screaming away so we had the happiness to be locked in the garden together but however to make the best of a bad market as the saying is i got my rival down and belabourd him with my fists for as good fortune would have it we had neither of us any offensive weapons  the noise of the maid and our bustling alarmed an english mastiff that was watchman to the house who without saying by your leave had the impudence to fasten upon my rival by the arm and worried him very handsomely but notwithstanding my reasons to the contrary i took pity of him and by force of arms destroyed the dog that is i held him so fast about the throat with my hands that his last breath flew away in a huff  my disguised spark seeing himself so unexpectedly relieved gave me thanks for his safety and as soon as ever he spoke for we had been sullen before neither of us having opened our lips i knew him by his tongue to be one of my particular acquaintance  why how now don juan said i how came you thus disguised nay replied the don i ought to ask you the same thing with several questions and answers we came to a right understanding if i had known said he your pretensions here i should never have made any attempts to your prejudice come come said i it is very well as it is so we turned that to mirth and ridicule which perhaps others of our nation would have turned to blood our next thing was to make our escape for the whole house was alarmed and coming upon us with their domestic weapons as pokers spits fireshovels etc my companion led me to a place of the garden where the wall was something lower than any where else and just as we had gained the ascent we perceived a man mounting from the other side but my friend did him the favor to tumble him down again he quickly got up and ran upon him most furiously with his poniard and gave him several stabs but my friend closed with him wrested his weapon from him and stabbed him to the heart  as soon as he was sped we made off but did not go far before my companion dropped down dead of his wounds i was very much grieved at the accident but made the best of my way home for fear i should come into trouble about it if i was caught near the dead bodies  i went to bed but very much perplexed in mind and had no rest all night but what was my grief in the morning when my servant brought me word my father and don juan my friend were found murdered in the habits of peasants under don lewiss gardenwall the relation deprived me of the use of speech for some time and my reason forsook me i was more than once going to put an end to my life and had certainly done it if i had not been prevented by my faithful servant but when my reason returned again i began to think of the adventure with some calmness for though i had all the grief imaginable for the loss of so good a father yet i was of a temper not to grieve long at any thing and then the fortune i thought my self master of appeared so lovely to me that it soon dried up my tears  the city imagined my father came by his death through don lewiss means as remembering the ancient enmity of the two houses and being found so near his house strengthened the opinion of every body and i was the only person satisfied to the contrary  the servants that brought in my fathers body gave me several papers found in his pockets among which were two letters that partly let me into the truth of this unhappy adventure the first was to this purpose  sir your generosity has prevailed and i can no longer withstnd your offers on the condition as you promise in your last that you will break off the match between your son and my lady you must provide your self of a peasants habit and tomorrow i will send you a note to instruct you farther  yours etc teresa   the second was as follows  be at the west end of the garden at one in the morning and ascend a ladder of rope you will find there and bring it over with you near the corner you will perceive an arbor go in there and wait till i come to conduct you to your wishes i will take care nothing shall be in your way to interrupt your privacy and be sure you be careful of your tongue for if you speak we shall be both undone  my thoughts were in the utmost confusion about the unravelling of this fatal affair and running over in my imagination my past conversations with my father i remembered in our last he told me he thought it a little of the soonest for me to marry and that it would be more for my interest to delay our nuptials and perhaps said he i may give you sufficient reasons for the contrary whatever his reasons were i little thought of the true one  i sent a letter to the maid of my false mistress but she fearing she should be found out as she really was absconded  don lewis sent to condole with me in my great loss but i could perceive it gave him some satisfaction that i was in actual possession of that estate which i had only hopes of in the life of my father his visit was but short yet i thought it too long for as i had no design of marrying the daughter i was very willing to drop my acquaintance with the father though i gave him hopes when decency would permit i would not fail in my addresses to his daughter  after the interment of my father i began to examine his affairs and was not very well pleased to find the best part of his estate mortgaged for twelve years to several persons and instead of seeing my self worth twenty thousand crowns a year soon found i was not worth the sixth part  it was agreed that my father was very profuse in his way of living always keeping open house yet it was every bodys opinion he did not expend half his income  i sometimes imagined there was some underhand dealing in the affair but it was past my finding out i therefore took an odd resolution i determined with my self to undergo a voluntary banishment till the term of years on the mortgage was expired  i made a visit to don lewis and told him of my resolves and my reasons for it which he could not choose but applaud for it was easy enough to perceive interest was the jack he aimed at he did not press me to see his daughter nor i him but after assurance of remembrancing on both sides we parted  i must own my soul longed for another taste of the delicious banquet and i hope you will excuse me when i own to you my passion could not be called love but as i found it impracticable i made my self as easy as i could  in a few weeks i had finished my affairs and waited for the sailing of the west india fleet resolving for the city of mexico where i had an uncle very rich who had often expressed in his letters to my father the great desire he had to see me  i had raised out of the ruins of my fathers fortune six thousand crowns without so much as touching any of his plate or furniture the care of those things with all my writings i trusted to a near kinsman superior of a monastery in the city  one day going about two leagues out of town my horses girt broke which obliged me to a light at a sadlers to have it made good the man asked me if i would not take a walk in his garden while he was doing his work which i accordingly did  at the end of the walk was a pretty arbor and in it sat a woman reading who at the sight of me gave a great shriek and was for running out but i stopped her and begging pardon for disturbing her told her i would retire and leave her alone but upon finding it was teresa maid to my quondam mistress i resolved to stay with her that i might know something of my fathers affair  she appeared confounded at the sight of me is imagining i had come on purpose to apprehend her but i soon undeceived her and with a little soothing language and a couple of pistoles she disposed her self to give me all the information she could  sir said she i hope you will pardon me for what i did was purely by the influence of gold  your father declared to me at first sight of my mistress his heart and reason forsook him and often informed me if he could not enjoy er he should be obliged to put an end to his misery by death i often laid before him the njury he would do to you his son but he as often declared he would break off the match between you for he was well assured you had no very violent inclination for her and there were other women in sevil of as great a fortune as my mistress that would be proud of his alliance  the many rich presents he made me overcame my honesty and that unfortunate night that brought him his death was to have completed his happiness but said she after some pause i am very much at a loss to find out one thing what is that madam said i why sir returned madona since i know how matters stand between you and my mistress i shall give you to understand that you were not the favored lover and that another gentleman revelld in those delights you perhaps thought to have the whole possession of and that was the reason i was so willing to comply with your father for i had intended to introduce him in the habit of the said gentleman unknown to my mistress and had provided a story accordingly for as soon as ever the gentleman was gone your father should have taken his place in the same disguise and i intended to impose on my mistress that her lover was returned to take another farewell of her and this cheat was easy to be carried on being they were obliged to silence old don louis lodging in the next room but what amazes me as i was saying opening the door to let my mistresss lover in another in the same disguise rushed in upon me which i am sure was not your father i soon cleared up this affair with her and let her know how i had supplanted my rival  she seemed very much surpised at the unravelling of this secret but was very glad she had nothing to apprehend from my resentments being that was the chief cause of leaving her mistress as imagining i should find the letters she had sent him and upon this she resolved to go to her mistress again for she heard every day from the family and knew how matters stood and that her mistress wanted her that they might condole together for the loss of don juan her old spark but she declared she was not very sorry for his loss for money came very hard from him and you know sir said she it is our business to make hay while the sun shines  madam said i since i know what you love best if you will pursue my intrigue twenty pistoles are at your service indeed sir returned madam it must be something very extraordinary that i shall refuse for such a sum why then i will let you into my plot said i you shall inform your mistress don juan is not dead as was reported but after a tedious and dangerous illness was recovered to a miracle but concealed his revival being under some apprehension of answering for the life of my father  sir said she i like your plot so well that i will answer for the success on it and i will go about it instantly for i long to be fingering the gold why then said i you shall finger it beforehand and when the business is done i will double the sum she was mightily pleased with the amendment to the bargain and the third night after was concluded on for the time when i was to attend as before  i took leave of teresa and pursued my journey made merry with my friends and returned  at length the happy moment came that i so long expected my mercenary confident was ready i entered and once more took possession of all my treasure and as i thought it would be the last time was profuse enough my lady seemed very well pleased with my nights work and in plain terms told me so  i had prepared a letter in which i had disclosed every thing when our loving affair was over she asked me softly how i was engaged in that adventure i told her as softly as i could that i knew she would be inquisitive and talking being dangerous i had brought the account in writing which i put into her hand and with some regret took my leave for the next day was intended for our imbarkation as i walked over the garden i asked teresa how long the amor had been between don juan and her lady she told me about two years and this was the commencement  don juan whose country house lay about two leagues from my masters was set upon by thieves and dangerously wounded and there had lost his life if don lewis had not very fortunately for him come that way attended and drove off the thieves don juan was so very much hurt that it was not thought safe to carry him home therefore my master ordered him to his house where his wounds kept him a great while when he had recovered strength enough to walk he usually employed his time in the garden where my lady often seeing him fell desperately in love with him she made me the confident of her infant passion and i being a very proper person to be trusted with such secrets advised her to let the don see her which we contrived thus  she was to go into an arbor at the farther end of the garden where i had observed don juan sat every day and pretend to be asleep she took all the care that was necessary in her dress and did as i directed her it succeeded to her wish for the don at sight of her imagining her an earthly goddess kneeled and kissed her hand she seemed to wake in a pretended fright but it was not long before they came to a right understanding  that place was made the rendezvous of the lovers when opportunity would permit but he recovering though he pretended a weakness for some time was obliged to take leave of our house though in the fathers absence they often found opportunity to satisfy their loves and when they resided in town he continued his visits in the disguise of the countryman he used to send to my lady with presents of fruit and by that means they received letters from each other  when she had finished her short relation i gave her the tewnty pistoles i promised her and took my leave she seemed to be in some confusion about managing it with her mistress for she would certainly find her out she said when she would be confirmed of don juans death but she comforted her self with telling me her mistress durst not disclose it to any body for fear of betraying herself but poor teresa little thought her mistress would find it out so soon as the next morning when she had read my letter that i put into her hand when i left her the next day i ordered my equipage on board our ship which lay at cadiz and followed my self but the wind chopping about hindered our setting sail i then repented the leaving my letter with my mistress for by the help of my money with teresa i might have made another meal with her  i old not think it prudence to go on shore fearing her resentments might form some designs on my life i therefore contented my self on board till the wind should prove fair for sailing as i was reading in my cabin one day alone my servant brought me a letter the contents were these  noble sir understanding you are bound for mexico the place of my birth i shall think it the greatest honor in the world if you please to take me into your protection my father was a rich merchant of that city who going to another world has left me a considerable estate in this those persons who had the care of my education here seem to have designs against my fortune therefore i have made my escape from em but must return to my betrayers if you have not the goodness to be my guardian to mexico where i shall return the obligation you shall please to lay me under in being my protector   i asked my man who brought the letter and he told me a young negro i bid him bring him in i asked him several questions and found him ready with his answers he informed me that his father though a negro was a man of substance and had sent him in his infancy to be educated at sevil and for the rest the letter informed me  i was mightily pleased with the person of the black gentleman and treated him civilly with the assurance of delivering him safe to his friends at mexico  when we were alone he told me he had a farther secret to discover to me if he was sure of not being interrupted upon hearing this i ordered my servant on shore for some necessaries and informed him we need not fear any interruption for some hours  after a long pause and casting his eyes on the ground he began  this veil of night would not hide my blushes if i were not convinced in your knowledge of my frailty but if you will consider my youth climate and opportunity you will allow few of my sex could withstand the temptation be not surpised to find in this disguise the daughter of don lewis who is so far subject to the caprice of love as to disclose to you the inmost secret of her heart  the letter you left with me produced a contrary effect than i believe you imagined and instead of rage and indignation taking possession of my breast a softer passion stole in and i felt all the tenderness imaginable for don pedro  i expect nothing but ill usage from you for my past conduct but if you can believe there is any sincerity in woman after what i have been guilty of i am assured you may depend on what i say that no other object shall share my heart with you i do not mean the tie of wedlock but if you will accept of me as i am i will be as subservient to your commands as your meanest slave  i was so confounded between pleasure and amazement that i imagined all i heard and saw was a dream but being sweetly convinced of the reality i said all my passion could suggest in return not giving my self time to consider of the oddness of the accident twas sufficient i had in possession all that was lovely in woman in my imagination and i had no other thought but how to keep her from the knowledge of her father on shore and the sailors on board for we did not know when we should set sail  my mistress told me if she had not succeeded with me she resolved for a nunnery but since we were reconciled she had laid by all thoughts of the habit she made her escape from her fathers without the assistance or knowledge of any one but teresa but what favored her escape was the absence of her father for ten days in the country yet she feared when he came home again he would fright teresa into consession or by promises get it out of her for that she was mercenary enough to sell any thing she had to the best bidder to prevent which we agreed to dress her in the habit of a man and let her wear her own complexion  accordingly we both went on shore at cadiz and soon equipt our selves with what we wanted and on board i brought my spark as a relation of mine that had a mind to run his fortune with me the next day the wind proving favorable we set sail and left our apprehensions behind us  i was obliged to let our servant into the secret that i might have it kept so well knowing if he had discovered it himself it had not been a secret long though the fellow was very faithful to any secret that was trusted to him  we touched at the madera islands passed the pike of teneriff got over the line duckd our men as usual and met with no extraordinary accident but in fifty three days arrived safe at the city of sancta domingo or st dominick the capital city of the island hispaniola  i was very well pleased to find so delightful a place as this was after the fatigue of our voyage my mistress and i took us a lodging at a goodnaturd spaniards that treated us very well  for our money  here my lady told me she felt the effects of our familiarity i endeavored to persuade her i had no hand in it but she insisted upon it that the deed was done by me and gave me some proofs to believe it  i was very much concerned to find means to hide it from the house for she began to have those qualms which attend that natural distemper and by the beauty of her face i feared her sex might soon be distinguished  i kept her from the sight of our ships crew in the voyage she always staying in the cabin and it was very dangerous to discover a fine woman in this part of the world because there are few that are handsome  i was upon thorns till our departure for mexico but the fleet staying longer than i expected i took a ramble to the most noted places in the island and since i understand by your story you never were there i will give you a short description of it  hispaniola is seated from seventeen degrees to nineteen degrees latitude in length about one hundred and twenty leagues and breadth about the middle part fifty the air much the same for heat as at sevil in spain the fruits delicious and some peculiar to the place  the capital city is st domingo which gives a delightful prospect from the fields about it being mixed with pleasant gardens and rivers  here the governor of the island resides and here are kept all their offices and courts of judicature and it is likewise the storehouse to the whole island  there are two cities more st jago and nuestra sennora de alta gracia the last of which is to the south and is famous for the best chocolate in the world  the cathedral of st domingo is a handsome pile of building and the other churches are answerable to the grandeur of the inhabitants whose very artizans are wealthy  the friars live as luxurious here as in any other part of the world and follow the steps of their brethren in choosing the noblest situations  this island was discovered by columbus in the year      and kept in the hands of the spaniards ever since that time while most of their other acquisitions are fell to the english french and dutch  though the french have some plantations in the island at present yet they were of their own acquiring and not taken from the spaniards and being chiefly hunters and not very rich the spaniards make no attempt upon em  no island can boast of more convenient ports than this and every port disembogues fine rivers stored with palatable fish into the sea but then to qualify that blessing they are very much infested with aligators and crocodiles i saw one lying on the shoreside like a log of wood and as a buffalo came there to drink he sprung upon him dragged him to the bottom and there devoured him though they are easily to be avoided from the aromatic smell that comes from their skin  i was much surpised to find in most houses serpents instead of cats that were greater enemies to rats and mice but what was more pleasing they were not the least offensive having no venom in em but then they will often play the fox with the poultry and destroy many of them unless narrowly watched  the scolopendria of the greeks is found here and very large scorpions but by the divine providence neither of em hurtful  i shall not trouble you with any farther account of this island because there is not any thing to be found there but what is upon the continent unless some particular herbs and as i am no botanist i shall not take any notice of em  the time came at last for our embarking for vera cruz in order to go to mexico and i left st domingo with some regret as imagining i should not meet with any other place in america so pleasant  during our voyage my mistress was mightily disordered  we embarked for vera cruz where we arrived without any accident and having no business there we set out by land for mexico and got safe there but enquiring for my uncle i was informed he was gone to reside at lima the capital city of peru my concern was the more in that i feared i should not meet with proper accommodation at mexico for want of him in the affair of my mistress for her condition would not bear the fatigue of another removal  i was entertained in the house of a near friend of my uncles and one who kept a correspondence with him he was very civil to me and of a freer disposition than generally the spaniards are but he had the same vanity as all the old christians have who pride themselves very much upon it i let him into the secret of my lady and her condition and by the help of his wife we made her reassume her proper dress but we kept her private  the time of her delivery came and the product proved a lusty boy who staid among us three weeks and then left us i had no scruples about being the father for it was plain enough to be seen it being my picture in a little my mistress continued very weak longer than the usual time and i being alone with her one day she told me she was under some apprehensions concerning our landlord don manuel who had made her secretly many large offers and the nurse was his emissary i told her i had the same proposals from his wife and though the woman was not disagreeable nay might pass for a beauty where women were so scarce yet i could not find any tenderness for her in my heart  after many arguments between us a thought came into my head which i hoped would produce some mirth among us i desired my mistress to give don manuel some small encouragement and leave the rest to me  my landlord soon found an opportunity through my means to see my mistress she followed my advice and transported the don out of his senses his joy was not to be contained he forgot the gravity of a spaniard and caperd about like a french dancing master when i learnt all their discourse from my mistress i begged her to continue her good humor to him and promise him a meeting that day sevennight in the summer house of the garden she did as i directed  in the mean time i took my opportunity to confabulate with the wife and gave her directions the night appointed to go to the same summer house but to avoid speech being it was over the water and men were continually passing to and fro the good woman was as much overjoyed as her husband and the better to carry on my design i gave it out that i was to go with some gentlemen a hunting the buffalo for two or three days i desired my landlord a title i had given him out of mirth to take care of my wife in my absence i told my good landlady this was a contrivance of mine that we might not be suspected  my mistress had made just the same agreement with the don the time came and the good man and good woman were left to worry one another with their extraordinary passion  the next day at dinner for we generally eat together don manuel cast many a sheeps eye at my wife and his good lady at me  the same day as i was reading in the garden madona came to me and in bitter terms of reproach gave me much ill language and told me i had betrayed her to her husband basely by giving him the ring she gave me the last night i soon found that she had made a present to her husband of a ring taking him for me and she had observed it upon his finger she made so many speeches about it that at last i was compelled to tell her the whole truth to get rid of her tiresome passion but i soon repented of my declaration for she flew upon me and with her nails played the cat with my face and i had much ado to disengage my self from her so furious does a disappointed passion make a woman  her confounded temper made me resolve to leave mexico the husband began to suspect something of the affair but his imagination that he had the company of my wise in the summer house curbed his resentment  the womans rage was unsurmountable and it was not in my power to bring her to temper therefore i chose to avoid her as much as possible as i was at supper with my mistress some few days after the accident happened she told me she had received a present of cordialwater from don manuels wife now i had not told her of madonas resentment because i imagined it might make her uneasy but as soon as i heard of the present something struck my mind there was something uncommon in it i therefore desired my mistress not to drink any of it lord said she my dear i have already and desire you would taste it too for it is the pleasantest liquor i ever drank in my life  i was mightily disturbed at it and two hours discovered the fatal effects  my mistress began to be very much out of order and notwithstanding all the aid of physicians she expired in my arms and every body agreed she had been poisoned i had in my fury and ravings declared to don manuel the author of this black deed and when he went to enquire after her was informed she went out before night and was supposed to have gone to the town of st jago on the lake to one of her relations don manuel sent after her but she was not to be found he grieved at the loss of my mistress as much as i did and i dare avow if he had found his wife he would have sacrificed her to the manes of my dear mistress  i was very much grieved for the loss of my mistress for i had reason to be convinced her passion for me was unfeigned you may easily imagine there was no staying for me in the house where this dismal accident happened but as i was preparing to be gone the corrigidore sent for me to appear before him to give him the best account i could of this action i related to him the whole truth as i have told it you only i declared it was my wife i had lost don manuel was seized and put in prison notwithstanding i insisted upon his innocence but he proceeded in that manner being it was supposed he was accessory to his wifes escape but a few days after he was secured news was brought that his wife was found murdered in the woods as it was supposed by some indians as she was endeavoring to make her escape from the hands of justice  thus she met her reward for her barbarous murder of a woman that never wronged her though indeed the favor was designed for me  a few days after this fatal accident i heard of some merchants that designed to cross the continent to the south sea with a good guard i made acquaintance with em paid my quota to the charge and set out along with em leaving behind me the hateful city of mexico where i had lost the only thing i esteemed on earth and i must own to you notwithstanding my philosophy i never thought of her for some time without the utmost heartbreaking i have endeavored indeed by forcing my temper to mirth to bury the remembrance and time with good company has brought me some assistance yet nevertheless i do firmly believe no womans charms will ever for the future break my rest for i am satisfied my late mistress made a hole quite through my heart  but to pursue my discourse  we set out with a guard of fifty spanish soldiers for fear of the indians who had made it their daily practice to set upon every body that went through the country if not too strong for em i need not tell you that mexico is one of the finest cities in the world or that it lies upon a lake and no other passage to it but over three broad causways from different cities on the land but what is something extraordinary one part of the lake is brackish and noisome with no living creature in it and the other is fresh wholesome and stored with palatable fish but as there are many exact accounts of the continent of america and its conquest by my noble countryman hernando cortes i shall say no more of it but i will take the liberty to add that caesar and alexander were but pigmy conquerors to him and every body will be of that opinion if they will give themselves the trouble of reading his history  we met with no indians to oppose our passage and arrived at segovia an inland town environed with rocks and but meanly built some of our company staid there and i was willing to stay along with em to refresh my self for it is but indifferent traveling over rocky mountains and crossing rivers upon hurdles that is pieces of timber lashed together with ropes and it is sometimes dangerous though we got over safe with our whole company  i staid fifteen days at segovia with fifteen of my companions i was very much surpised at the relation of some of the inhabitants of that place who told me about two hundred of your countrymen the year before freebooters in spite of all opposition came from the south sea to the north with a very great booty defeated the spaniards when ten to one and posted to all the advantage in the world several times the people of segovia talk of em as so many devils and that they were aided by the black gentleman or it had been an impossibility to have gone through what they did but it must be confessed your countrymen despise hazards and laugh at the greatest dangers  after we had sufficiently refreshed our selves we took our leaves of segovia and pursued our journey to the south sea with a guard of indians subservient to the spaniards and i must own to you there is not a people in the world more true to their trust than those confederate indians that own the dominion of spain  our journey to st fee was pleasant enough through a rich level pleasant country and we rode upon mules a beast of a sure foot and our chief diversion was shooting of monkies that played us several comical tricks running up the trees and frequently did us the favor to urine in our faces and sometimes something worse  when we arrived at st fee a small town and port in the south sea we had the good fortune of meeting with a vessel ready to set sail for lima we went immediately on board and got clear of the shore that evening  we arrived at lima after a voyage of twenty five days we landed at calao the port that all the ships of spain anchor at and one of the finest in the south sea  the town is built upon a point of land that runs into the sea it is very strongly fortified and well garrisoned i sent my servant to my uncle at lima to acquaint him that i was coming to wait on him the next day but my servant returned in four hours with my uncles coach who informed me that he was impatient till he saw me my uncle was judge of the civil courts and a man in very great power he sent his major domo to wait on me with his excuse that he had come himself but that he was afflicted with the gout i only staid till i had put on other clothes and immediately after went in the coach with the major domo and arrived at my uncles just within night he was very well pleased to see me and caressed me in an extraordinary manner but i was something surpised to find that he had resolved for spain within a month there to end his days  i told him the story of my fathers unhappy fate only concealing his love to donna elvira he was very much shocked at the news owning to me his chief reason of going to spain was to have the happiness of living together i then told him i supposed as that could not be that he would alter his resolution and think no more of his voyage but he answered most of his effects were gone for spain two months before and that he must of necessity follow  i gave him to understand that it was not in my power to wait upon him he took a great deal of pains to persuade me to it but when he found it was to no purpose he told me since i was not to be prevailed upon he would leave me master of a small fortune in lima  during his stay he introduced me to most of the best families in the city and the viceroy was pleased to show me good countenance and promised my uncle to provide for me  when the time came of his embarking for spain i waited on him on board where we took leave though not with dry eyes and i have repented many times that i did not accompany him but we must submit to fate and what is allotted us by fortune will come  he left me master of a wellfurnishd house and a plantation whose income would provide every thing necessity required in the middle station of life with a promise that at his death i should inherit the remainder of his estate for he was a single man and had no nearer relation than my self  i took all the pleasure the place would afford and to say truth there was no want of any thing at lima except the conversation of the female sex though i must freely confess i did not always want that  the viceroy proved very kind to me but death taking him away suddenly i mightily grieved his loss as indeed i had reason for the person that succeeded him proved the reverse he made a general remove of all the officers the deceased had put in posts and among the rest i was one of the sufferers and farther upon all occasions he made it his business to slight me and often affronted me so grossly that nothing but his dignity shrouded him from my resentment and many other people in power as the injudicious generally copy the frailties of their superiors and neglect their virtues treated me in the same manner but i was resolved not to bear it  one day as i was coming from my plantation upon my mule attended only with my old servant i met a nephew of the viceroys in his chaise in a narrow road and not being willing to give way to him we were both at a stand which so enraged the choleric gentleman that he flew out of his vehicle and ran his spado into the belly of my mule which dropped down dead  i did not want so much provocation to raise my choler therefore i drew upon him and left him in the same condition with my beast groveling upon the sand he had several people that attended him who rushed upon me and my man overpowered us and dragged us immediately to the viceroys palace who being glad of any pretense to wreak his ill nature upon me condemned me to baldivia for life in spite of the intercession of those few friends i had  it was in vain to complain of this damned trick of fortune and the more to plague me he left orders that i should be disposed of to don sancho ramires a relation of his the wretch that i have sufficiently revenged my self of and in part of the inhumane viceroy for they were partners in trade  ramires used to put me upon the most slavish business but as i had money i usually bought it off for i received yearly my small estate from lima i mean from my plantation for the viceroy had seized all the rest of my movables and would have done this but that the honest indian who had the occupying of it insisted on its being my uncles  this old hunks had a beautiful daughter that i found was in love with a colonel of the garrison of baldivia this colonel notwithstanding my condition was not ashamed of my acquaintance and often told me the torments he endured for the young lady  i asked him if the lady knew of his passion he informed me that he flattered himself with the return though they had never spoke to each other but he had received obliging glances from her fair eyes from the gallery which overlooked the court of guard  i agreed that if he would write a letter i would pawn my life she should have it and an answer into the bargain if she had any inclination to send one he embraced me and thanked me for my kind proffer and wrote a passionate letter to the lady which i accompanied with another to let her know i was devoted to her service upon the colonels account  in two days i had an answer conveyed into a hollow tree in the garden as i had concerted in my note to her that waited upon the colonels  these paper messengers brought matters to bear and the kind lady resolved to venture her self with the colonel  we contrived a ladder of ropes long enough to reach from her window to the terras on the court of guard and i conveyed a small bundle of packthread for her to throw down which we fastened to the ladder of ropes and the lady with much difficulty pulled it up and fastened to an iron chest which was in the room but as she came trembling for fear down the ladder it drew the chest along the floor above which awakened that old devil her father he immediately alarmed all the servants as well as slaves but the captain had got safe off with his mistress  when old huncks had summoned us all together he went into the room to see what the matter was but when he found his money safe his distraction began to abate i must own i wished heartily we could have cleared his money too as well as his daughter it was some time ere he missed her as having no notion of her elopement but when he found she was gone his passion was unsurmountable for the good lady had made bold with writings of an estate that it seems were left her by an old aunt and i was very well pleased she did not go emptyhanded to my colonel for i take money to be the sinews of love as well as war  the enraged don ran up and down like a madman with about a dozen of us at his heels and as we approached the ditch of the castle which happened to be free from water being the tide was out but pretty well provided with mud some of his servants imagined they saw something lie on the mud the old don being very peery was stooping down and gazing to be satisfied and the devil prompting me just at the same time i clapped my knee into his bum and down fell the poor don into the mud  i was the first that cried out for help yet i did not make extraordinary haste to assist him but at last ropes were brought and after he had flounderd about a quarter of an hour we luggd him up in a sweet pickle  by good luck he did not mistrust that the favor was designed him but purely accidental i had an opportunity the next day to find out the lady and the happy colonel who had brought a commission from the priest to go to bed together he was so well pleased with my service that he promised to ransom me from don sancho and did not doubt but he should succeed being the don made money his summum bonum but we were surpised at the refusal for he had such a strict charge from the viceroy of peru to hold me fast that it was more his interest to keep me than part with me nay this proposal opened the old dons eyes for he saw plainly i was at bottom of his daughters affair this so enraged him that he ordered a great wooden clog to be locked fast to my leg which i was obliged to lug along with me  this proceeding drove me almost to despair and i lost all hopes of ever procuring my liberty  the colonel and his lady who had recovered the fortune from don sancho were very much grieved at my ill usage and tried all manner of means for my liberty but to no purpose i past three years in this uncomfortable life and had the pleasure to hear that my implacable enemy the viceroy of peru was summoned to spain upon the account of some maladministration at the hearing of this news my hope of freedom began to revive but it was soon clouded again for the old devil don sancho was resolved to keep me a martyr to his own revenge and i weathered out two years more in my wretched confinement though thanks to heaven nothing depressed my spirits quite  the colonel got an opportunity to tell me that there was a vessel in the road bound for lima and the captain being a very good friend of his he had prevailed with him to take me on board him if it was possible for me to get out of hunkss clutches  i made all the efforts imaginable but to no purpose and i was once more in my imagination given up to eternal slavery  the same night as i was endeavoring to compose my troubled thoughts i heard a great noise in the castleyard and was very much surpised a while after when i saw an officer and a file of soldiers come to seize me as a plotter against the state and carried me to the colonels lodging but my surprise was turned into joy when i found he had used this stratagem to gain me my freedom i told him he had trebly repaid the obligation he was pleased to say he lay under to me and i was resolved not to accept of my liberty till i found what stir don sancho made about it but the colonel resolved me that he had the means in his own hands to pacify him  i went on board and set sail the same evening we had but an indifferent voyage being involved in many storms yet at last we arrived safe at calao  i shall if you think fit give you a short description of baldivia because few foreigners are permitted to enter their port  baldivia or valdivia takes its name from the first founder a spaniard the old town stood a little higher than the new one till it was destroyed by the indians for peter baldivia and the rest of the spaniards were such tyrants over the poor natives that they took heart laid an ambush for em and destroyed em every one but in the new town they are sufficiently guarded from their insults or danger of a foreign enemy which have often attempted em to no purpose this being reckoned the richest country for gold mines in all america nature has befriended em very much in the strength of the place for there is so large a sandbank in the mouth of the bay that vessels are obliged to come within five hundred yards of the shore which is guarded by a strong castle to avoid it it is a difficult harbor to enter but when you are once at anchor no wind on the whole compass can hurt you though it blew a storm it is so well sheltered by the land on all sides of it  the inhabitants are chiefly made up of banished persons who generally work in the mines for so many years and the time expired they have so much land of their own to cultivate and most of them find the means to be rich but how honestly i will give you leave to judge the country about it is very fruitful and produces great quantities of apple trees from which they make very good cider but the juice of the grape is very uncomatible there and those that do procure it must pay extravagantly for it  this city for it is no less is esteemed the key to the south sea  the governor and officers are generally sent from lima but the soldiers are composed of those persons that are sent there for a punishment and though few persons choose to be sent there yet as few desire to leave it when once they are settled  notwithstanding the people could make shift to live without religion yet there are seven churches and three monasteries but they seem to be in a ruinated condition and i dont doubt but an age or two hence those that pass that way may find them totally ruined  as i said we arrived safe at the port of calao i was resolved to remain incognito till i had inquired into the affairs of the city  i took an occasion to send to my indian tenant who came to me and was very well pleased to find me at liberty  i sent him to several of my friends to acquaint them what circumstance i lay under who soon informed the viceroy of my misfortune and he as readily complied with my desire allowing me the liberty i had enjoyed before i was sent to baldivia  i once more made my appearance at lima renewed my acquaintance and began to divert my self as before by degrees i crept into the good graces of the viceroy who gave me a post in the government that brought me a considerable income and with the esteem of most people i past on a whole year  the viceroy not liking his situation found the means to be recalled to spain yet recommending me to his successor i remained in the same station he before had given me though i cannot brag of any more favors bestowed on me by my new superior for he was a man of an uncertain temper proud and revengeful he was newly married to a very rich widow of lima who had a very beautiful daughter by report for she was not suffered to take the liberties of the place  i often had a great desire to see her face for i had observed her veiled many times at church which was all the liberty she had i was in formed she was designed a wife for the supreme judge though much against her inclination being there was a disparity of years which is certainly the greatest bitter to the sweets of matrimony but nothing is consulted now more than wealth  i received a letter from my uncle at sevil wherein he desired i would leave lima and come to spain and to induce me to it he gave me the promise to make me his heir i must own i began to be pretty well tired of this climate and the time drawing on for the expiration of my mortgage i set my self to prepare things accordingly  i disposed of my plantation to my faithful indian for an under price being i thought i was under many obligations to him i resigned up my office in the viceroys palace indeed because i could not get leave to dispose of it  i turned all my effects into golddust and sent it before me to my uncle and now i only waited for company to go over land to vera cruz a port in the north sea where i should have convenience of imbarking for spain  i began now to think of settling in the world and indeed it was almost time for i had past my twentyeighth year and at that age the heat of youth should be pretty well over for if a man cannot see his follies on this side thirty he is in danger of being incorrigible all the days of his life beside i had very good encouragement to stability my own fortune and the prospect of my uncles who in all probability had not many years to live being in his eightythird year  well then as my story is almost off the stage i will throw you into the bargain a short account of one place more for my catastrophe and then to my epilogue for detaining you so long and that shall be the description of lima as it is at present  lima the capital city of peru is seated about two leagues from the seaport of callao in    degrees   minutes of southern latitude and    degrees    minutes of western longitude it is built in a noble plain with hills at a distance  francis pizarro was the founder in the year      though it has changed its name since his time from la ciudad de los reges or city of kings to lima which is only a corruption of the indian word rimac which was the name of an indian idol formerly worshipped in that place  this is the finest city next to mexico in all america all the streets are in a direct line exactly measured out and much of the same length and breadth being fifty yards wide  in the heart of the city is the noblest square my eyes ever beheld and in the midst a fountain of brass adorned with eight lions continually spouting water supplied by the river of lima that runs through the skirts of the town covered with a handsome stone bridge that leads to the suburbs within the suburbs is a fine public walk beautified with orange trees and in the evening is crowded with the best company of the city although this city is so beautiful it was mostly destroyed by an earthquake in the year      there are no less than fiftyseven churches and chapels with those that are in the monasteries in this city and twentyfour monasteries for men and twelve for women the cathedral is very magnificent as are most of the other churches though chiefly built with wood from the first story by reason of the earthquakes  the viceroy of peru has his residence here and is so powerful he hardly owns the king his master to be his superior here are likewise kept all the courts of justice and from the high court there is no appeal among the rest they have settled an inquisition which on my conscience is worse than that of spain heaven keep every body from it for in this court the informant is a witness and the accuser is ever behind the curtain and to mend the matter the witnesses are never brought face to face  to complete the grandeur of the place there is an archbishopric and an university of three wellfilld colleges though the students dont always follow learning for i have found some ignorant enough  there are twelve hospitals and one of them for indians  this city is garrisoned with two thousand horse and six thousand foot but very indifferent troops for service against a foreign foe being chiefly composed of creolians and indians these creolians who are so named from owing their birth to america are most of em proud lazy and ignorant and generally tyrants whenever they have power though sharp enough as to trade and will overreach you if they can  they are all inclined to venery and will sacrifice every thing to gratify that vice the women who are really very handsome generally sit at home all day crosslegd and as mute as fishes but at night it is customary for em to haunt the streets veiled and will as hardly be refused a favor as the men with us on the like occasion  as i was sitting one evening in my lodging dispatching some letters for spain i heard some body knock softly at my door my servant was gone abroad and therefore i arose and opened it my self but was surpised to see a lady veiled who without making any words came in and sat down on a couch after she had reposed her self some time she unveiled and discovered to me one of the sweetest faces i had ever seen i was almost turned into stone at the sight of so much beauty and was ready to fall down to worship her as a divinity said she i come not here to be gazed at i like you and if you can do the same by me i believe you will not use me ill  madam i returned i know no other way to convince you that i like you but one with that i took her into an alcove where we soon came to a right understanding as soon as our small matter of business was over she desired to be dismissed yet with a promise to give me another visit the next evening but said she if you should chance by any accident to see me in any other place take your eyes from the object for fear of danger for those messengers of the soul often betray their trust i promised to observe her directions and left her but yet could not help my curiosity for when she was got down stairs i put on my cloak followed her and observed she want into the viceroys palace i was convinced by the dress she wore that she was none of the common sort and much diverted i was at the accident  the next day she did me the favor of another visit when we passed our time as pleasantly as we could and my incognita seemed very much pleased with my company  after our toying was over she told me she was afraid of losing me for she had heard i designed for spain i informed her nothing had power to stop me but the passion i had for her  she at last discovered herself to me she was daughterinlaw to the viceroy she told me that she had respected me a great while and had many disputes with her honor and love but the former was forced to give way to the latter she likewise let me know of her approaching marriage and added that the knowledge of my person would make her aversion to her husband the stronger we had many meetings to the content of us both and she made me several presents of jewels which i intend to keep for her sake having preserved them through all my fortunes our meetings now began to be less frequent being the wedding day was fixed which gave me a great deal of uneasiness to divert my melancholy i usually took a walk in the orangegrove where in my musing fits i often stayed longer than usual  as i was going home one evening i heard the clashing of swords at a distance and immediately after saw a person running toward me who cried for the virgin marys sake if you are a gentleman lend me your sword to defend my self against a villain who has offered me the vilest indignity i made him no answer but gave him my sword for he looked like a man of quality and followed him  just as i turned the corner i saw him engaged and his antagonist drop down dead  the gentleman seeing that took to his heels  the street being alarmed with the bustle as i came near the body i was seized as the murderer what strengthened their opinion and i must confess had but an indifferent look was my sword remaining in the body of the deceased all my asseverations of innocence signified nothing i was carried before the corrigidore but having no witnesses of my assaulting him and one fellow by good fortune proving i was not the person that engaged him first i was only once more condemned to baldivia i cursed my hard stars a thousand times and the grief of parting from my mistress was like to rid me of life but time began to wear it off  i was secured in the castle of the city till the vessel was ready to sail  while i was confined in order to be transported to baldivia a gentleman came into the prison and begged half an hours conversation with me i had been so liberal to the keeper with my money and pretty jovial in my humor that i believe if i had asked him to let me go he would not have deneyd me so that i begged the favor to admit the gentleman and his absence during our confabulation he obeyed me in both and the gentleman entered my room which though but mean was the best in the prison  as soon as the gentleman had reposed himself upon a chair none of the best he asked me if i would please to refresh my self with any thing the place afforded but i answering in the negative he made half a dozen humms and haws and opened his mouth to utter sense  sir said he you see before you the unhappy person that is the occasion of your confinement i should not be thus free with you if i were not assured of your generous goodnature once more i must tell you you see before you the unhappy man who is guilty of that fact you are to suffer for i am a gentleman by birth and though i had not the good fortune to owe my first being to old spain yet i have this for my consolation that my parents were born at cordova there but the frowns of fortune driving them to this part of the world grew ashamed of her ill looks and greeted em with smiles of favor in a few years plutus the god of wealth made em a visit and took his leave of em with a promise of his frequent return and he proved as good as his word for in a little time fortune became a neuter gender that is believing they did not want her assistance they were no more her devotees  sir said i the sooner you will please to come to plain spanish the sooner i shall be in the ready road to your business  why then said he not to keep you in suspense i am the person that was obliged to you for your sword on such a time which proved the instrument of my revenge on a base wretch that deserved an eternity of torments after this life for wronging the best of women and since i find you love the shortest way without the tedious outward flourishes of rhetoric i will inform you of my story with as much brevity as i am capable of  my mother died about seven years since and i may very justly say the rest of my fathers life was a delirium but death taking pity of his griefs came to his aid and about two years ago i was left master of a plentiful fortune  as death is the end of all things and age must pay its tribute to him i shook off my grief for my fathers loss and in six months after his decease fell in love with a young lady of an incomparable beauty at least in my eye my fortune gave me easy access to the father of my fair and when i had the happiness of conversing with the object of my wishes she did not seem averse to my passion every thing concurring to my desires hymen joined those hands whose hearts were united before  for several days we revelld in the sweets of love and i may justly say possession had not the power to pall desire each moment of enjoyment seemed new and my utmost wish was centered in her breast but the dire fiend tormenting jealousy at last crept in and palled my appetite to ardent love the fatal bitter to our mutual sweets  i had a person that i called my friend who shared the affluence of fortune with me we had the same desire to love and hate i therefore thought i was but poorly blessed till my friend saw the idol of my soul but oh what pangs that fatal moment cost me his eyes received the bane to all his peace and in one moment rendered up his heart i gave him leave for what could i refuse to such a friend to visit my wife when business demanded my absence he often declared his passion to her by plaintive sighs and languishing looks when my wife perceived he importuned her too far with his love she threatened to tell me of it but in the mean time he had acquainted me with what had passed between him and my wife said he my friend i imagined your wife was like other women prone to change therefore in your absence i counterfeited a passion for her to see whether she had that regard she ought to have for you and i am pleased to find you have made so worthy a choice  i must own to you i was mightily pleased with this trial of my friend as believing it sprang from his kindness to me and i had much to do to reconcile my wife to his visits she would often say i wish your friend be sincere in his professions to you for my part i greatly doubt it  in a little time after this accident i perceived my friend began to look very melancholy i endeavored to sift the secret from him but to no manner of purpose for some time  one day as we were riding out to take the air together he seemed more deeply plunged in sorrow than usual i told him i should not take him for my friend any longer if he did not let me into the cause of his disorder at last with much reluctance he told me that the good opinion he had before conceived of my wife was false for he was well assured she was not true to my bed  you must imagine what a thunderclap this must be to me from a friend who i was assured in my self would not relate a falsehood it was some moments before i could open my mouth and all the time of my silence he seemed so much grieved that he had declared the secret to me that i had no doubt of the truth of it  when my grief had given me liberty of speech i begged he would give me the foundation of his suspicion but he desired to be excused till he had certain proof of her infidelity which he did not doubt but he should soon have though it was what he wished to be deceived in and farther added he would not have me take any notice of it but carry it fair to her as if nothing had happened for if you should said he you will never come to the truth of the matter  i promised to comply with him and went home but heaven knows with what a heart  i followed my friends advice punctually but yet could not help showing the discontent of my mind in my countenance my wife was mightily concerned for my melancholy and was very pressing to know the cause and in a very tender manner seemed to be disquieted which i took all for art and the cunning of her sex  i must own to you that sometimes i imagined my friend had deceived me but whenever we had an opportunity of conversing he strengthened my jealousy to such a degree that i began to wish the cause of it no longer in this world and if it had not been for my revenging my self on the supposed partner of her guilt i had certainly taken methods to dispatch her hence  i had some affairs to transact at segovia every year and the time drawing on for my journey my friend told me before my return i should have demonstration of her infidelity for said he your absence will give her the opportunity she wants and she will be sure to take hold of it  it was a great while before i could be prevailed upon by my friend to undertake really this journey but only to feign as if i had that i might be convinced of her perfidy and punish it my self but my friend laid me down so many reasons for it that i at last very unwillingly agreed to go but in the mean time said he you must order that i may have admittance in your absence that i may take my opportunity to observe all passages why said i i never knew you debarred the liberty of my house but you know said he since my false declaration of love to try your wifes virtue she has looked upon me more like an enemy than friend as knowing i was not sincere in my passion for women be they ever so vicious yet they abhor the man that doubts their virtue well then said i if you will well sup together tonight and then i will take an opportunity to leave directions with my faithless wife to allow you the same privileges in my absence as you now have why then returned my friend dont you be surpised at what i shall say to her  we parted and went to prepare every thing for my intended journey when i was at dinner with my wife i gave her some hints concerning my friend and that i desired he should have admittance in my absence i observed she changed color at my discourse and seemed to be in the utmost confusion although i did not seem to see it  after some talk about indifferent matters she told me if i thought fit she intended to live private in my absence and admit of no visitors for sir said she the world will be censorious and receiving visits from a man when you are from home is not consisting with our spanish customs she found by my discourse that i was determined it should be so wherefore she left off arguing upon that subject but i could perceive all the time we were together my resolves sat very uneasy upon her and it was with much difficulty she restrained her tears her sorrow struck me to the heart and it was the greatest struggle i ever went through to keep my temper for i imagined all her grief was to have this spy upon her actions  when night approached my friend came according to appointment and during our supper i told my wife she was to look upon him as my only friend and give him the same admittance as if it was my self in every thing he should desire well knowing i told her he would ask nothing contrary to our strict amity  sir said my friend i am very sorry i cannot comply with your desires for i have received letters from a near relation at panama and i am obliged to attend his nuptials being he cannot make proper marriage settlements without i am upon the spot and i fear i shall hardly return this six weeks i was at first very much surpised at this his sudden resolution and was going to say something upon it till i observed he winked at me i then began to remember what he said to me in the morning that i should not take notice of what he said but i observed the cloud upon my wifes face began to disappear by degrees which seemed to me the greatest proof of her infidelity i was so provoked with the imaginary wrong that i could not help showing it in words and actions but yet i had so much reason in my madness for passion is no less that i concealed the real clause  my wife seemed confounded at my incoherent anger having never seen my fury before and when my friend was gone begged i would tell her the real cause of my uneasiness for she was well assured some secret cause had ruffled my temper but i persisted in the obstinacy of not discovering it to her and the next day pursued my journey with a dismal idea of what was to come  thought had so much impaired my strength with its violent workings that i found it a difficult thing to sit my horse and when i came to my inn at night i was carried to bed in a violent fever and all night was in a delirium my servants sent for a physician who gave me something to resist my malady and while he was with me i uttered some words in my ravings that gave him to understand my disease proceeded from the mind when i came to my self i was something surpised to hear him speak to me after this manner  sir i have so long dealt with diseases of most kinds that i have knowledge enough to perceive when they proceed from an ill habit of body or those maladies of the mind that slight all physic and be not amazed when i tell you i have often cured the latter by wholesome advice you are a young man and perhaps may have taken a wrong conception of things if you will be pleased to tell me your case i will give you my advice without a fee and dont think me impertinent to desire it i have seen more years than you you may conceal your name in your relation and if my advice does not please you you are but just where you were i shall be as faithful in keeping your secret as your confessor  you may be assured i was very much surpised at his proceeding and i easily perceived a sincerity in his discourse that gained him my esteem and i was resolved to let him into my story which i did as much as i have to you  after a pause he said i had just come up to his imagination of my case and now sir said he i will proceed to my advice consider well what you are about you have confessed your friend owned to you he made pretended love to your wife to try her virtue and yet i dont find he advised with you about it before he had put his device in practice to give you my sentiments of this matter i believe your friend to be false to you and that he really is in love with your wife the distress of your spouse proceeded from her indignation to him and love to you his telling you after his attempt upon her was no more than to be the first in the declaration as imagining she would of course inform you with it her keeping it a secret from you was not to make you uneasy and his declaring his suspicion of her virtue afterward was either to be revenged on her for slighting his passion or to give him an opportunity in your absence to wrong your wife  this in short i fancy will prove the whole truth neither is this judgment hard to make for i am apt to believe any disinterested person would make the same judgment your passion has blinded yours yet nevertheless if you can give your self time to think calmly i dont in the least doubt but you will be of my opinion this i am assured of jealousy is a certain sign of love and if you should in the heat of passion do a rash deed every moment of your life will prove a torment to you lovers eyes are often false and too quick in false creations call reason to your assistance that will prove your best friend take some time to think of my advice and counsel friends may as soon prove false as wives and you had better lose the former than the latter  all the while he was speaking methought i was listening to an oracle and at the end of his discourse i could not help blaming my self for my rash belief i called over in my memory every moment of my wifes behavior and could not find any one action start up to give me that hard opinion i had rashly conceived against her  i returned the physician of my mind as well as body many thanks for his cordial advice and would have paid him in another coin but i could not prevail upon him to take a single dollar no said he in accepting of your money i shall make it appear that like lawyers i pleaded for my fee no sir all the recompense i shall ask of you is only to let me know the truth of every thing when the catastrophe is over which i hope will not affect your wife and if i might throw in one word of advice more if you prove the friend you have so much confided in to be false show your resentment by slighting him and leave revenge to heaven i promised to follow his judicious advice in every thing and so we parted with a very good regard for each other  i was resolved to proceed no farther on my journey but make the best of my way back again and as i went along consider of my behavior and let time alone for proof the reason i gave my servants for returning was that i had not strength to pursue my journey which in reality was no falsehood for i was weak enough and i am convinced that disorders of the mind weaken the body more than habitual distempers in part of my journey back i could not come to any resolution how to behave and therefore resolved to lie one more night upon the road to see if my pillow would advise me when i arrived at my inn one of my servants told me don roderigo was just alighted hearing him named my blood ran a wild course about my body and immediately it struck to my mind something was not right  i asked my servant if roderigo had seen him he told me no and that he seemed disguised as if he did not desire to be known this strengthened my suspicion of some ill intended or done already and that he was making his escape i ordered my servants not to appear but when supper was ready i sent for my host to bear me company where after some trivial discourse i asked him what guests he had in the house he made no scruple in telling me but when he came to don roderigo he declared he did not much like him for he seemed very willing to be private with two of his servants and he had observed em often whispering they design said he to be going very early in the morning but i dont know which road they travel i concealed my disturbance of mind from my host but resolved to be going as early as don roderigo and to be sure of being early enough i determined not to go to bed notwithstanding the weakness of my body required repose  in the middle of the night i heard people whispering in the next room and i could easily distinguish roderigos voice though i could gather little of their discourse yet i could hear mine and my wifes name often mentioned  at break of day i found they were preparing to be gone and though i was pretty expeditious yet they were got out of the inn before i could get on horseback with my servants i was much vexed at it yet pursued my journey homeward but i was very much amazed when about two leagues from lima i met my wife in a coach with her maid and two indian servants the servants as soon as they saw me were overjoyed and my wife could not open her mouth for some time i then began to relapse into my former jealousy and imagined she was following don roderigo  at last she opened her mouth with a great deal of joy lord my dear said she is it you in reality or are my senses deceived i asked her the reason of her journey and her mighty surprise sir answered she that question confounds me have i not a letter from you to come with all speed imaginable here it is continued she i took the letter from her and read the contents  my dear pursuing my journey i had the misfortune to fall from my horse and break my arm which prevents my writing to you the accident is attended with a violent fever which i am told is very dangerous i have refrained writing to you till now as expecting some amendment but finding my self worse i beg you will come to me with all the expedition imaginable for fear you should never see me more alive  your affectionate husband   there needed no sphynx to unriddle this enigma and i observed by my wifes countenance we both knew the author of the letter while we were confused the coachman that drove the coach was stealing away but my wife cried out to stop him for that was the messenger that brought the letter to her and farther told her he was to conduct her to me for the coachman we had before was drowned and that circumstance deceivd her more than any thing else the fellow also told her that i had prevailed with a gentleman in the neighborhood where i lay hurt to send him to drive the coach i rid after the fellow and brought him back ordered him into the coachbox and forced him to drive out of the road to a neighboring village where lived a gentleman of my acquaintance he very unwillingly complied with my commands and we kept very close to him to prevent his making away when we arrived at my friends house we secured the fellow in a strong room and i left two of my indian servants to guard him i made my friend acquainted with the accident and that this visit was not intended but by mere chance he gave me to know i was welcome let what would bring me there  when my wife and i with my friend were alone i tenderly embraced her and begged her pardon for my unjust suspicions of her virtue and related the whole progress of my jealousy without omitting the least circumstance she gave thanks to heaven for the danger she was saved from and related to me the manner of her being deceived by the fellow that brought the letter as follows  the fifth day after you had left me as i was musing in the garden my maid told me a person had a letter to deliver me from you i began to tremble with timorous apprehension and my whole frame felt violent disorders i ordered the bearer to be brought to me and when i had read the letter grief locked up my tongue and i had not power to speak for some time when i had recovered speech i asked the fellow where you were madam said he he is at don florios country house naming a friend of mine that my wife had heard me often mention and knowing you had never a coachman my master sent me to conduct you to your husband i would not spend time in dressing my self but just as i was with my maid and the two indians pursued our journey i never once dreamed of any treachery though i always doubted your false friend but as he had never been to visit me in your absence it wiped away all suspicions of him i observed the coachman by his looks did not like the company of my servants but i was too much concerned for you to think of it much  we congratulated one another again at our happy deliverance and admired the workings of divine providence and the second cause my friendly physician  my wife expressed a great desire to see him to return him acknowledgments for his inspired advice and in the morning i promised her to go to him if we could get any convenient carriage for we were not very fond of making use of the coachman that brought her out  i deferred his examination till the next day being too much fatigued to do it then though i ordered he should want nothing but his liberty for i considered him only as an instrument to work his masters ends when i was up in the morning i ordered him to be brought before me but after some time they brought me word he had made his escape by creeping through the cieling of the room and throwing down the shingles for it was a single apartment near the garden i was a little uneasy at his getting away as well as my wife for fear his master should make some attempt upon us in the house where we were it being a quarter of a mile from the village and the gentleman my friend had but few servants therefore it was thought the safest course for us to go immediately to lima and as soon as we could procure mules we set out and reached that city without molestation  i heard nothing of the faithless roderigo for several days neither did i think it strange for i imagined if he had any shame left he would not dare to appear publicly at lima but if he did i had resolved to take my friendly physicians advice which had proved so successful to me to show my resentment in slighting him  one night as soft repose had locked up our senses we were alarmed from our downy sleep by a fearful cry of fire fire i rose and ran into my wifes apartment where she remained frighted almost to death and as people generally in the alarm of fire know not what they do she ran to the chamber where the maids lay and dressed herself in her servants clothes the maid being equally frighted when she found she had no clothes to put on clapped on her mistresss which i had brought after her and was running down stairs to free herself from the danger as she was going through the hall i observed four men in masks seized her and carried her off i followed with my sword in my hand till one of the villainous company came behind me and run me through the back my servants who came after me bore me in faint with loss of blood but by good fortune the wound did not prove dangerous though well meant  we could never come by the truth how the house was set on fire though it was soon extinguished but we were assured it must be by some one of the domestics it was easy to judge don roderigo was the cause on it by running away with the maid as mistaking her for my wife because she had in the hurry put on her mistresss clothes and vail  i was advised by my best friends to summon him before the supreme judge for it was dangerous to let him go on with impunity but he would not obey the summons therefore he was designed to be outlawed by due course of law but as that takes up several months i was obliged to keep a guard in my house for i received several menacing letters frequently from him either thrown over the wall or left so that we could never secure any person that brought em while our suit was going on our new viceroy arrived who proving a friend to don roderigo a nolle prosequi was issued out and i was obliged to stand at the whole charge of the lawsuit this violent and unjust proceeding of the viceroys raised my gaul to that degree that i said many warm things against his administration which came to his knowledge for there are generally poorspirited wretches in all governments that have no other merit than to improve tales and feed the ears of their superiors with nauseous flattery and lies  i was sent for to the viceroy and examined concerning these reports and i so far incensed him with my replies to his questions that if i had not met with some friends that palliated the matter i dont know how far his resentment would have carried him i was dismissed with my liberty but a multitude of menaces if for the future i ever gave my tongue another loose and i soon found the effects of his resentment by losing a small place in the government but as providence had put me above wanting it i was not much grieved at the loss  my wife begged me to remove from lima a place where i had received so many insults and it was not improbable but i might receive more which proved but too true  in a few days after i had appeared before the viceroy the maid that was forced away by mistaking her for my wife came home miserably ill used and brought me a letter from the ungrateful don roderigo which you may read if you please upon that he took the letter out of his pocket and i found it as follows  i declare my self your inveterate enemy though i have no just reason to be so you may be sure my enmity is rooted for ever in my heart and i shall have no rest in this world till thou art out of it i should not perhaps be so free in declaring my mind by writing if i was not very well assured thy publishing it would do thee no good i have so much honor in me still as to assure thee i would venture my life to hazard thine and if i have ever the opportunity i shall put it to the hazard therefore be well guarded whenever thou appearest abroad minds like mine are never appeased i always was a villain but had so much cunning to hide it from the world till now this affair has published it and be assured i shall study every way to compass my revenge whilst i am  roderigo   the insolence of this letter was not to be born and i was as impatient to meet him as he could be to meet with me and i must own to you i thirsted for his blood for his usage was beyond the nature of man to bear i examined the poor girl of what she knew of the wretch who informed me that they put her into a coach and carried her a league out of town but when they found their mistake the usage she bore from em was insupportable and the brute roderigo told his servants if they pleased to make use of her in the vilest manner they were welcome the wretches that served such a villain must have very near the same sentiments of honor and honesty or they would seek another master they were too forward to neglect such a cruelty and four of em by turns ravished her strangers to the nature of the wretches who are superiors in this part of the world would imagine such deeds should find punishment by law but alas justice is fled the place and we may expect more mercy from the worst of cannibals than is to be found here  the poor creature in a little time felt the farther effects of their cruelty for they gave her a distemper that ended her life  before her death she gave me knowledge of the place where they led her for they had not any caution in their villainous proceeding but as soon as they had gratified their lust and cruelty turned her out of doors  i had no farther need of any thing to whet my revenge but i must own the death of this unfortunate poor creature added fuel to the fire my wife was almost distracted at the unhappy accident and had no other consolation but that she had escaped their cruel hands  i did not acquaint her with my intention of seeking this villain but i made it my only business i went to the place the poor maid had directed me where i had information that he had left the place and now resided in lima i was very sorry he had changed his habitation because i should find it a more difficult thing to execute my resentment with safety in lima but however i sent him the following letter  thy usage to me is not to be born therefore if thou have that spirit which i much question from thy villainy for villains are always cowards meet me in st justins field tomorrow at six in the morning as i imagine there is no second in thy villainy i shall expect thee alone and i hope thou will not fail to meet the injured  alonzo de castro   i chose st justins field for the convenience of a small publickhouse which overlooked it where i went before day that i might discover if he came alone for i had but little reason to expect fair play from such a villain when the time came i saw him go by the house alone i let him pass by me to see if he was not followed by any of his cursed crew but finding none i hasted after him into the middle of the field and called to him he turned about and with the image of hell in his face he cried i thought your resentment would have brought you first into the field but as i am here before you it speaks me no coward though your vile scrawl would intimate as much come said i no words thy breath is poison to me it will insect the air only this sir said he as you had not named any particular weapon i have made bold to bring a pair of pistols with me and to let you see i have some honor you shall take your choice i gave him no answer but took one and we agreed to stand at such a distance as i was going to fire he cried out hold i will tell you one secret more before we engage and that is this your pistol is only charged with powder but mine with ball which i put in since you made the choice and now prepare for death be assured this is the last moment of thy life i did not give my self time to answer but fired my pistol and then hurled it at him and had the good fortune to cut him in the face with it and in the confusion and surprise his pistol went off without hurting me now said i thou wretch we are once more on equal terms and heaven i hope will favor the justest cause we drew and in a few passes i laid him for dead on the ground though in the encounter i had received a dangerous wound in the breast i went home notwithstanding my hurt and sent secretly for a surgeon of my acquaintance who dressed me and told me i was in no danger  my wife was very much grieved at the accident though she could not but be pleased at roderigos death yet her fears increased as imagining i should suffer for it by the violent temper of the viceroy but her grief began to blow over when in several days after no enquiry was made nor even any notice taken of his death  i was very much surpised at it imagining i had really killed him  as soon as my wound was well i went to the little house to enquire if they knew any thing of the body for the owner of the house was formerly my servant and a man of much probity who knew all my story he informed me that a little while after i past by his house home again five persons ran that way and coming to the body seemed to mourn over it and went the road that leads to st dominick a village about half a mile from the place where we fought  i imagined they had buried him privately in that village and went home to acquaint my wife who shared my contentment  i now went abroad as i was wont and all the discourse was of don roderigos sudden disappearing servants and all had left his house but no one suspected any thing of his death some of my acquaintance told me they imagined this to be some trick of his and that he only lay dormant to meditate some mischief to me  i seemed to come into their fears but in my mind slighted their advice as imagining i had nothing to fear i past on a whole month without any danger at all but as i was going one day across the bridge to a warehouse i had in the suburbs a fellow came up to me and privately asked me if i would be his chapman for some east india goods he told me a long story that he was obliged to make up a cargo and leave this part of the world for his credit began to fail and if he did not get away speedily his creditors would lay him up we went to a neighboring tavern where he read me his bill of parcels he told me he had been encouraged to offer his goods to me from the fairness of my character and was coming to wait on me when he had the good fortune to meet me the next day was agreed on for me to go and view the goods for i was not to pay for em till they were entered my warehouse accordingly as appointed i went to the house of the person in the benedictine street i was shown into a room till the goods were brought but as i was looking on some paintings five men rushed out of a closet in the room and seized me they disarmed me took out every thing that was in my pockets went out and locked me in you may imagine the surprise i was in which was very much increased when i saw my enemy don roderigo enter the room i in my confusion thought i had seen a ghost for he looked very pale but he soon convinced me of the contrary and have i got you at last said he i now will revenge my self at leisure but to complete my revenge i have sent a token for your wife that i may ravish her before thy face and then i will devise tortures to rack every joint about thee he gave me to know that he had sent my watch for a token and that she would bring such a sum of money to pay for the goods the torment of my soul no tongue can express and i am assured if they had not taken my sword from me i had put an end to my wretched life  the inhumane villain insulted me so much that i rushed upon him unarmed as i was and had certainly choked him if his wicked assistants had not dragged me from him  it is well said he i have no other passion but lust reigning in my breast at this instant but when i have sated my desires on thy wife i will then add another pang for this usage but in the mean time i will leave you to think of this matter alone for i fancy you dont much care for my company  as soon as he had made an end of this speech he and his gang went out and fastened the door on the other side i will give you leave to imagine the confusion of my thoughts i remained some time without moving but accidentally casting my eyes on the door i observed there was a bar to shut it on the inside i immediately barred it and began to look about to see if i could find any thing for my defense but to my grief could perceive nothing i entered the closet and searched there but to no purpose looking upon the floor of the closet i perceived one of the boards seemed to be loose i essayed to pull it up but wanted some engine to effect it i at last thought of the bar of the door ran to it and by main force wrenchd it from the staple for i thought if it would not serve me to make my escape it would serve me to defend my self but i easily forced up the board and with my bar beat down the ceiling under me i was resolved to explore the hidden place whatever was the consequence for it could not be worse than to remain where i was i therefore ventured down though something of a difficult descent for the joyces were so close together i had much ado to force my body through but at last with much difficulty i pressed through and had a desperate fall to the ground  i soon found i had got into a coopers collar for there were several pipestaves and tools to work with i seized upon some of them and by force wrenchd open the cellardoor which led me once more into the street before don roderigos house i did not give my self time to consider but ran toward the bridge to get to my own house and just as i entered the cordeliers street i met my wife with her maid and the wretch that had decoyed me to the house i ran upon him seized him by the throat and flung him over the bridge where he met with the reward of his villainy i had not power of speech to inform my wife of the accident but made signs for her to go home by this time it was dark and the profligate villain don roderigo fancying his cursed emissary staid too long came out of his door which faced the bridge as soon as i discovered him i ran toward him and seized him now villain said i i will not part with thee till thou have rendered up thy soul to hell we both struggled and i kept him down but the rest of his company coming up to his assistance i quitted him and runring to see if i could meet with some one armed i had the good fortune to light on you as soon as i received your sword i ran back and just met the villain as he was entering his door i ran the weapon into his very heart and i believe you were a better witness of his death than my self being you were found near the body  as soon as i saw him fall i made the best of my way home not imagining you would meet with any farther damage than the loss of your sword  the darkness of the night i fancy concealed me from the servants that came to the assistance of their master for i never once was suspected or perhaps if they did know me fear kept em from discovering me  when i heard of your trial i came my self into court and if you had been condemned resolved to have discovered the truth but finding you were to be banished to baldivia i concealed the fact imagining i had it in my power to gain your freedom by paying your ransom which was the reason i came now to wait upon you to offer you my service in that or any thing else that lies in my power i returned him thanks for his offer and considering his story i told him i was glad i was in some sort an instrument of his revenge he would force upon me a ring and two hundred pieces of gold and begged he might be ranked in the number of my friends he made me many visits and once brought his wife with him she was a very handsome woman and seemed to have a great deal of wit she made me several very handsome compliments in behalf of her husband and begged i would accept of their pictures set round with fine oriental pearls  he accompanied me on board when our vessel was to set sail putting in the captains hands fresh provision and several sorts of good liquor to comfort me in my voyage  i had the happiness to have pirates for my fellowsuflerers and the viceroy had given out to take off all censure from him that i encouraged em in their piracy  we took our leaves with protestations of a lasting friendship and i lived as merrily as i could till the day we had the good fortune to meet with you which has not given me any reason to change my humor    we were mightily diverted with the relation of don pedro and i found i was not deceived when i took him for a man that understood the world  we had now gained the streights of gibraltar and had entered the mediterranean sea but i must confess i could not see the african shore without numbers of sighs for misfortunes past and i found my griefs renewed with the remembrance and all the mitigation i had was the affectionate concern from don ferdinand to whom i had told my whole story we had not made a days sail in the mediterranean ere we perceived two sail making toward us i must own i had no desire to engage being so richly laden and therefore by the advice of both the ships company made all the sail i could to avoid em but our vessels being foul with so long a voyage and never once cleaned during our whole course they gained upon us do what we could when we found there was no getting from em without fighting we were as much determined on the other hand to fight our ships to the bottom of the sea rather than surrender having fixed this resolution we prepared for the engagement and when we had got all things in readiness we lessened our sails that they might come up to us i ordered every sailor to load as many small arms as they could and not to fire a gun till i gave em orders but as soon as ever they had fired the great guns to discharge their small arms upon em i could not prevail upon don ferdinand to keep below though i saw fear livelily painted in his face when they came within pistolshot of our ship they hailed us and commanded us to strike immediately we made no other answer than with our guns and small arms which surpised em and did em a great deel of damage in their rigging for cutting the topsail halliards with our shot the topsail fell down upon the cap and hindered their ships way very much and i believe we might have made our escape but i perceived the villars was hard put to it our spanish man of war whom i had named the villars in remembrance of that dear one by this time we were prepared again and i ordered every man as soon as they had discharged to lie flat upon their bellies till we had received the fire of the enemy which accordingly we did they fired in upon us but killed  not one man then our ha ose up all together and fired in our small shot we had so damaged their rigging with this broadside that we fell astern till we were charged again and then i gave our men orders to fire into the body of the ship and point their guns low on purpose which we soon found had the desired effect for they had several shots between wind and water so that they were obliged to heel the ship on the starboard side to prevent the water running in on the larboard i seeing there was not much to be feared from her bore down to assist the villars because she was overmatchd but when her antagonist found my design and understood the condition of the other ship she made all the sail she could and fled for it we did not think fit to follow her but sent a boat on board to enquire how it stood with em in the villars they sent me word they had lost eight men had three wounded and were very much mawld in their rigging as well as their hull and had received a shot between wind and water and the ship leakd very much i bad em search for it but there was no coming at it therefore i ordered them to get out as many of the goods as they could and bring them on board me the weather proving very favorable they went to work as fast as they could  our men brought me word that the ship we had engaged was sinking they fired several guns for assistance and their consort being almost out of sight i bore down to help them all i could but before we could come to em she sunk to the bottom the men had put out their longboat and barge and were got in them and made toward us as soon as they came within hearing they called out for quarter which i promised em they sh uld have there were     of em and as their number exceeded ours we were obliged to confine em for fear they should take it in their heads to set upon us  the captain was killed in the engagement but the lieutenant informed me they were two men of war of forty guns each set out from barcelona to cruise upon the coast and manned each with two hundred men but the rest of their crew were either killed or being wounded sunk with the ship i did not think it proper to carry em to italy for fear it should prove prejudicial to don antonio and understanding that in removing the goods on board the villars they had found out the leak and stopped it i intended to put em on board her and give em the ship with their liberty but first i ordered out the guns and ammunition and her goods leaving em nothing but provision and water which they returned me many thanks for and so we parted  the next day there arose such a storm as we had never felt before and continued in the utmost violence for fourteen days so that now we were in danger of drowning and i believe most would have parted with their wealth to have been safe on shore at last we discovered land but were very much surpised to find it candia for now we began to be in fear of the turkish pirates so we resolved to steer for zant as fast as we could and there make dividend of our prizemoney and goods and accordingly we arrived there safely sept         this island of zant belongs to the venetians therefore we were out of danger from the turks the town which bears the same name with the island is above a mile in length seated upon a beach of the bay it is built mostly of stone and has a noble look from the sea to the west of the town stands the castle built on a high and very steep hill where most of the merchants dwell and is very near as big as the city below it is a bishops see and the governor is of the nobility of venice the chief commodities they deal in are wine oil and currants which are esteemed of the best growth they grow on vines like other grapes and are gathered in july and then packed in hogsheads ready for the merchants  our men being well pleased they were out of danger and in a place where wine was to be bought cheap traffickd so much for that commodity that most of them fell into dangerous diseases therefore i resolved to leave zant and make for sapienza an island with a good harbor not inhabited where they would not be under the like temptation so we came to an anchor there sept   i ordered twelve guns on shore and raised a platform capable of defending us from the insults of an enemy in a pleasant green we put up a large tent and others smaller by it for the officers and sailors but i having but one bed put up on shore don ferdinand was forced to lie with me though as i thought very unwillingly our sharing the ready money took us up four days i reserved a fourth part to my owners which amounted to upwards of sixty thousand pound and a twelfth part for my self which with what presents and other things that i had amounted to the value of fifty thousand pound every sailor from first to last shared above twelve hundred pound apiece but when we came to divide the goods we knew not which way to go about it so with one common consent of the sailors i was obliged to accept of them without paying one penny for them  we set sail for ostia the next day after we had finished our dividend and arrived there nov   after a voyage of two years and seven months and the richest prize that ever came into any port of italy i sent a letter to don antonio to give him notice of my arrival and advice to come and take care of his cargo in two days he donna isabella and their little son came on board in a pleasureboat i found they were in mourning and i told em i was afraid to ask em who it was for they informed me that isabellas father had been dead above two years but they had resolved never to wear any other color till they had seen me never was a more tender meeting between friends than between us and i must confess for some time all my cares lay hushed  when i came to inform don antonio of the wealth i had brought him home he stood amazed for besides the money which i told him of the goods i had on board exceeded in value the freight i went out with i could hardly prevail upon him to accept of such a sum of money till i informed him it was but barely his due and that i had very near as much to my own share  i presented don ferdinand to antonio and his lady who seemed very much pleased with him and don pedro out of his free merry humor told me he hoped i would not forget him because he was older for he thought he had more right to my friendship than don ferdinand being he was an older acquaintance i let em into some of his life and humor they received him yery friendly and we all went to don antonios villa together  after staying a week i began to be tired with so much pleasure and therefore begged leave of don antonio to visit rome only to show don ferdinand that celebrated place don antonio sent before to his palace to prepare for our reception and the next day we followed we visited all the rarities ancient and modern where we might see the grandeur of the ancient romans by those stupendous ruins still left as rome was formerly a nursery of war and greatness it is now a nursery of arts but chiefly painting architecture and music there have flourished in one century lanfranio dominichino pietro du cortona the possines camassei guercin da cento chivoli andrea sacchi the immortal raphael hannibal carace guide rene mutiano and many more excellent in the art of painting then palladio vitruvius scamozzi pozza and many more famous for architecture then the divine corelli for music whose sweet compositions will be always new and we may say by him as a great english poet said of our countryman shakespeare that the former had pulled up the roots of music as the latter of poetry and transplanted em into their own gardens where all those that follow must borrow a branch from them  i shall not say any thing more of rome nor of naples where we went once more upon don ferdinands account i would have persuaded him to have begun his studies at rome for i supposed him a roman catholic but he would not hear of it and begged he might go with me into england which i promised him he should  donna isabella had an orphan cousin that lived with her of a vast fortune beautiful to a miracle who having seen don ferdinand fell desperately in love with him but he did not seem to have the least regard for her don antonio discovered to me the secret and pitying by experience his kinswoman desired i would foward the match but when don ferdinand understood my desires he fell upon his knees and begged i would never mention it more for he had made a solemn resolution never to marry any woman breathing i pressed him all i could and laid the folly of such a rash resolve before him but it was preaching to a tempest and all my arguments had no power upon him on the other hand the merry don pedro was as deep in love with donna felicia which was the name of the orphan lady but his manner of courtship was so odd and out of the way that he caused more diversion than we could have imagined if she went to bed he would lay himself down at her chamber door and sing songs all night that if she had any inclination to have rested he was resolved she should not and he would often say he intended to plague her into a compliance if she went into the garden he was sure to follow her close or even at church he would often tell her it was in vain to pray for a blessing from heaven when she was committing murder with every look in short he would often force a smile from the afflicted lady her self  i was still endeavoring with don ferdinand to forget his rash vow but he desired me in such moving tms not to entreat him further that i resolved never to trouble him any more on that theme notwithstanding which i begged of donna isabella to try what she could do with him for i imagined complaisance might work more upon him than friendship she sent for him into her closet and they remained together several hours and i was very much pleased the next day to see him walking in the garden only with donna felicia i did not think it proper to interrupt them but when i had an opportunity i declared my satisfaction and told him i easily forgave his not complying with me and yielding to the persuasion of donna isabella he seemed in some confusion at what i said to him which i attributed to his denying me and his condescension to donna isabella but in a few days after that i was something more surpised to see don pedro eagerly addressing donna felicia and she regarding him more favorably than usual and my surprise was increased when donna isabella told me the nuptial day was fixed between don pedro and donna felicia i told her i was very well pleased the lady had so soon forgot her violent passion but i added that the stronger the flame the shorter the duration if so returned donna isabella we may hope your passion is buried long since i told her i did not love like others for i was resolved to carry mine with me to the grave by what i have formerly heard returned donna isabella from you as well as my husband you have not the least glimpse of hopes madam said i that is the reason i must despair for no other fire shall ever warm my breast but what was kindled there by my first flame we had much discourse upon the same subject and donna isabella told me at last i was a pattern for all faithful lovers  when we were at naples i had provided goods and convenience of sending to st salvador according to my promise given to don jaques and the vessel being to touch at ostia was to send to me for my letters to don jaques i desired don ferdinand to write to his father but he begged to be excused for fear it should fall into the hands of his lady and for the same reason he begged i would be cautious how i mentioned him i told him he should see what i had wrote before i sent it which was as follows  sir i know not how to make you acknowledgments sufficient for those favors so generously conferred upon me and the manner of doing it stamps a double value on the obligation if there is no way to repay the mighty debt yet i shall with the utmost gratitude remember don jaques and his kind benefits i have done my self the honor to send you those things you were desirous of the last time i had the happiness of conversing with you which i beg you will accept only for this reason that you may see you shall ever live in the remembrance of one who shall think it the best good fortune can fall upon him to subscribe himself  your sincere friend and servant robert boil p s i also beg you to give my humble duty to your good lady and virtuous daughter and be assured whatever you have given me in charge shall have the same regard as if an immortal spirit had descended from above and written in my heart your commission whatever letters you are pleased to honor me with direct for me at the palace of antonio de alvares in rome who will take care to send em to me wherever i am for as yet i am undetermined where to settle my self but i have england in view     i wrote this letter in the portugueze language and showed it to don ferdinand who approved of what i had written  i had disposed of the rest of my goods on board and the money amounted to upwards of fifteen thousand pound but i could not prevail upon don antonio to accept of one penny  no my dear friend said he you have already brought me the fortune of a nobleman though it is not worldly wealth i covet i have all the earth contains in the possession of my adorable wife and even that my greatest happiness is owing to you and all the allay of joy i have is that i cannot see you as blessed as i am but continued he time that wears out all things will i hope cure this amorous sickness of your soul i let him know my grief was as fixed as destiny and i had nothing else to do but to wing to the place where the joy of my life did once reside with this only hope that the lively imagination of my loss would put an end to all my sorrows by sinking me into the arms of death  he was so very much concerned for me that he could not avoid shedding tears and used all the arguments he could to persuade me to reside in italy i told him i had more reasons to go for my native country than what i had given him and that was the education of young don ferdinand who begged to cultivate his studies in england  i turned all my money into bills of exchange well knowing the casualties that attend travelers and i intended to go by land to flanders with don ferdinand my two faithful indians and one servant more  all my spanish sailors that i had picked up by the way had by my consent their discharge and were gone to their several homes in circumstances beyond their expectations though they all declared if i intended another voyage they would never forsake me some of my english sailors had married italian women and so designed to settle in italy  when i desired don antonio to take charge of the ship he told me he had nothing to do with it declaring it was mine and therefore desired i would make no more words about it for said he you dont know but you may meet with something to change your mind and we may have the satisfaction of seeing you once more  in a few days after this the nuptials were celebrated between don pedro and donna felicia who designed for spain as soon as i left italy where he intended to take up the mortgage of his estate the time being almost expired i must own the uncertainty of womens tempers gave me much cogitation and i thought this marriage was a very odd thing  i now began to think of my journey but first i ordered a goldsmith to make me every way the same parcel of plate as i received as a present from don jaques de ramires which i presented to donna isabella that she might remember me she gave me many thanks for it but seemed very unwilling to accept of it a great while i told her as merrily as i could if she made any more words about it i would return her the ship that bore her name and would be no longer under her command well said she i will accept em but as you allow me to be your owner i will give you orders in writing that you must not break open till you come in such a latitude that is a fortnight after you are settled in england i promised to obey her punctually the next day she gave me a sealed paper which she told me were the orders she mentioned  i had given my lieutenant charge of the ship with directions to make for bristol with all the expedition practicable  the next day being feb        i took my leave of all my acquaintance and notwithstanding i am not used to weep could not forbear shedding some tears at parting with such true friends as don antonio and his lady had proved i rode the first day overwhelmed with melancholy and not one thought of being possessed of such a fortune from nothing in so short a time ever entered my breast but seeing don ferdinand by his countenance partake of my sorrow i was forced to appear less melancholy to oblige him to be so too  i would have shown him the rarities of italy in our travels but he seemed very little inclined to curiosity and we arrived at antwerp without any adventure we staid some time there to recover the fatigue of our journey but more upon don ferdinands account being he was something indisposed having never traveled on horseback so far before  as we approached the town he and my indians were surpised to see the manner of begging the boys and girls would run before you and of a sudden stop short stand upon their heads and clap their hands saying their prayers all the while  the city of antwerp is finely seated upon the river scheld it is very well fortified and upon the walls are planted trees that give an agreeable shade and make it pleasant walking the castle both strong and beautiful was founded by the duke of alva the city in bigness may compare with bristol their streets spacious and houses very magnificent the church of sancta maria their cathedral is a superb building and of that neatness that the emperor charles the fifth of germany would often say it was only fit to be kept in a case the inside is as glorious and neat as the out the paintings were performed by sir peter paul rubens an inhabitant of antwerp and are equal to any thing that ever he did the jesuits church is also very beautiful adorned with abundance of curious marble pillars and all the pannels painted by the same hand as the other there are several more beautiful churches and chapels but as these mentioned are the chief we shall take no farther notice of em  the third of april having pretty well recovered our fatigue by a rest of ten days we set out for calais being the shortest cut to dover and arrived there april   making short stages  from this place we might behold the white cliffs of dover i must own i had some secret satisfaction in viewing my native country and the next day early in the morning we embarked and reached the town by noon having a very favorable passage here landing i had like to have lost one of my indians slinging his horses into the boat he would get upon the back of one of them thinking he would go out quietly but just upon the instant a vessel riding by the peer fired a gun and frighted the horse to such a degree that he plunged into the sea and swam from the shore and the indian being thrown off with the start had his foot so entangled in the stirrup that notwithstanding his skill in swimming he must have inevitably perished if the other indian seeing the misfortune had not plunged in and with a knife cut the string he then took the horse by the bridle with one hand and swimming with the other brought him safe to shore  don ferdinand not being overpleasd with riding on horseback we took the flyingcoach the next day and safely arrived at london i ordered my english servant and the two indians with our baggage to make two days of it and gave em directions to wait at the place where the coach innd till i sent for em  when we arrived at london i did not care to go to any of my acquaintance but rather chose to lie at a bagnio for a day or two but i sent privately for my uncles clerk that had endeavored to prevent my being kidnappd by putting a letter in my pocket mentioned in the beginning of this relation he came to me according to my desire but was overjoyed and surpised to see me though he hardly knew me at first for i had not sent him my name  he informed me that my uncle had been dead above a year and had left his estate to his eldest son and his business to his youngest and him but they would often talk of me not believing i was in the land of the living yet they had increased my small estate with their utmost care intending if ever i came back again to restore it to me i let him into my whole history and he was very much pleased to hear that i had gained such a plentiful fortune i got him to provide us convenient lodgings and private for i did not intend to go abroad much and also to go to the inn to fetch my servants  my two indians spoke english very well and i had learnt em to write and read and being in modern habits they were not much gazed at  the time being expired that i was to look into my commission as donna isabella called it i resolved to break it open having some curiosity but it was gone and notwithstanding all my search i could not gain any tidings of it i could not imagine how i should lose that and nothing else i must own i was very uneasy fearing it might be something of importance i was to do for donna isabella therefore i dispatched a letter to italy to tell em of my safe arrival and my loss of the packet and to send me a fresh one with directions where to write to me  while i staid in town i purchased an estate of  000 l a year in somersetshire and yet had   000 l left which i employed in the public funds and now i had settled my estate as well as that i had for don ferdinand i was willing to forward him in his studies and proposed to send him to oxford with a tutor but he still begged to stay a little longer with me  i therefore took a resolution of going to bristol only with don ferdinand and one servant with no other business than to see the place where my lost treasure once lived  when we were arrived i inquired which was the house that mr villars late merchant formerly dwelt in we soon found it out but were informed one capt kendrick dwelt there i was inquisitive to know if there was any tidings of one susan who was formerly maid to mrs villars daughter to the deceased merchant and at last got information that she lived at a country house near the seaside  i went immediately away for the place though near thirty mile off and late in the evening before we had rid far the skies became gloomy and a violent storm threatened us which soon overtook us with such fury that we were forced to put into a little house out of the road for shelter when we came within we could not see any body in it but a little child playing with some toys it had before it and all we could get out of it was that mamma would come by and by it was as lovely a child as ever i saw and we were still admiring it when a man and woman came in they were much amazed to find us there but i begged their pardon and told em the storm drove us in to take shelter  the man told us we were very welcome to such as his house afforded but he feared we should find but poor accommodation in short the storm kept up in its full force and now it grew dark and we were two mile from any inn and to add to our distress we were strangers to the road the man seeing us so put to it told us he had but two beds but we should be welcome to em such as they were  i told him i would gratify him for his trouble and thereupon gave him a guinea he was very well pleased with my present and began to show it in his looks as well as the woman i gave him another to provide us something to eat and to take care of the horses he said he had but bad stableroom but if i pleased he would take my servant and all the horses with one of his own to bring him back again and leave em at an inn in the neighboring village i agreed to it and while he was gone i asked the good woman many questions about the child which we saw there and soon sound it was none of their own but a gentlewomans a stranger to them and one they had never seen but once why said i how are you paid for the keeping of it she seemed amazed at my question and was some time before she answered me but at last she said she was always very well paid  i finding she did not much care for talking upon that subject changed the discourse soon after the man came in and we went to supper i would have had don ferdinand to have lain with me but the man understanding we usually lay asunder would give us both the beds and they would sit up i asked them where the child lay and they told us in a cradle i began to be concerned for the infant though without giving any reason when we had supped we went to bed and had but little rest and when we rose in the morning it proving fair and pleasant we resolved to walk to the inn where our horses were with our host for our guide when we arrived i dismissed him with another guinea and would have got immediately on horseback but don ferdinand was so very much disordered that he was not able to mount i was very much concerned for his indisposition and begged he would repose himself there while i pursued my journey with a promise to return the next day or send my servant for him he consented that it should be so and i set forward  coming to a place where several roads met i was confounded to know the right and therefore was some time at a stand not knowing which to take but hearing several voices in an adjacent barn i made up to it on foot giving my horse to my man the nearer i approached the more noise they made but i could not understand em this awakened my curiosity and i stole softly to the barn where i could observe through a crevice unseen upwards wards of twenty gypsies sitting in a huddle with a child in the midst stark naked which they were rubbing over with walnutshells and every time it cried they set up that confused noise but i was very much surpised to find in that child the features of that i had seen the night before at my country landlords i beckoned my servant to come near with my horses being armed i made to the barn door and forced it open i asked em in an imperious manner what they were doing with that child and further affirmed they had stole it from such a place giving them to understand i had people coming to apprehend em upon hearing this they all took to their heels and some i found that had come there with crutches ran very nimbly away without em but the child was left behind i now began to consider with my self what i had done and that i had gotten a child but did not know what to do with it they had rubbed the poor thing all over with the green walnutshells that made it look like one of their fraternity by good fortune they had left his clothes behind em as also some rags which i suppose were to be put on instead of the others  my man and i dressed it as well as we could and aukwardly enough but when we had finished notwithstanding my haste i resolved to go back again and enquire into this affair when we came to the inn i gave the infant to the care of the woman of the house till my return and understanding don ferdinand was gone to rest i proceeded to my hosts house without disturbing him when we arrived there i met the woman at the door pray said i to her good woman where is the child that i saw here last night where is the child returned the woman snappingly why the childs in his cradle asleep let me see it said i no said she i will not disturb it for you nor no one else i told her peremptorily i would see it that instant in spite of her for i feared some foul play she seeing me resolute and lighting from my horse well sir seeing you are so desirous said she i will go and bring it to you when she was gone i began to imagine my self mistaken and that children might be very like without being the same but i knew a guinea would soon reconcile her to my rudeness i staid waiting a considerable time taken up with several thoughts and not observing how long i had waited till my man told me the old woman was long a coming i began to call and no body answering i ordered him to go in and see for her he came out again and told me she was not in the house nor any one else but that he believed she had slipped out of the back door and got away through the garden i began to think there was something very extraordinary in the adventure of the child and resolved to be strict in the examination i entered the house my self and searched but to no purpose i sent my man in the mean time in pursuit of the woman but he returned without her there was never a neighbouringhouse to enquire no nearer than the village where i had left the child so i had just got on horseback in order to go back when i perceived the man coming toward his own house i spurred on to meet him and he seemed much concerned i seized him by the collar and told him i came to secure him for the murder of the child i saw at his house last night the man was in such a terrible fright at what i said that he was more dead than alive sure sir said he it cannot be it is not murdered i bid him produce it or he should be tried for it in short i frighted the poor fellow so much that he told me if i would have a little patience he would tell me all that he knew concerning it still crying i hope it is not murdered i told him the child was safe we went back to his house where after the fellow had a little composed himself he made me the following relation  about three years ago a gentlewoman came to my wife and made a bargain with her to keep this infant and by paying us handsomely we imagined it belonged to some person of distinction for we received ten pounds every quarter and that before it was due the lady would often take the child for a day or two and return it again my wife being a worldly woman laid several plots how to know the truth of the child but to no purpose but by all circumstances we believed the parents did not care for owning it one day my wife told me she had a design in her head but she would not disclose it till she could be sure of succeeding and when the lady came the next time to take the child away for a day as usual my wife was in conference with her for some time and when she was gone she told me that she had prevailed upon the lady to pay her one hundred pounds before hand and that she brought her to it by telling her we should make a purchase of the house we live in in short my wife who wears the breeches made me consent to carry on the deceit and the next day the lady brought the child and the hundred pound and gave it my wife without any thing under my hand and left us in a small time after when she was gone my wife discoursed me after this manner  husband we have now one hundred and fifty pounds for we had been very saving besides our goods and cattle which will fetch us one hundred more with this money we may go into my country which was the isle of man and live contentedly all our lives without any fears of bad crops and ill markets well but said i what will become of the child i quickly found by her expressions that she resolved to murder it i was struck with horror at her proposition and notwithstanding her violent temper opposed her in it and told her upon no conditions would i consent to do so barbarous a deed i found her so fixed upon the design of murder that i was at last as the lightest evil obliged to consent to her selling it to a company of gypsies but with the greatest reluctance in the world which was executed this morning but we had disposed of every thing before hand with intention to have gone for bristol two days hence for we were assured the lady would not come again for some time  when he had done i informed him how i came to meet with the child i then began to examine if he did not know where the lady lived and at last he confessed he dogged her to her house one day set on by his wife but would never discover it to her for fear of her playing some trick i prevailed with him to go with me and show me the house with the promise of a reward and letting him go afterward we set out after he had got a horse and in two hours arrived at a pleasant house surrounded by a small river and almost covered with trees i stopped some time to view it and through a little avenue saw two women gathering flowers one had her face turned toward us which the man said was the woman that used to come to see the child and that was the place she carried it to i ordered my man to take the horses to the next town about half a mile off and come to me again but i needed not have bid mine host to have gone about his business for he being fearful of the event got away without our perceiving it  when my man was gone i walked about to view the house but i had lost sight of the women and it began to rain again i stood up for shelter from the weather under a large oak and had but just got there when a woman came out of the gate with her mistresss service to invite me in i was very well pleased with the invitation and went into the house where i was met by the gentlewoman a very handsome lady she told me as i looked like a gentleman she desired i would take shelter there till the storm was over i returned her the thanks her civility deserved and we sat down but were immediately interrupted with ringing at the gate and i perceived through a small window a gentleman in a scarletcloak alight from his horse and go in quite through the house the lady begged my pardon and told me she was obliged to go keep another lady company while that person was there but would wait on me as soon as possible again as my curiosity had brought me there i had no thoughts of going away till i had satisfied it in some measure i could hear the mans voice very plain who seemed to threaten a lady with a great many hardships as to her fortune if she would not consent to his love the lady answered in so low a voice that i could not hear what she said but i found her answers did but inrage him the more they talked a great while and at last they seemed to be silent i hearing the door open stepped back into the room where the lady left me she came to me again and sat down i hope sir said she you will pardon my rudeness but i could not wait on you before madam returned i i ought to beg your pardon for taking possession of your house here who am an utter stranger to you we were interrupted in our compliments by the voice of a person that screamd out murder murder  we both ran out and she coming to the door where the noise was we found it shut and the voice still calling out for help i burst it open with my foot and with my sword in my hand ran into the room where i found the gentleman that came in the cloak endeavoring to force a lady i gave him a stroke upon the head and bid him turn about and defend himself which he did with many bitter exclamations but after several passes i had the good fortune to disarm him and he having received several wounds dropped down with loss of blood the lady he had attempted was still in a swoon and the bustle had brought several women servants into the room i retired into the chamber i came from but desired the lady to take some care of the wretch who deserved death but i wished might survive to prevent farther trouble she took my advice and sent to the next town for a surgeon who soon came and my man along with him by accident perceiving his wounds were not dangerous for i stood by while the surgeon dressed him and finding the house in too much confusion to be better informed concerning the child i was about to take my leave but the lady i had so timely rescued having recovered her fright desired she might thank me for so great a providence i was easily persuaded to stay and immediately a lady came into the room but good god what transports did i feel when in that lady i beheld every feature of my dear mrs villars our eyes were fixed upon each other and the sight of me raised such a tumult of joy in her breast that combating with her unsettled heart she fell down in a swoon again the other lady at first knew not the meaning of our disorder but when i called her my dear wife and other extravagant expressions of my love she soon guessed the truth and seemed as much transported as we were words would but wrong the sentiments we felt for each other therefore let the reader if possible guess the joy of two lovers meeting after imagining each other no longer in this world we thought it was all a dream but at last being convinced of the reality we sent privately for the parson and were tied by the outward ceremony of the church whose hearts had been divinely united long before and that night i took once more possession of what i valued above all the world could give  the next day i sent for don ferdinand to partake in our joy but was informed his indisposition had increased upon him so much that it was dangerous to remove him this was some allay to my joy for i had a real friendship for him i told my dear wife the obligation i had to his father i now desired to know the particulars of her wonderful escape which she related to me after the following manner  you know said she when we parted at mequinez our hearts foreboded something would follow prejudicial to our loves i was not acquainted with mustaphas escape if i had it is very probable i might have avoided the misfortune that befell me but he got a vessel to carry him to sallee as he informed me when i was their prisoner again and by the way met with his master hamet who wrote a letter to the governor of mammora and sent mustapha with it while he intended to wait near the coast to guard us back when they had seized me they hurried me away immediately on board a vessel and sailed upon the instant and before night met with hamet where i was carried on board he upbraided me in terms that gave me to expect worse treatment from him but i told him rather than submit to his nauseous love i would starve my self to death if i could find no other means to rid me of life the next day a storm arising of a sudden blew down one of their masts and drove em back again within sight of the port of mammora but to avoid it they ran beyond it and the storm continued in the evening it began to abate and he steered his course back again but before it was dark a ship appeared in view and notwithstanding he had lost several men in a former engagement he resolved to set upon this vessel and it growing calm he got up to her with rowing the other vessel knowing what she was began with us first and fired very briskly  the fight continued about an hour as near as i could guess for all my employment was to pray that some lucky shot would end that life which was so burdensome to me when the noise of the ordnance ceased i had not curiosity enough to go to see how affairs stood but judge my surprise and pleasure when i tell you the first man that entered the cabin was the mate that i had made captain as i mentioned to you in the relation of my first misfortune  how madam cried he is it you thank heaven my voyage is at end come madam continued he i will carry you to one that thinks her life a burden till you are safe being your danger is owing to her i had not power to return him an answer or ask him who it was he meant i was so confounded with thought he carried me on board of his own ship where he brought mrs susan to me my heart was so full of content that for a moment you had slipped out of my memory  the ship of hamets was just sinking for they had shot her between wind and water and could not come to stop it they had taken out as many of their goods as the time would permit and all the men that were wounded before she sunk i let em into your story and the mutual affection we had and in return the captain gave me the following account of their getting away from sallee  you know madam said he the moors were not very strict in searching us and i had at the first sight of em judging what they were secured all the merchants money designed for trade as well as what i had of my own about my clothes and in a great fur cap which i wore upon my head  hamet being satisfied with you and what he found besides would not sell us for slaves but gave us the liberty of walking about the town with a small allowance of provision till we could send a person to england for a thousand pounds which was the ransom of both ship and men in a little time i became acquainted with one of the jews of sallee whom i prevailed upon by the force of money to buy the ship and pay for our ransom which he did without any ones concerning themselves about it we did all we could to find you out but to no purpose so we were obliged to set sail for england  in our voyage home mrs susan informed we with your story not concealing even her own part in it and i found her so sincere in her repentance that i could not help pitying her which soon rose a softer passion and as soon as we arrived in england the ceremony of the church completed my happiness we acquainted mr kendrick your ladyships guardian and steward with your misfortune who with the advice of us fitted the ship out in your name with a sufficient quantity of money for your ransom if it were possible for us to hear of you and by meeting with you now we have compassed what we intended i returned em many thanks especially mrs susan who would accompany her husband in hopes to meet with me i desired captain morris which is the name of mrs susans husband to steer toward mammora but he told me it was not safe for as there was a war proclaimed between france and england the ambassador could not answer it if he did not make us prize and we were further informed by one of the renegado prisoners that he was very well assured they were sailed for france  upon this notice we directed our course with this hope that you would soon arrive in england and find me out for i remembered in the story of my misfortunes i gave you marks enough to let you know where i was to be found before we made the english coast i found my self with child and the very imagination had like to have cost me my life for fear the father of the unborn infant would not come time enough to save my credit for though i was well assured of your honor yet i knew the censuring world would be apt to blame my conduct i could hide nothing from the faithful susan who joined her fears with mine  when we came into bristol channel i consulted with susan about my management and i at last resolved to live private till i could hear some news of you but i was obliged to let mr kenderick my steward into the knowledge of my arrival though he was a stranger to my condition  i sent to london in hopes of hearing some news of you but having kept the name of your uncle a secret in your relation our endeavors proved fruitless  my melancholy increased with my condition and for fear of a discovery i went into wales with a relation of mrs susans and was delivered of a boy that proved the greatest comfort to my sinking heart for in his face was every feature of his dear father i brought him back again here and had him put to nurse as a child to a relation of mrs susans and had resolved but this very day to have sent for him home that i might always have the satisfaction of having him in my sight  my steward finding i was under a necessity of living private began to talk to me of love and often proceeded so far after finding i disdained his passion to tell me if i would not consent to make him my husband he would take care my estate should come into his hands though i could have soon broke his designs as to my fortune yet my solitary dwelling pleased me so well that i gave him good words which did but more encourage his insolence till it arrived to that pitch you so happily delivered me from  i soon found by my wifes relation that the infant i had so marvellously saved was our own child when i related the accident of meeting with the child my wife expressed so much feat terror tenderness and joy that i thought the different passions would have taken away her understanding by this we may learn there is a ruling providence that regulates every action of our lives when they tend to virtue  mr kendrick the person that made the attempt upon my wife was soon informed of our happy meeting and his wounds mending every day he begged we would favor him with a visit which we complied with where he asked pardon for all past offenses in such a sincere manner that we were easily prevailed upon to forgive him  he sent for all the books of accounts and writings that belonged to my wifes estate and delivered em up to us  the same day captain morris arrived from france where he went by the desire of my wife as her last hope to know if he could gain any intelligence of me he was so very diligent in his commission that he got to the speech of monsieur de st olon who informed him of my pursuing the vessel and returning and of my voyage to italy i rewarded him by several handsome presents for his trouble and found in all his actions a downright blunt sincere honesty which drew me into a friendship for him i now began to think of don ferdinands illness and resolved to go with my wife to make him a visit and my dear wife was so impatient to embrace the child she would not let me stay to finish my affairs with mr kendrick  as we were upon our journey we were met by a relation of mine son to that barbarous uncle that had kidnapd me he was in the country when i arrived at london notwithstanding the injury i had suffered from his father i could not help receiving him with the utmost affection for we were both of an age and very like as to our persons being brought up together till the death of my father which created a friendship for each other  he brought me a packet from italy and in it one enclosed from don jaques sent from st salvaldor i broke open that first which was as follows  i hope the distance of climates has had no force upon your friendship mine here has rather received an addition though i am overwhelmed with a very great misfortune my daughter in whom all my hopes centered is i fear entirely lost for the very day you left us was the last time my eyes beheld her we have some reason to fear the relations of the person who died by your sword have used some clandestine means and perhaps have privately murdered her to be revenged on us for that accident though of their own seeking in short i am weary of the hateful place and shall do my endeavor to seek repose in some other part of the world and relying upon your goodnatured friendship i hope to have the honor very shortly after your receiving this to embrace you in england for i am preparing to leave st salvador with the soonest i received your obliging letter and the bales of goods all in good condition but there is something dark in it or at least my understanding cannot reach this paragraph and be assured whatever you gave me in charge etc i sent you nothing but what i hope you will accept as your own and i took the manner of leaving em with you knowing your generous temper would not have been easily persuaded to have accepted em from one that shall ever subscribe himself  your sincere friend and servant jaques de ramires p s my wife who is inconsolable throws in her love and service and all the hopes she has left is the expectation of telling you face to face the grief she lies under at her fatal loss and to bring us farther in your debt we beg you will leave us sufficient direction among our countrymen at your exchange where we may find you     i was very much concerned at my friends misfortune especially in believing i was in some sort the mistaken cause of it i had informed my wife of the adventure before and she condold with me and the thoughts of being so near the same distress in her own child redoubled her grief when we had given up some time to those melancholy reflections i broke open the following letter from don antonio  my dear friend we received yours with the utmost transports but as i am an italian i ought to be jealous at the joy my wife expressed when she read it and much more when she now declares that she will come to england to reproach you for the little care you took of her commission she will farther to increase my jealousy write you her sentiments her self but let her say what she will there i am resolved to esteem you as the only friend that is dear to  antonio de alvares   the other letter from isabella contained these words  sir i will suspend my reproaches till i see you which i hope will be soon i had no commission to be executed in those papers you lost but that of having cleared the aspersion you cast on our sex of inconstancy which you had some grounds for in the sudden marriage of don pedro and donna felicia after her violent passion for don ferdinand when i found the cause of her distemper i as having felt the keenest dart of love pitied her pain and therefore taxed don ferdinand often with his wearing an obdurate heart in his bosom i pressed him so often that he desired to meet donna felicia and my self in my closet we came according to appointment where he spoke to this effect madam tax me no more with hardness of heart for if i had not a very tender one i had never arrived here and to discover my frailty at once know i am a woman and upon that undiscovering her bosom gave us evident tokens we were both so very much surpised that she went on with her discourse i beg ladies you will never open your mouth to my captain concerning this for the moment i am sensible he knows my weakness shall be the last of my life but notwithstanding this injunction i cannot help informing you in pity to her and i am well assured as your passion is hopeless you have humanity enough not to destroy one who dies for you and nothing in this world can equal my joy if i find when i arrive don ferdinand the wife to one who shall ever have the friendship of  isabella de alvares   what words can express the amazement i felt at the reading this last letter my thoughts were confounded in thought and a chaos of ideas possessed my brain i was in so much confusion that i thought of returning home again to consider of this strange turn recollected circumstances convinced me how blind i was in not discovering it sooner my soul was immediately filled with the most tender pity and i had not the use of words to declare my sentiments to my wife and cousin sometimes i would imagine it was all a fictitious dream yet at last i was not displeased that i had it in my power to restore to don jaques his long lost daughter my wife was as much concerned as i was and my cousin could hardly believe it i soon found that she had taken care the packet should not fall into my hands and that convinced me she would not have her disguise discovered the next day we resolved to visit her and form my resolution from my observation  when we arrived at the inn we found her dressed at a table with paper pens and ink before her but very weak i presented my wife and cousin to her she saluted em and seemed mightily pleased with my good fortune and was very much concerned her indisposition would not admit her waiting on me to partake in my contentment her weakness was so prevalent that she could hardly utter her words she knew nothing of receiving the packet from my cousin but after we had sat some time i gave her the letter from her father which as soon as she had read she fell backward upon the bed in a swoon  the noise we made at this accident brought several people into the room and among the rest my landlady who it seems had fell desperately in love with her as imagining her to be a man she made such awkward complainings that if our minds had been at ease would have produced much mirth but among her actions she unbuttond her clothes to give her breath and soon discovered her mistake in the object of her wishes when she found by her breasts that she was a woman she ran down stairs with the utmost precipitation and left us alone to recover her when we had brought her to her senses again she soon found that we had discovered her sex and the grief and shame at the accident had like to have thrown her again into her swooning it was some time before we could bring her to her self but she found by my discourse that i understood the whole secret  after a long pause said she i did not intend to let my frailty be known to you till after my death but since it is discovered i beg you will have some regard to my memory and i shall die contented i begged her not to talk of death but live to comfort her grieved parents it is too late said she to talk of any comfort for i have called my greatest friend death to my aid who is just now arrived upon uttering these words a deadly paleness possessed her face and trembling seized her limbs she had just strength enough to declare to us that she had taken a dose of poison provided for the occasion bought of an apothecary of the town and that she was just going to write a letter to me but was prevented by our sudden appearance whose contents were only to see her secretly buried and if possible to have concealed her sex and story from the world she had hardly made an end before her speech forsook her and life in all appearance fled the beauteous dwelling my wife was not present at this accident being her eager desire had carried her to her child but she came in before it was over my cousin seemed more oppressed with grief than any of us for love had taken full possesson of his heart  while sorrow had locked up all our tongues the apothecary came in in a strange confusion for the report had soon dispersed it self all over that little village sir said he to me dont be concerned at the condition you see the gentleman in for he is not dead he has only took a sleeping potion i partly guessed his design when he applied to me for poison and the extraordinary price he paid for it convinced me it was for some sinister design and therefore i happily imposed upon him  this news revived us all again especially my cousin who i thought would have gone distracted for joy and to see his impatient watching for her lifes return if we may call it so only gave me further proof that one look is sufficient to fix love for ever in the soul the apothecary during this interval of life and death poured cordials into her mouth to help the operation and at last she opened her unwilling eyes and gazed around her as if she had been in another world but we soon convinced her of the apothecarys deceit at which she seemed in the utmost confusion and gave us to understand that life was forced upon her against her inclination and she would shake it off  we gave her all the comfort we were capable of and my wife told her if she talked any longer of death it was only that she could not bear to see us happy this as it were roused her from her lethargy well then said she i will live if it be only to convince you that i am pleased to see my captain blessed for she would always call me so after we had a little composed her we left her with my cousin to look after our child who was in the same place which had proved the secret instinct of nature for at the first sight in the house of his unnatural nurse i could not help feeling a tender regard for him when we had satisfied our inn we prevailed upon donna bianca now no longer ferdinand to come into the coach with us and we arrived that evening at bristol where we took possession of the house which captain kendrick had lived in that belonged to my wife we staid some time there to settle my wifes affairs and as much to recover donna biancas indisposition  my cousin by his assiduity gained very much of her esteem but she freely declared she had no room in her heart for love but notwithstanding with much importunity we prevailed upon her to accept him for a husband and her esteem soon came up to a more tender passion as soon as the ceremony was over we took a journey to london to settle our affairs there and provide for my expected guests  one morning as we were pursuing our journey coming near the skirts of a wood we heard several groans which alarmed us but as we had too many people about us armed to sear any thing we came out of the coach to know the reason where we found a woman weltring in blood being stabbed in several places with a sword when i came to take a nearer view i found it was my former master the watchmakers wife i could not help having compassion for any person in that condition therefore ordered her to be taken up and put in the coach donna bianca opened her breast and stopped her wounds as well as she could till we could get a surgeon that i had ordered to be sent for she soon knew me and cried out sure heaven has sent you that know my guilt to be witness of my repentance the wrongs i have done my husband have pursued me to my grave when i had robbed him of all i could lay my hands on i made my escape to ireland changed my name and set up for a greater fortune than i really was i had many suitors but heaven to punish me made me place my affections on a person that courted me for my money and though i soon understood he had but very little estate yet love prevailed with me to make him my husband he soon spent both his own and my fortune and by contracting many debts was forced to fly for england and finding no relief took to the highway where he has committed many robberies he lodged me in a neighboring village but our place of meeting was generally in this wood for fear of a discovery this morning he came according to appointment where he began his discourse after this manner i had no inclination for you when i first married you but now i utterly abhor you therefore am resolved to part with you but i have another reason besides my hatred to you which is this i have it in my power to marry an old woman very rich and therefore it is necessary to send you out of the world for fear our marriage should come to her ears and spoil my fortune he followed his discourse with these wounds which he gave me and rode into the wood without my once offering to open my mouth for astonishment had tied up my tongue i told her i hoped heaven had given her all its punishment in this world that is all the hope i have said she and in my unfeigned repentance for i feel death approaching we observed she was just expiring and before the surgeon came she gave up her last breath calling upon heaven for mercy i gave orders for her funeral and sent after her murderer but to no purpose but i heard he was taken for the highway some time after and executed at worcester where he confessed the murder of his wife thus we see the hand of heaven though slow in punishments yet always overtakes the guilty when i had given directions for her funeral we pursued our journey and arrived safe at london  don antonio and his lady arrived first in a private capacity not caring to make a show according to their birth to be taken notice of and in a few days after came don jaques and his lady in a ship of their own in company with the isabella which my lieutenant commanded that had sprung a leak which obliged her to put into lisbon to refit where don jaques joyfully met with her  i had desired donna bianca once more to put on her boys clothes for i intended agreeably to surprise her parents  i was obliged to take lodgings for don jaquess family being they intended to take a convenient house in the city as soon as mutual caresses were over grief again took possession of their souls for the loss of their child after condoling with em some time i begged em to hope for the best and that it was possible to hear of her again they shook their heads and told me that thought was long given over and they had no hope but in time to wear away their unhappy loss  i told em i had a kinsman as much as i could remember the features of their beautiful daughter as like her as a man could be like a woman they expressed a great desire to see him i told em i had invited him with another relation to sup with us on purpose we had taken care before that donna bianca should ombre her face and speak nothing but english on purpose to carry on the deceit till the time of their coming we spent in relating our accidents in the voyage i told em how much i was surpised at the likeness of my cousin to their daughter for i had given em to understand it was a relation i had never seen before i left england which was truth  when the time i had appointed came donna bianca and my cousin entered i presented em to don jaques and his wife as my relations and they saluted em as utter strangers but when they saw and heard donna bianca they burst into tears at the great resemblance in both voice and features as they said to their daughter she carried it on as long as she could speaking english all the while but at last their tears prevailed so much upon her tenderness that she begged leave to retire but would return immediately i made an apology for my kinsman to don jaques and his wife and told em he would return in a very little time the space of their absence was filled with sighs and tears and as i knew their grief would soon be over i never attempted to comfort em  when they were ready they sent a servant to tell me a gentleman wanted to speak with me i retired and came in again immediately and told em our company would be increased for another relation and his wife were just coming in to sup with us and upon the instant my cousin entered leading by the hand donna bianca they both ran and kneeled down before don jaques and his wife at the sight of their daughter the mother fell backward in the chair in a swoon and don jaques was in such a surprise that he could not open his mouth but expressed his joy by tears kisses and embraces and his lady coming to her self had like to have stifled her with her transports  they did not ask any reasonable questions till the torrent of their joy was poured out after the first transports were over donna bianca told her own story she said the first time i dined at their house in st salvador love flew into her heart and knowing the modesty due to her sex she was resolved never to discover it till she found the state of mine yet finding her passion daily increase and understanding the day of my departure she procured secretly the habit of a man with all other necessaries and conveyed herself on board in the boat that carried the presents her father had sent me and counterfeited the letter she gave me as from her father every thing answered my wish said she but i soon found my captain had no heart to bestow it is needless to tell how many bitter sighs and tears that knowledge cost me but it is now buried in oblivion then she proceeded to beg their pardon for her rash folly as she called it and they were too much overjoyed not to forgive her every thing and they expressed a great deal of satisfaction in that they could now call me their relation we lived in all the contentment imaginable returning heaven our grateful thanks for its bounteous mercy and now i am settled i will take leave of my reader with this couplet of the poet o never let a virtuous mind despair for constant hearts are loves peculiar care   the voyage shipwreck and miraculous escape of richard castelman gent with a description of pensylvania and the city philadelphia etc  printed in the year mdccxxvi  the voyage etc of richard castelman gent the dangers at sea are certainly more imminent than those on shore even in the fairest weather the space is very small between this world and the next  a grecian philosopher was in my opinion much in the right when asked by a friend if he would go to a neighboring island in the hellespont to hunt answered if he should be guilty of so much folly he should have no other hope but of returning safe back for those that trusted their lives to the sea ventured with a changing mistress  i embarked on board captain cox bound for charlestown in carolina with mr jones and his family and arrived safe there without any great hazard just when captain moor had made a descent upon the spaniards of st augustine a plantation to the southward of carolina and returned with considerable booty by some of the colony his proceedings were censured with injustice being the spaniards had not any notice of the rupture between england and spain but all stratagems are lawful in war  some time after the spaniards resenting the usage of the english fitted out five sail of men of war and several transports to repay them in their own coin  they landed eight hundred men in the bay and sent two trumpeters to sir nathaniel johnson at that time governor of charlestown to surrender but he sent em word back as the place was entrusted to him by the queen his mistress he was resolved to hold it out to the last the messengers informed their admiral of sir nathaniels resolution and likewise added that the town was too well manned to be easily taken he thought better on it recalled his men and sailed away  this attempt very much alarmed the country and put em upon fortifying charlestown which at present may laugh at all attempts from a foreign foe or the native indians who used before to infest em daily  charlestown or charles city the capital of carolina is situated upon a neck of land formed by a river on each side named ashley and cooper rivers from the first plantations well stored with fish there was when i was there but an indifferent wooden church but before i left the place subscriptions were taken in to build a regular stone building there are upwards of a thousand houses very neatly built with gardens almost to every house there is plenty of every thing for the life of man to be found at charlestown it lies in    degrees  0 min northern latitude the trade of this place is more considerable for its bigness than any other plantation in america it being the southermost settlement belonging to the crown of england upon the continent and i have been informed they have dealings three hundred leagues up the country which is very much facilitated by the numerous navigable rivers that come from the mountains the climate is very wholesome though most europeans have at their first arrival the distemper of the country which proceeds from change of air and diet yet i had the good fortune to escape with a swelled arm which had like to have ended in the mortification of a finger but i was happily cured by the care and advice of madam rhett the only good surgeon on the place though were i to enumerate her other good qualities my small tract would exceed in bulk my intentions i shall only say another dacter may be found in america  i staid at charlestown upwards of eight months and was well entertained by the courteous inhabitants for i must own pleasure as well as profit induced me to travel though i have no inclination that way now  mr jones the person concerned with me in trade was obliged to go to bermuda being secretary and provostmarshal of the summerislands and in a short time after i followed with his family we met with no other accident than a large shark that followed our vessel several days together and the master told me he was well assured some one on board would die i laughed at his superstition and endeavored to rally him out of it but he still persisted in his opinion when the shark appeared first every body was in good health but in three days time a woman passenger expired of a fever whom we committed to the waves and was probably entombed in the bowels of the shark for he took his leave of us the same day the master told me he had made it his observation for several years and was never once out it is not impossible but the shark at sea has the same instinct as the vulture at land  when i arrived at st georges the capital of bermudas i was as well pleased with the climate and inhabitants as i was at carolina  st georges town is seated in the bottom of a bay of the same name and is very well fortified it contains about two hundred houses with a church something handsomer than that of charlestown the incumbent was the reverend mr holland a person of a good understanding i had a present an antelopes foot set in gold for a tobaccostopper which i was to deliver to the bishop of bangor his patron but it was lost among my other things in my shipwreck  there is a perpetual spring to be observed in these islands and the old leaves never drop before they are thrust out by new ones their fruit is in blossoms buds and ripe at the same time the air is generally temperate and innubilous but now and then troubled with violent thunder and lightning and i have been shown several rocks that they say were split by lightning  i was informed by a gentleman that had coasted along these islands that their number amounts to     but above  00 of them deserve no other name than rocks and most of the others that are inhabited have not above half a dozen houses upon them  the soil of all the cultivated islands is alike being very fruitful and some people imagine they were once joined making one entire island but were divided as they are now by the innovation of the sea and what gives them ground for this opinion is that the waves daily lessen the small ones but this is only conjecture  i am sorry to say that the former inhabitants gained much by pirates and even some that had large plantations when i was there were little better at first than searobbers  the late queen being informed of it ordered mr larkins with a commission to try pirates wherever they resorted in her dominions in america i happened to be at bermuda when he arrived there he acquainted the people in power with his commission but met with a very cold reception from em but however he proceeded in his design and issued out warrants to seize the suspected persons mr jones as provostmarshal was obliged to execute the warrants but he met with resistance every where and was very ill used by some of them even to the hazard of his life  the governor whose name was bennet as he represented the monarch of england should have assisted mr jones and mr larkins but whether he was afraid of offending the inhabitants or not enquiring truly into the matter mr jones and mr larkins were seized and committed to prison mr jones first made his escape and arrived safe in england where he set forth his case and had all the redress he desired he was ordered back and reinstated in his former post  those that opposed him i am informed had reprimanding letters from england upon his account but when hate is fixed in the minds of some men it is never to be rooted out their animosities rose as high as ever and he was once more obliged to abandon the island there is now depending a suit in law between the governor and mr jones who are both in england and there is no doubt but justice will take place  mr larkins was put into the dungeon of the prison and it was the common report he was denied even food to sustain life and would have certainly expired for want if he had not made his escape in the habit of a woman with the assistance of a true friend which is hard to find any where but more especially among the men of power in america but his confinement had so worn him and he had contracted so many distempers by his illusage that he expired in his voyage home  as i said before this island was in former times the common receptacle for pirates and indeed their chiefest gain proceeded from trading with them here they came to spend what money they got and recreate themselves it lying very convenient for em between    and    degrees of n latitude and  00 leagues from the continent or any other island  among their trees the cedar is the most plentiful which they use even for firing i have seen vessels of a hundred ton built with cedar and most of the houses are composed of the same  the laws should be the same as those in england but power is generally chief judge in america yet if a person never comes under the lash of the superior there is very comfortable living at bermuda  mr jones capt bayley and my self had jointly bought a vessel of about   0 ton and we had got in all our freight but tobacco which we were to take in at virginia and then make up with the fleet for england while we were fitting out our vessel mr jones was employed in his own affairs therefore the care of his share was committed to me  we set sail from bermuda april      0 with a fair gale which continued till we lost sight of the islands but in the night a contrary wind sprang up and blowing very fresh at n n e carried us to the southward of the bermudas and it was the greatest providence in the world we were not stavd upon the rocks but with great difficulty we got clear of them being obliged to ply it to windward three days  we had the misfortune to find our ship none of the best sailors yet in four days we got in our proper latitude and the wind continuing pretty fair we made very good way we had no other diversion than taking dolphins with our fizgig but in my opinion it is but indifferent food  we were forty one including passengers and many of those being sick with the rocking of the ship made it uncomfortable living among them and i wished my self once more on shore  april    we were alarmed at sight of a vessel we discovered which we imagined to be a spanish privateer we crowded all the sail we could to avoid her which would have been very hard to do if immediately after the wind had not changed to s s e a very strong gale we bore away before it and ere night lost sight of her  as we were at supper in the cabin a son of capt bayleys came and told his father that the color of the water was changed but his father reprimanded him and told him he had lost his senses for it was impossible to be near any shore when the sea changes its color it is an evident token land is not far off we continued the same course under a foresail but our terror and surprise was not to be expressed when in the morning watch the captain who being upon deck discovered land right ahead came down into my cabin and with tears in his eyes desired i would rise i knew by his looks something extraordinary was the matter and got upon deck to be resolved for capt bayley had not power to utter a word i soon found the danger for i perceived we were in view of virginia near ronoke sandbanks we did all that was in our power to weather em but our ship having a round head she would not obey the helm therefore we all agreed to make in for the land hoping as it seemed a bold shore it was tide of flood and then we might through providence land safe but it proving tide of ebb we bulgd upon the ronoke sandbanks but by lightning the ship and cutting our masts by the board we got clear of that but keeping still in for the shore we struck upon the second sandbank but not very violently so we threw out our anchors in hopes we might ride out the tide but the wind increasing we dragged em and were violently thrown upon another sandbank where our ship stuck and the waves dashed over us we had several women with children on board and their dismal cries pierced my very heart we ordered the boat out to see if we could gain the shore that way i jumped into her one of the first but ere we could leave the side of the ship she was stavd in pieces all we could do in this exigence was get into the ship again and with much difficulty we compassed it being dragged in by main force yet if i had not held fast hold by the coat of one that was in the water with me and the foot of another i must have inevitably perished for i was under the keel when i had got footing upon deck i fetched my box out of my cabin and was for securing my money which amounted to fifty pound while i was busying my self with uncording my box the captains sister reprimanded me for thinking on my money when all their lives were in danger i must own other thoughts had been more suitable to my condition therefore i was ashamed of what i was about and had no other regard than to assist in saving our selves it proved a fruitless labor in endeavoring to get off the vessel therefore we laid aside all hopes of saving the cargo  we had two blacks on board that belonged to capt bayley that were excellent diverse for the surge was so violent no one could stem the billows but by diving who offered to get with a rope on shore and fasten it from the ship to a stump of a tree and divine providence had so ordered it there was not any thing like a tree for half a mile on each side of us i told the captain it looked like a good omen and by the help of god i did not doubt but we should get safe on shore  the negroes with much difficulty did as they had intended and by the help of the rope came back to the ship capt bayley his wife and mate ventured into the water first upon the awning of the ship and got safe on shore though it broke as soon as they were landed but my ears are even pierced this moment with the cries of his poor children that were in the ship which was more terrible to me than the storm i offered to help em upon the rope but they were in such frights and terrors that i could not prevail upon em to venture  two of the sailors got upon the rope just as i was going to venture and with their bustling had very near thrown me once more into the sea i offered my assistance to the capains sister but she was as timorous as the children and fed her self with vain hopes that the waves would leave em by degrees and they might with less danger get on shore i took my leave of all that were on board and recommending them and my self to the care of heaven i got into the water and laid fast hold on the rope and with the assistance of one of the negroes got some distance from the ship but the waves drove back with such an impetuosity that i was many times in danger of losing my hold and so be carried into the main sea which had certainly came to pass if i had not been assisted by the black for every time a great sea was coming to break over us he would cry out for the lords sake master hold fast and whenever he called to me i settled my self to receive the force of the waves which would as often overwhelm me and i poured out my prayers to god for his assistance at last with much struggling i could feel my feet touch the ground sometimes and by degrees with the utmost difficulty got footing and at every retire of the waves set my self to running when they drove back upon the shore i seized upon the rope or otherwise i had been dashed to pieces on the sand but at last my strength began to fail me with the violent fatigue i had undergone and if the negro had not dragged me on the sands whose strength also was almost gone i must after all my strugglings for life have resigned my self to the waves  as soon as i could recover my spirits i gave the divine creator of all things thanks for my wonderful delivery from the jaws of death which was still more wonderful for as soon as i had let go the rope some other persons venturing the same way it broke so that not one of the unfortunate wretches came on shore but were swallowed up by the waves  awhile after i had got on shore captain bayley his wife and the mate came down to me and informed me that they could find no road nor any inhabitants this news renewed our griefs for we seemed to be in as much danger of starving now as of drowning before and to increase our dread it was not above three hours to night and then we had the wild bears to fear  while we were lamenting our condition we heard somebody hollow up in the woods which revived our drooping senses but running to see who it was we much to our grief found it to be one of the sailors that escaped who was hollowing to his companion and they were both as drunk as twas possible for them to be with rum before they left the ship such beasts are some sailors that even the greatest dangers will not deter them from drinking if they have an opportunity  when we were all together that is the captain his wife and mate two white sailors two negroes and my self we resolved to walk to the southward to see if it were possible to find any habitations but in less than an hour our journey was stopped by an impenetrable wood and we were obliged to return  we then went northward but were interrupted by large swamps and not the least mark of any plantation thus maroond as we were we went back again and could perceive the poor wretches in the vessel lifting up their hands to us for succor but we could neither give em assistance or comfort i made em signs to let em know our condition was as bad as theirs and that they had nothing to think on but heaven  it growing near night some of the poor creatures ventured into the water but were soon drowned in short every object we beheld increased our horror none of us had eat or drank for two days besides our fatigue though quite cast down my self i endeavored to cheer my fellow sufferers and that we might be sheltered from the inclemency of the night which to add to our wretched condition proved a rainy one we by joint consent and labor while the day lasted plucked down a good number of palmetoe leaves and with pieces of trees which we tore for we had never a knife among us built us up a hut and sheltered it from the weather as well as we could  the palmetoe leaf is very large and the same that they make the plaited straw of which forms the finest hats that come from bermuda and carolina it was a very melancholy reflection to think of our condition nothing to lie upon but the bare wet ground and our clothes that covered us were those upon our backs dropping with rain and salt water no food nor hopes of getting any and i was even ready to expire with thirst while the hut was preparing to allay my drouth i stole by my self urind in my tobaccobox and drank it with as great a gusto as ever i have done french claret before or since  when i came to lie down in our wretched tenement the place was full but i even laid my self down upon em and though a woman was among us had no thoughts of different sexes and by degrees made room for my self notwithstanding their complaining of legs and arms i held my tongue and maugre all my wants and misfortunes slept soundly till morning but with the day reflection returned sharpened with the extremest hunger  when we had got all together again that is seven of us for one of the drunken sailors was found dead some distance from our cabin as we might well imagine with cold and want and spoiled an excellent proverb that drunken men never get any harm by my advice we addressed our selves to the allseeing power for succor all but the mate who told us that praying alone would not do therefore while we prayed he would go seek after our extempore orisons were over we rose up and resolved to go into the woods to gather if it was possible something to kill our hunger but as we turned toward the beach we saw the mate with another man a stranger to us coming toward us the dove could not be a more pleasing sight to the patriarch noah when he returned with the olive branch in his mouth than that stranger was to us we ran with all the speed which our weak condition would admit of to meet him under his arm he had got a little tub of butter that the sea had thrown up and though mixed with sand and gravel we as greedily devoured it as if it had been partridge or pheasant but our misfortune was when we had tired our selves with eating for i cannot say we were satisfied we all of us grew sick and cast it up again  the stranger to relieve us gave us a couple of limes among us which we greedily devoured and to the butter again but what was a pleasing surprise to us our mate informed us a puncheon of fresh water was thrown on shore we eagerly ran and my tobaccobox served us instead of a cup the mate who had slakd his thirst before would not let us drink too much for fear of endangering our lives but with this indifferent repast we recovered our fainting spirits and were more able to bear the fatigue of the day  our vessel was drove close on shore but broke in many pieces and it was a melancholy sight to behold the dead bodies covering the sand but what had almost killed capt bayley and his wife with sorrow were the bodies of his sister and one of his children half buried in the sands for my own part i had no other thing to grieve for but the loss of my cargo which consisted of cotton indigo and straw ware which if it had arrived safe to england would have yielded to my own share fifteen hundred pound though the loss of my harpsichord and italian timbrel i most regretted whose remains i discovered upon the shore and the whole strand was covered with bermuda hats some we picked up and among other pieces of the wreck the mate discovered my box floating on the surface which by good fortune he dragged on shore in it was my money linen and books of accounts we kept this private from the stranger and buried it in a place i had marked by several observations for he had given us to understand it was his usual custom after a violent storm to come to the sandbanks in expectation of shipwrecks therefore we were not assured he might not find means to destroy us in hopes of what we had on shore or leave us without assisting us to some plantation  when we had done all we could about our wreck we took leave of the miserable sight and set forward to the strangers plantation which was about ten miles off he led us along the woods by certain marks on trees which we were ignorant of but the inhabitants know how to find one anothers plantations by those marks and in four hours for i had my watch in my pocket when i was shipwrecked we once more beheld the pleasing sight of a chimney smoking which was the habitation of our guide you may imagine the joy we had to enter once more into a house after our miserable hardships but when we came there we found but indifferent accommodation there were no other eatables to be got but a little hung beef and humminy that is indian corn ground mixed with milk and dried before the fire but this was feasting to us for hunger is the best sauce  there were but two beds in the house which the family complimented us with the captain and his wife had one and mr burnam and i had the other  i deferred going for my box till the second day after our arrival for i was very much out of order with the fatigue i had underwent and by lying on the wet ground i had lost my hearing which i did not recover thoroughly till my arrival in england  the mate two negroes and my self set out with one to guide us to the place of our shipwreck but we were so long in looking for my box that we were ready to give over all search but just as we were thinking of returning the mate happily found it out  the negroes took it by turns and we brought it safe to the plantation  i had a good parcel of linen in it which i lent to my fellow sufferers but it was an odd sight to discover so many scarecrows with tattered coats and fine ruffled shirts on  our host was very well satisfied for our entertainment with what he found of the wreck  we staid here five days to refresh our selves and then resolved to go up the river to wait on colonel carew deputy governor of north carolina a gentleman i had the honor of being acquainted with we hired a canoo with two sails and embarked capt baily his wife the mate two blacks and the sailor with another from the plantation to assist us we sailed up ronoke sound with a fresh gale and at seven aclock the next morning stopped at colonel carews plantation who out of his known courtesy entertained us very handsomely we took our leaves and at eight aclock the same evening came before the governors house situate on the river notaway which runs into the ronoke about fifty leagues from the sea  i sent up one of the men to acquaint the governor i was come to wait on him and upon the instant he came down to the shore accompanied by capt cratbach a native of bermuda island and one i had long been acquainted with he had left bermuda since we came away and the governor and he had just been wishing i had escaped the storm as the messenger came to him  as soon as ever he saw me he cried out i am sorry for your misfortune i can easily perceive an ill wind drove you hither he would not suffer us to talk much but hurried the whole company into his dining room where stood a supper and a bowl of punch with several genlemen his guests he begged their pardon but told em they should neither eat nor drink before we had satisfied our selves and we soon cleared what was put before us and then another supper was provided for the whole company which we had our shares of notwithstanding what we had eaten before  the governor was but ill provided with beds therefore capt bayley and his wife went to mr glovers a neighboring gentleman and the secretary would have me home with him about a mile from the governors when we came to his house we found a quarter of a shote a young hog and a turkey on the table i sat down once more and made a hearty supper and i must own i never thought i should bring my stomach to its proper tone again after we had drank very heartily we went to bed the next morning we breakfasted upon broiled fowls and chocolate  my readers if any i hope will not ridicule my taking notice so often of eating till they put themselves in my starved condition  the next day we went to dine with a friend of the secretarys and as we were at dinner a messenger came from the governor and capt bayley to inform me a vessel was going that instant for kakatan a harbor where the virginia fleet make up and with the convoy set sail all together for england and that capt bayley and the rest of my unfortunate company waited on board for me notwithstanding my stomach i was obliged to make all the dispatch i could to the place where the vessel lay but to my great misfortune the wind proving fair for them they were obliged to take the advantage and when i arrived at the port they were almost out of sight i was very much concerned at this loss of my passage for it was very probable i might not get such another opportunity till the fleet was gone and then i should be obliged to stay till next year  the governor seeing me so much concerned offered me his horse to go to kakatan by land about   0 leagues from the place where we were and he procured me a guide an honest quaker who for ten pieces of eight agreed to accompany me and bring the governors horse back again  we set out immediately for i had no luggage to carry because capt bayley as imagining i would come time enough had got all my things on board  we rode that day about twenty mile through unfrequented woods but my guide knew the way by the abovementioned marks upon trees we came to a quakers plantation and all the compliments my guide used to him was only this friend i have brought along with me a shipwrecked gentleman who is going to kakatan and desires a lodging tonight who was answered by our new host friend come in thou art welcome and indeed he made his words good for we had plenty of every thing and a handsome apartment to lie in the best in the house i was very much pleased with his conversation for i found him a man of a sound understanding  in the morning when i was going i offered to pay him for what i had but he seemed much offended at my proposition said he my house is no inn and we see strangers so very seldom that they are always welcome when they come and god forbid that i should lessen the store of an unfortunate man like thy self in short this is the treatment i met with in my six days travel hospitality is commendable in all countries and england was once famous for it but it seems at present banished to america the third day my horse tumbled with me into a deep swamp and i was not only in danger of drowning but of having my brains dashed out with his hoofs in his floundering i continued so long in this condition that i gave my self up for lost for my guide could not come to assist me without being in the same danger at last my horse with much struggling got foot on firm ground by good fortune i had got hold of the stirrup and he drew me up with him to the great joy of my guide who gave me for gone  you must imagine i was not very easy in the rest of my days journey which i was obliged to ride all covered with water and mud but our host where we lay at night got all my things clean and dry by the time i rose in the morning  our first four days we traveled through vast woods without seeing any humane creature but at the plantations where we dined and supped and our stages were very different sometimes more than twenty mile asunder and at other times not above seven monstrous snakes i saw of different kinds but none attempted to come near us till the fifth day when as we were riding along my horse gave a start and ran on with me five hundred yards before i could stop him i turned about and saw a rattlesnake of a monstrous bulk spring at my guide who happened at that time to be behind me and it was very well he was for if i had been in his place i should certainly have met with death in not knowing how to avoid it  their manner of springing upon any thing is this they fold themselves up in rings then clap their tail to the ground and dart upon their prey but as they are some time in doing it a person may avoid em who knows their manner  there is but one way to cure the bite of these venomous creatures and that is to apply immediately the fundament of a fowl to the wound and keep it there till it be dead which does not always happen if the fowl dies there is hope of a cure but if it does not all the physicians in the world cannot help you my guide told me this was one of the largest he had ever seen i believe it was near six yards in length and as thick as a lusty mans thigh it is very rare for em to come so near the roads but this being little frequented perhaps was the reason of it the rattle which is in their tail makes an odd sort of a noise when i was at philadelphia a gentleman showed me the rattle it was about a yard and a half long in small joints covered with a thin transparent skin like your white goldbeaters skin they say they have a joint grows every year but i cannot tell who can prove it the rattle as it lay folded in my hand seemed so light that if i had not seen it there i could not have perceived it by the weight  the last days journey was one of the pleasantest i had ever traveled in my life in a fine sweet road shaded by trees for many miles together and through em on each side numerous plantations with a well cultivated glebe the whole prospect put me in mind of the vale of evesham in england  the sixth night i lay at the fathers of my guide having one days journey more to reach kakatan mr ratcliff the name of my guides father was owner of a handsome plantation upon james river and there were so many about it that it looked like a little town  the next day after my arrival being sunday there was a general assembly of the brethren and most of the elders dined with mr ratcliff when dinner was served they began in their usual manner with their long graces and when one had made an end another rose up to begin but mr ratcliff begged upon my account that they would for once abridge the motion of the spirit and let it take its full scope for an aftergrace  we had notice from kakatan that the fleet would not sail for some time so i staid with my friendly quaker four days who treated me very generously i called for his son to dismiss him back to the governor with the horses as i was paying him the money i agreed for his father coming in by accident was very angry with him and declared he would disown him for his child if he took a penny i was not at all pleased with the refusal for the poor man had taken a great deal of pains with me wherefore meeting by chance with four yards of muslin to be sold i bought it and made him a present of it unknown to his father though i had some difficulty to make him accept of it after what his father had said to him  the fourth day after my arrival we had notice the fleet would sail in a few days this gave me a great deal of uneasiness for i could not get to kakatan without a boat and mr ratcliffs was broke to pieces some time before i came there but he seeing the uneasiness i labored under procured one yet another difficulty arose we could not gain even for money any body to row us well said mr ratcliff since we have got a boat thou shall not be made uneasy for want of people to work it i and my children will go along with thee accordingly we set out and arrived at kakatan but we were surpised not to find above five sail there and one of em that vessel that capt bayley went in so i had the satisfaction of getting my things again  notwithstanding the fleets not being there the place was so full of people in expectation of it that there was no lodging to be had i was not so much concerned for my self as for my generous quaker who was to meet with such bad accommodation for his good nature in accompanying me  i met with a gentleman bound for england one mr le cruce at present a winemerchant in st martins lane who seeing the shifts we were put to offered me half his bed which i accepted of for my friendly quaker but i could not prevail upon him to take it therefore i lay with mr le cruce my self and mr ratcliff with his sons made what shift they could upon the ground  it was the report of every one that the fleet would not get together in four months so i resolved to take a trip to philadelphia in the mean time  i did not know how to fasten a present upon mr ratcliff for his civility for he would not hear of any thing like it but at last i found out this method i bought a runlet of rum a thing very much in esteem among the planters and i begged mr ratcliff to add to the obligations i had already received from him by taking charge of it and a letter to one mr randal a planter in his neighborhood in the letter i sent to mr randal was one enclosed for mr ratcliff where i informed him the rum was to him only as a small acknowledgment for the many obligations he had laid me under  the next day he and his sons took their leave of me even without taking any thing for the hire of the boat though i had bargained for it before i left the place  the vessel that was to carry me to philadelphia was not cleared of her lading therefore i was obliged to stay seven days at kakatan which is no place of resort but only once a year at the time the fleet makes up for england so there are not many conveniences expected there  the day before i failed for philadelphia i received a letter from my friendly quaker with a present of a powdered shote and several turkies which he sent me by water  the letter was as follows  friend castelman i received thy present in a very particular manner and though i am not very easy about it yet i give thee my thanks with a promise of a grateful remembrance from me and mine i pray thee to accept what i send thee as from a real friend and i commit thee to god  j ratcliff   the vessel had but one cabin in it which was taken up by a womanpassenger so that i was obliged to make shift to warp my self up in the sail and the spray of the waves beating over us now and then i had but a wet lodging and though it was nothing to what i underwent before yet i got more cold by it we made so good way that we got up to new castle in delaware river the second evening and we prevailed upon the master to stay there all night where i got a good lodging at a public house being the first time i had paid for any thing since my shipwreck  new castle the capital of the county of new castle is a handsome well built town standing upon an eminence which gives you a pleasant view from the river delaware the dutch were the first founders but did not possess it long there are now above  00 handsome houses and foundations for several more as it is daily increasing in wealth by trade we may imagine it will increase in buildings and inhabitants i have been informed they have discovered in the neighborhood of this town a fine iron mine  the day following we dined at chester a little neat town on the same river consisting of near three hundred houses we were very handsomely entertained there by a gentleman of the place who would accompany us to philadelphia we had a pleasant voyage with many delightful prospects of towns villages and plantations on both sides of the river and in the evening we landed at philadelphia the capital of pensylvania  pensylvania takes its name from william penn esquire son to sir william penn admiral of a squadron in the dutch war where he behaved like a man of courage and conduct his son the present proprietor met with some difficulty in obtaining his patent by reason he had declared himself head of the people called quakers  pensylvania is composed of all that tract of land with its islands rivers coasts and bays which lies from forty to fortyfive degrees of north latitude and is one of the richest countries in his majestys foreign dominions  the air is pleasant wholesome and unclouded or very rarely overcast though the winter is something colder and the summer hotter than in england yet the inhabitants have known several winters together without frosts the day in the summer is two hours shorter than ours and in winter two hours longer which is really better for business of all kinds and certainly this is a tract of ground as well seated as any in the world for pleasure and profit it is bounded on the east by westjersey on the west by virginia canada on the north and maryland on the south all except canada fine english settlements  the original inhabitants of all these places are supposed to be the ten tribes of the jews that were scattered but from whence they derive their authority even for this supposition i cannot imagine it is true some of the ancient jewish customs are among the indians but as every nation and people have customs peculiar to themselves in my opinion there is nothing to be gathered from thence it is certain they have something of the countenance of the jews they observe new moons and offer their first fruits to their idols they are most of em well made and exactly proportioned in their features without the thick lips and flat noses of the negroes they are generally good natured and inoffensive slow to anger but hard to be appeased a courteous and humane behavior will gain upon em more than severity it is very seldom they wrong a good master but i have known em frequently venture their lives for em their language is very lofty and high sounding but not copious for one word has several meanings i will give you from my friend mr thomas a short specimen  hodi hita nee huska apeechi nee machi pensylvania huska dogwachi keshow apeechi nowa huska hayly chetena koon peo  thus in english  farewell my friend i shall go shortly to pensylvania we shall have a cold moon presently and hard frosts will soon follow  they throw their children into the water as soon as born to harden their bodies the business of the men is to fish or hunt and the women to till their ground and look after their children who commonly go alone at nine months they are most of them knowing in botany and if at any time visited with sickness cure themselves by their knowledge in herbs and roots they are exceeding charitable and if any among em have the misfortune to be lame or blind they take care they shall want for nothing the boys go a hunting or fishing with the father at six years old and when they are experienced in both and arrive to their sixteenth year they may marry the girls stay at home with their mother who instructs them in her business the women are very modest and chaste and you cannot affront them more than by saying any thing to the contrary of either adultery is punished with death among em  their habitations are generally mean and small and their utensils a pot and two or three calabashes with a bowl and when they travel they lie in the woods about a fire to keep the wild beasts from them they are people of a merry disposition continually laughing and singing even at their work they have some particular songs among em though but indifferent tunes and their instruments of music are as poor they are generally given to sobriety but if they once get liquor of the europeans they never give over till dead drunk and i have seen em lie in the middle of the roads and streets like so many dogs as soon as ever they come to themselves they plunge into the water and gather some herbs squeeze em into a calabash which they drink by which means they are recovered and are never sick after their debauches their age generally comes up to seventy and very few to eighty i have heard one indian speaking to another when on his deathbed of the uncertainty of this life and how happy he should be in the company of their god where would be no want of corn or wood or any thing that was needful for him but there is a great number instructed in the christian faith there are indian schools to teach em writing as well as reading and most of em are very docile  the country of pensylvania abounds with every thing necessary for the life of man even for the most luxurious  the woods afford fine pigeons pheasants quails partridges woodcocks snipes wild turkies and various other birds about the rivers geese ducks swans teal diverse brands etc in the rivers generally a gravelly bottom are to be found herrings smelts roach dace eels perch salmon trout gurnets shadds catsheads sheepsheads and many more with fine large oysters preferable to any i ever tasted in england and when any of these are brought to market you may buy em very reasonably  the wood produce cedar mulberry vines  ash chestnut and the finest  ships i am informed some of  have made wine with grapes  growth but i have heard nothing in commendation of it  the dutch were the first foreigners that came to these parts but they made but few settlements their chief business was to trade with the indians for skins furrs etc and give them in exchange rum beer and sugar the next that appeared was a colony from sweden who began to plant and manure the ground the dutch were offended at these interlopers as they called em and threatened to make war upon em which was prevented by the swedes surrendering the plantations to em who returned home  in the dutch war sir robert carr made a descent upon em outed em quite and took possession of it for the crown of england in the year      and left a relation of his of the same name as governor but the next year the dutch got the mastery again and the few english that were there settled themselves in the other english colonies better provided with defense against an invader  the dutch remained possessors of this pleasant country till the peace was concluded between england and holland and then it was delivered once again to the english but no great progress was made there till      the year after mr penn had gained the patent for it in less than a year there were a hundred houses built and formed into a town to which mr penn gave the name of philadelphia or brotherly love a place for its situation very agreeable seated high upon a neck of land formed by two fine navigable rivers two hundred miles from the sea yet ships of five hundred ton can unlade on the key  the country about it is rich well watered and wooded the earth producing a vast increase they reap their corn about the beginning of july  the gardens and orchards yield all roots fruits and flowers we have in england and several peculiar only to the country the air is so healthy that there is no occasion for physicians being they find cures for their accidental diseases by simples and the people so peaceful there is no want of a lawyer among them and if any difference happens a third person makes up the matter without the charge of a lawsuit this country is divided into six counties or divisions and each county sends six members to the assembly at philadelphia chester   new castle   kent   bucks   sussex   and philadelphia   all these mentioned places have yearly fairs and weekly markets being very conveniently situated for commerce with the country about em  they have excellent copper mines which produce better copper than any in england both for color and finess coal mines have been lately found and several mineral waters that perform the same office as bath tunbridge or epsom there is also found good stone for building that proves handsome and lasting and another thin stone which they tile their houses with being much neater than our english tile also loadstones and the salamander stone having a substance like cotton in the veins which will not consume in the fire  the woods produce wolves panthers bears deer hares antelopes foxes rackoons rabbets squirrels bevers etc whose skins yield great profit to the taker and a creature called a possum that has a false belly into which the young ones retire in time of danger also the flyingsquirrel with wings like those of a bat and i have often seen it fly from tree to tree  red deer buffalos and elks are common in the woods and delicious food but they are generally purchased from the indians though at a very reasonable rate they being the people that best know how to hunt them there is a reward given em for killing a bear or wolf which has very much lessened the number of both though any person has the liberty to hunt fish or fowl without being molested there is also plenty of otters about the rivers and such a multitude of frogs in the swamps a swamp is much of the same kind as the boggs in ireland that they disturb you with their croaking especially the bullfrog that makes a noise something like that beast and is the base to all the others  if the distressed people of england knew the comforts of pensylvania and the casy means there is of a livelihood they would never stay where they are in a continual scene of want and misery even the meanest servant has better wages than those in england if criminal persons were sent over there they would find employment and yet be restrained in the vices for which they were punished for a thief there is to return fourfold what he has stole and if he has not wherewithal to do that he is compelled to work it out but every thing is in such plenty there they would have no occasion to exercise their talents that way  their beef mutton pork lamb veal etc is equal to our meat in england with which they trade to the leewardislands and bring in return rum sugar molossos and pieces of eight their horses are strong handsome and hardy and seldom feed on any thing but grass and after the hardest days work are turned out hot into the fields yet get no harm  the country produces great numbers of apple and pear trees with which they make great quantities of cider and perry that is very wholesome and well tasted  there are many large beautiful well built towns in the province of pensylvania of which as i said before philadelphia is the chief it is a noble large and populous city standing on as much ground as our english city of bristol seated upon a neck of land formed by the rivers delaware and the schuylkill both navigable many leagues above the city it is built square in form of a chessboard with each front facing one of the rivers  there are several streets near two mile long as wide as holborn and better built after the english manner the chief are broadstreet king street and high street though there are several other handsome streets that take their names from the productions of the country as mulberry walnut beech sassafras cedar vine ash and chestnut streets from these streets run great numbers of courts yards and allies with well built houses in em there are several coves and docks where large ships are built and by a moderate computation there has been launched from the stocks of this city in forty year near  00 sail of ships besides smallcraft which may in some sort give us an idea of the opulency of the place many of their merchants keep their coaches and the tradesmens shops and streets are well frequented all religions are tolerated here which is one means to increase the riches of the place the people of the church of england as by law established have a neat well built church founded in the year      and i am informed the foundation is laid for another the quakers who are the major part of the inhabitants have several meetings there is a swedish reformed church mr rudman the incumbent a man of singular learning and piety who is as much followed by the quakers when he preaches as the protestants i shall beg leave to give one instance of his humility and piety when subscriptions were taking in to build the church he subscribed a considerable sum but when called upon for the money he had it not in his power to pay it yet to keep his word he contracted with the master builder for so much a day to carry the hod till he had worked his subscriptionmoney out this was an instance of his piety and zeal for religion and i fancy if churches were to be built after the same manner in a certain island the work would go but slowly on there are single houses upon the key that have cost  000 l the building mr badcocks brewhouse is a noble large building and has in it one single vessel that will hold eight ton of liquor  in this city is held the courts of the province and the assembly meet here which is in the nature of a dependant parliament as in those cities of france that are distant from the capital there are three fairs in the year and every week two markets in time of the fairs the city is so thronged as well as the adjacent plantations that it is hard to find a lodging  the government and constitutions are the same as in england  their council is composed of the protestants and quakers but the public officers are taken out of the former the governor is nominated by the king of england and the rest of the civil officers are master of the rolls four judges a judge of the admiralty secretary attorney general treasurer public register clerk of the peace as also a commissary and a surveyorgeneral these with eight members of the council form the government of the city the number of the inhabitants is generally supposed to be upwards of   000 besides slaves there is hardly any trade in england but the same may be met with in philadelphia and every mechanic has better wages a journeyman tailor has twelve shillings a week besides his board and every other trade in proportion has the same advantage  there is a post office lately erected which goes to boston in new england charlestown in carolina and the other neighboring places the uncultivated ground which is not grubbd sells for ten times the value it did at first though there is none of that sort within ten miles round the city and that within the neighborhood that was sold for ten pound at first will fetch above three hundred now all womens work is very dear there and that proceeds from the smallness of the number and the scarcity of workers for even the meanest single women marry well there and being above want are above work the proprietor of this fine country as i said before is william pen esquire who has a sine seat called pensbury built on three islets if i may so call em for a branch of the river delaware runs thrice round it in his orchards and gardens may be found all the fruits roots and herbs that are in england and many more peculiar to the country there is very good paper made in pensylvania linen druggets crapes camblets and serges with which they trade most of the merchants and some tradesmen have handsome country houses well and conveniently furnished no insults from the indians were ever heard of here which is more than any of our other plantations upon the continent can say neither are there any of them used as slaves but they are paid as well as the europeans for their commodities or labor and there are more christians among em than in any other nation in america for their number most of them bring up their children to read and write and some of them are bound apprentice to the europeans who prove as good workmen at the business they follow as their masters in short in the midst of war they enjoy the tranquillity of peace they are too far distant from the sea to fear the invasion of a foreign enemy and there are several places of strength upon the river of delaware before they can arrive at philadelphia yet when i was there the town was alarmed with a false report that the french had landed within the bay and committed several acts of hostility it was judged by some that this report was spread abroad on purpose to see how active the people would be to defend themselves and whether the quakers were to be depended upon in case of an invasion the governor got at the head of about  00 men and exhorted the brethren to stand up for the defense of their lives and estates but they declared the carnal weapon did not belong to them yet they would retire and pray for us the people of the town brought out their provision and liquor and freely gave it among the soldiers who made as free with it before night news came that it was a false alarm which i believe did not displease any of us  in the heat of the day i sometimes took a walk with some of the town to fair mount a pleasant place shaded with trees on the river schuylkill as we were coming home one day deep in discourse with one another as i was stepping over a style i saw stretched on the ground before me a snake as i suppose asleep i had not power to draw my leg back again but my foot fell just upon the head and part of the neck of the reptile more by the particular direction of providence than my design it sprung up so quick and twisted round my right leg and body with such force that i was in fear of being strangled however i kept my foot fixed fast upon its head and in a little time it fell down dead it is almost impossible for words to describe what i felt at this accident the very touch of it about my leg and body had very near taken away my breath and it was the greatest providence in the world i did not take my foot from the head of the snake for if i had it would certainly have bit me it was a considerable time before i could shake off my apprehension and i was downright sick with the fright the whole day after some of my companions had the curiosity to measure it it was in length two yards nine inches and ten inches about from the neck to within a yard of the tail i remember very well after this accident whenever i had occasion to cross a style in pensylvania or old england i ever took care to look before me so lasting is the impression of fear and danger upon the minds of men  i continued at philadelphia near four months and was very well entertained by the gentlemen of the place i am pleased i have it in my power to pay em my public acknowledgment of thanks for all their favors particularly the reverend mr brooks whom i met with by chance at philadelphia his business there was to raise subscriptions for a new church near new york when he heard of my misfortunes he was so generous and charitable as to offer to lend me a sum of money he had in his hands upon my bare word only which i was to return to him from england by the society for propagating the gospel in foreign parts as i was not in want of it i did not accept his intended favor but i shall ever gratefully remember his kind intentions  i must not forget the many obligations i had the honor to receive from his excellency governor evans nor mr evans the commissary who was particularly civil to me these gentlemen though of the same name are no otherwise related than by marrying the daughters of mr moor the collector of the kings customs the commissary is just gone for philadelphia again having been in england near a twelvemonth about an affair between the present governor sir william keith and him relating to the kings customs among the rest of my friends i must not forget the facetious mr staples dancing master who was the first stranger of philadelphia that did me the honor of a visit and to his merry company i owe the passing of many a dull hour that probably might have lain heavy upon the hands of a man under my circumstances deprived of fortune in a strange country having no friends in whose power it was to assist me nearer than england for mr jones was too much involved in his own troublesome affairs at bermuda to expect any thing from him but the generosity of the philadelphians is rooted in their natures for it is the greatest crime among them not to show the utmost civility to strangers and if i were obliged to live out of my native country i should not be long puzzled in finding a place of retirement which should be philadelphia there the oppressed in fortune or principles may find a happy asylum and drop quietly to their graves without fear or want  in the beginning of august news arrived that the fleet would be ready to sail from kakatan the latter end of the month so that i now began to bend my thoughts toward my native country i picked up at philadelphia four more companions that intended the same voyage and august   we took leave of our friends and the lovely city of philadelphia which i shall always remember with the utmost satisfaction we hired a boat to carry us down the delaware and lay the first night at a planters an acquaintance of one of my companions who treated us with the usual civilities of the country the next day we dined on board our boat and at night arrived at lewis about  0 leagues from philadelphia and  0 from the sea we staid here three days this town is the capital of sussex county and is built upon the hoorkill a river that runs into the delaware a little below begins the bay of delaware which is formed by cape william and cape james this last is the utmost bounds of pensylvania while we staid here i had the curiosity to go into the woods to see em gather honey it being free for any one which proceeds from its great plenty and you may buy the best beeswax at philadelphia for four pence a pound at lewis we had some of the largest oysters and cockles i ever saw in my life some of the former were six inches diameter out of the shell and very well tasted at this place they make a rich soup composed of these and other shellfish which is very nourishing and palatable from lewis we were to walk over an isthmus of eight mile that parts delaware river and chesapeak bay which would save us three or four days sailing for we had notice of a ship called the globe a new vessel of near five hundred ton and twentyfour guns that was at kakatan and would be willing to receive passengers we set out from lewis with horses to carry what little baggage we had but we chose to walk it on foot our selves we dined at a pleasant plantation about the midway of our journey but found it a difficult matter to prevail upon a couple of young girls to come near us at first for they took us for privateers but at last we prevailed upon em and they called their father etc who made very much of us one of the girls perceiving i had a watch in my hand to see what time of day it was begged to look upon it but it was very pleasant to see her fear when she touched it and would not be persuaded but it was alive from its going and the noise it made i asked her if she had never seen or heard of a watch before she told me she had never seen one but her sister had read of em i only mention this to show the simplicity and innocence of those inhabitants of america that live retired in the country for they told me they had neither of em been four mile from their own house in their lives  we took leave of our planter and his family and got that night to a plantation on chesapeak bay where we lay all night and were well entertained the next day we set about getting a boat to carry us to kakatan but we met with a great deal of difficulty in procuring one and were three days before we could succeed but at last we got one by accident that was coming up the bay we got on board and arrived at kakatan the same evening kakatan is no more than a large cove where all the fleet rendezvous in order to set sail for england there are some few houses scattered up and down the bay which go at great rates upon this occasion it lies about ten leagues up the river of chesapeak which river divides virginia and maryland it is the greatest river upon the continent in the english dominions and the farthest navigable up in the country and many other rivers fall into it we inquired for the globe and soon agreed with the captain for his great cabin at a reasonable rate and he seemed pleased with his company we provided what little necessaries we wanted as some fresh provisions liquor etc and on sept   the commadore hung out the signal for sailing  i thought it was a noble sight to see so many ships under sail all together there were upwards of two hundred sail of merchantmen besides four sail of men of war for our convoy  we drove down the river and at night got over against the virginia capes cape henry and cape charles which form the mouth of chesapeak bay the next day we left the main land astern and we had orders from the commadore to spread our selves for fear we should fall foul of each other in the night we continued sailing several days together with a prosperous gale sept    the skies threatened us with a storm we reevd our sails in expectation of it but it blew so violently at last that we were obliged to lie under a reeft foresail and it was well we had a good stout ship under us or we had perished our fleet was soon scattered and we saw several of them sink in view with their whole crew and it was not in the power of the other ships to succor em i now began to think i should be buried in the deep though our captain always gave us great hopes in the goodness and strength of the ship for she was well rigged and fitted it being her first voyage we were terribly tossed all night and when the morning dawned we could not perceive one of the fleet so we were obliged to sail alone which gave me many melancholy reflections however we had this to comfort us that the storm was abated and the next day to my great joy we discovered forty of our scattered fleet and one man of war when we could come within hailing we received a dismal account of the loss of above thirty of the fleet that foundered at sea some of the men were saved as also part of the cargo of seven or eight but the rest went to the bottom  one reason of the weakness of the ships was their being unsheathed and staying four months beyond their usual time the worms had got into their bottoms  we sailed together with a fair wind till we came upon the coast of france and then we had the misfortune of being dispersed in the night and our danger was the greater in being so near an enemys country the next day we perceived a sail making up to us we soon discovered it was a french privateer there were three ships of us in company we got together to consult and at last it was agreed to prepare for the fight though in a very poor condition for an engagement some of the sailors advised us to meet em which advice was taken we immediately crowded all the sail we could and got our hands upon deck passengers and all and having the wind of em we bore down upon em which had the desired effect for as soon as they perceived us chasing em they made all the sail they could to get from us and in a little time got out of our sight we were very well pleased with our stratagem and continued our course  november   we discovered england whose chalky cliffs gave us all a vast delight we coasted along the channel with the pleasing hopes of once more fetting our feet upon our native country and nov   we got safe into deal harbor we staid there but one night and hired horses to go to canterbury from whence we took a coach to gravesend and the next day went in the passageboat to london as we were going up the river a ship outwardbound came so suddenly upon us that we were in the utmost danger of being run over most of the passengers got up ready to lay hold of the tackling of the ship to save themselves but by providence she mist us by about two inches this put me in mind of the uncertainty of human life and that a man may meet with death when he imagines himself past all danger  i landed at london nov       0 i gave god thanks for his many and signal mercies where i hope i am settled for the remnant of my life without trusting my self any more to the dangers of the tempestuous sea  finis
