the meridian sun of liberty or the whole rights of man displayed and most accurately defined in a lecture read at the philosophical society in newcastle on the  th of november      for printing of which the society did the author the honor to expel him  to which is now first prefixed by way of preface a most important dialogue between the citizen reader and the author  the invention all admired and each how he to be the inventor missed so easy it seemed once found which yet unfound most would have thought impossible milton let thelwall see sober reflections or rather lamentations over the impending fate of the vessel of hereditary property by john thelwall and burke from its splendor retire a splendor too strong for their eyes let pedants and fools their effusions admire inwrapt in their cobwels like flies shall frenzy and sophistry hope to prevail when reason opposes her weight when the welfare of millions is hung on the scale and the balance yet trembles with fate by t spence  london printed for the author at no   little turnstile high holborn patriotic bookseller and publisher of that best school of mans rights entitled pigs meat the end of oppression grand repository of the english language etc  price one penny        preface citizen reader pray what is all this you make ado about landlords and tenants and parishes we dont understand you   author that is surprising i thought i had been very plain but none are so blind as those who will not see but the reason why i trouble you with my little publications is that i wish to teach you the rights of m   reader rights of man what  dont we yet know enough of the right of man   author no   reader no do you say after all that pain thelwall and other philosophers and the french republic have taught us do we not yet know the rights of man   author no   reader does ot the whole rights of man consist in a fair equal and imprtial representation of the people in parliament   author no nobody ought to have right of suffrage or representation in a society wherein they have no property as none are suffered to meddle in the affairs of a benefit society or corporation but those who are members by having a property therein so none have a right o vote or interfere in the affairs of the government of a country who have to right to the soil because such are and ought to be accounted strangers   reader do you then account men born in a country as strangers to it and unworthy of suffrage that unfortunately may have no title to landed property   author most certainly i do especially such men as being afraid to look their rights in the face have disfranchised and alienated themselves by denying and renouncing all claim to the soil of their birth and profess to be content with the right of property in the fruits of their industry ingenuity and good fortune this is a right of property that a hottentot a chinese or a native of the moon may claim among us as well as you wherefore as you are content with the property of a foreigner pray do likewise be content with the privileges of a foreigner   reader i tell you we have a right to universal suffrage as well as to the fruits of our labor   author and i tell you that such lacklanders as you have no right to suffrage at all for you are to all intents and purposes as much foreigners as the jews for if birth gave a title many of them might claim as much as you having been born in the country and perhaps too through as many generations so it is not birth but property that gives right of suffrage in a society sure you do not by your suffrages want to interfere in the estates and properties of other men you own that the landed interest are the legal proprietors of their estates and of course the legal possessors of the fountains of life and yet by your universal suffrage you want to modify to your liking those very estates which you allow to be private property  you say that no one has a right to set a price on your labor yet you want to cramp others in the disposal of what you allow to be as much their right you say you would abolish the right of primogeniture you would tax all estates according to their value prevent the monopoly of farms aboash the gamelaws and thus  and thus  at your whim you would fashion reduce melt and pare down private property contrary to your own fundamental maxims of right and wrongpray be consistent and let us know before you begin where you mean to leave off if the rights of man be definable as i believe they are let them be accurately defined and then let them be sacred this is the only way to procure unanimity of sentiment and prevent anarchy is it necessary that our rights like the rainbow should always recede from us as we advance are they today to be subject to this decree and tomorrow to tha as it pleases a few of our leading demagogues who only wish us to know in part that they may lead us like men upon a secret expedition does not this look as if they longed to fish in dark and troubled waters   reader are we then because we have no land to do nothing in our own defense against oppression   author if you dont like the country and the oppression in it pray leave it you have no more right to this country than to any other while you allow the justice of private property in land you justify every thing the landed interest do both in their own estates and in the government for the country is theirs and what you call oppression is only their acting consistently with their interest and they certainly have a right to govern their own property and what affects it so as by your own confession you have neither part nor lot among them you are of consequence only strangers and sojourners wherefore the landed interest act infinitely more consistently in debarring such unprincipled legislators from interfering among them than you do in demanding rights which are inexplicable noble architects truly who would pull down before you know what to build who to serve some temporary purpose perhaps of plunder would put all things in a state of requisition and then suffer matters to end in as much perhaps more oppression than they began this is not establishing the immovable temple of justice but erecting the wavering standard of robbery   reader and pray what do you call the rights of man   author read this lecture which i have been publishing in various editions for more than twenty years there you will see the whole rights of man without reserve there you will see how far men ought to go in recovering their rights and where to a hairsbreadth they ought to stop   of kings and courtiers how the fools complain nor blame their own inordnate love of gain none think that while dire landlords they allow to kings and knaves they will still be doomed to bow none think that each by favoring the deceit himselfs a foolish party to the cheat few can be landlords and these very few must to succeed their brethren all undo yet each low wretch for lordship fierce does burn and longs to act the tyrant in his turn nor longs alone but hopes before he dies to have his rents and live on tears and sighs pigs meat a lecture read at the philosophical society in newcastle on nov the  th      mr president it being my turn to lecture i beg to give some thoughts on this important question viz whether mankind in society reap all the advantages from their natural and equal rights of property in land and liberty which in that state they possibly may and ought to expect and as i hope you mr president and the good company here are sincere friends to truth i am under no apprehensions of giving offense by defending her cause with freedom  that property in land and liberty among men in a state of nature ought to be equal few one would fain hope would be foolish enough to deny therefore taking this to be granted the country of any people in a native state is properly their common in which each of them has an equal property with free liberty to sustain himself and family with the animals fruits and other products thereof thus such a people reap jointly the whole advantages of their country or neighborhood without having their right in so doing called in question by any not even by the most selfish and corrupt for upon what must they live if not upon the productions of the country in which they reside surely to deny them that right is in effect denying them a right to live  well methinks some are now ready to say but is it not lawful reasonable and just for this people to sell or make a present even of the whole of their country or common to whom they will to be held by them and their heirs even for ever  to this i answer if their posterity require no grosser materials to live and move upon than air it would certainly be very illnatured to dispute their right of parting with what of their own their posterity would never have occasion for but if their posterity cannot live but as grossly as they do the same gross materials must be left them to live upon for a right to deprive any thing of the means of living supposes a right to deprive it of life and this right ancestors are not supposed to have over their posterity  hence it is plain that the land or earth in any country or neighborhood with every thing in or on the same or pershining thereto belongs at all times to the living inhabitants of the said country or neighborhood in an equal manner for as i said before there is no living but on land and its productions consequently what we cannot live without we have the same property in as in our lives  now as society ought properly to be nothing but a mutual agreement among the inhabitants of a country to maintain the natural rights and privileges of one another against all opposers whether foreign or domestic it should lead one to expect to find those rights and privileges no farther infringer upon among men pretending to be in that state than necessity absolutely required i say again it should lead one to think so but i am afraid whoever does will be mightily mistaken  however as the truth here is of much importance to be known let it be boldly sought out in order to which it may not be improper to trace the present method of holding land among men in society from its original  if we look back to the origin of the present nations we shall fee that the land with all its appurtenances was claimed by a few and divided among themselves in as assured a manner as if they had manufactured  and it had been the work of their own hands and by being unquestioned or not called to an account for such usuations and unjust claims they fell into a habit of thinking or which is the same thing to the rest of mankind of acting as if the earth was made for or by them and did not scruple to call it their own property which they might dispose of without regard to any other living creature in the universe accordingly they did so and no man more than any other creature could claim a right to so much as a blade of grass or a nut or an accn a fish or a fowl or any natural production whatever though to save his life without the permission of the pretended proprietor and not a foot of land water rock or heath but was claimed by one or other of those lords so that all things men as well as other creatures who lived were obliged to owe their lives to some or others property consequently they too like the brutes were claimed and certainly as properly as the wood herbs etc that were nourished by the soil and so we find that whether they lived multiplied worked or fought it was all for their respective lords and they god bless them most graciously accepted of all as their due for by granting the means of life they granted the life itself and of course they had a right to all the servicesandadvantages that the life or death of the creatures they gave life to could yield  thus the title of gods seems suitably enough applied to such great beings nor is it to be wondered at that no services could be thought too great by poor dependent needy wretches to such mighty and all sufficient lords in whom they seemed to live and move and have their being thus were the first landholders usurpers and tyrant and all who have since possessed their lands have done so by right of inheritance purchase etc from them and the present proprietors like their predecessors are proud to own it and like them too they exclude all others from the least pretense to their respective properties and any one of them still can by laws of their own making for they are the landlords alone who make the laws oblige every living creature to remove from off his property which to the great distress of mankind is too often put in execution so of consequence were all the landholders to be of one mind and determined to take their properties into their own hands all the rest of mankind might go to heaven if they would for there would be no place found for them here thus men may not live in any part of this world not even where they are born but as stangers and by the permission of the pretender to the property thereof which permission is for the most part paid extravagantly for and they are still advancing the terms of permission though many people are so straitened to pay the present demands that it is believed in a short time if they hold on there will be few to grant the favor to and those landmakers as we shall call them justify all this by the practice of other manufacturers who take all they can get for the products of their hands and because that every one ought to live by his business as well as he can and consequently so ought landmarkers  now having before supposed it both proved and allowed that mankind have as equal and just a property in land as they have in liberty air or the light and heat of the sun and having also considered upon what hard conditions they enjoy those common gifts of nature it is plain they are far from reaping all the advantages from them which they may and ought to expect  but lest it should be said that a system whereby they may reap more advantages consistent with the nature of society cannot be proposed i will attempt to show you the outlines of such a plan  let it be supposed then that the whole people in some country after much reasoning and deliberation should conclude that every man has an equal property in the land in the neighborhood where he resides they therefore resolve that if they live in society together it shall only be with a view that every one may reap all the benefits from their natural rights and privileges possible therefore a da is appointed on which the inhabitants of each parish meet in their respective parishes to take their longlost rights into possession and to form themselves into corporations so then each parish becomes a corporation an all the men who are inhabitants become members or burgers the land with all that appertains to it is in every parish made the property of the corporation or parish with as ample power to let repair or alter all or any part thereof as a lord of the manor enjoys over his lands houses etc but the power of alienating the least morsel in any manner from the parish either at this or any time hereafter is denied for it is solemnly agreed to by the whole nation that a parish that shall either sell or give away any part of its landed property shall be looked upon with as much honor and detestation and used by them as if they had sold all their children to be slaves or massacred them with their own hands thus are there no more nor other landlords in the whole country than the parishes and each of them is sovereign landlord of its own territories  o hearken yet besotted sons of men by this one bold resolve your chains are eternally broken and your enemies anihilated by this one resolve the power the pride and the arrogance of the landed interest those universal and never ceasing scourges and plunderers of your race are instantaneously and for ever broken and cut off for being thus deprived and shorn of their revenues they become like shorn sampson weak as other men weak as the poor dejected wretches whom they have so long been grinding and treading under toot  there you may behold the rent which the people have paid into the parish treasuries employed by each parish in paying the government so much per pound to make up the sum which the parliament or national representation at any time think requisite in maintaining and relieving its own poor and people out of work in paying the necessary officers their salaries in building repairing and adorning its houses buddges and other structures in making and maintaining convenient and delightful streets highways and passages both for foot and carriages in making and maintaining canals and other conveniences for trade and navigation in planting and taking in waste grounds in providing and keeping up a magazine of ammunition and all forts of arm sufficient for all its in habitants in case of danger from enemies in premiums for the encouragement of agriculture or any thing else thought worthy of encouragement and in a word in doing whatever the people think proper and not as formerly to support and spread luxury pride and all manner of vice as for corruption in elections it has now no being or effect among them all affairs to be determined by voting either in a full meeting of a parish its committees or in the house of representatives are done by balloting so that votings or elections among them occasion no animosities for none need to let another know for which side he votes all that can be done therefore to gain a majority of votes for any thing is to make it appear in the best light possible by speaking or writing  among them government does not meddle in every trifle but on the contrary allows to each parish the power of butting the laws in force in all cases and does not interfere but when they act manifestly to the prejudice of society and the rights and liberties of mankind as established in their glorious constitution and laws for the judgment of a parish may be as much depended upon as that of a house of lords because they have as little to fear from speaking or voting according to truth as they  a certain number of neighboring parishes choose delegates to represent them in parliament senat or congress and each of them pays equally toward their maintenance they are chosen thus all the candidates are proposed in every parish on the same day when the election by balloting immediately proceeds in all the parishes at once to prevent too great a concourse at one place and they who are found to have the majority on a proper survey of the several pole books are acknowledged to be their representatives  a man by dwelling a whole year in any parish becomes a parishioner or member of its corporation and retains that privilege till he lives a full year in some other when he becomes a member in that parish and immediately loses all his right to the former for ever unless he chose to go back and recover it by dwelling again a full year there thus none can be a member of two parishes at once and yet a man is always a member of one though he move ever so often  if in any parish should be dwelling strangers from foreign nations or people from distant parishes who by sickness or other casualties should become so necessitous as to require relief before they have acquired a settlement by dwelling a full year therein then this parish as if it were their proper settlement immediately takes them under its humane protection and the expense thus incurred by any parish in providing for those not properly their own poor being taken an account of is deducted by the parish out of the first payment made to the star thus poor strangers being the poor of the state are not looked upon by their new neighbors where they have come to reside with an envious evil eye left they should become burden some neither are the poor harassed about in the extremity of distress and perhaps in a dying condition to gratify the litigiousness of parishes  all the men in the parish at times of their own choosing repair together to a field for that purpose with their officers arms banners and all sorts of martial music in order to learn or retain the complete art of war there they become soldiers yet not to molest their neighbors unprovoked but to be able to defend what none have a right to dispute their title to the enjoyment of and woe be to them who occasion them to do this they would use them worse than highwayman or pirates if they got them in their power  there is no army kept in pay among them in times of peace as all have a property in their country to defend they are alike ready to run to arms when their country is in danger and when an army is to be sent abroad it is soon raised of ready trained soldiers either as volunteers or by casting lots in each arish for so many men  besides as each man has a vote in all the affairs of his parish and for his own sake must wish well to the public the land is let in very small farms which makes employment for a greater number of hands and makes more victualling of all kinds be raised  there are no tolls or taxes of any kind paid among them by native or foreigner but the aforesaid rent the government poor roads etc etc as said before are all maintainep by the parishes with the rent on which account all wares manufactures allowable trade employments or actions are entirely dutyfree freedom to do any thing whatever cannot there be bought a thing is either entirely prohibited as theft or murder or entirely free to every one without tax or price  when houses lands or any tenements become vacant they are let publicly by the parish officers in seven years ases to the best bidder this way prevents collusion to the prejudice of the parish revenue and likewise prevents partiality  methinks i now behold the parish republics like fraternal or benefit societies each met at quarterday to pay their rents and to settle their accounts as well with the state as with all their parochial officers and workmen their several accounts having been examined some days before  on that day which is always a day not as now of sorrow but of gladness when the rents are all paid in and the sum total proclaimed the first account to be settled is the demand made by the national representation of so much per pound in behalf of the state which sum is set apart to be sent to the national treasury another sum is also set apart for the parish treasury to answer contingencies till next quarterday next the salaries of the parish officers are paid then are paid the respective bills of their workmen as masons bricklayers carpenters glaziers painters etc who have been employed in building or repairing the houses and other parish buildings after these come the paviour lamplighters watchmen scavengers and all the other workpeople employed by the parish to receive their demands until none remain then the residue of the public money or rents after all public demands are thus satisfied which is always twothirds more or less of the whole sum collected comes lastly to be disposed of which is the most pleasant part of the business to every one the number of parishioners and the sum thus le to be divided among them being announced each without respect of persons is sent home joyfully with an equal share  so if by sickness or mischance to poverty some wane their dividend of rents will come to set them up again though i have only spoke of parishioners receiving dividends which may be understood as if men only were meant to share the residue of the rents yet i would have no objection if the people thought proper to divide it among the whole number of souls male and female married and single in a parish from the infant of a day old to the second infantage of hoary hairs for as all of every age legitimate and illegitimate have a right to live on the public common and as that common for the sake of cultivation must be let out for rent that rent then ought to be equally enjoyed by every human being instead of the foil which they are thus deprived of  but what makes this prospect yet more glorious is that after this empire of right and reason is thus established it will stand for ever force and corruption attempting its downfall shall equally be baffled and all other nations struck with wonder and admiration at its happiness and stability shall follow the example and thus the whole earth shall at last be happy and live like brethren  finis an important query has the universal concession and agitation of political opinions occasioned by the french revolution produced no publication likely by containing a brief and clear solution of all the great political problems to outlive the present ferment and become a permanent and standing school of mans rights to rising generations  answer yes there is one that was compiled and published with that extensive view and whose solid worth will daily become more apparent as the temporary and tautological productions of the moment sink into oblivion this publication is entitled in conformity to the phrases of the times pigs meat or lessons for the swinish multitude consisting of   volumes duodecimo price   s   d each half bound nothing but the title is local and temporary and it may perhaps hereafter be more generally printed and known under the title of the universal school of mans rights
