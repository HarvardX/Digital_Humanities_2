an essay on the genius and writings of shakespeare with some letters of criticism to the spectator  by mr dennis   me lectori credere malim quam spectatoris fastidia far superbi horace london printed for bernard lintott at the crosskeys between the two templegates in fleetstreet      price   s  to the right honorable george granville esquire secretary at war sir an address of this nature made upon your advancement to one of the principal employments of the state and made by one who has had the honor to be known to you so many years might be pretended by malicious people to be a homage rather to your fortune and power than a due respect to your merit and virtue if it were not publicly known that i formerly applied my self to you in the same manner when you were much more distingnished by merit and virtue than by fortune and power  but if any one farther maliciously urges that even when i formerly applied my self to you by the distinguishing qualities of your mind and person i foresaw your fortune and power to him i answer in order to vindicate the reputation of my sincerity and my disinterestedness that though i saw very well that those great qualities fitted mr granville for the most illustrious employments yet who could have ever imagined that any man living had merit enough to raise him in spite of so many unfortunate virtues with which that merit was attended in spite of not only a true poetical genius but a frankness a probity a matchless integrity a sincerity worthy of heroic times and a most untainted honor  but though your character were less conspicuous and what i had formerly done were entirely forgot the numerous and powerful obligations i have to you would more than justify this address and the omitting the first opportunity of making you a public acknowledgment would look like black ingratitude you have taken such care of my interest with others at a most seasonable conjuncture and have your self made me a present so noble and so extraordinary at a time when i stood most in need of it that how few alive have spirit and magnanimity to do any thing like it at least i defy any one to name that living man who in a private capacity has done any thing like it  i know very well indeed that you are very far from desiring such a public acknowledgment that you aim at nothing by doing daily good but the godlike pleasure which results from your actions and that others perhaps may censure me for sacrificing your modesty to my own vanity for to publish to the world that i have been obliged in an extraordinary  by a person so universally esteemed and stinguishd that one of the very few things in which the most violent of both parties agree is the character of mr granville will be thought to be the result of uncommon vanity by those who have not goodness enough to believe it to be the effect of a lively gratitude  but though sir i had no obligation to you and you had no other merit but that of perfectly understanding an art which you have perfectly practiced viz the art which is the subject of the following treatise that treatise would be by right of nature yours for to whom can an essay upon the genius and writings of shakespeare be so properly addressed as to him who best understands shakespeare and who has most improved him i would not give this just encomium to the jew of venice if i were not convinced from a long experience of the penetration and force of your judgment  no exaltation can make you amd of your former noble art that you know it to be a weakness barely to imagine that the most noble and most exalted of all arts and the most difficult to excel in can render a man less qualified for public business or for the first employments of the state that all the great statesmen who have best succeeded in affairs of government have either writ poems or treatises concerning poetry the most ancient of historians and legislators moses at least of those whose laws and histories remain has given us a pathetick and a lofty poem upon the passage of the red sea  the athenian legislator solon thought it not in the least below his dignity to render moral virtue lovely by the charms of verse and lacedemonian licurgus even the rigid and the austere lycurgus thought it an employment worthy of his wisdom and virtue to restore and publish the immortal works of homer having the same opinion of that prince of poets that horace afterward had that his poems would better instruct mankind in virtue than they could be possibly taught by prose the most illustrious writers of politics among the grecians plato and aristotle one of them had a figurative a lofty and a poetic prose and the other who may be called the legislator of parnassus wrote the laws of tragedy so exactly and so truly in reason and nature that succeeding critics have writ justly and reasonably upon that art no farther than they have adhered to their great masters notions tacitus the very oracle of modern statesmen has a style that is warm and daring and figurative that is to say poetic machiavel the prince of modern politicians if we except but one of our own countrymen wrote more than one comedy and more than one poem has been attempted by our british politician harrington the two princes of poets may easily be proved to have been great statesmen homer particularly made choice of a moral which in his time when greece with the islands of the aegaean was divided into petty sovereignties was the fundamental maxim of their politics and their true interest which moral was as sallust afterward expressed it concordia res parvae crescunt discordia maxima dilabuntur from whose noblest poem you formerly gave us a tragedy in which in imitation of homer you are daring yet just fiery yet regular sublime yet natural and perspicuous chaste yet alluring and easy yet strong and powerful  but to come to the more active part of government the greatest monarchs and captains and ministers of state that ever were known in the world either were or would have been great poets when athens flourished in all her glory their poets and their famous writers were they who directed their counsels and led their armies to battle alexander read nothing but the works of homer while he conquered the orient in rome the greatest captain that flourished in the time of the commonwealth vouchsafed his assistance to a comic poet and the two first caesars were proud to write tragedies with those fatal hands that were victorious over the universe mecaenas at the time that he was first minister to the emperor of the world was not only the greatest patron of the muses that ever was but endeavored to be himself a poet if we descend to modern times richlieu who laid the foundation of the french greatness wrote more than one dramatick poem with that very right hand which dictated to the cabinets of so many sovereign princes and directed the successful motions of so many conquering commanders and that greatness which upon a french poetic foundation was in the space of less than one century raised to an insupportable height was in less than twenty years sappd and undermined and overturned by a british poetic ministry it being undeniable that several of the persons who made the chief figures in both the old and the new ministry were poets i make no doubt sir but the time will come when you will be distinguished by the wisdom and reach of your counsels as much as you were formerly by the spirit and justness of your writings for the very virtues which we once were afraid would hinder your advancement even in the most virtuous court are now like to preserve and support your interest since you have had an opportunity of publicly practicing them so long it is impossible to behold that ardor that sincerity and that alacrity with which you every day endeavor to do good to your fellow creatures without loving you and without wishing as well as hoping that you may be the peculiar care of providence which by advancing you to one of the most eminent stations would provide for thousands but when we behold that ardor and that alacrity attended with such an attractive sweetness and such a manly grace and with a nobility which god and nature seem to have imprinted both on your mind and person we have no longer power over our selves but give up all our affections to you and not only wish but firmly believe that since god and nature have given you those several excellencies which were the undoubted original of all political nobility they have determined you to succeed to the most extensive fortunes and titles of your noble ancestors which is warmly desired and earnestly expected by all who have the honor to know you but more especially by  sir your most obliged most humble and most faithful servant john dennis  letter i on the genius and writings of shakespeare to mr  feb      0   sir i here send you the tragedy of coriolanus which i have altered from the original of shakespeare and with it a short account of the genius and writings of that author both which you desired me to send to you the last time i had the good fortune to see you but i send them both upon this condition that you will with your usual sincerity tell me your sentiments both of the poem and of the criticism  shakespeare was one of the greatest geniuss that the world ever saw for the tragic stage thohe lay under greater disadvantages than any of his successors yet had he greater and more genuine beauties than the best and greatest of them and what makes the brightest glory of his character those beauties were entirely his own and owing to the force of his own nature whereas his faults were owing to his education and to the age that he lived in one may say of him as they did of homer that he had none to imitate and is himself inimitable his imaginations were often as just as they were bold and strong he had a natural discretion which never could have been taught him and his judgment was strong and penetrating he seems to have wanted nothing but time and leisure for thought to have found out those rules of which he appears so ignorant his characters are always drawn justly exactly graphically except where he failed by not knowing history or the poetical art he has for the most part more fairly distinguished them than any of his successors have done who have falsified them or confounded them by making love the predominant quality in all he had so fine a talent for touching the passions and they are so lively in him and so truly in nature that they often touch us more without their due preparations than those of other tragic poets who have all the beauty of design and all the advantage of incidents his masterpassion was terror which he has often moved so powerfully and so wonderfully that we may justly conclude that if he had had the advantage of art and learning he would have surpassed the very best and strongest of the ancients his paintings are often so beautiful and so lively so graceful and so powerful especially where he uses them in order to move terror that there is nothing perhaps more accomplished in our english poetry his sentiments for the most part in his best tragedies are noble generous easy and natural and adapted to the persons who use them his expression is in many places good and pure after a hundred years simple though elevated graceful though bold and easy though strong he seems to have been the very original of our english tragical harmony that is the harmony of blank verse diversifyed often by dissyllable and trissyllable terminations for that diversity distinguishes it from heroic harmony and bringing it nearer to common use makes it more proper to gain attention and more fit for action and dialogue such verse we make when we are writing prose we make such verse in common conversation  if shakespeare had these great qualities by nature what would he not have been if he had joined to so happy a genius learning and the poetical art for want of the latter our author has sometimes made gross mistakes in the characters which he has drawn from history against the equality and convenience of manners of his dramatical persons witness menenius in the following tragedy whom he has made an errant buffoon which is a great absurdity for he might as well have imagined a grave majestic jackpudding as a buffoon in a roman senator aufidius the general of the volscians is shown a base and a profligate villain he has offended against the equality of the manners even in his hero himself for coriolanus who in the first part of the tragedy is shown so open so frank so violent and so magnanimous is represented in the latter part by aufidius which is contradicted by no one a flattering fawning cringing insinuating traitor  for want of this poetical art shakespeare has introduced things into his tragedies which are against the dignity of that noble poem as the rabble in julius caesar and that in coriolanus though that in coriolanus offends not only against the dignity of tragedy but against the truth of history likewise and the customs of ancient rome and the majesty of the roman people as we shall have occasion to show anon  for want of this art he has made his incidents less moving less surprising and less wonderful he has been so far from seeking those fine occasions to move with which an action furnished according to art would have furnished him that he seems rather to have industriously avoided them he makes coriolanus upon his sentence of banishment take his leave of his wife and his mother out of sight of the audience and so has purposely as it were avoided a great occasion to move  if we are willing to allow that shakespeare by sticking to the bare events of history has moved more than any of his successors yet his just admirers must confess that if he had had the poetical art he would have moved ten times more for it is impossible that by a bare historical play he could move so much as he would have done by a fable  we find that a romance entertains the generality of mankind with more satisfaction than history if they read only to be entertertaind but if they read history through pride or ambition they bring their passions along with them and that alters the case nothing is more plain than that even in an historical relation some parts of it and some events please more than others and therefore a man of judgment who sees why they do so may in forming a fable and disposing an action please more than an historian can do for the just fiction of a fable moves us more than an historical relation can do for the two following reasons first by reason of the communication and mutual dependence of its parts for if passion springs from motion then the obstruction of that motion or a counter motion must obstruct and check the passion and therefore an historian and a writer of historical plays passing from events of one nature to events of another nature without a due preparation must of necessity stifle and confound one passion by another the second reason why the fiction of a fable pleases us more than an historical relation can do is because in an historical relation we seldom are acquainted with the true causes of events whereas in a feigned action which is duly constituted that is which has a just beginning those causes always appear for it is observable that both in a poetical fiction and an historical relation those events are the most entertaining the most surprising and the most wonderful in which providence most plainly appears and it is for this reason that the author of a just fable must please more than the writer of an historical relation the good must never fail to prosper and the bad must be always punished otherwise the incidents and particularly the catastrophe which is the grand incident are liable to be imputed rather to chance than to almighty conduct and to sovereign justice the want of this impartial distribution of justice makes the coriolanus of shakespeare to be without moral it is true indeed coriolanus is killed by those foreign enemies with whom he had openly sided against his country which seems to be an event worthy of providence and would look as if it were contrived by infinite wisdom and executed by supreme justice to make coriolanus a dreadful example to all who lead on foreign enemies to the invasion of their native country if there were not something in the fate of the other characters which gives occasion to doubt of it and which suggests to the skeptical reader that this might happen by accident for aufidius the principal murderer of coriolanus who in cold blood gets him assassinated by ruffians instead of leaving him to the law of the country and the justice of the volscian senate and who commits so black a crime not by any erroneous zeal or a mistaken public spirit but through jealousy envy and inveterate malice this assassinator not only survives and survives unpunished but seems to be rewarded for so detestable an action by engrossing all those honors to himself which coriolanus before had shared with him but not only aufidius but the roman tribunes sicinius and brutus appear to me to cry aloud for poetic vengeance for they are guilty of two faults neither of which ought to go unpunished the first in procuring the banishment of coriolanus if they were really jealous that coriolanus had a design on their liberties when he stood for the consulship it was but just that they should give him a repulse but to get the champion and defender of their country banished upon a pretended jealousy was a great deal too much and could proceed from nothing but that hatred and malice which they had conceived against him for opposing their institution their second fault lay in procuring this sentence by indirect methods by exasperating and inflaming the people by artifices and insinuations by taking a base advantage of the openheartedness and violence of coriolanus and by oppressing him with a sophistical argument that he aimed at sovereignty because he had not delivered into the public treasury the spoils which he had taken from the antiates as if a design of sovereignty could be reasonably concluded from any one act or any one could think of bringing to pass such a design by eternally favoring the patricians and disobliging the populace for we need make no doubt but that it was among the young patricians that coriolanus distributed the spoils which were taken from the antiates whereas nothing but caressing the populace could enslave the roman people as caesar afterward very well saw and experienced so that this injustice of the tribunes was the original cause of the calamity which afterward befell their country by the invasion of the volscians under the conduct of coriolanus and yet these tribunes at the end of the play like aufidius remain unpunished but indeed shakespeare has been wanting in the exact distribution of poetical justice not only in his coriolanus but in most of his best tragedies in which the guilty and the innocent perish promiscuously as duncan and banquo in mackbeth as likewise lady macduffe and her children desdemona in othello cordelia kent and king lear in the tragedy that bears his name brutus and porcia in julius caesar and young hamlet in the tragedy of hamlet for though it may be said in defense of the last that hamlet had a design to kill his uncle who then reigned yet this is justified by no less than a call from heaven and raising up one from the dead to urge him to it the good and the bad then perishing promiscuously in the best of shakespeares tragedies there can be either none or very weak instruction in them for such promiscuous events call the government of providence into question and by scepticks and libertines are resolved into chance i humbly conceive therefore that this want of dramatical justice in the tragedy of coriolanus gave occasion for a just alteration and that i was obliged to sacrifice to that justice aufidius and the tribunes as well as coriolanus  thus have we endeavored to show that for want of the poetical art shakespeare lay under very great disadvantages at the same time we must own to his honor that he has often performed wonders without it in spite of the judgment of so great a man as horace  natura fieret laudabile carmen an art quaesitum est ego nec studium sine divite vena nec rude quid profit video ingenium alterius sic altera poscit opem res and conjurat amice but from this very judgment of horace we may justly conclude that shakespeare would have wonderfully surpassed himself if art had been joined to nature there never was a greater genius in the world than virgil he was one who seems to have been born for this glorious end that the roman muse might exert in him the utmost force of her poetry and his admirable and divine beauties are manifestly owing to the happy confederacy of art and nature it was art that contrived that incomparable design of the aeneis and it was nature that executed it could the greatest genius that ever was infused into earthly mold by heaven if it had been unguided and unassisted by art have taught him to make that noble and wonderful use of the pythagorean transmigration which he makes in the sixth book of his poem had virgil been a circular poet and closely adhered to history how could the romans have been transported with that inimitable episode of dido which brought afresh into their minds the carthaginian war and the dreadful hannibal when it is evident that that admirable episode is so little owing to a faithful observance of history and the exact order of time that it is derived from a very bold but judicious violation of these it being undeniable that dido lived almost  00 years after aeneas yet is it that charming episode that makes the chief beauties of a third part of the poem for the destruction of troy it self which is so divinely related is still more admirable by the effect it produces which is the passion of dido  i should now proceed to show under what disadvantages shakespeare lay for want of being conversant with the ancients but i have already writ a long letter and am desirous to know how you relish what has been already said before i go any farther for i am unwilling to take more pains before i am sure of giving you some pleasure i am  sir your most humble faithful servant  letter ii on the genius and writings of shakespeare to mr  feb      0   sir upon the encouragement i have received from you i shall proceed to show under what disadvantages shakespeare lay for want of being conversant with the ancients but because i have lately been in some conversation where they would not allow but that he was acquainted with the ancients i shall endeavor to make it appear that he was not and the showing that in the method in which i pretend to convince the reader of it will sufficiently prove what inconveniences he lay under and what errors he committed for want of being conversant with them but here we must distinguish between the several kinds of acquaintance a man may be said to be acquainted with another who never was but twice in his company but that is at the best a superficial acquaintance from which neither very great pleasure nor profit can be derived our business is here to show that shakespeare had no familiar acquaintance with the grecian and roman authors for if he was familiarly conversant with them how comes it to pass that he wants art is it that he studied to know them in other things and neglected that only in them which chiefly tends to the advancement of the art of the stage or is it that he wanted discernment to see the justness and the greatness and the harmony of their designs and the reasonableness of those rules upon which those designs are founded or how come his successors to have that discernment which he wanted when they fall so much below him in other things how comes he to have been guilty of the grossest faults in chronology and how come we to find out those faults in his tragedy of troylus and cressida he introduces hector speaking of aristotle who was born a thousand years after the death of hector in the same play mention is made of milo which is another very great fault in chronology alexander is mentioned in coriolanus though that conqueror of the orient lived above two hundred years after him in this last tragedy he has mistaken the very names of his dramatick persons if we give credit to livy for the mother of coriolanus in the roman historian is vetturia and the wife is volumnia whereas in shakespeare the wife is virgilia and the mother volumnia and the volscian general in shakespeare is tullus aufidius and tullus attius in livy how comes it that he takes plutarchs word who was by birth a grecian for the affairs of rome rather than that of the roman historian if so be that he had read the latter or what reason can be given for his not reading him when he wrote upon a roman story but that in shakespeares time there was a translation of plutarch and there was none of livy if shakespeare was familiarly conversant with the roman authors how came he to introduce a rabble into coriolanus in which he offended not only against the dignity of tragedy but the truth of fact the authority of all the roman writers the customs of ancient rome and the majesty of the roman people by introducing a rabble into julius caesar he only offended against the dignity of tragedy for that part of the people who ran about the streets upon great festivals or public calamities or public rejoicings or revolutions in government are certainly the scum of the populace but the persons who in the time of coriolanus rose in vindication of their just rights and extorted from the patricians the institution of the tribunes of the people and the persons by whom afterward coriolanus was tried were the whole body of the roman people to the reserve of the patricians which body included the roman knights and the wealthy substantial citizens who were as different from the rabble as the patricians themselves as qualified as the latter to form a right judgment of things and to contemn the vain opinions of the rabble so at least horace esteems them who very well knew his countrymen  offenduntur enim quibus est equus aut pater aut res nec siquid fricti ciceris probat aut nucis emptor aequis accipiant animis donantve corona where we see the knights and the substantial citizens are ranked in an equal degree of capacity with the roman senators and are equally distinguished from the rabble  if shakespeare was so conversant with the ancients how comes he to have introduced some characters into his plays so unlike what they are to be found in history in the character of menenius in the following tragedy he has doubly offended against that historical resemblance for first whereas menenius was an eloquent person shakespeare has made him a downright buffoon and how is it possible for any man to conceive a ciceronian jackpudding never was any buffoon eloquent or wise or witty or virtuous all the good and ill qualities of a buffoon are summed up in one word and that is a buffoon and secondly whereas shakespeare has made him a hater and contemner and vilifyer of the people we are assured by the roman historian that menenius was extremely popular he was so very far from opposing the institution of the tribunes as he is represented in shakespeare that he was chiefly instrumental in it after the people had deserted the city and sat down upon the sacred mountain he was the chief of the delegates whom the senate deputed to them as being looked upon to be the person who would be most agreeable to them in short this very menenius both lived and died so very much their favorite that dying poor he had pompous funerals at the expense of the roman people  had shakespeare read either salust or cicero how could he have made so very little of the first and greatest of men as that caesar should be but a fourthrate actor in his own tragedy how could it have been that seeing caesar we should ask for caesar that we should ask where is his unequalled greatness of mind his unbounded thirst of glory and that victorious eloquence with which he triumphed over the souls of both friends and enemies and with which he rivalld cicero in genius as he did pompey in power how fair an occasion was there to open the character of caesar in the first scene between brutus and cassius for when cassius tells brutus that caesar was but a man like them and had the same natural imperfections which they had how natural had it been for brutus to reply that caesar indeed had their imperfections of nature but neither he nor cassius had by any means the great qualities of caesar neither his military virtue nor science nor his matchless renown nor his unparalleled victories his unwearied bounty to his friends nor his godlike clemency to his foes his beneficence his munificence his easiness of access to the meanest roman his indefatigable labors his incredible celerity the plausibleness if not justness of his ambition that knowing himself to be the greatest of men he only sought occasion to make the world confess him such in short if brutus after enumerating all the wonderful qualities of caesar had resolved in spite of them all to sacrifice him to public liberty how had such a proceeding heightened the virtue and the character of brutus but then indeed it would have been requisite that caesar upon his appearance should have made all this good and as we know no principle of human action but human sentiment only caesar who did greater things and had greater designs than the rest of the romans ought certainly to have outshind by many degrees all the other characters of his tragedy caesar ought particularly to have justified his actions and to have heightened his character by showing that what he had done he had done by necessity that the romans had lost their agrarian lost their rotation of magistracy and that consequently nothing but an empty shadow of public liberty remained that the gracchi had made the last noble but unsuccessful efforts for the restoring the commonwealth that they had failed for want of arbitrary irresistible power the restoration of the agrarian requiring too vast a retrospect to be done without it that the government when caesar came to public affairs was got into the hands of a few and that those few were factious and were contending among themselves and if you will pardon so mean an expression scrambling as it were for power that caesar was reduced to the necessity of ruling or himself obeying a master and that apprehending that another would exercise the supreme command without that clemency and moderation which he did he had rather chosen to rule than to obey so that caesar was faulty not so much in seizing upon the sovereignty which was become in a manner necessary as in not reestablishing the commonwealth by restoring the agrarian and the rotation of magistracies after he had got absolute and uncontrollable power and if caesar had seized upon the sovereignty only with a view of reestablishing liberty he had surpassed all mortals in godlike goodness as much as he did in the rest of his astonishing qualities i must confess i do not remember that we have any authority from the roman historians which may induce us to believe that caesar had any such design nor if he had had any such view could he who was the most secret the most prudent and the most discerning of men have discovered it before his parthian expedition was over for fear of utterly disobliging his veterans and caesar believed that expedition necessary for the honor and interest of the state and for his own glory  but of this we may be sure that two of the most discerning of all the romans and who had the deepest insight into the soul of caesar salust and cicero were not without hopes that caesar would really reestablish liberty or else they would not have attacked him upon it the one in his oration for marcus marcellus the other in the second part of that little treatise de republica ordinanda which is addressed to caesar haec igitur tibi reliqua pars says cicero hic restat actus in hoc elaborandum est ut rempublicam constituas eaque tu in primis composita summa tranquillitate and otio perfruare cicero therefore was not without hope that caesar would reestablish the commonwealth and any one who attentively peruses that oration of cicero will find that that hope was reasonably grounded upon his knowledge of the great qualities of caesar his clemency his beneficence his admirable discernment and that avoidless ruin in which the whole empire would be soon involved if caesar did not effect this salust urges it still more home to him and with greater vehemence he has recourse to every motive that may be thought to be powerful over so great a soul he exhorts him by the memory of his matchless conquests not to suffer the invincible empire of the roman people to be devoured by time or to be torn in pieces by discord one of which would soon and infallibly happen if liberty was not restored  he introduces his country and his progenitors urging him in a noble prosopopeia by all the mighty benefits which they had conferred upon him with so little pains of his own not to deny them that just and easy request of the restoration of liberty he adjures him by those furies which will eternally haunt his soul upon his impious refusal he implores him by the foresight of those dismal calamities that horrible slaughter those endless wars and that unbounded devastation which will certainly fall upon mankind if the restoration of liberty is prevented by his death or his incurable sickness and lastly he entreats him by his thirst of immortal glory that glory in which he now has rivals if he has not equals but which if he reestablishes liberty will be acknowledged by consenting nations to have neither equal nor second  i am apt to believe that if shakespeare had been acquainted with all this we had had from him quite another character of caesar than that which we now find in him he might then have given us a scene something like that which corneille has so happily used in his cinna something like that which really happened between augustus mecaenas and agrippa he might then have introduced caesar consulting cicero on the one side and on the other anthony whether he should retain that absolute sovereignty which he had acquired by his victory or whether he should reestablish and immortalize liberty that would have been a scene which might have employed the finest art and the utmost force of a writer that had been a scene in which all the great qualities of caesar might have been displayed i will not pretend to determine here how that scene might have been turned and what i have already said on this subject has been spoke with the utmost caution and diffidence but this i will venture to say that if that scene had been managed so as by the powerful motives employed in it to have shaken the soul of caesar and to have left room for the least hope for the least doubt that caesar would have reestablished liberty after his parthian expedition and if this conversation had been kept secret till the death of caesar and then had been discovered by anthony then had caesar fallen so beloved and lamented by the roman people so pitied and so bewailed even by the conspirators themselves as never man fell then there would have been a catastrophe the most dreadful and the most deplorable that ever was beheld upon the tragic stage then had we seen the noblest of the conspirators cursing their temerarious act and the most apprehensive of them in dreadful expectation of those horrible calamities which fell upon the romans after the death of caesar but sir when i write this to you i write it with the utmost deference to the extraordinary judgment of that great man who some years ago i hear altered the julius caesar and i make no doubt but that his fine discernment and the rest of his great qualities have amply supplied the defects which are found in the character of shakespeares caesar  i should here answer an argument by which some people pretend to prove and especially those with whom i lately conversed that shakespeare was conversant with the ancients but besides that the post is about to be gone i am heartily tired with what i have already writ and so doubtless are you i shall therefore defer the rest to the next opportunity and remain  your etc  letter iii on the writings and genius of shakespeare to mr  feb   sir i come now to the main argument which some people urge to prove that shakespeare was conversant with the ancients for there is say they among shakespeares plays one called the comedy of errors which is undeniably an imitation of the menechmi of plautus now shakespeare say they being conversant with plautus it undeniably follows that he was acquainted with the ancients because no roman author could be hard to him who had conquered plautus to which i answer that the errors which we have mentioned above are to be accounted for no other way but by the want of knowing the ancients or by downright want of capacity but nothing can be more absurd or more unjust than to impute it to want of capacity for the very sentiments of shakespeare alone are sufficient to show that he had a great understanding and therefore we must account some other way for his imitation of the menechmi i remember to have seen among the translations of ovids epistles printed by mr tonson an imitation of that from oenone to paris which mr dryden tells us in his preface to those epistles was imitated by one of the fair sex who understood no latin but that she had done enough to make those blush who understood it the best there are at this day several translators who as hudibrass has it  translate from languages of which they understand no part of speech i will not affirm that of shakespeare i believe he was able to do what pedants call construe but that he was able to read plautus without pain and difficulty i can never believe now i appeal to you sir what time he had between his writing and his acting to read any thing that could not be read with ease and pleasure we see that our adversaries themselves acknowledge that if shakespeare was able to read plautus with ease nothing in latinity could be hard to him how comes it to pass then that he has given us no proofs of his familiar acquaintance with the ancients but this imitation of the menechmi and a version of two epistles of ovid how comes it that he had never read horace of a superior merit to either and particularly his epistle to the pisos which so much concerned his art or if he had read that epistle how comes it that in his troylus and cressida we must observe by the way that when shakespeare wrote that play ben johnson had not as yet translated that epistle he runs counter to the instructions which horace has given for the forming the character of achilles  scriptor honoratum si forte reponis achillem impiger iracundus inexorablis acer jura neget sibi nata where is the impiger the iracundus or the acer in the character of shakespeares achilles who is nothing but a drolling lazy conceited overlooking coxcomb so far from being the honored achilles the epithet that homer and horace after him give him that he is deservedly the scorn and the jest of the rest of the characters even to that buffoon thersites  though shakespeare succeeded very well in comedy yet his principal talent and his chief delight was tragedy if then shakespeare was qualified to read plautus with ease he could read with a great deal more ease the translations of sophocles and euripides and though by these translations he would not have been able to have seen the charming coloring of those great masters yet would he have seen all the harmony and the beauty of their great and their just designs he would have seen enough to have stirred up a noble emulation in so exalted a soul as his how comes it then that we hear nothing from him of the oedipus the electra the antigone of sophocles of the iphigenias the orestes the medea the hecuba of euripides how comes it that we see nothing in the conduct of his pieces that shows us that he had the least acquaintance with any of these great masterpieces did shakespeare appear to be so nearly touched with the affliction of hecuba for the death of priam which was but daubed and bungled by one of his countrymen that he could not forbear introducing it as it were by violence into his own hamlet and would he make no imitation no commendation not the least mention of the unparalleled and inimitable grief of the hecuba of euripides how comes it that we find no imitation of any ancient play in this but the menechmi of plautus how came he to choose a comic preferably to the tragic poets or how comes he to choose plautus preferably to terence who is so much more just more graceful more regular and more natural or how comes he to choose the menechmi of plautus which is by no means his masterpiece before all his other comedies i vehemently suspect that this imitation of the menechmi was either from a printed translation of that comedy which is lost or some version in manuscript brought him by a friend or sent him perhaps by a stranger or from the original play it self recommended to him and read to him by some learned friend in short i had rather account for this by what is not absurd than by what is or by a less absurdity than by a greater for nothing can be more wrong than to conclude from this that shakespeare was conversant with the ancients which contradicts the testimony of his contemporary and his familiar acquaintance ben johnson and of his successor milton  lo shakespeare fancys sweetest child warbles his native woodnotes wild and of mr dryden after them both and which destroys the most glorious part of shakespeares merit immediately for how can he be esteemed equal by nature or superior to the ancients when he falls so far short of them in art though he had the advantage of knowing all that they did before him nay it debases him below those of common capacity by reason of the errors which we mentioned above therefore he who allows that shakespeare had learning and a familiar acquaintance with the ancients ought to be looked upon as a detractor from his extraordinary merit and from the glory of great britain for whether is it more honorable for this island to have produced a man who without having any acquaintance with the ancients or any but a slender and a superficial one appears to be their equal or their superior by the force of genius and nature or to have bred one who knowing the ancients falls infinitely short of them in art and consequently in nature it self great britain has but little reason to boast of its natives education since the same that they had here they might have had in another place but it may justly claim a very great share in their nature and genius since these depend in a great measure on the climate and therefore horace in the instruction which he gives for the forming the characters advises the noble romans for whose instruction he chiefly writes to consider whether the dramatick person whom they introduce is  colchus an assyrius thebis nutritus an argis thus sir i have endeavored to show under what great disadvantages shakespeare lay for want of the poetical art and for want of being conversant with the ancients  but besides this he lay under other very great inconveniences for he was neither master of time enough to consider correct and polish what he wrote to alter it to add to it and to retrench from it nor had he friends to consult upon whose capacity and integrity he could depend and though a person of very good judgment may succeed very well without consulting his friends if he takes time enough to correct what he writes yet even the greatest man that nature and art can conspire to accomplish can never attain to perfection without either employing a great deal of time or taking the advice of judicious friends nay it is the opinion of horace that he ought to do both  siquid tamen olim scripseris in metii descendat judicis aures et patris and nostras nonumque prematur in annum now we know very well that shakespeare was an actor at a time when there were seven or eight companies of players in the town together who each of them did their utmost endeavors to get the audiences from the rest and consequently that our author was perpetually called upon by those who had the direction and management of the company to which he belonged for new pieces which might be able to support them and give them some advantage over the rest and it is easy to judge what time he was master of between his laborious employment of acting and his continual hurry of writing as for friends they whom in all likelihood shakespeare consulted most were two or three of his fellowactors because they had the care of publishing his works committed to them now they as we are told by ben johnson in his discoveries were extremely pleased with their friend for scarce ever making a blot and were very angry with ben for saying he wished that he had made a thousand the misfortune of it is that horace was perfectly of bens mind   vos o pompilius sanguis carmen reprehendite quod non multa dies and multa litura coercuit atque praesectum decies non castigavit ad unguem and so was my lord roscommon  poets lose half the praise they should have got could it be known what they discreetly blot these friends then of shakespeare were not qualified to advise him as for ben johnson besides that shakespeare began to know him late and that been was not the most communicative person in the world of the secrets of his art he seems to me to have had no right notion of tragedy nay so far from it that he who was indeed a very great man and who has writ comedies by which he has born away the prize of comedy both from ancients and moderns and been an honor to great britain and who has done this without any rules to guide him except what his own incomparable talent dictated to him this extraordinary man has erred so grossly in tragedy of which there were not only stated rules but rules which he himself had often read and had even translated that he has chosen two subjects which according to those very rules were utterly incapable of exciting either compassion or terror for the principal characters which yet are the chief passions that a tragic poet ought to endeavor to excite so that shakespeare having neither had time to correct nor friends to consult must necessarily have frequently left such faults in his writings for the correction of which either a great deal of time or a judicious and a well natured friend is indispensably necessary  vir bonus and prudens versus reprehendet inertes culpabit duros incomptis allinet atrum transverso calamo signum ambitiosa recidet ornamenta parum claris lucem dare coget arguet ambigue dictum metanda notabit there is more than one example of every kind of these faults in the tragedies of shakespeare and even in the coriolanus there are lines that are utterly void of that celestial fire of which shakespeare is sometimes master in so great a degree and consequently there are lines that are stiff and forced and harsh and unmusical though shakespeare had naturally an admirable ear for the numbers but no man ever was very musical who did not write with fire and no man can always write with fire unless he is so far master of his time as to expect those hours when his spirits are warm and volatile shakespeare must therefore sometimes have lines which are neither strong nor graceful for who ever had force or grace that had not spirit there are in his coriolanus among a great many natural and admirable beauties three or four of those ornaments which horace would term ambitious and which we in english are apt to call fustian or bombast there are lines in some places which are very obscure and whole scenes which ought to be altered  i have sir employed some time and pains and that little judgment which i have acquired in these matters by a long and a faithful reading both of ancients and moderns in adding retrenching and altering several things in the coriolanus of shakespeare but with what success i must leave to be determined by you i know very well that you will be surpised to find that after all that i have said in the former part of this letter against shakespeares introducing the rabble into coriolanus i have not only retained in the second act of the following tragedy the rabble which is in the original but deviated more from the roman customs than shakespeare had done before me i desire you to look upon it as a voluntary fault and a trespass against conviction it is one of those things which are ad populum phalerae and by no means inserted to please such men as you  thus sir have i laid before you a short but impartial account of the beauties and defects of shakespeare with an intention to make these letters public if they are approved by you to teach some people to distinguish between his beauties and his defects that while they imitate the one they may with caution avoid the other there being nothing of more dangerous contagion to writers and especially to young ones than the faults of great masters and while with milton they applaud the great qualities which shakespeare had by nature they may follow his wise example and form themselves as he assures us that he himself did upon the rules and writings of the ancients  sir if so candid and able a judge as yourself shall happen to approve of this essay in the main and to excuse and correct my errors that indulgence and that correction will not only encourage me to make these letters public but will enable me to bear the reproach of those who would fix a brand even upon the justest criticism as the effect of envy and ill nature as if there could possibly be any ill nature in the doing justice or in the endeavoring to advance a very noble and a very useful art and consequently to prove beneficent to mankind as for those who may accuse me of the want of a due veneration for the merit of an author of so established a reputation as shakespeare i shall beg leave to tell them that they choose the wrongest time that they could possibly take for such an accusation as that for i appeal to you sir who shows most veneration for the memory of shakespeare he who loves and admires his charms and makes of them one of his chief delights who sees him and reads him over and over and still remains unsatiated and who mentions his faults for no other reason but to make his excellency the more conspicuous or he who pretending to be his blind admirer shows in effect the utmost contempt for him preferring empty effeminate sound to his solid beauties and manly graces and deserting him every night for an execrable italian ballad so vile that a boy who should write such lamentable dogrel would be turned out of westminsterschool for a desperate blockhead too stupid to be corrected and amended by the harshest discipline of the place i am  sir yours etc  to the spectator upon his paper on the   th of april you know mr spectator that esquire bickerstaff attacked the sharpers with success but shadwell is of opinion that your bully with his box and his false dice is an honester fellow than the rhetorical author who makes use of his tropes and figures which are his high and his lowrunners to cheat us at once of our money and of our intellectuals  i would not have you think mr spectator that this reflection is directed to you it is only intended against one or two of your correspondents and particularly the innsofcourtman who as you told us in your second paper supplies you with most of your criticism who seems to me so little to understand the province that he has undertaken that you would do well to advise him to do by you as he has done by his father and make a bargain in the gross with some honest fellow to answer all your occasions which wholesome advice if he proves too obstinate or too proud to take i am confident at least that he is too gallant a person to take it ill if once a week or once a fortnight i should show so much presumption as to cause a writ of error to be issued out to reverse his templejudgment  i cannot wonder that criticism should degenerate so vilely at a time when poetry and acting are sunk so low for as hobbes has observed that as often as reason is against a man a man will be against reason so as often as the rules are against an author an author will be against the rules men first write foolish ridiculous tragedies which shock all the rules of reason and philosophy and then they make foolish extravagant rules to fit those foolish plays it is impossible that your gentleman of the innsofcourt could have sent you so much wrong sense as there is in your paper of the   th if he had not formerly writ an absurd tragedy there are as many bulls and blunders and contradictions in it almost as there are lines and all delivered with that insolent and that blustering air which usually attends upon error and delusion while truth like the deity that inspires it comes calmly and without noise  to set a few of his errors in their proper light he tells us in the beginning of that paper that the english writers of tragedy are possessed with a notion that when they represent a virtuous or innocent person in distress they ought not to leave him till they have delivered him out of his trouble and made him triumph over his enemies  but mr spectator is this peculiar to the english writers of tragedy have not the french writers of tragedy the same notion does not racine tell us in the preface to his iphigenia that it would have been horrible to have defiled the stage with the murder of a princess so virtuous and so lovely as was iphigenia  but your correspondent goes on this error says he with an insolent and dogmatick air they have been led into by a ridiculous doctrine in modern criticism that they are obliged to an equal distribution of rewards and punishments and an impartial execution of poetical justice  but who were the first who established this rule he is not able to tell i take it for granted that a man who is ingenuous enough to own his ignorance is willing to be instructed let me tell him then that the first who established this ridiculous doctrine of modern criticism was a certain modern critic who lived above two thousand years ago and who tells us expressly in the thirteenth chapter of his critical spectator which pedants call his poetic that since a tragedy to have all the beauty of which it is capable ought to be implex and not simple by the way mr spectator you must bear with this critical cant as we do with your speculations and lucubrations and ought to move compassion and terror for we have already shown that the exciting these passions is the proper effect of a tragical imitation it follows necessarily that we must not choose a very good man to plunge him from a prosperous condition into adversity for instead of moving compassion and terror that on the contrary would create horror and be detested by all the world  and does not the same deluded philosopher tell us in the very same chapter that the fable to which he gives the second preference is that which has a double constitution and which ends by a double catastrophe a catastrophe favorable to the good and fatal to the wicked is not here mr spectator a very formal recommendation of the impartial and exact execution of poetical justice thus aristotle was the first who established this ridiculous doctrine of modern criticism but mr rymer was the first who introduced it into our native language who notwithstanding the rage of all the poetasters of the times whom he has exasperated by opening the eyes of the blind that they may see their errors will always pass with impartial posterity for a most learned a most judicious and a most useful critic now is not your correspondent a profound and a learned person and ought he not to own himself obliged to me for this notable piece of erudition  but he goes on in his dictatorian way this rule says he whoever established it has i am sure no foundation in nature in reason and in the practice of the ancients but what will this dogmatick person say now when we show him that this contemptible doctrine of poetical justice is not only founded in reason and nature but is it self the foundation of all the rules and even of tragedy itself for what tragedy can there be without a fable or what fable without a moral or what moral without poetical justice what moral where the good and the bad are confounded by destiny and perish alike promiscuously thus we see this doctrine of poetical justice is more founded in reason and nature than all the rest of the poetical rules together for what can be more natural and more highly reasonable than to employ that rule in tragedy without which that poem cannot exist well but the practice of the ancients is against this poetical justice what always mr spectator will your correspondent have the assurance to affirm that no but sometimes why then sometimes the ancients offended against reason and nature and who ever believed that the ancients were without fault or brought tragedy to its perfection but i shall take another opportunity to show that the practice of the ancients in all their masterpieces is exactly according to this fundamental rule i have not time to do that in this short letter because that would necessarily oblige me to show that poetical justice is of a much larger extent than this profound critic imagines but yet i shall give the discerning reader a hint of it in that which follows  poetical justice says your correspondent has no foundation in nature and reason because we find that good and evil happen alike to all men on this side the grave in answer to which he must give me leave to tell him that this is not only a very false but a very dangerous assertion that we neither know what men really are nor what they really suffer  it is not always that we know mens crimes but how seldom do we know their passions and especially their darling passions and as passion is the occasion of infinitely more disorder in the world than malice for where one man falls a sacrifice to inveterate malice a thousand become victims to revenge and ambition and whereas malice has something that shocks human nature passion is pleasingly catching and contagious can any thing be more just than that that providence which governs the world should punish men for indulging their passions as much as for obeying the dictates of their most envenomed hatred and malice  thus you see for ought we know good and evil does not happen alike to all men on this side the grave because it is for the most part by their passions that men offend and it is by their passions for the most part that they are punished but this is certain that the more virtue a man has the more he commands his passions but the virtuous alone command them the wicked take the utmost care to dissemble and conceal them for which reason we neither know what our neighbors are nor what they really suffer man is too finite too shallow and too empty a creature to know another man thoroughly to know the creature of an infinite creator but dramatical persons are creatures of which a poet is himself the creator and though a mortal is not able to know the almightys creatures he may be allowed to know his own to know the utmost extent of their guilt and what they ought to suffer nay he must be allowed not only to know this himself but to make it manifest and unquestionable to all his readers and hearers the creatures of a poetical creator have no dissimulation and no reserve we see their passions in all their height and in all their deformity and when they are unfortunate we are never to seek for the cause  but suppose i should grant that there is not always an equal distribution of affliction and happiness here below man is a creature who was created immortal and a creature consequently that will find a compensation in futurity for any seeming inequality in his dealing here but the creatures of a poetical creator are imaginary and transitory they have no longer duration than the representation of their respective fables and consequently if they offend they must be punished during that representation and therefore we are very far from pretending that poetical justice is an equal representation of the justice of the almighty  we freely confess that it is but a very narrow and a very imperfect type of it so very narrow and so very imperfect that it is forced by temporal to represent eternal punishments and therefore when we show a man unfortunate in tragedy for not restraining his passions we mean that every one will for such neglect unless he timely repents be infallibly punished by infinite justice either here or hereafter  if upon this foot we examine the tragedies of sophocles and euripides we shall find that in their most beautiful pieces they are impartial executors of poetic justice and it is upon this foot that aristotle requires that we should examine them your correspondent i must confess is in the right when he says that that philosopher declares for tragedies whose catastrophes are unhappy with relation to the principal characters but then what instructions does he give us for the forming those principal characters we are neither to make them very virtuous persons on the one side that is persons who absolutely command their passions nor on the other side villains who are actuated by inveterate malice but something between these two that is to say persons who neglecting their passions suffer them to grow outrageous and to hurry them to actions which they would otherwise abhor and that philosopher expressly declares as we have shown above that to make a virtuous man unhappy that is a man who absolutely commands his passions would create horror instead of compassion and would be detested by all the world and thus we have shown that aristotle is for poetical justice notwithstanding that he is for unhappy catastrophes and so one would think was your correspondent for when he enumerates and commends some english tragedies which have unfortunate catastrophes there are not two of those which he commends whose principal characters can be said to be innocent and consequently there are not two of them where there is not a due observance of poetical justice  thus mr spectator i have discussed the business of poetical justice and shown it to be the foundation of all tragedy and therefore whatever persons whether ancient or modern have writ dialogues which they call tragedies where this justice is not observed those persons have entertained and amused the world with romantic lamentable tales instead of just tragedies and of lawful fables  it is not my business at present to take any farther notice of the errors of your correspondent perhaps i no more approve of tragicomedies or tragedies with double plots than he does but i hope he will not take it ill if i put him in mind that several of the plays which he recommended before are tragicomedies and that most of them have double plots but he is vilely mistaken if he thinks that tragicomedy is of the growth of our english theaters  i shall take another opportunity to show him that he is as much mistaken in what he has said of humors as in what he dictates concerning poetical justice  i am your very humble  letter to the spectator upon his paper on the   th of april sir i have read over your paper of the   th with a great deal of satisfaction and here return you my acknowledgments for the honor you have done me in quoting two of my verses with applause i think my self obliged in gratitude my worthy friend to do as much honor to your judgment as you have done to my imagination and as you have the goodness to allow me to be an humorous poet i am bound in justice to celebrate you for a wonderful critic and to make it appear that contrary to the observation of the author of a late rhapsody one who has shown himself no great poet may be a prodigious judge indeed the observation of that author is so far from being true that most of the critics ancient and modern have been no poets and most of the poets ancient and modern have been no critics i cannot find out that any but homer and virgil and horace and sophocles and euripides among the ancients were great critics for who can believe that has read them that apollonius rhodius nonnus lucan statius and silius italicus ever so much as heard that nature and the philosophers her interpreters and commentators had laid down rules for an epick poem and who that has read the moderns could imagine that most of their dramatick poets had ever so much as heard that there were such things as the rules as boileau has observed of the french that some persons among them had distinguished themselves by their rhimes who never knew how to distinguish lucan from virgil so some among our own rhimers have been renowned for versifying who never so much as knew that horace and milton were good poets and i can on the other side name several who never distinguished themselves by poetry who yet have obliged the world with criticisms which have been nonpareillos and the very topcritick of all those critics is my worthy friend the spectator  though who the devil could have ever expected to have found my worthy friend a critic after he had treated critics with so much contempt in two or three of his immortal tatlers and particularly in the   th and the    th where they are pronounced to be the silliest of mortals creatures forsooth who profess judgment though by the way mr spectator he who professes or practices poetry and does not profess judgment in it professes himself an ass it was from those tatlers and one or two more mr spectator that i guessed that you had a mortal aversion to criticism but now i find plainly that they were none of your own but were sent you by two or three damned poets who are a sort of offenders that have not half the charity which other malefactors are wont to show but bear eternal malice to their executioners  thus the invectives against critics and criticism were other peoples you were too wise to write any such thing as knowing that taste which declines so fast is only to be restored and maintained by criticism and therefore instead of writing invectives against it you have obliged the world with the thing it self with criticism upon criticism and such criticism  as those tatlers were the offspring of some certain poets which is manifest by their insipid satyr like the faint eagerness of vinegar decayed nothing is more clear than that the criticisms could be none but yours for as you may discover ex ungue leonem and ex pede hercules so in this case the prodigious offspring speaks and confesses the gigantick father  in your very folio of the   th of april how have you shown the finess of your discernment and the profundity of your penetration by your encomium of two verses of my translation of the fourth satyr of boileau it is now thirty years since i translated that satyr and consequently was a very boy at the time of that translation yet from that time to this the stupid age has been ignorant of the beauty of that couplet how very phlegmatic a wretch have i been and how illegitimate an offspring of mr bays not to know any thing of my own excellence till i heard of it from you  how little did i imagine when i translated that couplet that the great critic was then in embrio who thirty years afterward should declare it to be a charming couplet by giving it a place in his never dying speculations  i am perfectly convinced my most worthy and most ingenious friend that we authors are as blind and as partial judges of our own works as we are unrighteous ones of other peoples i was apt to imagine before i submitted my own opinion to the decisive authority of your judgment that you would have done more for the credit of my genius and of your own discernment by commending the following verses of the fourth book of the poem upon the battle of ramelies when you had so fair an occasion of taking notice of them as you had at the writing the   th tatler if i begin the verses a little higher than the couching of the cataracts which is the subject of the   th tatler i am confident you will have the goodness to pardon me and the rather because you discovered more than a common satisfaction when you were present with your friend mr a at the reading those verses in manuscript a celestial spirit visits the duke of marlborough in a vision the night before the battle of ramelies and after he has said several other things to him goes on thus  a wondrous victory attends thy arms great in it self and in its sequel vast whose ecchoing sound through all the west shall run transporting the glad nations all around who often shall doubt and often suspend their joy and often imagine all an empty dream the conqueror himself shall cry amazed it is not our work alas we did it not the hand of god the hand of god is here for thee so great shall be thy high renown that fame shall think no music like thy name around the circling globe it shall be spread and to the worlds last ages shall endure and the most lofty most aspiring man shall want the assurance in his secret prayers to ask such high felicity and fame as heaven has freely granted thee yet this that seems so great so glorious to thee now would look how low how vile to thy great mind if i could set before thy astonished eyes the excess of glory and the excess of bliss that is prepared for thy expiring soul when thou arrivst at everlasting day o could embodied mind but comprehend the glories of the intellectual world or i the blissful secret were allowed but fate forbids to mortals to reveal o i could lay a scene before thy eyes which would distract thee with transporting joy fire the rich blood in thy illustrious veins make every nerve with fierce convulsions start blast all thy spirits and thy life destroy thou could not taste the extatick bliss and live as one who has lived thirty tedious years and ever since his wretched birth been dark his visual orbs with cloudy films overcast and in the dungeon of the body dwelt in utter ignoranceof natures works and wonders of this vast material world and has no notion ever conceived of light or colors or the verdant flowery earth or the stupendous prospect of the sky if then he finds some artist whose nice hand couches the cataracts and clears his eyes and all at once a flood of glorious light and this bright temple of the universe the crystal firmament the blazing sun all the amazing glories of the heavens all the great makers high magnificence come rushing through his eyes upon his soul he cannot bear thastonishing delight but starts exclaims and stamps and raves and dies so the vast glories of the upper world if they were set before embodied mind would oppress nature and extinguish life these are the verses my most discerning friend that i thought might have been preferred to the forementioned couplet especially since they would as it were have introduced themselves whereas the couplet is dragged in by extreme violence but i submit to your infallible judgment not in the least suspecting that my worthy friend can have any malice in this affair and insert that couplet in his immortal speculations only on purpose to expose me no far be it from me to entertain any such jealousy of my dearest friend who is so good so kind so beneficent and who has so often given himself the glorious title of the lover and benefactor of mankind who could imagine that one who has given himself that glorious appellation could ever be prompted by malice or passion or interest thus slily and hypocritically to abuse one whom he had called his friend  i have been apt to believe likewise my worthy friend that you would have been kinder to your self and to me if instead of commending the forementioned couplet you had taken some notice of the following verses which are in my paraphrase upon the te deum especially when you had so fair an occasion to mention them as you had at the writing the    th tatler the couplet of the translated satyr was introduced by violence but how very naturally would the following verses of the paraphrase have been mentioned either before or after the last paragraph of the forementioned paper where a spirit is introduced who after he has spoke of that part of the creation which is too little for human sight comes afterward to speak of the immense objects of nature after this manner  tat     i must acknowledge for my own part that although it is with much delight that i see the traces of providence in these instances i still see greater pleasure in considering the works of the creation in their immensity than in their minuteness for this reason i rejoice when i strengthen my sight so as to make it pierce into the most remote spaces and take a view of those heavenly bodies which lie out of the reach of human eyes though assisted by telescopes what you look upon as one confused white in the milky way appears to me a long tract of heavens distinguished by stars that are ranged in proper figures and constellations while you are admiring the sky in a starry night i am entertained with a variety of worlds and suns placed one above another and rising up to such an immense distance that no created eye can see an end of them upon the writing this paragraph how could you avoid the making mention of verses which had the very same ideas and verses which you had formerly mentioned with applause in private conversation i know you will answer that you had entirely forgot them and therefore i take the liberty here to refresh your memory the angels are introduced in that paraphrase speaking to god and saying after other things that which follows  wherever at utmost stretch we cast our eyes through the vast frightful spaces of the skies even there we find thy glory there we gaze on thy bright majestys unbounded blaze ten thousand suns prodigious globes of light at once in broad dimensions strike our sight millions behind in the remoter skies appear but spangles to our wearied eyes and when our wearied eyes want farther strength to pierce the voids immeasurable length our vigorous towering thoughts still farther fly and still remoter flaming worlds descry but even an angels comprehensive thought cannot extend so far as thou have wrought our vast conceptions are by swelling brought swallowed and lost in infinite to naught how glad am i that the forementioned verses were writ before the abovenamed tatlers otherwise i should have been thought to have borrowed from my worthy friend without making any manner of acknowledgment only adding or endeavoring to add to what i borrowed a little of that spirit and elevation and magnificence of expression which the greatness of the hints required  it is for this reason that i am glad the verses were printed some years before the prose for you know my dear friend that a plagiary in general is but a scandalous creature a sort of a spiritual outlaw and ought to be treated as such by all the members of the commonwealth of learning but a plagiary from living authors is most profligately impudent and in so slow and splenatick a nation as ours most unjust and barbarous for among us any thing that is admirably good is twenty or thirty years before it comes to be understood and how infinitely base is it in the mean while to deprive an author of any thing that is valuable in him and to intercept his coming praise as laws are made for the security of property what pity it is that there are not some enacted for the security of a mans thoughts and inventions which alone are properly his for land is alienable and treasure is transitory and both must at one time or other pass either by his own voluntary act or by the violence and injustice of others or at least by fate and therefore nothing is truly and really a mans own   puncto quod mobilis horae nunc prece nunc precio nunc vi nunc sort suprema permutet dominos and cedat in altera jura it is only a mans thoughts and inventions that are properly his being alone things that can never be alienated from him neither by force nor persuasion nor by fate it self and though another may basely usurp the honor of them yet they must for ever rightfully belong to their first inventor thus even the richest and the happiest of men have nothing that is truly and really their own but their thoughts and inventions but authors for the most part and especially poets have nothing that can so much as be called their own but their thoughts it is for those alone and the glory which they expect from those that they entirely quit their pretensions to riches and renounce the pomps and vanities of this wicked world and therefore to endeavor to deprive them of those is exceedingly inhuman what a joy it is to think that the precedence of times sets me free from the imputation of this injustice had i been capable of doing this and doing it to my worthy friend of wronging my dearest friend in this manner who knows how far that barbarity might have extended it self i might have proceeded to have upbraided him with some weak place in his neverdying folios and having forcibly deprived him of his silver and his gold have pelted him with his brass and his copper out of counterfeit anger or pretended scorn because they were of no richer metal  but the case of my dear friend is vastly different you have that reputation and the world has that opinion of your merit that they will be so far from believing that you have obligations to a living author which you have not that though you had really made thus bold with me it would have been impossible to have convinced above forty or fifty people of it and here my dear friend at the same time that i acknowledge your uncommon merit i cannot but congratulate your incomparable felicity it being plain that you have got more reputation in three years time than milton has done in fifty years or than shakespeare has in an hundred i shall therefore judiciously conclude with the generality of your readers that you have a merit paramount to that of all british authors both living and dead and that you have not only more merit than any one moralist either ancient or modern but that if you continue your paper three years longer you will have as much merit as they have all together i am  my dear friend with great respect and fidelity your etc  march the  th    0   mr spectator you tell us in your fourth paper that you know peoples thoughts by their eyes how apt we are all to imagine fine things of our selves especially we authors mr spectator there was a certain friend of mine a squire lately defunct who made the very same boast that you do and yet he recommended a pettifogger to me for an honest fellow who diving into my secrets betrayed me to those very people with whom he pretended to serve me a pettifogger through whose eyes even i and several others who pretend to none of my friend the squires profundity can discern the working of his mischievous thoughts as plainly as i can see the operations of bees through a crystal hive  as soon mr spectator as i found my self betrayed i began to enquire into this fellows character though if you were to look between his two eyes you would swear there was no occasion for it for mr spectator he tells you what he is when he only looks on you and uniting in his pettifogging person both your noble attributes is at one and the same time tatler and spectator in short though he is an errant traitor in his heart his face is a plain dealer and lets you immediately without ceremony and without reserve into the inmost secrets of his soul  upon enquiry i found his character to be as extraordinary as his person he is by politics a jacobite by moral principle a setter and a betrayer by religion a quaker an utter foe to all civil and religious ceremony unless it be drinking the pretenders health on his knees to whom alone of the race of men he has been true and faithful by this one may guess that his education has been very extraordinary i find upon the most curious enquiry that i have been able to make that the only schools that ever he has been at have been spunging houses and countygaols and that his two universities have been the fleet and the queensbench  i hope mr spectator that this letter may afford you a hint for a lucubration or a speculation or whatever other learned term you may be pleased to give it which by discovering to your readers the error and the frailty of the squire lately defunct may convince them how little we know even those with whom we daily converse alas our judgments of one another are empty and superficial and either built upon vain appearances or the reports of those who neither truly know us nor speak what they really think of us but often traduce us and misrepresent us in order to comfort or vindicate or to support themselves  but of all mankind there are none who know the rest of men so little as the generality of your authors for this pettifogger was so foolish a rogue that any one might see through him at first sight and yet my friend the squire was stark blind to him by the way you may know that my friend the squire was an author as celebrated an author as you are mr spectator a pennyfolio author he got some reputation by his lucubrations but had the fault of most authors who have more imagination than judgment he could not leave off when he was well not considering mr spectator that had honest sir martin left off in time his mistress had never made the discovery that warner played and sung for him i am  your etc  to the spectator mr spectator i have a short case of conscience to put to you to you who have established your self in the office of ductor dubitantium general about january last i happened to have an obligation to a certain author an obligation that reposed a trust in me which i have since discharged being pleased with the frankness of this authors doing this i resolved upon reading his celebrated pennyfolios i mean upon reading them in order for till then i had read but here and there one and none at all of the first two months the first thing that i observed in them was that i was endeavored to be exposed and calumniated clandestinely and perfidiously by one who at the same time caressed me whereeer he saw me and called himself my friend and all this only to serve a poor pitiful turn which was to establish the opera at the expense of dramatick poetry i say of dramatick poetry mr spectator if it had not been for which that author had long since been in the dust the quere is whether the foresaid obligation ought to debar me of the right of vindicating the truth and my self it was not long after this mr spectator that the abovesaid author repented him so far of the obligation he had laid on me that he insulted and affronted me several times most barbarously by a wretch so despicable and so impotent that it would have been cowardice to have beat him a wretch whose character will come enclosed to you in the same cover with this and not content with that endeavored once more to expose me in his quotidian folios the second quere is mr spectator whether i am not free now i am got quit of the obligation which was laid upon me though it had been far greater than it was to show my just resentment which i am about to do by publishing three or four modest letters which i have picked and culled from the numerous company of those which are more bitter and which i resolve to suppress in order to show that i have a soul that is capable of remembering obligations as well as of revenging injuries i impatiently expect your decision in this matter in the mean time it seems to me that common sense obliges me to believe that no man can have an obligation strong enough laid on him to make him pass by a box on the ear or the being exposed in print without returning each of the affronts in kind i
