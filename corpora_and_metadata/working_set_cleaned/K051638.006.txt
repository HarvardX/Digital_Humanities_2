clarissa  or the history of a young lady comprehending the most important concerns of private life and particularly showing the distresses that may attend the misconduct both of parents and children in relation to marriage  published by the editor of pamela  vol vi  london printed for s richardson and sold by john osborn in paternoster row by andrew millar over against catharinestreet in the strand by j and j rivington in st pauls churchyard and by j leake at bath  mdccxlviii  the history of miss clarissa harlowe vol vi letter i mr lovelace to john belford esquire friday june  0 i am ruined undone blownup destroyed and worse than annihilated that is certain  but was not the news shocking enough do thou think without thy throwing into the too weighty scale reproaches which thou could have had no opportunity to make but for my own voluntary communications at a time too when as it falls out i have another very sensible disappointment to struggle with  i imagine if there be such a thing as future punishment it must be none of the smallest mortifications that a new devil shall be punished by a worse old one and take that and take that to have the old satyr cry to the screaming sufferer laying on with a catoninetails with a star of burning brass at the end of each and for what for what  why if the truth might be fairly told for not being so bad a devil as myself  thou art surely casuist good enough to know what i have insisted upon vol iii p         heretofore that the sin of seducing a credulous and easy girl is as great as that of bringing to your lure an incredulous and watchful one  however ungenerous an appearance what i am going to say may have from my pen let me tell thee that if such a lady as miss harlowe chose to enter into the matrimonial state i am resolved to disappoint thee in thy meditated triumph over my rage and despair and according to the old patriarchal system to go on contributing to get sons and daughters with no other view than to bring them up piously and to be good and useful members of the commonwealth what a devil had she to do to let her fancy run a gadding after a rake one whom she knew to be a rake  o but truly she hoped to have the merit of reclaiming him she had formed pretty notions how charmingly it would look to have a penitent of her own making dangling at her side to church through an applauding neighborhood and as their family increased marching with her thither at the head of their boys and girls processionally as it were boasting of the fruits of their honest desires as my good lord bishop has it in his license and then what a comely fight all kneeling down together in one pew according to eldership as we have seen in effigy a whole family upon some old monument where the honest chevalier in armor is presented kneeling with uplift hands and half a dozen jolterheaded cropeared boys behind him ranged gradatim or stepfashion according to age and size all in the same posture  facing his pious dame with a ruff about her neck and as many wheyfaced girls all kneeling behind her an altar between them and an opened book upon it over their heads semilunary rays darting from gilded clouds surrounding an atchievementmotto in coelo salus  or quies  perhaps if they have happened to live the usual married life of brawl and contradiction  it is certainly as much my misfortune to have fallen in with miss clarissa harlowe were i to have valued my reputation or ease as it is that of miss harlowe to have been acquainted with me and after all what have i done more than prosecute the maxims by which thou and i and every rake are governed and which before i knew this lady we have pursued from pretty girl to pretty girl as fast as we had set one down taking another up  just as the fellows do with their flyingcoaches and flyinghorses at a countryfair  with a who rides next who rides next  but here in the present case to carry on the volant metaphor for i must either be merry or mad is a pretty little miss just come out of her hangingsleeve coat brought to buy a pretty little fairing for the world jack is but a great fair thou know and to give thee serious reflection for serious all its toys but tinselled hobbyhorses gilt gingerbread squeaking trumpets painted drums and so forth   now behold this pretty little miss skimming from booth to booth in a very pretty manner one pretty little fellow called wyerly perhaps another jiggeting rascal called biron a third simpering varlet of the name of symmes and a more hideous villain than any of the rest with a long bag under his arm and parchment settlements taggd to his heels yleped solmes pursue her from rareeshow to rareeshow shouldering upon one another at every turning stopping when she stops and set a spinning again when she moves  and thus dangled after but still in the eye of her watchful guardians traverses the pretty little miss through the whole fair equally delighted and delighting till at last taken with the invitation of the lacdhat orator and seeing several pretty little bibwearers stuck together in the flyingcoaches cutting safely the yielding air in the onegoup the othergodown picture oftheworld vehicle and all with as little fear as wit is tempted to ride next  in then suppose she slily pops when none of her friends are near her and if after two or three ups and downs her pretty head turns giddy and she throws herself out of the coach when at its elevation and so dashes out her pretty little brains who can help it  and would you hang the poor fellow whose professed trade it was to set the pretty little creatures a flying  it is true this pretty little miss being a very pretty little miss being a very muchadmired little miss being a very good little miss who always minded her book and had passed through her samplardoctrine with high applause had even stitched out in gaudy propriety of colors an abraham offering up isaac a samson and the philistines and flowers and knots and trees and the sun and the moon and the seven stars all hung up in frames with glasses before them for the admiration of her future grandchildren who likewise was entitled to a very pretty little estate who was descended from a pretty little family upwards of one hundred years gentility which lived in a very pretty little manner respected a very little on their own accounts a great deal on hers   for such a pretty little miss as this to come to so very great a misfortune must be a very sad thing but tell me would not the losing of any ordinary child of any other less considerable family of less shining or amiable qualities have been as great and as heavy a loss to that family as the losing this pretty little miss to hers  to descend to a very low instance and that only as to personality have thou any doubt that thy strongmuscled bony face was as much admired by thy mother as if it had been the face of a lovelace or any other handsome fellow and had thy picture been drawn would she have forgiven the painter had he not expressed so exactly thy lineaments as that every one should have discerned the likeness the handsome likeness is all that is wished for ugliness made familiar to us with the partiality natural to fond parents will be beauty all the world over  do thou apply  but alas jack all this is but a copy of my countenance drawn to evade thy malice  though t answer thy unfriendly purpose to own it i cannot forbear to own it that i am stung to the very soul with this unhappy  accident must i call it  have i nobody whose throat either for carelessness or treachery i ought to cut in order to pacify my vengeance   when i reflect upon my last iniquitous intention the first outrage so nobly resented as well as so far as she was able so nobly resisted i cannot but conclude that i was under the power of fascination from these accursed circes who pretending to know their own sex would have it that there is in every woman a yielding or a weakresisting moment to be met with and that yet and yet and yet i had not tried enough  but that if neither love nor terror should enable me to hit that lucky moment when by help of their cursed arts she was once overcome she would be for ever overcome  appealing to all my experience to all my knowledge of the sex for a justification of their assertion  my appealed to experience i own was but too favorable to their argument for do thou think i could have held my purpose against such an angel as this had i ever before met with one so much in earnest to defend her honor against the unwearied artifices and perseverance of the man she loved why then were there not more examples of a virtue so immovable or why was this singular one to fall to my lot except indeed to double my guilt and at the same time to convince all that should hear of her story that there are angels as well as devils in the flesh  so much for confession and for the sake of humouring my conscience with a view likewise to disarm thy malice by acknowlegement since no one shall say worse of me than i will of myself on this occasion  one thing i will nevertheless add to show the sincerity of my contrition  it is this that if thou can by any means find her out within these three days or any time before she has discovered the stories relating to captain tomlinson and her uncle to be what they are and if thou can prevail upon her to consent i will actually in thy presence and his he to represent her uncle marry her  i am still in hopes it may be so  she cannot be long concealed  i have already set all engines at work to find her out and if i do what indifferent persons and no one of her friends as thou observest will look upon her will care to imbroil themselves with a man of my figure fortune and resolution  show her this part then or any other part of this letter at thy own discretion if thou can find her for after all methinks i would be glad that this affair which is bad enough in itself should go off without worse personal consequences to anybody else and yet it runs in my mind i know not why that sooner or later it will draw a few drops of blood after it except she and i can make it up between ourselves and this may be another reason why she should not carry her resentment too far  not that such an affair would give me much concern neither were i to choose my man or men for i heartily hate all her family but herself and ever shall  let me add that the ladys plot to escape appears to me no extraordinary one there was much more luck than probability that it should do since to make it succeed it was necessary that dorcas and will and sinclair and her nymphs should be all deceived or off their guard it belongs to me when i see them to give them my hearty thanks that they were and that their selfish care to provide for their own future security should induce them to leave their outward door upon their boltlatch and be cursed to them   mabell deserves a pitchsuit and a bonfire rather than the lustring and as her clothes are returned let the ladys be put to her others to be sent to her when it can be told whither  but not till i give the word neither for we must get the dear fugitive back again if possible  i suppose that my stupid villain who knew not such a goddessshaped lady with a mien so noble from the awkward and bentshouldered mabell has been at hamstead to see after her and yet i hardly think she would go thither he ought to go through every street where bills for lodgings are up to inquire after a newcomer the houses of such as deal in womens matters and tea coffee and suchlike are those to be inquired at for her if some tidings be not quickly heard of her i would not have either dorcas will or mabell appear in my sight whatever their superiors think fit to do  this though written in character is a very long letter considering it is not a narrative one or a journal of proceedings like some of my former for such will unavoidably and naturally as i may say run into length but i have so used myself to write a great deal of late that i know not how to help it yet i must add to its length in order to explain myself on a hint i gave at the beginning of it which was that i have another disappointment besides this of miss harlowes escape to bemoan  and what do think it is why the old peer pox of his tough constitution for that would have helped him on has made shift by fire and brimstone and the devil knows what to force the gout to quit the counterscarp of his stomach just as it had collected all its strength in order to storm the citadel of his heart in short they have by the mere force of stinkpots handgranades and popguns drove the slowworking pioneer quite out of the trunk into the extremities and there it lies nibbling and gnawing upon his great toe when i had hoped a fair end both of the distemper and the distempered  but i who could write to thee of laudanum and the wet cloth formerly yet let  000 l a year slip through my fingers when i had entered upon it more than in imagination for i had begun to ask the stewards questions and to hear them talk of fines and renewals and such sort of stuff deserve to be mortified  thou can not imagine how differently the servants and even my cousins look upon me since yesterday to what they did before neither the one nor the other bow and courtesy half so low  nor am i a quarter so often his honor and your honor as i was within these few hours with the former and as to the latter  it is cousin bobby again with the usual familiarity instead of sir and sir and if you please mr lovelace and now they have the insolence to congratulate me on the recovery of the best of uncles while i am forced to seem as much delighted as they when would it do me good i could sit down and cry my eyes out  i had bespoken my mourning in imagination after the example of a certain foreign minister who before the death or even last illness of charles ii as honest white kennet tells us had half exhausted blackwellhall of its fables an indication as the historian would insinuate that the monarch was to be poisoned and the ambassador in the secret  and yet fool that i was i could not take the hint  what a devil does a man read history for if he cannot profit by the examples he finds in it  but thus jack is an observation of the old peers verified that one misfortune seldom comes alone and so concludes  thy doublymortified lovelace  letter ii miss clarissa harlowe to miss how wednesday night june    o my dearest miss how once more have i escaped  but alas i my best felf have not escaped  oh your poor clarissa harlowe you also will hate me i fear  yet you will not when you know all   but no more of my self my lost self you that can rise in a morning to be blessed and to bless and go to rest delighted with your own reflections and in your unbroken unstarting slumbers conversing with saints and angels the former only more pure than yourself as they have shaken off the encumbrance of body you shall be my subject as you have long long been my only pleasure and let me at awful distance revere my beloved anna how and in her reflect upon what her clarissa harlowe once was   forgive oh forgive my rambling my peace is destroyed my intellects are touched and what flighty nonsense must you read if now you will vouchsafe to correspond with me as formerly   oh my best my dearest my only friend what a tale have i to unfold  but still upon self this vile this hated self  i will shake it off if possible and why should i not since i think except one wretch i hate nothing so much  self then be banished from self one moment for i doubt it will for no longer to inquire after a dearer object my beloved anna how  whose mind all robed in spotless white charms and irradiates  but what would i say   and how my dearest friend after this rhapsody which on reperusal i would not let go but to show you what a distracted mind dictates to my trembling pen how do you you have been very ill it seems that you are recovered my dear let me hear  that your mamma is well pray let me hear and hear quickly  this comfort surely is owing to me for if life is no worse than chequerwork i must now have a little white to come having seen nothing but black all unchequered dismal black for a great great while  and what is all this wild incoherence for  it is only to beg to know how you have been and how you now do by a line directed for mrs rachel clark at mr smiths a gloveshop in king street covent garden which although my abode is a secret to every body else will reach the hands of  your unhappy  but that is not enough   your miserable clarissa harlowe  letter iii mrs how to miss clarissa harlowe superscribed as directed in the preceding friday june  0 miss clarissa harlowe you will wonder to receive a letter from me i am sorry for the great distress you seem to be in such a hopeful young lady as you were  but see what comes of disobedience to parents  for my part although i pity you yet i much more pity your poor father and mother such education as they gave you such improvements as you made and such delight as they took in you  and all come to this   but pray miss dont make my nancy guilty of your fault which is that of disobedience i have charged her over and over not to correspond with one who has made such a giddy step it is not to her reputation i am sure you knew that i so charged her yet you go on corresponding together to my very great vexation for she has been very perverse upon it more than once evil communication miss  you know the rest  here people cannot be unhappy by themselves but they must involve their friends and acquaintance whose discretion has kept them clear of their errors into near as much unhappiness as if they had run into the like of their own heads thus my poor daughter is always in tears and grief and she has postponed her own felicity truly because you are unhappy  if people who seek their own ruin could be the only sufferers by their headstrong doings it were something but o miss miss what have you to answer for who have made as many grieved hearts as have known you the whole sex is indeed wounded by you for who but miss clarissa harlowe was proposed by every father and mother for a pattern for their daughters  i write a long letter where i proposed to say but a few words and those to forbid you writing to my nancy and this as well because of the false step you have made as because it will grieve her poor heart and do you no good if you love her therefore write not to her your sad letter came into my hands nancy being abroad and i shall not show it her for there would be no comfort for her if she saw it nor for me whose delight she is  as you once was to your parents   but you seem to be sensible enough of your errors now so are all giddy girls when it is too late  and what a crestfallen figure then does their selfwilled obstinacy and headstrongness compel them to make  i may say too much only as i think it proper to bear that testimony against your rashness which it behooves every careful parent to bear and none more than  your compassionating well wisher annabella how i send this by a special messenger who has business only so far as barnet because you shall have no need to write again knowing how you love writing and knowing likewise that misfortune makes people plaintive    letter iv miss clarissa harlowe to mrs how saturday july   permit me madam to trouble you with a few lines were it only to thank you for your reproofs which have nevertheless drawn fresh streams of blood from a bleeding heart  my story is a dismal story it has circumstances in it that would engage pity and possibly a judgment not altogether unfavourable where those circumstances known but it is my business and shall be all my business to repent of my failings and not endeavor to extenuate them  but i will not seek to distress your worthy mind if i cannot suffer alone i will make as few parties as i can in my sufferings and indeed i took up my pen with this resolution when i wrote the letter which has fallen into your hands it was only to know and that for a very particular reason as well as for affection unbounded if my dear miss how from whom i had not heard of a long time were ill as i had been told she was and if so how she now does but my injuries being recent and my distresses having been exceeding great self would crowd into my letter when distressed the human mind is apt to turn itself to every one in whom it imagined or wished an interest for pity and consolation  or to express myself better and more concisely in your own words misfortune makes people plaintive and to whom if not to a friend can the afflicted complain  miss how being abroad when my letter came i flatter myself that she is recovered but it would be some satisfaction to me to be informed if she has been ill another line from your hand would be too great a favor but if you will be pleased to direct any servant to answer yes or no to that question i will not be farther troublesome  nevertheless i must declare that my miss howes friendship was all the comfort i had or expected to have in this world and a line from her would have been a cordial to my fainting heart judge then dearest madam how reluctantly i must obey your prohibition  but yet i will endeavor to obey it although i should have hoped as well from the tenor of all that has passed between miss how and me as from her established virtue that she could not be tainted by evil communication had one or two letters been permitted this however i ask not for since i think i have nothing to do but to beg of god who i hope has not yet withdrawn his grace from me although he is pleased to let loose his justice upon my faults to give me a truly broken spirit if it be not already broken enough and then to take to his mercy  the unhappy clarissa harlowe two favors good madam i have to beg of you  the first  that you will not let any of my relations know that you have heard from me the other  that no living creature be apprised where i am to be heard of or directed to this is a point that concerns me more than i can express  in short my preservation from further evils may depend upon it    letter v miss clarissa harlowe to hannah burton thursday june    my good hannah strange things have happened to me since you were dismissed my service so sorely against my will and your pert fellow servants set over me but that must be all forgotten now   how do you my hannah are you recovered of your illness if you are do you choose to come and be with me or can you conveniently  i am a very unhappy creature and being among all strangers should be glad to have you with me of whose fidelity and love i have had so many acceptable instances  living or dying i will endeavor to make it worth your while my hannah  if you are recovered as i hope and if you have a good place it may be they would bear with your absence and suffer somebody in your room for a month or so and by that time i hope to be provided for and you may then return to your place  dont let any of my friends know of this my desire whether you can come or not  i am at mr smiths a hosiers and gloveshop in king street covent garden  you must direct to me by the name of rachel clark  do my good hannah come if you can to your poor young mistress who always valued you and always will whether you come or not  i send this to your mother at st albans not knowing where to direct to you return me a line that i may know what to depend upon and i shall see you have not forgotten the pretty hand you were taught in happy days by  your true friend clarissa harlowe  letter vi hannah burton in answer monday july   honored maddam i have not forgot to write and never will forget any thing you my dear young lady was so good as to larn me i am very sorrowful for your misfortens my dearest young lady so sorrowful i do not know what to do gladd at heart would i be to be able to come to you but indeed i have not been able to stir out of my rome here at my mothers ever since i was forsed to leave my plase with a roomatise which has made me quite and clean helpless i will pray for you night and day my dearest my kindest my goodest young lady who have been so badly used and i am very sorry i cannot come to do you love and farvice which will ever be in the heart of me to do if it was in my power who am  your most dewtifull sarvant to command hannah burton  letter vii miss clarissa harlowe to mrs judith norton thursday june    my dear mrs norton i address myself to you after a very long silence which however was not owing either to want of love or duty principally to desire you to satisfy me in two or three points which it behooves me to know  my father and all the family i am informed are to be at my uncle harlowes this day as usual pray acquaint me if they have been there and if they were cheerful on the anniversary occasion and also if you have heard of any journey or intended journey of my brother in company with captain singleton and mr solmes  strange things have happened to me my dear worthy and maternal friend  very strange things  mr lovelace has proved a very barbarous and ungrateful man to me but god be praised i have escaped from him  being among absolute strangers though i think worthy folks i have written to hannah burton to come and be with me if the good creature fall in your way pray encourage her to come to me i always intended to have her she knows  but hoped to be in happier circumstances  say nothing to any of my friends that you have heard from me  pray do you think my father would be prevailed upon if i were to supplicate him by letter to take off the heavy curse he laid upon me at my going from harloweplace  i can expect no other favor from him but that being literally fulfilled as to my prospects in this life i hope it will be thought to have operated far enough  i am afraid my poor as i used to call the good creatures to whose necessities i was wont to administer by your faithful hands have missed me of late but now alas i am poor myself it is not the least aggravation of my fault nor of my regrets that with such inclinations as god had given me i have put it out of my power to do the good i once pleased myself to think i was born to do it is a sad thing my dearest mrs norton to render ourselves unworthy of the talents providence has entrusted to us  but these reflections are now too late and perhaps i ought to have kept them to myself let me however hope that you love me still pray let me hope that you do and then notwithstanding my misfortunes which have made me seem ungrateful to the kind and truly maternal pains you have taken with me from my cradle i shall have the happiness to think that there is one worthy person who hates not  the unfortunate clarissa harlowe pray remember me to my fosterbrother i hope he continues dutiful and good to you  be pleased to direct for rachel clark at mr smiths in king street covent garden but keep the direction an absolute secret    letter viii mrs norton in answer saturday july   your letter my dearest young lady cuts me to the heart why will you not let me know all your distresses  yet you have said enough  my son is very good to me a few hours ago he was taken with a feverish disorder but i hope it will go off happily if his ardour for business will give him the recess from it which his good master is willing to allow him he presents his duty to you and shed tears at hearing you sad letter read  you have been misinformed as to your familys being at your uncle harlowes they did not intend to be there nor was the day kept at all indeed they have not stirred out but to church and that but there times ever since the day you went away  unhappy day for them and forall who know you  to me i am sure most particularly so  my heart now bleeds more and more for you  i have not heard a syllable of such a journey as you mention of your brother captain singleton and mr solmes there has been some talk indeed of your brothers setting out for his northern estates but i have not heard of it lately  i am afraid no letter will be received from you it grieves me to tell you so my dearest young lady no evil can have happened to you which they do not expect to hear of so great is their antipathy to the wicked man and so bad is his character  i cannot but think hardly of their unforgivingness but there is no judging for others by ones self nevertheless i will add that if you had had as gentle spirits to deal with as your own or i will be bold to say as mine these evils had never happened either to them or to you i knew your virtue and your love of virtue from your very cradle and i doubted not but that with gods grace would always be your guard  but you could never be driven nor was there occasion to drive you  so generous so noble so discreet  but how does my love of your amiable qualities increase my affliction as these recollections must do yours  you are escaped my dearest miss  happily i hope  that is to say with your honor  else how great must be your distress  yet from your letter i dread the worst  i am very seldom at harlowe place the house is not the house it used to be since you went from it then they are so relentless and as i cannot say harsh things of the beloved child of my heart as well as bosom they do not take it amiss that i stay away  your hannah left her place ill some time ago and as she is still at her mothers at st albans i am afraid she continues ill if so as you are among strangers and i cannot encourage you at present to come into these parts i shall think it my duty to attend you let it be taken as it will as soon as my tommys indisposition will permit which i hope will be soon  i have a little money by me you say you are poor yourself  how grievous are those words from one entitled and accustomed to affluence  will you be so good to command it my beloved young lady  it is most of it your own bounty to me and i should take a pride to restore it to its original owner  your poor bless you and pray for you continually i have so managed your last benevolence and they have been so healthy and have had such constant employ that it has held out and will still hold out till happier times i hope betide their excellent benefactress  let me beg of you my dearest young lady to take to yourself all those aids which good persons like you draw from religion in support of their calamities let your sufferings be what they will i am sure you have been innocent in your intention so do not despond none are made to suffer above what they can and therefore ought to bear  we know not the methods of providence and what wise ends it may have to serve in its dispensations to its poor creatures  few persons have greater reason to say this than myself and since we are apt in calamities to draw more comfort from example than precept you will permit me to remind you of my own lot for who has had a greater share of afflictions than myself  to say nothing of the loss of an excellent mother at a time of life when motherly care is most wanted the death of a dear father who was an ornament to his cloth and who had qualified me to be his scribe and amanuensis just as he came within view of a preferment which would have made his family easy threw me friendless into the wide world threw me upon a very careless and which was much worse a very unkind husband poor man  but he was spared long enough thank god in a tedious illness to repent of his neglected opportunities and his light principles which i have always thought of with pleasure although i was left the more destitute for his chargeable illness and ready to be brought to bed when he died of my tommy  but this very circumstance which i thought the unhappiest that i could have been lest in so shortsighted is human prudence became the happy means of recommending me to your mother who in regard to my character and in compassion to my very destitute circumstances permitted me as i made a conscience of not parting with my poor boy to nurse both you and him born within a few days of each other and i have never since wanted any of the humble blessings which god has made me contented with  nor have i known what a very great grief was from the day of my poor husbands death till the day that your parents told me how much they were determined that you should have mr solmes when i was apprised not only of your aversion to him but how unworthy he was of you for then i began to dread the consequences of forcing so generous a spirit and till then i never feared mr lovelace attracting as was his person and specious his manners and address for i was sure you would never have him if he gave you not good reason to be convinced of his reformation nor till your friends were as well satisfied in it as yourself but that unhappy misunderstanding between your brother and mr lovelace and their joining so violently to force you upon mr solmes did all that mischief which has cost you and them so dear and poor me all my peace o what has not this ungrateful this doublyguilty man to answer for  nevertheless you know not what god has in store for you yet  but if you are to be punished all your days here for examplesake in a case of such importance for your one false step be pleased to consider that this life is but a state of probation and if you have your purification in it you will have you reward hereafter in a greater degree for submitting to the dispensation with patience and resignation  you see my dearest miss clary that i make no scruple to call the step you took a false one in you it was less excuseable than it would have been in any other young lady not only because of your superior talents but because of the opposition between your character and his so that if you had been provoked to quit your fathers house it needed not to have been with him nor needed i indeed but as an instance of my impartial love to have written this to you mrs norton having only the family representation and invectives to form her judgment upon knew not that clarissa had determined against going off with mr lovelace nor how solicitous she had been to procure for herself any other protection than his when she apprehended that if she staid she had no way to avoid being married to mr solmes   after this it will have an unkind and perhaps at this time an unseasonable appearance to express my concern that you have not before favored me with a line  yet if you can account to yourself for your silence i dare say i ought to be satisfied for i am sure you love me as i both love and honor you and ever will and the more for your misfortunes  one consolation methinks i have even when i am sorrowing for your calamities and that is that i know not any young person so qualified to shine the brighter for the trials she may be exercised with and yet it is a consolation that ends in adding to my regrets for your afflictions because you are blessed with a mind so well able to bear prosperity and to make everybody round you the better for it  woe unto him  o this wretched wretched man  but i will forbear till i know more  ruminating on every thing your melancholy letter suggests and apprehending from the gentleness of your mind the amiableness of your person and your youth the further misfortunes and inconveniences to which you may possibly be subjected i cannot conclude without asking for your leave to attend you and that in a very earnest manner  and i beg of you not to deny me on any consideration relating to myself or even to the indisposition of my other beloved child if i can be either of use or comfort to you were it my dearest young lady but for two or three days permit me to attend you although my sons illness should increase and compel me to come down again at the end of those two or thee days  i repeat my request likewise that you will command from me the little sum remaining in my hands of your bounty to your poor as well as that dispensed to  your everaffectionate and faithful servant judith norton  letter ix miss clarissa harlowe to lady betty lawrance thursday june    madam i hope you will excuse the freedom of this address from one who has not the honor to be personally known to you although you must have heard much of clarissa harlowe it is only to beg the favor of a line from your ladyships hand by the next post if convenient in answer to the following questions    whether you wrote a letter dated as i have a memorandum wedn june   congratulating your nephew lovelace on his supposed nuptials as reported to you by mr spurrier your ladyships steward as from one captain tomlinson  and in it reproaching mr lovelace as guilty of flight etc in not having acquainted your ladyship and the family with his marriage    whether your ladyship wrote to miss montague to meet you at reading in order to attend you to your cousin leesons in albemarlestreet on your being obliged to be in town on your old chanceryaffair i remember are the words and whether you bespoke your nephews attendance there on sunday night the   th    whether your ladyship and miss montague did come to town at that time and whether you went to hamstead on monday in a hired coach and four your own being repairing and took from thence to town the young creature whom you visited there  your ladyship will probably guess that these questions are not asked for reasons favorable to your nephew lovelace but be the answer what it will it can do him no hurt nor me any good only that i think i owe it to my former hopes however deceived in them and even to charity that a person of whom i was once willing to think better should not prove so egregiously abandoned as to be wanting in every instance to that veracity which is an indispensable in the character of a gentleman  be pleased madam to direct to me keeping the direction a secret for the present to be left at the bellesavage on ludgate hill till called for i am  your ladyships most humble servant clarissa harlowe  letter x lady betty lawrance to miss clarissa harlowe saturday july   dear madam i find that all is not as it should be between you and my nephew lovelace it will very much afflict me and all his friends if he has been guilty of any designed baseness to a lady of your character and merit  we have been long in expectation of an opportunity to congratulate you and ourselves upon an event most earnestly wished for by us all since all our hopes of him are built upon the power you have over him for if ever man adored a woman he is that man and you madam are that woman  miss montague in her last letter to me in answer to one of mine inquiring if she knew from him whether he could call you his or was likely soon to have that honor has these words i know not what to make of my cousin lovelace as to the point your ladyship is so earnest about he sometimes says he is actually married to miss cl harlowe at other times that it is her own fault if he be not  he speaks of her not only with love but with reverence yet owns that there is a misunderstanding between them but confesses that she is wholly faultless an angel and not a woman he says she is and that no man living can be worthy of her  this is what my niece montague writes  god grant my dearest young lady that he may not have so heinously offended you that you cannot forgive him if you are not already married and refuse to be his i shall lose all hopes that he ever will marry or be the man i wish him to be so will lord m so will lady sarah sadleir  i will now answer your questions but indeed i hardly know what to write for fear of widening still more the unhappy difference between you but yet such a young lady must command every thing from me this then is my answer  i wrote not any letter to him on or about the  th of june  neither i nor my steward know such a man as capt tomlinson  i wrote not to my niece to meet me at reading nor to accompany me to my cousin leesons in town  my chanceryaffair though like most chanceryaffairs it be of long standing is nevertheless now in so good a way that it cannot give me occasion to go to town  nor have i been in town these six months nor at hamstead for several years  neither shall i have any temptation to go to town except to pay my congratulatory compliments to mrs lovelace on which occasion i should go with the greatest pleasure and should hope for the favor of your accompanying me to glenhamhall for a month at least  be what will the reason of your inquiry let me entreat you my dear young lady for lord ms sake for my sake for this giddy mans sake soul as well as body and for all our familys sakes not to suffer this answer to widen differences so far as to make you refuse him if already he has not the honor of calling you his as i am apprehensive he has not by your signing by your familyname  and here let me offer to you my mediation to compose the difference between you be it what it will your cause my dear young lady cannot be put into the hands of anybody living more devoted to your service than into those of  your sincere admirer and humble servant eliz lawrance  letter xi miss clarissa harlowe to mrs hodges enfield june    mrs hodges i am under a kind of necessity to write to you having no one among my relations to whom i dare write or hope a line from if i did it is but o answer a question it is this  whether you know such a man as captain tomlinson and if you do whether he be very intimate with my uncle harlowe  i will describe his person lest possibly he should go by another name among you although i know not why he should  he is a thin tallish man a little pockfretten of a sallowish complexion fifty years of age or more of a good aspect when he looks up he seems to be a serious man and one who knows the world he stoops a little in the shoulders is of berkshire his wife of oxfordshire and has several children he removed lately into your parts from northamptonshire  i must desire you mrs hodges that you will not let my uncle nor any of my relations know that i write to you  you used to say that you would be glad to have it in your power to serve me that indeed was in my prosperity but i dare say you will not refuse me in a particular that will oblige me without hurting yourself  i understand that my father mother and sister and i presume my brother and my uncle antony are to be at my uncle harlowes this day god preserve them all and may they rejoice in many happy birthdays you will write six words to me concerning their healths  direct for a particular reason to mrs dorothy salcomb to be left till called for at the four swans inn bishopsgatestreet  you know my handwriting well enough were not the contents of the letter sufficient to excuse my name or any other subscription than that of  your

advarsity be your lot as well as prosprity for i am none of those as would do otherwis so noe more frum  your humbell sarvant to wish you well sarah hodges  letter xiii miss cl harlowe to lady betty lawrance monday july   madam i cannot excuse myself from giving your ladyship this one trouble more to thank you as i most heartily do for your kind letter  i must own to you madam that the honor of being related to ladies as eminent for their virtue as for their descent was at first no small inducement with me to lend an ear to mr lovelaces address and the rater as i was determined had it come to effect to do every thing in my power to deserve your favorable opinion  i had another motive which i knew would of itself give me merit with you your whole family a presumptuous one a punishably presumptuous one as it has proved in the hope that i might be an humble means in the hand of providence to reclaim a man who had as i thought good sense enough at bottom to be reclaimed or at least gratitude enough to acknowledge the intended obligation whether the generous hope were to succeed or not  but i have been most egregiously mistaken in mr lovelace the only man i persuade myself pretending to be a gentleman in whom i could have been so much mistaken for while i was endeavoring to save a drowning wretch i have been not accidentally but premeditatedly and of set purpose drawn in after him and he has had the glory to add to the list of those he has ruined a name that i will be bold to say would not have disparaged his own and this madam by means that would shock humanity to be made acquainted with  my whole end is served by your ladyships answer to the questions i took the liberty to put to you in writing nor have i a wish to make the unhappy man more odious to you than is necessary to excuse myself for absolutely declining your offered mediation  when your ladyship shall be informed of the following particulars  that after he had compulsatorily as i may say tricked me into the act of going off with him he could carry me to one of the vilest houses as it proved in london  that he could be guilty of a wicked attempt in resentment of which i found means to escape from him to hamstead  that after he had found me out there i know not how he could procure two women dressed out richly to personate your ladyship and miss montague who under pretense of engaging me to make a visit in town to your cousin leeson promising to return with me that evening to hamstead betrayed me back again to the vile house where again made a prisoner i was first robbed of my senses and then why should i seek to conceal that disgrace from others which i cannot hide from myself of my honor  when your ladyship shall know that in the shocking progress to this ruin wilful falsehoods repeated forgeries particularly of one letter from your ladyship another from miss montague and a third from lord m and numberless perjuries were not the least of his crimes  you will judge that i can have no principles that will make me worthy of an alliance with ladies of yours and your noble sisters character if i could not from my soul declare that such an alliance can never now take place  i will not offer to clear myself entirely of blame but as to him i have no fault to accuse myself of my crime was the corresponding with him at first when prohibited so to do by those who had a right to my obedience made still more inexcusable by giving him a clandestine meeting which put me into the power of his arts and for this i am content to be punished thankful that at last i have escaped from him and have it in my power to reject so wicked a man for my husband and glad if i may be a warning since i cannot be an example which once very vain and very conceited as i was i proposed to myself to be  all the ill i wish him is that he may reform and that i may be the last victim to his baseness perhaps this desirable wish may be obtained when he shall see how his wickedness his unmerited wickedness to a poor creature made friendless by his cruel arts will end  i conclude with my humble thanks to your ladyship for your favorable opinion of me and with the assurance that i will be while life is lent me  your ladyships grateful and obliged servant cl harlowe  letter xiv miss clarissa harlowe to mrs norton sunday evening july   how kindly my beloved mrs norton do you soothe the anguish of a bleeding heart surely you are my own mamma and by some unaccountable mistake i must have been laid to a family that having newly found out or at least suspected the imposture cast me from their hearts with the indignation that such a discovery will warrant  o that i had indeed been your own child born to partake of your humble fortunes an heiress only to that content in which you are so happy then should i have had a truly gentle spirit to have guided my ductile heart which force and ungenerous usage sit so ill upon and nothing of what has happened would have been  but let me take heed that i enlarge not by impatience the breach already made in my duty by my rashness since had i not erred my mother at least could never have been thought hardhearted and unforgiving  am i not then answerable not only for my own faults but for the consequences of them which tend to depreciate and bring disgrace upon a maternal character never before called in question  it is kind however in you to endeavor to extenuate the fault of one so greatly sensible of it  and could it be wiped off entirely it would render me more worthy of the pains you have taken in my education for it must add to your grief as it does to my confusion that after such promising beginnings i should have so behaved as to be a disgrace instead of a credit to you and my other friends  but that i may not make you think me more guilty than i am give me leave briefly to assure you that when my story is known i shall be entitled to more compassion than blame even on the score of going away with mr lovelace  as to all that happened afterward let me only say that although i must call myself a lost creature as to this world yet have i this consolation left me that i have not suffered either for want of circumspection or through credulity or weakness not one moment was i off my guard or unmindful of your early precepts but having been enabled to baffle many base contrivances i was at last ruined by arts the most inhuman but had i not been rejected by every friend this lowhearted man had not dared nor would have had opportunity to treat me as he has treated me  more i cannot at this time nor need i say and this i desire you to keep to yourself lest resntments should be taken up when i am gone that may spread the evil which i hope will end with me  i have been misinformed you say as to my principal relations being at my uncle harlowes the day you say was not kept nor have my brother and mr solmes  astonishing  what complicated wickedness has his wretched man to answer for  were i to tell you you would hardly believe there could have been such a heart in man   but one day you may know my whole story  at present i have neither inclination nor words  o my bursting heart  yet a happy a wished relief  were you present my tears would supply the rest  i resume my pen  and so you fear no letter will be received from me but dont grieve to tell me so i expect everything bad  and such is my distress that had you not bid me hope for mercy from the throne of mercy i should have been afraid that my fathers dreadful curse would be completed with regard to both worlds  for here an additional misfortune  in a fit of phrensical heedlesness i sent a letter to my beloved miss how without recollecting her private address and it is fallen into her angry mothers hands and so that dear friend perhaps has anew incurred displeasure on my account and here too your worthy son is ill and my poor hannah you think cannot come to me  o my dear mrs norton will you can you censure those whose resentments against me heaven seems to approve of and will you acquit her whom that condemns  yet you bid me not despond  i will not if i can help it  and indeed most seasonable consolation has your kind letter afforded me  yet to god almighty do i appeal to avenge my wrongs and vindicate my inno   but hushed be my stormy passions  have i not but this moment said that your letter gave me consolation  may those be forgiven who hinder my father from forgiving me  and this as to them shall be the harshest thing that shall drop from my pen  but although your son should recover i charge you my dear mrs norton that you do not think of coming to me i dont know still but your mediation with my mother although at present your interposition would be so little attended to may be of use to procure me the revocation of that most dreadful part of my fathers curse which only remains to be fulfilled the voice of nature must at last be heard in my favor surely it will only plead at first to my friends in the still conscious plaintiveness of a young and unhardened beggar  but it will grow more clamorous when i have the courage to be so and shall demand perhaps the paternal protection from further ruin and that forgiveness which those will be little entitled to expect for their own faults who shall interpose to have it refused to me for a accidental not a premeditated error and which but for them i had never fallen into  but again impatiency founded perhaps on selfpartiality that strange misleader prevails  let me briefly say that it is necessary to my present and future hopes that you keep well with my family and moreover should you come i may be traced out by your means by the most abandoned of men say not then that you think you ought to come up to me let it be taken as it will  for my sake let me repeat were my fosterbrother recovered as i hope he is you must not come nor can i want your advice while i can write and you can answer me and write i will as often as i stand in need of your counsel  then the people i am now with seem to be both honest and humane and there is in the same house a widowlodger of low fortunes but of great merit  almost such another serious and good woman as the dear one to whom i am now writing who has as she says given over all other thoughts of the world but such as shall assist her to leave it happily  how suitable to my own views  there seems to be a comfortable providence in this at least  so that at present there is nothing of exigence nothing that can require or even excuse your coming when so many better ends may be answered by your staying where you are a time may come when i shall want your last and best assistance and then my dear mrs norton  and then i will bespeak it and embrace it with my whole heart  and then will it not be denied me by anybody  you are very obliging in your offer of money but although i was forced to leave my clothes behind me yet i took several things of value with me which will keep me from present want you will say i have made a miserable hand of it  so indeed i have  and to look backward in a very little while too  but what shall i do if my father cannot be prevailed upon to recall his grievous malediction  of all the very heavy evils wherewith i have been afflicted this is now the heaviest for i can neither live nor die under it  o my dear mrs norton what a weight must a fathers curse have upon a mind so apprehensive of it as mine is  did i think i should ever have this to deprecate  but you must not be angry with me that i wrote not to you before you are very right and very kind to say you are sure i love you indeed i do and what a generosity is there so like yourself in your praise to attribute to me more than i merit in order to raise an emulation in me to deserve your praises  you tell me what you expect from me in the calamities i am called upon to bear may i but behave answerably  i can a little account to myself for my silence to you my kind my dear maternal friend how equally sweetly and politely do you express yourself on this occasion  i was very desirous for your sake as well as for my own that you should have it to say that we did not correspond had they thought we did every word you could have dropped in my favor would have been rejected and my mother would have been forbid to see you or to pay any regard to what you should say  they i had sometimes better and sometimes worse prospects before me my worst would only have troubled you to know my better made me frequently hope that by the next post or the next and so on for weeks i should have the best news to impart to you that then could happen cold as the wretch had made my heart to that best  for how could i think to write to you with a confession that i was not married yet lived in the house nor could i help it with such a man  who likewise had given it out to several that we were actually married although with restrictions that depended on the reconciliation with my friends and to disguise the truth or be guilty of a falsehood either direct or equivocal that was what you had never learnt me  but i might have written to you for advice in my precarious situation perhaps you will think but indeed my dear mrs norton i was not lost for want of advice and this will appear clear to you from what i have already hinted were i to explain myself no further  for what need had the cruel spoiler to have had recourse to unprecedented arts  i will speak out plainer still but you must not at present report it to stupefying potions and to the most brutal and outrageous force had i been wanting in my duty  a few words more upon this grievous subject   when i reflect upon all that has happened to me it is apparent that this generallysupposed thoughtless seducer has acted by me upon a regular and preconcerted plan of villainy  in order to set all his vile plots in motion nothing was wanting from the first but to prevail upon me either by force or fraud to throw myself into his power and when this was effected nothing less than the intervention of the paternal authority which i had not deserved to be exerted in my behalf could have saved me from the effect of his deep machinations opposition from any other quarter would but too probably have precipitated his barbarous and ungrateful violence and had you yourself been with me i have reason now to think that somehow or other you would have suffered in endeavoring to save me for never was there as now i see a plan of wickedness more steadily and uniformly pursued than his has been against an unhappy creature who merited better of him but the almighty has thought fit according to the general course of his providence to make the fault bring on its own punishment and that perhaps in consequence of my fathers dreadful imprecation that i might be punished here o my mamma norton pray with me that here it stop by the very wretch in whom i had placed my wicked confidence  i am sorry for your sake to leave off so heavily yet the rest must be brief  let me desire you to be secret in what i have communicated to you at least till you have my consent to divulge it  god preserve to you your more faultless child  i will hope for his mercy although i should not obtain that of any other person  and i repeat my prohibition  you must not think of coming up to  your everdutiful cl harlowe the obliging person who left yours for me this day promised to call tomorrow to see if i should have anything to return i would not lose so good an opportunity    letter xv mrs norton to miss clarissa harlowe monday night july   o the barbarous villainly of this detestable man  and is there a man in the world who could offer violence to so sweet a creature  and are you sure you are now out of his reach  you command me to keep secret the particulars of the vile treatment you have met with or else upon an unexpected visit which miss harlowe favored me with soon after i had received your melancholy letter i should have been tempted to own i had heard from you and to have communicated to her such parts of your two letters as would have demonstrated your penitence and your earnestness to obtain the revocation of your fathers malediction as well as his protection from outrages that may still be offered to you but then your sister would probably have expected a sight of the letters and even to been have permitted to take them with her to the family  yet they must one day be acquainted with the sad story  and it is impossible but they must pity you and forgive you when they know your early penitence and your unprecedented sufferings and that you have fallen by the brutal force of a barbarous ravisher and not by the vile arts of a seducing lover  the wicked man gives it out at lord ms as miss harlowe tells me that he is actually married to you  yet she believes it not nor had i the heart to let her know the truth  she put it close to me whether i had not corresponded with you from the time of your going away i could safely tell her as i did that i had not but i said that i was well informed that you took extremely to heart your fathers imprecation and that if she would excuse me i would say it would be a kind and sisterly part if she would use her interest to get you discharged from it  among other severe things she told me that my partial fondness for you made me very little consider the honor of the rest of the family but if i had not heard this from you she supposed i was set on by miss how  she expressed herself with a good deal of bitterness against that young lady who it seems everywhere and to everybody for you must think that your story is the subject of all conversations rails against your family treating them as your sister says with contempt and even with ridicule  i am sorry such angry freedoms are taken for two reasons first because such liberties never do any good i have heard you own that miss how has a satirical vein but i should hope that a young lady of her sense and right cast of mind must know that the end of satire is not to exasperate but amend and should never be personal if it be as my good father used to say it may make an impartial person suspect that the satirist has a natural spleen to gratify which may be as great a fault in him as any of those which he pretends to censure and expose in others  perhaps a hint of this from you will not be thrown away  my second reason is that these freedoms from so warm a friend to you as miss how is known to be are most likely to be charged to your account  my resentments are so strong against this vilest of men that i dare not touch upon the shocking particulars which you mention of his baseness what defense indeed could there be against so determined a wretch after you were in his power i will only repeat my earnest supplication to you that black as appearances are you will not despair you calamities are exceeding great but then you have talents proportioned to your trials this everybody allows  suppose the worst and that your family will not be moved in your favor your cousin morden will soon arrive as miss harlowe told me if he should even be got over to their side he will however see justice done you and then may you live an exemplary life making hundreds happy and teaching young ladies to shun the snares in which you have been so dreadfully entangled  as to the man you have lost is an union with such a perjured heart as his with such an admirable one as yours to be wished for a base lowhearted wretch as you justly call him with all his pride of ancestry and more an enemy to himself with regard to his present and future happiness than to you in the barbarous and ungrateful wrongs he has done you i need not i am sure exhort you to despise such a man as this since not to be able to do so would be a reflection upon a sex to which you have always been an honor  your moral character is untainted the very nature of your sufferings as you well observe demonstrates that cheer up therefore your dear heart and do not despair for is it not god who governs the world and permits some things and directs others as he pleases and will he not reward temporary sufferings innocently incurred and piously supported with eternal felicity  and what my dear is this poor needles point of now to a boundless eternity  my heart however labors under a double affliction for my poor boy is very very bad  a violent fever  nor can it be brought to intermit  pray for him my dearest miss  for his recovery if god see fit  i hope god will see fit  if not how can i bear to suppose that  pray for me that he will give me that patience and resignation which i have been wishing to you i am my dearest young lady  your everaffectionate judith norton  letter xvi miss cl harlowe to mrs judith norton thursday july   i ought not especially at this time to add to your afflictions  but yet i cannot help communicating to you who now are my only soothing friend a new trouble that has befallen me  i had but one friend in the world besides you and she is utterly displeased with me see the next letter  it is grievous but for one moment to lie under a beloved persons censure and this through imputations that affect ones honor and prudence there are points so delicate you know my dear mrs norton that it is a degree of dishonor to have a vindication of ones self from them appear to be necessary in the present case my misfortune is that i know not how to account but by guess so subtle have been the workings of the dark spirit i have been unhappily entangled by for some of the facts that i am called upon to explain  miss how in short supposes she has found a flaw in my character i have just now received her severe letter but i shall answer it perhaps in better temper if i first consider yours for indeed my patience is almost at an end and yet i ought to consider that faithful are the wounds of a friend but so many things at once  o my dear mrs norton how shall so young a scholar in the school of affliction be able to bear such heavy and such various evils  but to leave this subject for a while and turn to your letter  i am very sorry miss how is so lively in her resentments on my account i have always blamed her very freely for her liberties of this sort with my friends i once had a good deal of influence over her kind heart and she made all i said a law to her but people in calamity have but little weight in anything or with anybody prosperity and independence are charming things on this account that they give force to the counsels of a friendly heart while it is thought insolence in the miserable to advise or so much as remonstrate  yet is miss how an invaluable person and is it to be expected that she should preserve the same regard for my judgment that she had before i forfeited all title to discretion with what face can i take upon me to reproach a want of prudence in her but if i can be so happy as to reestablish myself in her evervalued opinion i shall endeavor to enforce upon her your just observations on this head  you need not you say exhort me to despise such a man as him by whom i have suffered  indeed you need not for i would choose the cruellest death rather than to be his and yet my dear mrs norton i will own to you that once i could have loved him  ungrateful man  had he permitted me i once could have loved him yet he never deserved my love and was not this a fault but now if i can but keep out of his hands and procure the revocation of my fathers malediction it is all i wish for  reconciliation with my friends i do not expect nor pardon from them at least till in extremity and as a viaticum  o my beloved mrs norton you cannot imagine what i have suffered  but indeed my heart is broken i am sure i shall not live to take possession of that independence which you think would enable me to atone in some measure for my past conduct  while this is my opinion you may believe i shall not be easy till i can procure the revocation of that dreadful curse and if possible a last forgiveness  i wish to be left to take my own course in endeavoring to procure this grace yet know i not at present what that course shall be  i will write but to whom is my doubt calamity has not yet given me the assurance to address myself to my father my uncles well as they once loved me are hardhearted they never had their masculine passions humanized by the tender name of father of my brother i have no hope i have then but my mother and my sister to whom i can apply  and may i not my dearest mamma be permitted to lift up my trembling eye to your allchearing and your once more than indulgent your fond eye in hopes of seasonable mercy to the poor sick heart that yet beats with life drawn from your own dearer heart  especially when pardon only and not restoration is implored  yet were i able to engage my mothers pity would it not be a means to make her still more unhappy than i have already made her by the opposition she would meet with were she to try to give force to that pity  to my sister then i think i will apply  yet how hard hearted has my sister been  but i will not ask for protection and yet i am in hourly dread that i shall want protection  all i will ask for shall be only to be freed from the heavy curse that has operated as far as it can operate as to this life  and surely it was passion and not intention that carried it so very far as to the other  but why do i thus add to your distresses  it is not my dear mrs norton that i have so much feeling for my own calamity that i have none for yours since yours is indeed an addition to my own but you have one consolation a very great one which i have not  that your afflictions whether respecting your more or your less deserving child rise not from any fault of your own  but what can i do for you more than pray  assure yourself that in every supplication i put up for myself i will with equal fervor remember both you and your son for i am and ever will be  your truly sympathizing and dutiful clarissa harlowe  letter xvii miss how to miss clarissa harlowe superscribed for mrs rachel clark etc wednesday july   my dear clarissa i have at last heard from you from a quarter i little expected  from my mamma  she had for some time seen me uneasy and grieving and justly supposed it was about you and this morning dropped a hint which made me conjecture that she must have heard something of you more than i knew and when she found that this added to my uneasiness she owned she had a letter in her hands of yours dated the   th of june directed for me  you may guess that this occasioned a little warmth that could not be wished for by either  it is surprising my dear mighty surprising that knowing the prohibition i lay under of corresponding with you you could send a letter for me to our own house since it must be fifty to one that it would fall into my mothers hands as you find it did  in short she resented that i should disobey her i was as much concerned that she should open and withold from me my letters and at last she was pleased to compromise the matter with me by giving up the letter and permitting me to write to you once or twice she to see the contents of what i wrote for besides the value she has for you she could not but have a great curiosity to know the occasion of so sad a situation as your melancholy letter shows you to be in  but i shall get her to be satisfied with hearing me read what i write putting in between hooks thus  what i intend not to read to her  need i to remind you miss cl harlowe of three letters i wrote to you to none of which i had any answer except to the first and that a few lines only promising a letter at large though you were well enough the day after you received my second to go joyfully back again with him to the vile house but more of these byandby i must hasten to take notice of your letter of wednesday last week which you could contrive should fall into my mothers hands  let me tell you that that letter has almost broken my heart good god what have you brought yourself to miss clarissa harlowe  could i have believed that after you had escaped from the miscreant with such mighty pains and earnestness escaped and after such an attempt as he had made you would have been prevailed upon not only to forgive him but without being married too to return with him to that horrid house  a house i had given you such an account of  surprising  what an intoxicating thing is this love  i always feared that you even you were not proof against it  you your best self have not escaped  indeed i see not how you could expect to escape  what a tale have you to unfold  you need not unfold it my dear i would have engaged to prognosticate all that has happened had you but told me that you would once more have put yourself into his power after you had taken such pains to get out of it  your peace is destroyed  i wonder not at it since now you must reproach yourself for a credulity so illplaced  your intellect is touched  i am sure my heart bleeds for you but excuse me my dear i doubt your intellect was touched before you left hamstead or you would never have let him find you out there or when he did suffer him to prevail upon you to return to the horrid brothel  i tell you i sent you three letters the first of which dated the  th and  th of june see vol iv p     for it was wrote at twice came safe to your hands as you sent me word by a few lines dated the ninth had it not i should have doubted my own safety since in it i gave you such an account of the abominable house and threw such cautions in your way as to that tomlinson as the more surprised me that you could think of going back to it again after you had escaped from it and from lovelace  o my dear  but nothing now will i ever wonder at  the second dated june  0 see vol v p      was given into your own hand at hamstead on sunday the   th as you was lying upon a couch in a strange way according to my messengers account of you bloated and flushcoloured i dont know how  the third was dated the  0th of june ibid p  0   0   having not heard one word from you since the promising billet of the  th i own i did not spare you in it i ventured it by the usual conveyance by that wilsons having no other so cannot be sure you received it indeed i rather think you might not because in yours which fell into my mammas hands you make no mention of it and if you had had it i believe it would have touched you too much to have been passed by unnoticed  you have heard that i have been ill you say i had a cold indeed but it was so slight a one that it confined me not an hour but i doubt not that strange things you have heard and been told to induce you to take the step you took and till you did take that step the going back with this villain i mean i knew not a more pitiable case than yours  for every body must have excused you before who knew how you was used at home and was acquainted with your prudence and vigilance but alas my dear we see that the wisest people are not to be depended upon when love like an ignis fatuus holds up its misleading lights before their eyes  my mother tells me she sent you an answer desiring you not to write to me because it would grieve me to be sure i am grieved exceedingly grieved and disappointed too you must permit me to say for i had always thought that there never was such a woman at your years in the world  but i remember once an argument you held on occasion of a censure passed in company upon an excellent preacher who was not a very excellent liver preaching and practicing you said required quite different talents which when united in the same person made the man a saint as wit and judgment going together constituted a genius  you made it out i remember very prettily but you never made it out excuse me my dear more convincingly than by that part of your late conduct which i complain of  my love for you and my concern for your honor may possibly have made me a little of the severest if you think so place it to its proper account to that love and to that concern which will but do justice to  your afflicted and faithful a h postscript my mother would not be satisfied without reading my letter herself and that before i had fixed my proposed hooks she knows by this means and has excused our former correspondence  she indeed suspected it before and so she very well might knowing me and knowing my love of you  she has so much real concern for your misfortunes that thinking it will be a consolation to you and that it will oblige me she consents that you shall write to me the particulars at large of your sad story but it is on condition that i show her all that has passed between us relating to yourself and the vilest of men i have the more cheerfully complied as the communication cannot be to your disadvantage  you may therefore write freely and direct to our own house  my mother promises to show me the copy of her letter to you and your reply to it which latter she has but just told me of she already apologizes for the severity of hers and thinks the sight of your reply will affect me too much but having her promise i will not dispense with it  i doubt hers is severe enough so i fear you will think mine but you have taught me never to spare the fault for the friends sake and that a great error ought rather to be more inexcuseable in the person we value than in one we are indifferent to because it is a reflection upon our choice of that person and tends to a breach of the love of mind and to expose us to the world for our partiality to the love of mind i repeat since it is impossible but the errors of the dearest friend must weaken our inward opinion of that friend and thereby lay a foundation for future distance and perhaps disgust  god grant that you may be able to clear your conduct after you had escaped from hamstead as all before that time was noble generous and prudent the man a devil and you a saint  yet i hope you can and therefore expect it from you  i send by a particular hand he will call for your answer at your own appointment  i am afraid this horrid wretch will trace out by the postoffices where you are if not careful  to have money and will and head to be a villain is too much for the rest of the world when they meet in one man    letter xviii miss clarissa harlowe to miss how thursday july   few young persons have been able to give more convincing proofs than myself how little true happiness lies in the enjoyment of our own wishes  to produce one instance only of the truth of this observation what would i have given for weeks past for the favor of a letter from my dear miss how in whose friendship i placed all my remaining comfort little did i think that the next letter she would honor me with should be in such a style as should make me look more than once at the subscription that i might be sure the name not being written at length that it was not signed by another a h for surely thought i this is my sister arabellas style surely miss how blame me as she pleases in other points could never repeat so sharply upon her friend words written in the bitterness of spirit and in the disorder of head nor remind her with asperity and with mingled strokes of wit of an argument held in the gaiety of an heart elated with prosperous fortunes as mine then was and very little apprehensive of the severe turn that argument would one day take against herself  but what have i sunk in my fortunes my character forfeited my honor lost while i know it i care not who knows it destitute of friends and even of hope what have i to do to show a spirit of repining and expostulation to a dear friend because she is not more kind than a sister   i find by the rising bitterness which will mingle with the gall in my ink that i am not yet subdued enough to my condition and so begging your pardon that i should rather have formed my expectations of favor from the indulgence you used to show me than from what i now deserve to have shown me i will endeavor to give a particualr answer to your letter although it will take me up too much time to think of sending it by your messenger tomorrow he can put off his journey he says till saturday i will endeavor to have the whole narrative ready for you by saturday  but how to defend myself in every thing that has happened i cannot tell since in some part of the time in which my conduct appears to have been censurable i was not myself and to this hour know not all the methods taken to deceive and ruin me  you tell me that in your first letter you gave me such an account of the vile house i was in and such cautions about that tomlinson as make you wonder how i could think of going back  alas my dear i was tricked most vilely tricked back as you shall hear in its place  without knowing the house was so very vile a house from your intended information i disliked the people too much ever voluntarily to have returned to it but had you really written such cautions about tomlinson and the house as you seem to have purposed to do they must had they come in time have been of infinite service to me but not one word of either whatever was your intention did you mention to me in that first of the three letters you so warmly tell me you did send me i will enclose it to convince you the letter she incloses was mr lovelaces forged one see vol v p    and seq   but your account of your messengers delivering to me your second letter and the description he gives of me as lying upon a couch in a strange way bloated and flushcoloured you dont know how absolutely puzzles and confounds me  lord have mercy upon the poor clarissa harlowe what can this mean  who was the messenger you sent was he one of lovelaces creatures too  could nobody come near me but that mans confederates either setting out so or made so  i know not what to make of any one syllable of this  indeed i dont  let me see you say this was before i went from hamstead  my intellects had not then been touched  nor had i ever been surprised by wine strange if i had how then could i be found in such a strange way bloated and flushcoloured you dont know how  yet what a vile what a hateful figure has your messenger represented me to have made  but indeed i know nothing of any messenger from you  believing myself secure at hamstead i staid longer there than i would have done in hopes of the letter promised me in your short one of the  th brought me by my own messenger in which you undertake to send for and engage mrs townsend in my favor see vol v p      i wondered i heard not from you and was told you were sick and at another time that your mother and you had had words on my account and that you had refused to admit mr hickmans visits upon it so that i supposed at one time that you was not able to write at another that your mothers prohibition had its due force with you but now i have no doubt that the wicked man must have intercepted your letter and i wish he found not means to corrupt your messenger to tell you so strange a story  it was on sunday june    you say that the man gave it me i was at church twice that day with mrs moore mr lovelace was at her house the while where he boarded and wanted to have lodged but i would not permit that though i could not help the other in one of these spaces it must be that he had time to work upon the man you will easily my dear find that out by inquiring the time of his arrival at mrs moores and other circumstances of the strange way he pretended to see me in on a couch and the rest  had anybody seen me afterward when i was betrayed back to the vile house struggling under the operation of wicked potions and robbed indeed of my intellects for this as you shall hear was my dreadful case i might then perhaps have appeared bloated and flushcoloured and i know not how myself but were you to see your poor clarissa now or even to have seen her at hamstead before she suffered the vilest of all outrages you would not think her bloated or flushcoloured indeed you would not  in a word it could not be me your messenger saw nor if anybody who it was can i divine  i will now as briefly as the subject will permit enter into the darker part of my sad story and yet i must be somewhat circumstantial that you may not think me capable of reserve or palliation the latter i am not conscious that i need i should be utterly inexcuseable were i guilty of the former to you and yet if you knew how my heart sinks under the thoughts of a recollection so painful you would pity me  as i shall not be able perhaps to conclude what i have to write in even two or three letters i will begin a new one with my story and send the whole of it together although written at different periods as i am able  allow me a little pause my dear at this place and to subscribe my self  your everaffectionate and obliged clarissa harlowe  letter xix miss clarissa harlowe to miss how referred to in vol v p     thursday night he had found me out at hamstead strangely found me out for i am still at a loss to know by what means  i was loath in my billet of the  th see vol v p        to tell you so for fear of giving you apprehensions for me and besides i hoped then to have a shorter and happier issue account to you for through your assistance than i met with  she then gives a narrative of all that passed at hamstead between herself mr lovelace capt tomlinson and the women there to the same effect with that so amply given by mr lovelace mr lovelace finding all he could say and all capt tomlinson could urge ineffectual to prevail upon me to forgive an outrage so flagrantly premeditated rested all his hopes on a visit which was to be paid me by lady betty lawrance and miss montague  in my uncertain situation my prospects all so dark i knew not to whom i might be obliged to have recourse in the last resort and as those ladies had the best of characters insomuch that i had reason to regret that i had not from the first thrown my self upon their protection when i had forfeited that of my own friends i thought i would not shun an interview with them though i was too indifferent to their kinsman to seek it as i doubted not that one end of their visit would be to reconcile me to him  on monday the   th of june these pretended ladies came to hamstead and i was presented to them and they to me by their kinsman  they were richly dressed and stuck out with jewels the pretended lady bettys were particularly very fine  they came in a coach and four hired as was confessed while their own was repairing in town a pretense made i now perceive that i should not guess at the imposture by the want of the real ladys arms upon it lady betty was attended by her woman whom she called morrison a modest countrylooking person  i had heard that lady betty was a fine woman and that miss montague was a beautiful young lady genteel and graceful and full of vivacity such were these impostors and having never seen either of them i had not the least suspicion that they were not the ladies they personated and being put a little out of countenance by the richness of their dresses i could not help fool that i was to apologize for my own  the pretended lady betty then told me that her nephew had acquainted them with the situation of affairs between us and although she could not but say that she was very glad that he had not put such a slight upon his lordship and them as report had given them cause to apprehend the reasons for which report however she much approved of yet it had been matter of great concern to her and to her niece montague and would to the whole family to find so great a misunderstanding subsisting between us as if not made up might distance all their hopes  she could easily tell who was in fault she said  and gave him a look both of anger and disdain asking him how it was possible for him to give an offense of such a nature to so charming a lady so she called me as should occasion a resentment so strong  he pretended to be awed into shame and silence  my dearest niece said she and took my hand i must call you niece as well from love as to humor your uncles laudable expedient permit me to be not an advocate but a mediatrix for him and not for his sake so much as for my own my charlottes and all our familys the indignity he has offered to you may be of too tender a nature to be inquired into but as he declares that it was not a premeditated offense whether my dear for i was going to rise upon it in my temper it were or not and as he declares his sorrow for it and never did creature express a deeper sorrow for any offense than he and as it is a reparable one let us for this one time forgive him and thereby lay an obligation upon this man of errors  let us i say my dear for sir turning to him an offense against such a peerless lady as this must be an offense against me against your cousin here and against all the virtuous of our sex  see my dear what a creature he had picked out could you have thought there was a woman in the world who could thus express herself and yet be vile but she had her principal instructions from him and those written down too as i have reason to think for i have recollected since that i once saw this lady betty who often rose from her seat and took a turn to the other end of the room with such emotion as if the joy of her heart would not let her sit still take out a paper from her stays and look into it and put it there again she might oftener and i not observe it for i little thought that there could be such impostors in the world  i could not forbear paying great attention to what she said i found tears ready to start i drew out my handkerchief and was silent i had not been so indulgently treated a great while by a person of character and distinction such i thought her and durst not trust to the accent of my voice  the pretended miss montague joined in on this occasion and drawing her chair close to me took my other hand and besought me to forgive her cousin and consent to rank myself as one of the principals of a family that had long very long coveted the honor of my alliance  i am ashamed to repeat to you my dear now i know what wretches they are the tender the obliging and the respectful things i said to them  the wretch himself then came forward he threw himself at my feet how was i beset  the women grasping one my right hand the other my left the pretended miss montague pressing to her lips more than once the hand she held the wicked man on his knees imploring my forgiveness and setting before me my happy and my unhappy prospects as i should forgive or not forgive him all that he thought would affect me in his former pleas and those of capt tomlinson he repeated he vowed he promised he bespoke the pretended ladies to answer for him and they engaged their honors in his behalf  indeed my dear i was distressed perfectly distressed i was sorry that i had given way to this visit for i knew not how in tenderness to relations as i thought them so worthy to treat so freely as he deserved a man nearly allied to them  so that my arguments and my resolutions were deprived of their greatest force  i pleaded however my application to you i expected every hour i told them an answer from you to a letter i had written which would decide my future destiny  they offered to apply to you themselves in person in their own behalf as they politely termed it they besought me to write to you to hasten your answer  i said i was sure that you would write the moment that the event of an application to be made to a third person enabled you to write  but as to the success of their requests in behalf of their kinsman that depended not upon the expected answer for that i begged their pardon was out of the question i wished him well i wished him happy but i was convinced that i neither could make him so nor he me  then again how the wretch promised  how he vowed  how he entreated  and how the women pleaded and they engaged themselves and the honor of their whole family for his just his kind his tender behavior to me  in short my dear i was so hard set that i was obliged to come to a more favorable compromise with them than i had intended i would wait for your answer to my letter i said and if it made doubtful or difficult the change of measures i had resolved upon and the scheme of life i had formed i would then consider of the matter and if they would permit me lay all before them and take their advice upon it it conjunction with yours as if the one were my own aunt and the other were my own cousin  they shed tears upon this  of joy they called them  but since i believe to their credit bad as they are that they were tears of temporary remorse for the pretended miss montague turned about and as i remember said there was no standing it  but mr lovelace was not so easily satisfied he was fixed upon his villainous measures perhaps and so might not be sorry to have a pretense against me he bit his lip  he had been but too much used he said to such indifference such coldness in the very midst of his happiest prospects  i had on twenty occasions shown him to his infinite regret that any favor i was to confer upon him was to be the result of  there he stop  and not of my choice  this had like to have set all back again i was exceedingly offended but the pretended ladies interposed the elder severely took him to tsk he ought she told him to be satisfied with what i had said she dsired no other condition and what sir said she with an air of authority would you commit errors and expect to be rewarded for them  they then engaged me in more agreeable conversation  the pretended lady declared that she lord m and lady sarah would directly and personally interest themselves to bring about a general reconciliation between the two families and this either in open or private concert with my uncle harlowe as should be thought fit animosities on one side had been carried a great way she said and too little care had been shown on the other to mollify or heal my father should see that they could treat him as a brother and a friend and my brother and sister should be convinced that there was no room either for the jealousy or envy they had conceived from motives too unworthy to be avowed  could i help my dear being pleased with them   permit me here to break off the task grows too heavy at present for the heart of  your clarissa harlowe  letter xx miss clarissa harlowe in continuation i was very ill and obliged to lay down my pen i thought i should have fainted but am better now  so will proceed  the pretended ladies the more we talked seemed to be the fonder of me and the lady betty had mrs moore called up and asked her if she had accommodations for her niece and self her woman and two menservants for three or four days  mr lovelace answered for her that she had  she would not ask her dear niece lovelace  permit me my dear whispered she this charming style before strangers  i will keep your uncles secret whether she should be welcome or not to be so near her but for the time she should stay in these parts she would come up every night  what say you niece charlotte  the pretended charlotte answered she should like to do so of all things  the lady betty called her an obliging girl she liked the placed she said her cousin leeson would excuse her the air and my company would do her good she never chose to lie in the smoaky town if she could help it in short my dear said she to me i will stay till you hear from miss how and till i have your consent to go with me to glenhamhall not one moment will i be out of your company when i can have it stedman my solicitor as the distance from town is so small may attend me here for instructions niece charlotte one word with you child  they retired to the farther end of the room and talked about their nightdresses  the miss charlotte said morrison might be dispatched for them  true the other said  but she had some letters in her private box which she must have up and you know charlotte that i trust nobody with the keys of that  could not morrison bring up that box  no she thought it safest where it was she had heard of a robbery committed but two days ago at the foot of hamsteadhill and she should be ruined if she lost her box  well then it was but going to town to undress and she would leave her jewels behind her and return and should be the easier a great deal on all accounts  for my part i wondered they came up with them but that was to be taken as a respect paid to me and then they hinted at another visit of ceremony which they had thought to make had they not found me so inexpressibly engaging  they talked loud enough for me to hear them on purpose no doubt though in affected whispers and concluded with high praises of me  i was not fool enough to believe or to be puffed up with their encomiums yet not suspecting them i was not displeased at so favorable a beginning of acquaintance with ladies whether i were to be related to them or not of whom i had always heard honorable mention and yet at the time i thought highly as they exalted me that in some respects though i hardly knew in what they fell short of what i expected them to be  the grand deluder was at the farther end of the room another way probably to give me an opportunity to hear these preconcerted praises  looking into a book which had there not been a preconcert would not have taken his attention for one moment it was taylors holy living and dying  when the pretended ladies joined me he approached me with it in his hand  a smart book this my dear  this old divine affects i see a mighty flowery style upon a very solemn subject but it puts me in mind of an ordinary country funeral where the young women in honor of a defunct companion especially if she were a virgin or passed for such make a flowerbed of her coffin  and then laying down the book turning upon his heel with one of his usual airs of gaiety and are you determined ladies to take up your lodgings with my charming creature  indeed they were  never were there more cunning more artful impostors than these women practiced creatures to be sure yet genteel and they must have been welleducated  once perhaps as much the delight of their parents as i was of mine and who knows by what arts ruined body and mind  o my dear how pregnant is this reflection  but the man  never was there a man so deep never so consummate a deceiver except that detested tomlinson whose years and seriousness joined with a solidity of sense and judgment that seemed uncommon gave him one would have thought advantages in villainy the other had not time for hard very hard that i should fall into the knowledge of two such wretches when two more such i hope are not to be met with in the world  both so determined to carry on the most barbarous and perfidious projects against a poor young creature who never did or wished harm to either  take the following slight account of these womens and of this mans behavior to each other before me  mr lovelace carried himself to his pretended aunt with high respect and paid a great deference to all she said he permitted her to have all the advantage over him in the repartees and retorts that passed between them i could indeed easily see that it was permitted and that he forbore that acumen that quickness which he never spared showing to the pretended miss montague and which a man of wit seldom knows how to spare showing when an opportunity offers to display his wit  the pretended miss montague was still more reverent in her behavior to her aunt while the aunt kept up the dignity of the character she had assumed raillying both of them with the air of a person who depends upon the superiority which years and fortune give over younger persons who might have a view to be obliged to her either in her life or at her death  the severity of her raillery however was turned upon mr lovelace on occasion of the character of the people who kept the lodgings which she said i had thought my self so well warranted to leave privately  this startled me for having then no suspicion of the vile tomlinson i concluded and your letter of the  th his forged letter see vol v p    favored my conclusions that if the house were notorious either he or mr mennell would have given me or him some hints of it  nor although i liked not the people did i observe any thing in them very culpable till the wednesday night before that they offered not to come to my assistance although within hearing of my distress as i am sure they were and having as much reason to be frighted as i at the fire had it been real  i looked with indignation upon mr lovelace at this hint  he seemed abashed i have not patience but to recollect the specious looks of this vile deceiver but how was it possible that even this florid countenance of his should enable him to command a blush at his pleasure for blush he did more than once and the blush on this occasion was a deepdyed crimson unstrained for and natural as i thought  but he is so much of the actor that he seems able to enter into any character and his muscles and features appear entirely under obedience to his wicked will it is proper to observe that there was a more natural reason than this that the lady gives for mr lovelaces blushing it was a blush of indigntion as he owned afterward to his friend belford in conversation for his pretended aunt had mistaken her cue in condemning the house and he had much ado to recover the blunder being obliged to follow her lead and vary from his first design which was to have the people of the house spoken well of in order to induce her to return to it were it but on pretense to direct her clothes to be carred to hamstead   the pretended lady went on saying she had taken upon herself to inquire after the people on hearing that i had left the house in disgust and though she heard not any thing much amiss yet she heard enough to make her wonder that he would carry his spouse a person of so much delicacy to a house that if it had not a bad fame had not a good one  you must think my dear that i liked the pretended lady betty the better for this i suppose it was designed i should  he was surprised he said that her ladyship should hear a bad character of the people it was what he had never before heard that they deserved it was easy indeed to see that they had not very great delicacy though they were not indelicate the nature of their livelihood letting lodgings and taking people to board and yet he had understood that they were nice in these particulars led them to aim at being free and obliging and it was difficult he said for persons of cheerful dispositions so to behave as to avoid censure openness of heart and countenance in the sex more was the pity too often subjected good people whose fortunes did not set them above the world to uncharitable censure  he wished however that her ladyship would tell what she had heard although now it signified but little because he would never ask me to set foot within their doors again and he begged she would not mince the matter  nay no great matter she said but she had been informed that there were more women lodgers in the house than men yet that their visitors were more men than women and this had been hinted to her perhaps by illwillers she could not answer for that in such a way as if somewhat further were meant by it than was spoken  this he said was the true innuendo way of characterizing used by detractors everybody and everything had a black and a white side as illwillers and wellwillers were pleased to report he had observed that the front house was well let and he believed more to the one sex than to the other for he had seen occasionally passing to and o several genteel modestlooking women and who it was very probable were not so illbeloved but they might have visitors and relations of both sexes but they were none of them anything to us or we to them we were not once in any of their companies but in the genteelest and most retired house of the two which we had in a manner to ourselves with the use of a parlour to the street to serve us for a servants hall or to receive common visitors or our traders only whom we admitted not upstairs  he always loved to speak as he found no man in the world had suffered more from calumny than he himself had done  women he owned ought to be more scrupulous than men needed to be where they lodged nevertheless he wished that fact rather than surmise were to be the foundation of their judgments especially when they spoke of one another  he meant no reflection upon her ladyships informants or rather surmisants as he might call them be they who they would nor did he think himself obliged  defend characters impeached or not thought well of by women of virtue and honor neither were these people of importance enough to have so much said about them  the pretended lady betty said all who knew he would clear her of censoriousness that it gave  some opinion she must needs say of the people the he had continued there so long with me that i had rther negative than positive reasons of dislike to them and that so shrewd a man as she heard capt tomlison was had not objected to them  i think niece charlotte proceeded she as my nphew has not parted with these lodgings you and i for as my dear miss harlowe dislikes the people i would n ask her for her company will take a dish of tea with m nephew there before we go out of town and then  shall see what sort of people they are i have hear that mrs sinclair is a mighty forbidding creature  with all my heart madam in your ladyships company i shall make no scruple of going anywhither  it was ladyship at every word and as s seem proud of her title and of her dress too i might ha guessed that she was not used to either  what say you cousin lovelace lady sarah though melancholy woman is very inquisitive about all yo affairs i must acquaint her with every particular cumstance when i go down  with all his heart he would attend her whene she pleased she would see very handsome apartmen and very civil people  the duce is in them said the miss montague if the appear other to us  they then fell into familytalk familyhappiness on my hopefor accession into it they mentioned lord ms and lady sarahs great desire to see me how many friends and admirers with uplift hands i should have  o my dear what a triumph must these creatures and he have over the poor devoted all the time  what a happy man he would be  they would not the lady betty said give themselves the mortification but to suppose that i should not be one of them  presents were hinted at she resolved that i should go with her to glenhamhall she would not be refused although she were to stay a week beyond her time for me  she longed for the expected letter from you i must write to hasten it and to let miss how know how every thing stood since i wrote last that might dispose me absolutely in their favor and in her nephews and then she hoped there would be no occasion for me to think of entering upon any new measures  indeed my dear i did at the time intend if i heard not from you by morning to dispatch a man and horse to you with the particulars of all that you might if you thought proper at least put off mrs townsends coming up to another day  but i was miserably prevented  she made me promise that i would write to you upon this subject whether i heard from you or not one of her servants should ride post with my letter and wait for miss howes answer  she then launched out in deserved praises of you my dear how fond should she be of the honor of your acquaintance  the pretended miss montague joined in with her as well for herself as for her sister  abominably wellinstructed were they both  o my dear what risques may poor giddy girls run when they throw themselves out of the protection of their natural friends and into the wide world  they then talked again of reconciliation and intimacy with every one of my friends with my mother particularly and gave the dear good lady the praises that every one gives her who has the happiness to know her  ah my dear miss how i had almost forgot my resentments against the pretended nephew  so many agreeable things said made me think that if you should advise it and if i could bring my mind to forgive the wretch for an outrage so premeditatedly vile and could forbear despising him for that and his other ungrateful and wicked ways i might not be unhappy in an alliance with such a family yet thought i at the time with what intermixtures does every thing come to me that has the appearance of good  however as my lucidhopes made me see fewer faults in the behavior of these pretended ladies than recollection and abhorrence have helped me since to see i began to reproach myself that i had not at first thrown myself into their protection  but amidst all these delightful prospects i must not said the lady betty forget that i am to go to town  she then ordered her coach to be got to the door  we will all go to town together said she and return together morrison shall stay here and see every thing as i used to have it in relation to my apartment and my bed for i am very particular in some respects my cousin leesons servants can do all i want to be do with regard to my nightdresses and the like and i will be a little airing for you my dear and a good opportunity for mr lovelace to order what you want of your apparel to be sent from your former lodgings to mrs leesons and we can bring it up with us from thence  i had no intention to comply but as i did not imagine that she would insist upon my going to town wit them i made no answer to that part of her speech  i must here lay down my tired pen  recollection heartaffecting recollection how pains me  letter xxi miss clarissa harlowe to miss how in the midst of these agreeablenesses the coach ca to the door the pretended lady betty besough me to give them my company to their cousin leeson i desired to be excused yet suspected nothing she would not be denied how happy would a visit so condescending make her cousin leeson  her cousin leeson was not unworthy of my acquaintance and would take it for the greatest favor in the world  i objected my dress but the objection was not admitted she bespoke a supper of mrs moore to be ready at nine  mr lovelace vile hypocrite and wicked deceiver seeing as he said my dislike to go desired her ladyship not to insist upon it  fondness for my company was pleaded she begged me to oblige her made a motion to help me to my fan herself and in short was so very urgent that my feet complied against my speech and my mind and being in a manner led to the coach by her and made to step in first she followed me and her pretended niece and the wretch followed her and away it drove  nothing but the height to affectionate complaisance passed all the way over and over what a joy would this unexpected visit give her cousin leeson what a pleasure must it be to such a mind as mine to be able to give so much joy to everybody i came near  the cruel the savage seducer as i have since recollected was in rapture all the way but yet such a sort of rapture as he took visible pains to check  hateful villain  how i abhor him  what mischief must be then in his plotting heart  what a devoted victim must i be in all their eyes  though not pleased i was nevertheless just then thoughtless of danger they endeavoring thus to lift me up above all apprehension of that and above myself too  but think my dear what a dreadful turn all had upon me when through several streets and ways i knew nothing of the coach slackening its pace came within sight of the dreadful house of the dreadfullest woman in the world as she proved to me  lord be good unto me cried the poor fool looking out of the coach  mr lovelace  madam turning to the pretended aunt  madam turning to the niece my eyes and hands lifted up  lord be good unto me  what what what my dear  he pulled the string  what need to have come this way said he  but since we are i will but ask a question  my dearest life why this apprehension  the coachman stopped his servant who with one of her was behind alighted  ask said he if i have any letters  who knows my dearest creature turning to me but we may already have one from the captain  we will not go out of the coach  fear nothing  why so apprehensive  oh these fine spirits  cried the execrable insulter  dreadfully did my heart then misgive me i was ready to faint  why this terror my life  you shall not stir out of the coach  but one question now the fellow has drove us this way  your lady will faint cried the execrable lady betty turning to him  my dearest niece i will call you taking my hand we must alight if you are so ill  let us alight  only for a glass of water and hartshorn  indeed we must alight  no no no  i am well  quite well  will not the man drive on  i am well  quite well  indeed i am  man drive on putting my head out of the coach  man drive on  though my voice was too low to be heard  the coach stopped at the door how i trembled  dorcas came to the door on its stopping  my dearest creature said the vile man gasping as i were for breath you shall not alight  any letters for me dorcas  there are two sir and here is a gentleman mr belton sir waits for your honor and has done so above an hour  i will just speak to him open the door  you shant step out my dear  a letter perhaps from the captain already  you shant step out my dear  i sighed as if my heart would burst  but we must step out nephew your lady will faint  maid a glass of hartshorn and water  my dear yo must step out  you will faint child  we must cut you laces  i believe my complexion was all manner of colors by turns  indeed you must step out my dear  he knew he said i should be well the moment the coach drove from the door i should not alight by his soul i should not  lord lord nephew lord lord cousin both women in a breath what ado you make about nothing  you persuade your lady to be afraid of alighting  see you not that she is just fainting  indeed madam said the vile seducer my dearest love must not be moved in this point against her will  i beg it may not be insisted upon  fiddlesaddle foolish man  what a pother is here  i guess how it is you are ashamed to let us see what sort of people you carried your lady among  but do you go out and speak to your friend and take your letters  he stepped out but shut the coachdoor after him to oblige me  the coach may go on madam said i  the coach shall go on my dear life said he  but he gave not nor intended to give orders that it should  let the coach go on said i  mr lovelace may come after us  indeed my dear you are ill  indeed you must alight  alight but for one quarter of an hour  alight but to give order yourself about your things whom can you be afraid of in my company and my nieces  these people must have behaved shockingly to you  please the lord i will inquire into it  i will see what sort of people they are  immediately came the old creature to the door a thousand pardons dear madam stepping to the coachside if we have anyway offended you  be pleased ladies to the other two to alight  well my dear whispered the lady betty i now find that an hideous description of a person we never saw is an advantage to them i thought the woman was a monster but really she seems tolerable  i was afraid i should have fallen into fits but still refused to go out  man  man  man cried i gaspingly my head out of the coach and in by turns half a dozen times running drive on  let us go  my heart misgave me beyond the power of my own accounting for it for still i did not suspect these women but the antipathy i had taken to the vile house and to find myself so near it when i expected no such matter with the sight of the old creature all together made me behave like a distracted person  the hartshorn and water was brought the pretended lady betty made me drink it heaven knows if there were any thing else in it  besides said she whisperingly i must see what sort of creatures the nieces are want of delicacy cannot be hid from me you could not surely my dear have this aversion to reenter a house for a few minutes in our company in which you lodged and boarded several weeks unless these women could be so presumptuously vile as my nephew ought not to know  out stepped the pretended lady the servant at her command having opened the door  dearest madam said the other let me follow you for i was next the door fear nothing i will not stir from your presence  come my dear said the pretended lady give me your hand holding out hers oblige me this once  i will bless your footsteps said the old creature if once more you honor my house with your presence  a crowd by this time was gathered about us but i was too much affected to mind that  again the pretended miss montague urged me standing up as ready to go out if i would give her room lord my dear said she who can bear this crowd  what will people think  the pretended lady again pressed me with both her hands held out  only my dear to give orders about your things  and thus pressed and gazed at for then i looked about me the women so richly dressed people whispering in an evil moment out stepped i trembling forced to lean with both my hands frighted too much for ceremony on the pretended lady bettys arm  o that i had dropped down dead upon the guilty threshold  we shall stay but a few minutes my dear  but a few minutes said the same specious jilt  out of breath with her joy as i have since thought that they had thus triumphed over the unhappy victim  come mrs sinclair i think your name is show us the way  following her and leading me i am very thirsty you have frighted me my dear with your strange fears i must have tea made if it can be done in a moment we have further to go mrs sinclair and must return to hamstead this night  it shall be ready in a moment cried the wretch we have water boiling  hasten then  come my dear to me as she led me through the passage to the fatal inner house  lean upon me  how you tremble  how you faulter in your steps  dearest niece lovelace the old wretch being in hearing why these hurries upon your spirits  well begone in a minute  and thus she led the poor sacrifice into the old wretchs too wellknown parlour  never was anybody so gentle so meek so lowvoiced as the odious woman drawing out in a puling accent all the obliging things she could say awed i then thought by the conscious dignity of a woman of quality glittering with jewels  the called for tea was ready presently  there was no mr belton i believe for the wretch went not to anybody unless it were while we were parlying in the coach no such person however appeared at the teatable  i was made to drink two dishes with milk complaisantly urged by the pretended ladies helping me each to one i was stupid to their hands and when i took the tea almost choked with vapors and could hardly swallow  i thought transiently thought that the tea the last dish particularly had an odd taste they on my palating it observed that the milk was london milk far short in goodness of what they were accustomed to from their own dairies  i have no doubt that my two dishes and perhaps my hartshorn were prepared for me in which case it was more proper for their purpose that they should help me than that i should help myself ill before i found myself still more and more disordered in my head a heavy torpid pain increasing fast upon me but i imputed it to my terror  nevertheless at the pretended ladies motion i went up stairs attended by dorcas who affected to weep for joy that once more she saw my blessed face that was the vile creatures word and immediately i set about taking out some of my clothes ordering what should be put up and what sent after me  while i was thus employed up came the pretended lady betty in a hurrying way  my dear you will not be long before you are ready my nephew is very busy in writing answers to his letters so i will just whip away and change my dress and call upon you in an instant  o madam  i am ready i am now ready  you must not leave me here and down i sunk affrighted into a chair  this instant this instant i will return  before you can be ready  before you can have packed up your things  we would not be late  the robbers we have heard of may be out  dont let us be late  and away she hurried before i could say another word her pretended niece went with her without taking notice to me of her going  i had no suspicion yet that these women were no indeed the ladies they personated and i blamed myself for my weak fears  it cannot be thought i that such ladies will abet treachery against a poor creature they are so fond of they must undoubtedly be the persons they appear to be  what folly to doubt it the air the dress the dignity of women of quality  how unworthy of them and of my charity concluded i is this ungenerous shadow of suspicion  so recovering my stupefied spirits as well as they could be recovered for i was heavier and heavier and wondered to dorcas what ailed me rubbing my eyes and taking some of her snuff pinch after pinch to very little purpose i pursued my employment but when that was over all packed up that i designed to be packed up and i had nothing to do but to think and found them tarry so long i thought i should have gone distracted i shut myself into the chamber that had been mine i kneeled i prayed yet knew not what i prayed for then ran out again it was almost dark night i said where where was mr lovelace  he came to me taking no notice at first of my consternation and wildness what they had given me made me incoherent and wild all goes well said he my dear  a line from captain tomlinson  all indeed did go well for the villainous project of the most cruel and most villainous of men  i demanded his aunt  i demanded his cousin  the evening i said was closing  my head was very very bad i remember i said  and it grew worse and worse  terror however as yet kept up my spirits and i insisted upon his going himself to hasten them  he called his servant he raved at the sex for their delay twas well that business of consequence seldom depended upon such parading unpunctual triflers  his servant came  he ordered him to fly to his cousin leesons and to let his aunt and cousins know how uneasy we both were at their delay adding of his own accord desire them if they dont come instantly to send their coach and we will go without them tell them i wonder they will serve me so  i thought this was considerately and fairly put but now indifferent as my head was i had a little time to consider the man and his behavior he terrified me with his looks and with his violent emotions as he gazed upon me evident joysuppressed emotions as i have since recollected his sentences short and pronounced as if his breath were touched never saw i his abominable eyes look as then they looked  triumph in them  fierce and wild and more disagreeable than the womens at the vile house appeared to me when i first saw them and at times such a leering mischiefboding cast  i would have given the world to have been an hundred miles from him yet his behavior was decent  a decency however that i might have seen to be struggled for  for he snatched my hand two or three times with a vehemence in his grasp that hurt me speaking words of tenderness through his shut teeth as it seemed and let it go with a beggarvoicd humble accent like the vile womans just before halfinward yet his words and manner carrying the appearance of strong and almost convulsed passion  o my dear what mischiefs was he not then meditating  i complained once or twice of thirst my mouth seemed parched at the time i supposed that it was my terror gasping often as i did for breath that parched up the roof of my mouth i called for water some tablebeer was brought me beer i suppose was a better vehicle if i were not dosed enough before for their potions i told the maid that she knew i seldom tasted maltliquor yet suspecting nothing of this nature being extremely thirsty i drank it as what came next and instantly as it were found myself much worse than before as if inebriated i should fancy i know not how  his servant was gone twice as long as he needed and just before his return came one of the pretended lady bettys with a letter for mr lovelace  he sent it up to me i read it and then it was that i thought myself a lost creature it being to put off her going to hamstead that night on account of violent fits which miss montague was pretended to be seized with for then immediately came into my head his vile attempt upon me in this house the revenge that my flight might too probably inspire him with on that occasion and because of the difficulty i made to forgive him and to be reconciled to him his very looks wild and dreadful to me and the women of the house such as i had more reason than ever even from the pretended lady bettys hints to be afraid of all these crouding together in my apprehensive mind i fell into a kind of phrensy  i have not remembrance how i was for the time it lasted but i know that in my first agitations i pulled off my headdress and tore my ruffles in twenty tatters and ran to find him out  when a little recovered i insisted upon the hint he had given of their coach but the messenger he said had told him that it was sent to fetch a physician lest hi chariot should be put up or not ready  i then insisted upon going directly to lady bettys lodgings  mrs leesons was now a crowded house he said and as my earnestness could be owing to nothing but groundless apprehension and o what vows what protestations of his honor did he then make he hoped i would not add to their present concern charlotte indeed was used to fits he said upon any great surprises whether of joy or grief and they would told her for a week together if not got off in a few hours  you are an observer of eyes my dear said the villain perhaps in secret insult saw you not in miss montagues nowandthen at hamstead something wildish  i was afraid for her then  silence and quiet only do her good your concern for her and her love for you will but augment the poor girls disorder if you should go  all impatient with grief and apprehension i still declared myself resolved not to stay in that house till morning all i had in the world my rings my watch my little money for a coach or if one were not to be got i would go on foot to hamstead that night though i walked it by myself  a coach was hereupon sent for or pretended to be sent for any price he said he would give to oblige me late as it was and he would attend me with all his soul  buy no coach was to be got  let me cut short the rest i grew worse and worse in my head now stupid now raving now senseless the vilest of vile women was brought to frighten me never was there so horrible a creature as she appeared to me at the time  i remember i pleaded for mercy  i remember that i said i would be his  indeed i would be his  to obtain his mercy  but no mercy found i  my strength my intellects failed me  and then such scenes followed  o my dear such dreadful scenes  fits upon fits faintly indeed and imperfectly remembered procuring me no compassion  but death was withheld from me that would have been too great a mercy  thus was i tricked and deluded back by blacker hearts of my own sex than i thought there were in the world who appeared to me to be persons of honor and when in his power thus barbarously was i treated by this villainous man  i was so senseless that i dare not averr that the horrid creatures of the house were personally aiding and abetting but some visionary remembrances i have of female figures flitting as i may say before my sight the wretched womans particularly but as these confused ideas might be owing to the terror i had conceived of the worse than masculine violence she had been permitted to assume to me for expressing my abhorrence of her house and as what i suffered from his barbarity wants not that aggravation i will say no more on a subject so shocking as this must ever be to my remembrance  i never saw the personating wretches afterward he persisted to the last dreadfully invoking heaven as a witness to the truth of his assertion that they were really and truly the ladies they pretended to be declaring that they could not take leave of me when they left the town because of the state of senselesness and phrensy i was in for their intoxicating or rather stupefying potions had almost deleterious effects upon my intellects as i have hinted insomuch that for several days together i was under a strange delirium now moping now dozing now weeping now raving now scribbling tearing what i scribbled as fast as i wrote it most miserable when nowandthen a ray of reason brought confusedly to my remembrance what i had suffered  letter xxii miss clarissa harlowe in continuation the lady next gives an account of her recovery from her phrensical and sleepy disorders  of her attempt to get away in his absence  of the conversations that followed at his return between them  of the guilty figure he made  of her resolution not to have him  of her several efforts to escape  of her treaty with dorcas to assist her in it  of dorcass dropping the promisory note undoubtedly as she says on purpose to betray her  of her triumph over all the creatures of the house assembled to terrify her and perhaps to commit fresh outrages upon her  of his setting out for m hall  of his repeated letters to induce her to meet him at the altar on her uncles anniversary  of her determined silence to them all  of her second escape effected as she says contrary to her own expectation that attempt being at first but the intended prelude to a more promising one which she had formed in her mind  and of other particulars which being to be found in mr lovelaces preceding letters and that of his friend belford are omitted she then proceeds    the very hour that i found myself in a place of safety i took pen to write to you when i began i designed only to write six or eight lines to inquire after your health for having heard nothing from you i feared indeed that you had been and still were too ill to write but no sooner did my pen begin to blot the paper but my sad heart hurried it into length the apprehensions i had lain under that i should not be able to get away the fatigue i had in effecting my escape the difficulty of procuring a lodging for myself having disliked the people of two houses and those of a third disliking me for you must think i made a frighted appearance  these together with the recollection of what i had suffered from him and my farther apprehensions of my insecurity and my desolate circumstances had so disordered me that i remember i rambled strangely in that letter  in short i thought it on reperusal a halfdistracted one but i then despaired were i to begin again of writeing better so i let it go and can have no excuse for directing it as i did if the cause of the incoherence in it will not furnish me with a very pitiable one  the letter i received from your mother was a dreadful blow to me but nevertheless it had the good effect upon me laboring as i was just then under a violent sit of vapourish despondency and almost yielding to it which profuse bleeding and blisterings have in paralytical or apoplectical strokes reviving my attention and restoring me to spirits to combat the evils i was surrounded by  sluicing off and diverting into a new chanel if i may be allowed another metaphor the overcharging woes which threatened once more to overwhelm my intellects  but yet i most sincerely lamented and still lament in your mammas words that i cannot be unhappy by myself and was grieved not only for the trouble i had given you before but for the new one i had brought upon you by my inattention  she then gives the contents of the letters she wrote to mrs norton to lady betty lawrence and to mrs hodges as also of their answers whereby she detected all mr lovelaces impostures i cannot however says she forbear to wonder how the vile tomlinson could come at the knowledge of several of the things he told me of and which contributed to give me confidence in him the attentive reader need not be referred back for what the lady nevertheless could not account for as she knew not that mr loveace had come at miss howes letters particularly that in vol iv p   which he comments upon p       i doubt not continues she that the stories of mrs fretchville and her house would be found as vile impostures as any of the rest were i to inquire and had i not enough and too much already against the perjured man  how have i been led on says she  what will be the end of such a false and perjured creature heaven not less profaned and defied by him than myself deceived and abused this however against myself i must say that if what i have suffered is the natural consequence of my first error i never can forgive myself although you are so partial in my favor as to say that i was not censurable for what passed before my first escape  and now honored madam and my dearest miss how who are to sit in judgment upon my case permit me to lay down my pen with one request which with the greatest earnestness i make to you both and that is that you will neither of you open your lips in relation to the potions and the violences i have hinted at  not that i am solicitous that my disgrace should be hidden from the world or that it should not be generally known that the man has proved a villain to me for this it seems everybody but myself expected from his character but suppose as his actions by me are really of a capital nature it were insisted upon that i should appear to prosecute him and his accomplices in a court of justice how do you think i could bear that  but since my character before the capital enormity was lost in the eye of the world and that from the very hour i left my fathers house and since all my own hopes of worldly happiness are entirely over let me slide quietly into my grave and let it not be remembered except by one friendly tear and no more dropped from your gentle eye my own dear anna how on the happy day that shall shut up all my sorrows that there was such a creature as  saturday july   clarissa harlowe  letter xxiii miss how to miss clarissa harlowe sunday july   may heaven signalize its vengeance in the face of all the world upon the most abandoned and profligate of men  and in its own time i doubt not but it will  and we must look to a world beyond this for the reward of your sufferings   another shocking detection my dear  how have you been deluded  very watchful i have thought you very sagacious  but alas not watchful not sagacious enough for the horrid villain you have had to deal with   the letter you sent me enclosed as mine of the  th of june is a villainous forgery vol v p    and seq  the hand indeed is astonishingly like mine and the cover i see is actually my cover but yet the letter is not so exactly imitated but that had you had any suspicions about his vileness at the time you who so well know my hand might have detected it  in short this vile forged letter though a long one contains but a few extracts from mine mine was a very long one he has omitted every thing i see in it that could have shown you what a detestable house the house is and given you suspicions of the vile tomlinson  you will see this and how he has turned miss lardners information and my advices to you execrable villain to his own horrid ends by the rought draught of the genuine letter which i shall enclose see vol iv p       apprehensive for both our safeties from such a daring and profligate contriver i must call upon you my dear to resolve upon taking legal vengeance of the infernal wretch and this not only for our own sakes but for the sakes of innocents who otherwise may yet be deluded and outraged by him  she then gives the particulars of the report made by the young fellow whom she sent to hamstead with her letter and who supposed he had delivered it into her own hand vol v p      and then proceeds i am astonished that the vile wretch who could know nothing of the time my messenger whose honesty i can vouch for would come could have a creature ready to personate you strange that the man should happen to arrive just as you were gone to church as i find was the fact on comparing what he says with your hint that you were at church twice that day when he might have got to mrs moores two hours before  but had you told me my dear that the villain had found you out and was about you  you should have done that  yet i blame you upon a judgment founded on the event only  i never had any faith in the stories that go current among country girls of specter familiars and demons yet i see not any other way to account for this wretchs successful villainy and for his means of workingup his specious delusions but by supposing if he be not the devil himself that he has a familiar constantly at his elbow sometimes it seems to me that this familiar assumes the shape of that solemn villain tomlinson sometimes that of the execrable sinclair as he calls her sometimes it is permitted to take that of lady betty lawrence  but when it would assume the angelic shape and mien of my beloved friend see what a bloated figure it made  it is my opinion my dear that you will be no longer safe where you are than while the v is in the country words are poor  or how could i execrate him i have hardly any doubt that he has sold himself for a time o may the time be short  or may his infernal prompter no more keep covenant with him than he does with others  i enclose not only the rough draught of my long letter mentioned above but the heads of that which the young fellow thought he delivered into your own hands at hamstead and when you have perused them i will leave you to judge how much reason i had to be surprised that you wrote me not an answer to either of those lettes one of which you owned you had received though it proved to be is forged one the other delivered into your own hands as i was assured and both of them of so much concern to your honor and still how much more surprised i must be when i received a letter from mrs townsend dated june    from hamstead importing that mr lovelace who had been with you several days had on the monday before brought his aunt and cousin richly dressed and in a coach and four to visit you who with your own consent had carried you to town with them  to your former lodgings where you still were that the hamstead women believed you to be married and reflected upon me as a fomenter of differences between man and wife that he himself was at hamstead the day before viz wedn the   th and boasted of his happiness with you inviting mrs moore mrs bevis and miss rawlins to go to town to visit his spouse which they promised to do that he declared that you were entirely reconciled to your former lodgings  and that finally the women at hamstead told mrs townsend that he had very handsomely discharged theirs  i own to you my dear that i was so much surprised and disgusted at these appearances against a conduct till then unexceptionable that i was resolved to make myself as easy as i could and wait till you should think fit to write to me but i could reinin my impatience but for a few days and on the  0th of june i wrote a sharp letter to you which i find you did not receive  what a fatality my dear has appeared in your case from the very beginning till this hour had my mother permitted   but can i blame her when you have a father and mother living who have so much to answer for  so much  as no father and mother considering the child they have driven persecuted exposed renounced  ever had to answer for   but again i must execrate the abandoned villain  yet as i said before all words are poor and beneath the occasion  but see we not in the horrid perjuries and treachery of this man what rakes and libertines will do when they get a young creature into their power it is probable that he might have the intolerable presumption to hope an easier conquest but when your unexampled vigilance and exalted virtue made potions and rapes and the utmost violences necessary to the attainment of his detestable end we see that he never boggled at them i have no doubt that the same or equal wickedness would be oftener committed by men of this villainous cast if the folly and credulity of the poor inconsiderates who throw themselves into their hands did not give them an easier triumph  with what comfort must those parents reflect upon these things who have happily disposed of their daughters in marriage to a virtuous man and how happy the young women who find themselves safe in a worthy protection  if such a person as miss clarissa harlowe could not escape who can be secure  since though every rake is not a lovelace neither is every woman a clarissa and his attempts were but proportioned to your resistance and vigilance  my mother has commanded me to let you know her thoughts upon the whole of your sad story i will do it in another letter and send it to you with this by a special messenger  but for the future if you approve of it i will send my letters by the usual hand collinss to be left at the saracens head on snowhill whither you may send yours as we both used to do to wilsons except such as we shall think fit to transmit by the post which i am afraid after my next must be directed to mr hickman as before since my mother is for fixing a condition to our correspondence which i doubt you will not comply with though i wish you would this condition i shall acquaint you with byandby  mean time begging excuse for all the harsh things in my last i beseech you my dearest creature to believe me to be  your truly sympathizing and unalterable friend anna how  letter xxiv miss how to miss clarissa harlowe monday july  0 i now my dearest friend resume my pen to obey my mother in giving you her opinion upon your unhappy story  she still harps upon the old string and will have it that all your calamities are owing to your first fatal step for she believes what i cannot that your relations had intended after one general trial more to comply with your aversion if they had found it as rivetted a one as let me say it was a folly to suppose it would not be found to be after so many ridiculously repeated experiments  as to your latter sufferings from that vilest of miscreants she is unalterably of opinion that if all be as you have related which she doubts not with regard to the potions and to the violences you have sustained you ought by all means to set on foot a prosecution against him and his devilish accomplices  she asks what murderers what ravishers would be brought to justice if modesty were to be a general plea and allowable against appearing in a court to prosecute  she says that the good of society requires that such a beast of prey should be hunted out of it and if you do not prosecute him she thinks you will be answerable for all the mischiefs he may do in the course of his future villainous life  will it be thought nancy said she that miss harlowe can be in earnest when she says she is not solicitous to have her disgraces concealed from the world if she is afraid or ashamed to appear in court to do justice to herself and her sex against him will it not be rather surmised that she may be apprehensive that some weakness or lurking love will appear upon the trial of the strange cause if inferred she such complicated villainy as this where perjury potions forgery subornation are all combined to effect the ruin of an innocent creature and to dishonor a family of eminence and where those very crimes as may be supposed are proofs of her innocence is to go off impunely what case will deserve to be brought into judgment or what malefactor ought to be hanged  then she thinks and so do i that the vile creatures his accomplices ought by all means to be brought to condign punishment as they must and will be upon bringing him to his trial and this may be a means to blow up and root out a whole nest of vipers and save many innocent creatures  she added that if miss clarissa harlowe could be so indifferent about having this public justice done upon such a wretch for her own sake she ought to overcome her scruples out of regard to her family her acquaintance and her sex which are all highly injured and scandalized by his villainy to her  for her own part she declares that were she your mother she would forgive you upon no other terms and upon your compliance with these she herself will undertake to reconcile all your family to you  these my dear are my mothers sentiments upon your sad story  i cannot say but there are reason and justice in them and it is my opinion that it would be very right for the law to oblige an injured woman to prosecute and to make seduction on the mans part capital where his studied baseness and no fault in her will appeared  to this purpose the custom in the isle of man is a very good one   if a single woman there prosecutes a single man for a rape the ecclesiastical judges impanel a jury and if this jury finds him guilty he is returned guilty to the temporal courts where if he be convicted the deemster or judge delivers to the woman a rope a sword and a ring and she has it in her choice to have him hanged beheaded or to marry him  one of the two former i think should always be her option  i long for the full particulars of your story you must have but too much time upon your hands for a mind so active as yours if tolerable health and spirits be afforded you  the villainy of the worst of men and the virtue of the most excellent of women i expect will be exemplified in it were it to be written in the same connected and particular manner that you used to write to me in  try for it my dearest friend and since you cannot give the example without the warning give both for the sakes of all those who shall hear of your unhappy fate beginning from yours of june   your prospects then not disagreeable i pity you for the task though i cannot willingly exempt you from it  my mother will have me add that she must insist upon your prosecuting she repeats that she makes that a condition on which she permits our future correspondence  so let me know your thoughts upon it i asked her if she would be willing that i should appear to support you in court if you complied  by all means she said if that would induce you to begin with him and with the horrid women i think i could attend you i am sure i could were there but a probability of bringing the monster to his deserved end  once more your thoughts of it supposing it were to meet with the approbation of your relations  but whatever be your determination on this head it shall be my constant prayer that god will give you patience to bear your heavy afflictions as a person ought to do whose faulty will has not brought them upon herself that he will speak peace and comfort to your wounded mind and give you many happy years  i am and ever will be  your affectionate and faithful anna how  the two preceding letters were sent by a special messenger in the cover were written the following lines monday july  0 i cannot my dearest friend suffer the enclosed to go unaccompanied by a few lines to signify to you that they are both less tender in some places than i would have written had they not been to pass my mammas inspection the principal reason however of my writing thus separately is to beg of you to permit me to send you money and necessaries which you must needs want and that you will let me know if either i or anybody i can influence can be of service to you i am excessively apprehensive that you are not enough out of his reach where you are yet london i am persuaded is the place of all others to be private in  i could tear my hair for vexation that i have it not in my power to afford you personal protection  i am  your everdevoted anna how  letter xxv miss clarissa harlowe to miss how tuesday july    i approve my dearest friend of the method you prescribe for the conveyance of our letters and have already caused the porter of the inn to be engaged to bring to me yours the moment that collins arrives with them as the servant of the house where i am will be permitted to carry mine to collins for you  as you are so earnest to have all the particulars of my sad story before you i will if life and spirits be lent me give you an ample account of all that has befallen me from the time you mention but this it is very probable you will not see till after the close of my last scene and as i shall write with a view to that i hope no other voucher will be wanted for the veracity of the writer  i am far from thinking myself out of the reach of this mans further violence but what can i do whither can i fly  perhaps my bad state of health which must grow worse as recollection of the past evils and reflections upon them grow heavier and heavier upon me may be my protection once indeed i thought of going abroad and had i the prospect of many years before me i would go  but my dear the blow is given  nor have you reason now circumstanced as i am to be concerned that it is what a heart must i have if it be not broken  and indeed my dear my best i had almost said my only friend i do so earnestly wish for the last closing scene and with so much comfort find myself in a declining way that i even sometimes ingratefully regret that naturally healthy constitution which used to double upon me all my enjoyments  as to the earnestly recommended prosecution i may possibly touch upon it more largely hereafter if ever i shall have better spirits for they are at present extremely sunk and low  but just now will only say that i would sooner suffer every evil the repetition of the capital one excepted than appear publicly in a court to do myself justice dr lewin as will be seen hereafter presses her to this public prosecution by arguments worthy of his character which she answers in a manner worthy of hers  and i am heartily grieved that your mother prescribes such a measure as the condition of our future correspondence  for the continuance of your friendship my dear and the desire i had to correspond with you to my lifes end were all my remaining hopes and consolation nevertheless as that friendship is in the power of the heart not of the hand only i hope i shall not forfeit that  o my dear what weight has a parents curse  you cannot imagine  but i will not touch this string to you who never loved them  a reconciliation with them is not be hoped for  i have written a letter to miss rawlins of hamstead the answer to which just now received has helped me to the knowledge of the vile contrivance by which this wicked man got your letter of june the  0th i will give you the contents of both  in mine to her i briefly acquaint her with what had befallen me through the vileness of the women who had been passed upon me as the aunt and cousin of the wickedest of men and own that i never was married to him i desire her to make particular inquiry and to let me know who it was at mrs moores that on sunday afternoon june    while i was at church received a letter from miss how pretending to be me and lying on a couch  which letter had it come to my hands would have saved me from ruin i excuse myself from the delirium which the barbarous usage i had received threw me into and from a confinement as barbarous and illegal that i had not before applied to mrs moore for an account of what i was indebted to her which i now desired and for sear of being traced by mr lovelace i directed her to superscribe her answer to mrs mary atkins to be left till called for at the bellsavage inn o ludgate hill  in her answer she tells me that the vile wretc prevailed upon mrs bevis to personate me a sudde motion of his it seems on the appearance of you messenger  persuaded to lie along on a couch  handkerchief over her neck and face pretending  be ill drawn in by false notions of your ill office to keep up a variance between a man and his wife  and so taking the letter from your messenger as me  miss rawlins takes pains to excuse mrs beviss itention she expresses their astonishment and conc at what i communicate but is glad however and so they are all that they know in time the vileness of the base man the two widows and herself having at his earnest invitation designed me a visit at mrs sinclairs supposing all to be happy between him and me as he assured them was the case mr lovelace she informs me had handsomely satisfied mrs moore and miss rawlins concludes with wishing to be favored with the particulars of so extraordinary a story as they may be of use to let her see what wicked creatures women as well as men there are in the world  i thank you for the draughts of your two letters which were intercepted by this horrid man i see the great advantage they were of to him in the prosecution of his villainous designs against the poor wretch whom he has so long made the sport of his abhorred inventions  let me repeat that i am quite sick of life and of an earth in which innocent and benevolent spirits are sure to be considered as aliens and to be made sufferers by the genuine sons and daughters of that earth  how unhappy that those letters only which could have acquainted me with his horrid views and armed me against them and against the vileness of the base women should fall into his hands  unhappier still in that my very escape to hamstead gave him the opportunity of receiving them  nevertheless i cannot but still wonder how it was possible for that tomlinson to know what passed between mr hickman and my uncle harlowe see the note at the bottom of p     a circumstance which gave that vile impostor most of his credit with me  how the wicked wretch himself could find me out at hamstead must also remain wholly a mystery to me he may glory in his contrivances  he who has more wickedness than wit may glory in his contrivances  but after all i shall i humbly presume to hope be happy when he poor wretch will be  alas  who can say what   adieu my dearest friend  may you be happy  and then your clarissa harlowe cannot be wholly miserable  letter xxvi miss how to miss clarissa harlowe wedn night july    i write my dearest creature i cannot but write to express my concern on your dejection let me beseech you my charming excellence let me beseech you not to give way to it  comfort yourself on the contrary in the triumphs of a virtue unsullied a will wholly faultless who could have withstood the trials that you have surmounted  your cousin morden will soon come he will see justice done you i make no doubt as well with regard to what concerns your person as your estate and many happy days may you yet see and much good may you still do if you will not heighten unavoidable accidents into guilty despondency  but why my dear this pining solicitude continued after a reconciliation with relations as unworthy as implacable whose wills are governed by an allgrasping brother who finds his account in keeping the breach open on this oversolicitude it is now plain to me that the vilest of men built all his schemes he saw you had a thirst after it beyond all reason for hope the view the hope i own extremely desirable had your family been christians or even had they been pagans who had bowels  i shall send this short letter i am obliged to make it a short one by young rogers as we call him the fellow i sent to you to hamstead an innocent though pragmatical rustic admit him i pray you into your presence that he may report to me how you look and how you are  mr hickman should attend you but i apprehend that all his motions and my own too are watched by the execrable wretch as indeed his are by an agent of mine for i own that i am so apprehensive of his plots and revenge now i know that he has intercepted my vehement letters against him that he is the subject of my dreams as well as of my waking fears  my mother at my earnest importunity has just given me leave to write and to receive your letters  but fastened this condition upon the concession that yours must be under cover to mr hickman this with a view i suppose to give him consideration with me and upon this further condition that she is to see all we write  when girls are set upon a pointshe told one who told me again it is better for a mother if possible to make herself of their party rather than to oppose them since there will be then hopes that she will still hold the reins in her own hands  pray let me know what the people are with whom you lodge  shall i send mrs townsend to direct you to lodgings either more safe or more convenient for you  be pleased to write to me by rogers who will wait on you for your answer at your own time  adieu my dearest creature comfort yourself as you would in the like unhappy circumstances comfort  your own anna how  letter xxvii miss clarissa harlowe to miss how thursday july    i am extremely concerned my dear miss how for being primarily the occasion of the apprehensions you have of this wicked mans vindictive attempts what a wide spreading error is mine   if i find that he sets on foot any machination against you or mr hickman i do assure you i will consent to prosecute him although i were sure i should not survive my first appearance at the bar he should be arraigned at  i own the justice of your mothers arguments on that subject but must say that i think there are circumstances in my particular case which will excuse me although on a slighter occasion than that above apprehended i should decline to appear against him i have said that i may one day enter more particularly into this subject  your messenger has now indeed seen me i talked with him on the imposture put upon him at hamstead and am sorry to have reason to say that had not the poor young man been very simple and very selfsufficient he had not been so grossly deluded mrs bevis has the same plea to make for herself a goodnatured thoughtless woman not used to converse with so vile and so specious a deceiver as him who made his advantage of both these shallow creatures  i think i cannot be more private than where i am i hope i am safe all the risque i run is in going out and returning from morning prayers which i have two or three times ventured to do once at lincolns inn chapel at eleven once at st dunstans fleet street at seven in the morning in a chair both times and twice at six in the morning at the neighboring church in covent garden the wicked wretches i have escaped from will not i hope come to church to look for me especially at so early prayers and i have fixed upon the privatest pew in the latter church to hide myself in and perhaps i may lay out a little matter in an ordinary gown by way of disguise my face half hid by my mob  i am very careless my dear of my appearance now neat and clean takes up the whole of my attention  the mans name at whose house i lodge is smith  a glove maker as well as seller his wife is the shopkeeper a dealer also in stockens ribbands snuff and perfumes a matronlike woman plainhearted and prudent the husband an honest industrious man and they live in good understanding with each other a proof with me that their hearts are right for where a married couple live together upon ill terms it is a sign i think that each knows something amiss of the other either with regard to temper or morals which if the world knew as well as themselves it would as little like them as such people like each other happy the marriage where neither man nor wife has any wilful or premeditated evil in their general conduct to reproach the other with  for even persons who have bad hearts will have a veneration for those who have good ones  two neat rooms with plain but clean furniture on the first floor are mine one they call the dining room  there is up another pair of stairs a very worthy widowlodger mrs lovick by name who although of low fortunes is much respected as mrs smith assures me by people of condition of her acquaintance for her piety prudence and understanding with her i propose to be well acquainted  i thank you my dear for your kind you seasonable advice and consolation i hope i shall have more grace given me than to despond in the religious sense of the word especially as i can apply to myself the comfort you give me that neither my will nor my inconsiderateness has contributed to my calamity but nevertheless the irreconcileableness of my relations whom i love with an unabated reverence my apprehensions of fresh violences this wicked man i doubt will not yet let me rest my destituteness of protection my youth my sex my unacquaintedness with the world subjecting me to insults my reflections on the scandal i have given added to the sense of the indignities i have received from a man of whom i deserved not ill all together will undoubtedly bring on the effect that cannot be undesirable to me  the slower however perhaps from my natural good ocnstitution and as i presume to imagine from principles which i hope will in due time and by due reflection set me above the sense of all worldly disappointments  at present my head is much disordered i have not indeed enjoyed it with any degree of clearness since the violence done to that and to my heart too by the wicked arts of the abandoned creatures i was cast among  i must have more conflicts at times i find my self not subdued enough to my condition i will welcome those conflicts as they come as probationary ones  but yet my fathers malediction  yet i hope even that may be made of so much use to me as to cause me to double my attention to render it ineffectual  all i will at present add are my thanks to your mother for her indulgence to us due compliments to mr hickman and my request that you will believe me to be to my last hour and beyond it if possible my beloved friend and my dearer self for what is now my self  your obliged and affectionate clarissa harlowe  letter xxviii mr lovelace to john belford esquire friday july   i have three of thy letters at once before me to answer in each of which thou complainest of my silence and in one of them tellest me that thou can not live unless i scribble to thee every day or every other day at least  why then die jack if thou will  what heart think thou can i have to write when i have lost the only subject worth writing upon  help me again to my angel to my clarissa and thou shall have a letter from me or writing at least part of a letter every hour all that the charmer of my heart shall say that will i put down every motion every air of her beloved person every look will i try to describe and when she is silent i will endeavor to tell thee her thoughts either what they are or what i would have them to be  so that having her i shall never want a subject having lost her my whole soul is a blank the whole creation round me the elements above beneath and every thing i behold for nothing can i enjoy is a blank without her  o return return thou dear charmer of my soul return to thy adoring lovelace what is the light what the air what the town what the country what is anything without thee light air joy harmony in my notion are but parts of thee and could they be all expressed in one word that word would be clarissa  o my beloved clarissa return thou then once more return to bless thy lovelace who now by the loss of thee knows the value of the jewel he has slighted and rises every morning but to curse the sun that shines upon everybody but him  well but jack it is a surprising thing to me that the dear fugitive cannot be met with cannot be heard of she is so poor a plotter for plotting is not her talent that i am confident had i been at liberty i should have found her out before now although the different emissaries i have employed about town round the adjacent villages and in miss howes vicinage have hitherto failed of success but my lord continues so weak and lowspirited that there is no getting from him i would not disoblige a man whom i think in danger still for would his gout now it has got him down but give him like a fair boxer the risingblow all would be over with him and here pox of his fondness for me it happens at a very bad time he makes me sit hours together entertaining him with my rogeries a pretty amusement for a sick man and yet whenever he has the gout he prays night and morning with his chaplain but what must his notions of religion be who after he has nosed and mumbled over his responses can give a sigh or groan of satisfaction as if he thought he had made up with heaven and return with a new appetite to my stories  encouraging them by shaking his sides with laughing at them and calling me a sad fellow in such an accent as shows he takes no small delight in his kinsman  the old peer has been a sinner in his day and suffers for it now a sneaking sinner sliding rather than rushing into vices for fear of his reputation or rather for fear of detection and positive proof for these sort of fellows jack have no real regard for reputation  paying for what he never had and never daring to rise to the joy of an enterprise at first hand which could bring him within view of a tilting or of the honor of being considered as the principal man in a court of justice  to see such an old trojan as this just dropping into the grave which i hoped ere this would have been dug and filled up with him crying out with pain and grunting with weakness yet in the same moment crack his leathern face into an horrible laugh and call a young sinner charming varlet encoreing him as formerly he used to do the italian eunuchs what a preposterous what an unnatural adherence to old habits  my two cousins are generally present when i entertain as the old peer calls it those stories must drag horribly that have not more hearers and applauders than relaters  applauders   ay belford applauders repeat i for although these girls pretend to blame me sometimes for the facts they praise my manner my invention my intrepidity  besides what other people call blame that call i praise i ever did and so i very early discharged shame that coldwater damper to an enterprising spirit  these are smart girls they have life and wit and yesterday upon charlottes raving against me upon a related enterprise i told her that i had had it in debate several times whether she were or were not too near of kin to me and that it was once a moot point with me whether i could not love her dearly for a month or so and perhaps it was well for her that another pretty little puss started up and diverted me just as i was entering upon the course  they all three held up their hands and eyes at once but i observed that though the girls exclaimed against me they were not so angry at this plain speaking as i have found my beloved upon hints so dark that i have wondered at her quick apprehension  i told charlotte that grave as she pretended to be in her smiling resentments on this declaration i was sure i should not have been put to the expense of above two or three stratagems for nobody admired a good invention more than she could i but have disentangled her conscience from the embarasses of consanguinity  she pretended to be highly displeased so did her sister for her i told her that she seemed as much in earnest as if she had thought me so and dared the trial plain words i said in these cases were more shocking to their sex than gradatim actions and i bid patty not be displeased at my distinguishing her sister since i had a great respect for her likewise  an italian air in my usual careless way a halfstruggled for kiss from me and a shrug of the shoulder by way of admiration from each pretty cousin and sad sad fellow from the old peer attended with a sideshaking laugh made us all friends  there jack  will thou or will thou not take this for a letter there is quantity i am sure  how have i filled a sheet not a shorthand one indeed without a subject my fellow shall take this for he is going to town and if thou can think tolerably of such execrable stuff i will soon send thee another  letter xxix mr lovelace to john belford esquire six sat morning july   have i nothing new nothing diverting in my whimsical way thou ask in one of thy three letters before me to entertain thee with  and thou tellest me that when i have least to narrate to speak in the scottish phrase i am most diverting a pretty compliment either to thyself or to me to both indeed  a sign that thou have as frothy a heart as i a head but can thou suppose that this admirable woman is not all is not everything with me yet i dread to think of her too for detection of all my contrivances i doubt must come next  the old peer is also full of miss harlowe and so are my cousins he hopes i will not be such a dog theres a specimen of his peerlike dialect as to think of doing dishonourably by a woman of so much merit beauty and fortune and he says of so good a family but i tell him that this is a string he must not touch that it is a very tender point in short is my sore place and that i am afraid he would handle it too roughly were i to put myself into the power of so ungentle an operator  he shakes his crazy head he thinks all is not as it should be between us longs to have me present her to him as my wife and often tells me what great things he will do additional to his former proposals and what presents he will make on the birth of the first child but i hope the whole will be in my hands before such an event take place no harm in hoping jack my uncle says were it not for hope the heart would break  eight oclock at midsummer and these lazy varletesses in full health not come down yet to breakfast  what a confounded indecency in young ladies to let a rake know that they love their beds so dearly and at the same time where to have them but i will punish them they shall breakfast with their old uncle and yawn at one another as if for a wager while i drive my phaeton to col ambroses who yesterday gave me invitation both to breakfast and dine on account of two yorkshire nieces celebrated toasts who have been with him this fortnight past and who he says want to see me so jack all women do not run away from me thank heaven  i wish i could have leave of my heart since the dear fugitive is so ungrateful to drive her out of it with another beauty but who can supplant her who can be admitted to a place in it after miss clarissa harlowe  at my return if i can find a subject i will scribble on to oblige thee  my phaetons ready my cousins send me word they are just coming down so in spite i will be gone   saturday afternoon i did stay to dine with the colonel and his lady and nieces but i could not pass the afternoon with them for the heart of me there was enough in the persons and faces of the two young ladies to set me upon comparisons particular features held my attention for a few moments but those served but to whet my impatience to find the charmer of my soul who for person for air for mind had never any equal my heart recoiled and sickend upon comparing minds and conversation pert wit a too studiedfor desire to please each in high good humor with herself an openmouth affectation in both to show white teeth as if the principal excellence and to invite amorous familiarity by the promise of a sweet breath at the same time reflecting tacitly upon breaths arrogantly implied to be less pure  once i could have borne them  they seemed to be disappointed that i was so soon able to leave them yet have i not at present so much vanity my clarissa has cured me of my vanity as to attribute their disappointment so much to particular liking of me as to their own selfadmiration they looked upon me as a connoisseur in beauty they would have been proud of engaging my attention as such but so affected so flimsywitted mere skindeep beauties  they had looked no further into themselves than what their glasses had enabled them to see and their glasses were flatteringglasses too for i thought them passivefaced and spiritless with eyes however upon the hunt for conquests and bespeaking the attention of others in order to countenance their own  i believe i could with a little pains have given them life and soul and to every feature of their faces sparkling information  but my clarissa  o belford my clarissa has made me eyeless and senseless to every other beauty  do thou find her for me as a subject worthy of my pen or this shall be the last from  thy lovelace  letter xxx mr lovelace to john belford esquire sunday night july   now jack have i a subject with a vengeance i am in the very height of my trial for all my sins to my beloved fugitive for here yesterday at about five oclock arrived lady sarah sadleir and lady betty lawrance each in her chariot and six dowagers love equipage and these cannot travel ten miles without a set and half a dozen horsemen  my time had hung heavy upon my hands and so i went to church after dinner why may not handsome fellows thought i like to be looked at as well as handsome wenches  i fell in when service was over with major warneton and so came not home till after six and was surprised at entering the courtyard here to find it litterd with equipages and servants i was sure the owners of them came for no good to me  lady sarah i soon found was raised to this visit by lady betty who has health enough to allow her to look out of herself and out of her own affairs for business yet congratulation to my uncle on his amendment spiteful devils on both accounts was the avowed errand but coming in my absence i was their principal subject and they had opportunity to set each others heart against me  simon parsons hinted this to me as i passed by the stewards office for it seems they talked loud and he was making up some accounts with old pritchard  however i hastened to pay my duty to them other people not performing theirs is not excuse for the neglect of our own you know  and now i enter upon my trial with horrible grave faces was i received the two antiques only bowed their tabby heads making longer faces than ordinary and all the old lines appearing strong in their furrowed foreheads and fallen cheeks how do you cousin and how do you mr lovelace looking all round at one another as who should say do you speak first and do you for they seemed resolved to lose no time  i had nothing for it but an air as manly as theirs was womanly your servant madam to lady betty and your servant madam  i am glad to see you abroad  lady sarah  i took my seat lord m looked horribly glum hi fingers clasped and turning round and round under and over his but just disgouted thumbs his sallow face and goggling eyes cast upon the floor on the fireplace on hi two sisters on his two kinswomen by turns but no once deigning to look upon me  then i began to think of the laudanum and wet cloth i had told thee of long ago and to call myself in question for a tenderness of heart that will never do me good  at last mr lovelace  cousin lovelace  hem  hem  i am sorry very sorry hesitated lady sara that thee is no hope of your ever taking up   what is the matter now madam  the matter now  why lady betty has two letters from miss harlowe which have told us what is the matter  are all women alike with you  yes i could have answered bating the difference which pride makes  then they all chorusd upon me  such a character as miss harlowes cried one  a lady of so much generosity and good sense another  how charmingly she writes the two maiden monkies looking at her fine handwriting her perfections my crimes what can you expect will be the end of these things cried lady sarah  damned damned doings vociferated the peer shaking his loosefleshd wabbling chaps which hung on his shoulders like an old cows dewlap  for my part i hardly knew whether to sing or say what i had to reply to these allatonce attacks upon me  fair and softly ladies  one at a time i beseech you i am not to be hunted down without being heard i hope pray let me see these letters i beg you will let me see them  there they are  that is the first  read it out if you can  i opened a letter from my charmer date thursday june    our wedding day that was to be and written to lady betty lawrance  by the contents to my great joy i find the dear creature is alive and well and in charming spirits but the direction where to send an answer was so scratched out that i could not read it which afflicted me much  she puts three questions in it to lady betty   st about a letter of hers date june   congratulating our nuptials and which i was so good as to save my aunt the trouble of writing a very civil thing of me i think  again  whether she and one of her nieces montague were to go to town on an old chancerysuit and whether they actually did go to town accordingly and to hamstead afterward and whether they brought to town from thence the young creature whom they visited was the subject of the second and third questions  a little inquisitive dear rogue and what did she expect to be the better for these questions  but curiosity damned curiosity is the itch of the sex  yet when did thou know it turned to their benefit  for they seldom inquire but when they fear  and the proverb as my lord has it says it comes with a fear that is i suppose what they fear generally happens because there is generally occasion for the fear  curiosity indeed she avows to be her only motive for these interrogatories for though she says her ladyship may suppose the questions are not asked for good to me yet the answer can do me no harm nor her good only to give her to understand whether i have told her  a parcel of damned lies that is the plain english of her inquiry  well madam said i with as much philosophy as i could assume and may i ask pray what was your ladyships answer  there is a copy of it tossing it to me very disrespectfully  this answer was dated july   a very kind and complaisant one to the lady but very soso to her poor kinsman  that people can give up their own flesh and blood with so much ease  she tells her how proud all our family would be of an alliance with such an excellence she does me justice in saying how much i adore her as an angel of a lady and begs of her for i know not how many sakes besides my souls sake that she will be so good as to have me for an husband and answers  thou will guess how  to the ladys questions  well madam and pray may i be favored with the ladys other letter i presume it is in reply to yours  it is said the peer but sir let me ask you a few questions before you read it  give me the letter lady betty  there it is my lord  then on went the spectacles and his head moved to the lines  a charming pretty hand  i have often heard that this lady is a genus  and so jack repeating my lords wise comments and questions will let thee into the contents of this merciless letter  monday july   reads my lord  let me see  that was last monday no longer ago monday july the third  madam  i cannot excuse myself  um um um um um um humming inarticulately and skipping  i must own to you madam that the honor of being related   off went the spectacles  now tell me sir has not this lady lost all the friends she had in the world for your sake  she has very implacable friends my lord we all know that  but has she not lost all for your sake  tell me that  i believe so my lord  well then  i am glad thou art not so graceless as to deny that  on went the spectacles again  i must own to you madam that the honor of being related to ladies as eminent for their virtue as for their descent  very pretty truly said my lord repeating as eminent for their virtue as for their descent was at first no small inducement with me to lend an ear to mr lovelaces address   there is dignity born dignity in this lady cried my lord  lady sarah she would have been a grace to our family   lady betty indeed she would   lovel to a royal family i will venture to say   ld m they what a devil    lovel please to read on my lord it cannot be her letter if it does not make you admire her more and more as you read cousin charlotte cousin patty pray attend  read on my lord   miss charlotte amazing fortitude  miss patty only lifted up her doves eyes   lord m reading and the rather as i was determined had it come to effect to do every thing in my power to deserve your favorable opinion  then again they chorusd upon me  a blessed time of it poor i  i had nothing for it but impudence   lovel pray read on my lord  i told you how you would all admire her  or shall i read   lord m damned assurance reading i had another motive which i knew would of itself give me merit with your whole family  they were all ear  a presumptuous one a punishably presumptuous one as it has proved in the hope that i might be an humble means in the hand of providence to reclaim a man who had as i thought good sense enough at bottom to be reclaimed or at least gratitude enough to acknowledge the intended obligation whether the generous hope were to succeed or not  excellent young creature   excellent young creature echoed the ladies with their handkerchiefs at their eyes attended with nosemusic   lovel by my soul miss patty you weep in the wrong place you shall never go with me to a tragedy   lady betty hardened wretch   his lordship had pulled off his spectacles to wipe them his eyes were misty and he thought the fault in his spectacles  i saw they were all cocked and primd  to be sure that is a very pretty sentence said i  that is the excellency of this lady that in every line as she writes on she improves upon herself pray my lord proceed  i know her style the next sentence will still rise upon us   lord m damned fellow again saddling and reading but i have been most egregiously mistaken in mr lovelace  then they all clamoured again the only man i persuade myself    lovel ladies may persuade themselves to any thing  but how can she answer for what other men would or would not have done in the same circumstances  i was forced to say anything to stifle their outcries o take ye all together thought i as if i had not vexatio enough in losing her   lord m reading the only man i persuade myself pretending to be a gentleman in whom i could have been so much mistaken  they were all beginning again  pray my lord prceed  hear hear  pray ladies hear  now my lord be pleased to proceed the ladies are silent  so they were lost in admiration of me hands and eyes uplifted   lord m i will to thy confusion for he had looked over the next sentence  what wretches belsord what spiteful wretches are poor mortals  so rejoiced to sting one another to see each other stung   lord m reading for while i was endeavoring to save a drowning wretch i have been not accidentally but premeditatedly and of set purpose drawn in after him  what say you to this sirr   lady s lady b ay sir what say you to this   lovel say why i say it is a very pretty metaphor if it would but hold  but if you please my lord read on let me hear what is further said and i will speak to it all together   lord m i will  and he has had the glory to add to the list of those he has ruined a name that i will be bold to say would not have disparaged his own  they all looked at me as expecting me to speak   lovel be pleased to proceed my lord i will speak to this byandby how came she to know i kept a list  i will speak to this byand by   lord m reading on and this madam be means that would shock humanity to be made acquainted with  then again in a hurry off went the spectacles  this was a plaguey stroke upon me i thought myself an oak in impudence but by my troth this had almost felled me   lord m what say you to this sirr   remember jack to read all their sirs in this dialogue with a doubler rr sirr  denoting indignation rather than respect  they all looked at me as if to see if i could blush   lovel eyes off my lord  eyes off ladies looking fashfully i believe  what say i to this my lord  why i say that this lady has a strong manner of expressing herself  that is all  there are many things that pass among lovers which a man cannot explain himself upon before grave people   lady betty among lovers sirr  but mr lovelace cay you say that this lady behaved either like a weak or a credulous person  can you say    lovel i am ready to do the lady all manner of justice  but pray now ladies if i am to be thus interrogated let me know the contents of the rest of the letter that i may be prepared for my defense as you are all for my arraignment for to be required to answer piecemeal thus without knowing what is to follow is a cursed insnaring way of proceeding  they gave me the letter i read it through to myself  and by the repetition of what i said thou will guess at the remaining contents  you shall find ladies you shall find my lord that i will not spare myself then holding the letter in my hand and looking upon it as a lawyer upon his breviate  miss harlowe says that when your ladyship turning to lady betty shall know that in the progress to her ruin wilful falsehoods repeated forgeries and numberless perjuries were not the least of my crimes you will judge that she can have no principles that will make her worthy of an alliance with ladies of yours and your noble sisters character if she could not from her soul declare that such an alliance can never now take place  surely ladies this is passion this is not reason if our family would not think themselves dishonored by my marrying a person whom i had so treated but on the contrary would rejoice that i did this justice and if she has come out pure gold from the assay and has nothing to reproach herself with why should it be an impeachment of her principles to consent that such an alliance should take place  she cannot think herself the worse justly she cannot for what was done against her will  their countenances menaced a general uproar  but i proceeded  your lordship read to us that she had an hope a presumptuous one nay a punishably presumptuous one she calls it that she might be a means in the hands of providence to reclaim me and that this she knew if effected would give her a merit with you all but from what would she reclaim me  she had heard you will say but she had only heard at the time she held that hope that to express myself in the womens dialect i was a very wicked fellow  well and what then  why truly the very moment she was convinced by her own experience that the charge against me was more than hearsay and that of consequence i was a fit subject for her generous endeavors to work upon she would needs give me up accordingly she flies out and declares that the ceremony which would repair all shall never take place  can this be from any other motive than female resentment  this brought them all upon me as i intended it should it was as a tub to the whale and after i had let them play with it awhile i claimed their attention and knowing that they always loved to hear me prate went on  the lady it is plain thought that the reclaiming of a man from bad habits was a much easier task than in the nature of things it can be  she writes as your lordship has read that in endeavoring to save a drowning wretch she had been not accidentally but premeditatedly and of set purpose drawn in after him but how is this ladies  you see by her own words that i am still far from being out of danger myself had she found me in a quagmire suppose and i had got out of it by her means and left her to perish in it that would have been a crime indeed  but is not the fact quite otherwise has she not if her allegory proves what she would have it prove got out herself and left me floundering still deeper and deeper in  what she should have done had she been in earnest to save me was to join her hand with mine that so we might by our united strength help one another out  i held out my hand to her and besought her to give me hers  but no truly she was determined to get out herself as fast as she could let me sink or swim refusing her assitance against her own principles because she saw i wanted it  you see ladies you see my lord how pretty tinkling words run away with ears inclined to be musical   they were all ready to exclaim again but i went on proleptically as a rhetorician would say before their voices could break out into words  but my fair accuser says that i have added to the list of those i have ruined a name that would not have disparaged my own it is true i have been gay and enterprising it is in my constitution to be so i know not how i came by such a constitution but i was never accustomed to check or control that you all know when a man finds himself hurried by passion into a slight offense which however slight will not be forgiven he may be made desperate as a thief who only intends a robbery is often by resistance and for selfpreservation drawn in to commit a murder  i was a strange a horrid wretch with every one but he must be a silly fellow who has not something to say for himself when every cause has its black and its white side  westminster hall jack affords every day as confident defenses as mine  but what right proceeded i has this lady to complain of me when she as good as says  here lovelace you have acted the part of a villain by me  you would repair your fault but i will not let you that i may have the satisfaction of exposing you and the pride of refusing you  but was that the case was that the case would i pretend to say i would now marry the lady if she would have me   lovel you find she renounces lady bettys mediation    lord m interrupting me words are wind but deeds are mind what signifies your cursed quibbling bob  say plainly if she will have you will you have her answer me yes or no and lead us not a wildgoosechace after your meaning   lovel she knows i would but here my lord if she thus goes on to expose herself and me she will make it a dishonor to us both to marry   charl but how must she have been treated    lovel interrupting her why now cousin charlotte chucking her under the chin would you have me tell you all that has passed between the lady and me would yo care had you a bold and enterprising lover that proclamation should be made of every little piece of amorous roguery that he offered to you  charlotte reddend they all began to exclaim but i proceeded  the lady says she has been dishonored devil take me if i spare myself by means that would shock humanity to be made acquainted with them she is a very innocent lady and may not be a judge of the means she hints at overniceness may be underniceness have you not such a proverb my lord  tantamount to one extreme produces another  such a lady as this may possibly think her case more extraordinary than it is this i will take upon me to say that if she has met with the only man in the world who would have treated her as she says i have treated her i have met in her with the only woman in the world who would have made such a rout about a case that is uncommon only from the circumstances that attend it  this brought them all upon me hands eyes voices all lifted up at once but my lord m who has in his head the last seat of retreating lewdness as much wickedness as i have in my heart was forced upon the air i spoke this with and charlottes and all the rest reddening to make a mouth that was big enough to swallow up the other half of his face crying out to avoid laughing oh oh  as if under the power of a gouty twinge  had thou seen how the two tabbies and the young grimalkins looked at one another at my lord and at me by turns thou too would have been ready to split thy ugly face just in the middle thy mouth has already done half the work and after all i found not seldom in this conversation that my humorous undaunted way forced a smile into my service from the prim mouths of the younger ladies especially for the case not being likely to be theirs they could not be so much affected by it as the elders who having had roses of their own would have been very loath to have had them nipt in the bud without saying by your leave mrs rose bush to the mother of it  the next article of my indictment was for forgery and for personating of lady betty and my cousin charlotte two shocking charges thou wilt say and so they were  the peer was outrageous upon the forgerycharge the ladies vowed never to forgive the personating part not a peacemaker among them so we all turned women and scolded  my lord told me that he believed in his conscience there was not a viler fellow upon gods earth than me  what signifies mincing the matter said he  and that it was not the first time i had forged his hand  to this i answered that i supposed when the statute of scandalum magnatum was framed there were a good many in the peerage who knew they deserved hard names and that that law therefore was rather made to privilege their qualities than to whiten their characters  he called upon me to explain myself with a sirr so pronounced as to show that one of the most ignominious words in our language was in his head  people i said that were fenced in by their quality and by their years should not take freedoms that a man of spirit could not put up with unless he were able heartily to despise the insulter  this set him in a violent passion he would send for pritchard instantly let pritchard be called he would alter his will and all he could leave from me he would  do do my lord said i i always valued my own pleasure above your estate but i will let pritchard know that if he draws he shall sign and seal  why what would i do to pritchard  shaking his crazy head at me  only what he or any man else writes with his pen to despoil me of what i think my right he shall seal with his ears that is all my lord  then the two ladies interposed  lady sarah told me that i carried things a great way and that neither lord m nor any of them deserved the treatment i gave them  i said i could not bear to be used ill by my lord for two reasons first because i respected his lordship above any man living and next because it looked as if i were induced by selfish considerations to take that from him which nobody else would offer to me  and what returned he shall be my inducement to take what i do at your hands  hay sir  indeed cousin lovelace said lady betty with great gravity we do not any of us as lady sarah says deserve at your hands the treatment you give us and let me tell you that i dont think my character and your cousin charlottes ought to be prostituted in order to ruin an innocent lady she must have known early the good opinion we all have of her and how much we wished her to be your wife this good opinion of ours has been an inducement to her you see she says so to listen to your address and this with her friends folly has helped to throw her into your power how you have requited her is too apparent it becomes the character we all bear to disclaim your actions by her and let me tell you that to have her abused by wicked people raised up to personate us or any of us makes a double call upon us to disclaim them   lovel why this is talking somewhat like i would have you all disclaim my actions i own i have done very vilely by this lady one step led to another i am cursed with an enterprising spirit i hate to be foiled   foiled interrupted lady sarah what a shame to talk at this rate  did the lady set up a contention with you all nobly sincere and plainhearted have i heard miss clarissa harlowe is above art above disguise neither the coquet nor the prude  poor lady she deserved a better fate from the man for whom she took the step which she so freely blames   this above half affected me  had this dispute been so handled by every one i had been ashamed to look up i began to be bashful   charlotte asked if i did not still seem inclinable to do the lady justice if she would have me it would be she dared to say the greatest felicity the family could know she would answer for one that this fine lady were of it  they all declared to the same effect and lady sarah put the matter home to me  but my lord marplot would have it that i could not be serious for six minutes together  i told his lordship that he was mistaken light as he thought i made of this subject i never knew any that went so near my heart  miss patty said she was glad to hear that indeed she was glad to hear that and her soft eyes glistened with pleasure  lord m called her sweet soul and was ready to cry  not from humanity neither jack this peer has no bowels as thou may observe by his treatment of me but when peoples minds are weakened by a sense of their own infirmities and when they are drawing on to their latter ends they will be moved on the slightest occasions whether those offer from within or without them and this frequently the unpenetrating world calls humanity when all the time in compassionating the miseries of human nature they are but pitying themselves and were they in strong health and spirits would care as little for anybody else as thou or i do  here broke they off my trial for this sitting lady sarah was much fatigued it was agreed to pursue the subject in the morning they all however retired together and went into private conference  letter xxxi mr lovelace in continuation the ladies instead of taking up the subject where we had laid it down must needs touch upon passages in my fair accusers letter which i was in hopes they would have let rest as we were in a tolerable way but truly they must hear all they could hear of our story and what i had to say to those passages that they might be better enabled to mediate between us if i were really and indeed inclined to do her the hopedfor justice  these passages were  st that after i had tricked her against her will into the act of going off with me i carried her to one of the worst houses in london    that i had made a wicked attempt upon her in resentment of which she fled to hamstead privately   dly came the forgery and personating charge again and we were upon the point of renewing ou quarrel before we could get to the next charge which was still worse  for that  thly was that having tricked her back to the vile house i had first robbed her of her senses and then of her honor detaining her afterward a prisoner there  were i to tell thee the glosses i put upon these heavy charges what would it be but to repeat many of the extenuating arguments i have used in my letters to thee  suffice it therefore to say that i insisted much by way of palliation on the ladys extreme niceness on her diffidence in my honor on miss howes contriving spirit plots on their parts begetting plots on mine on the high passions of the sex i asserted that my whole view in gently restraining her was to oblige her to forgive me and to marry me and this for the honor of both families i boasted of my own good qualities some of which none that know me deny and which few libertines can lay claim to  they then fell into warm admirations and praises of the lady all of them preparatory as i knew to the grand question and thus it was introduced by lady sarah  we have said as much as i think we can say upon these letters of the poor lady to dwell upon the mischiefs that may ensue from the abuse of a person of her rank if all the reparation be not made that now can be made would perhaps be to little purpose but you seem sir still to have a just opinion of her as well as affection for her her virtue is not in the least questionable she could not resent as she does had she any thing to reproach herself with she is by everybodys account a fine woman has a good estate in her own right is of no contemptible family though i think with regard to her they have acted as imprudently as unworthily for the excellency of her mind for good economy the common speech of her as the worthy dr lewin once told me is that her prudence would enrich a poor man and her piety reclaim a licentious one i who have not been abroad twice this twelvemonth came hither purposely so did lady betty to see if justice may not be done her and also whether we and my lord m your nearest relations sir have or have not any influence over you and for my own part as your determination shall be in this article such shall be mine with regard to the disposition of all that is within my power  lady betty and mine  and mine said my lord and valiantly he swore to it   lovel far be it from me to think slightly of favors you may any of you be glad i would deserve but as far be it from me to enter into conditions against my own liking with sordid views  as to future mischiefs let them come i have not done with the harlowes yet they were the aggressors and i should be glad they would let me hear from them in the way they should hear from me in the like case perhaps i should not be sorry to be found rather than be obliged to seek on this occasion   miss charlotte reddening spoke like a man of violence rather than a man of reason i hope you will allow that cousin   lady sarah well but since what is done is done and cannot be undone let us think of the next best have you any objection against marrying miss harlowe if she will have you   lovel there can possibly be but one that she is everywhere no doubt as well as to lady betty pursuing that maxim peculiar to herself and let me tell you so it ought to be that what she cannot conceal from herself she will publish to all the world   miss patty the lady to be sure writes this in the bitterness of her grief and in despair  and this from you cousin patty  sweet girl and would you my dear in the like case whispering her have meant no more by the like exclamations  i had a rap with her fan and a blush and from lord m a reflection that i turned into jest every thing they said  i asked if they thought the harlowes deserved any consideration from me and whether that family would not exult over me were i to marry their daughter as if i dared not to do otherwise   lady sarah once i was angry with that family as w all were but now i pity them and think that you have but too well justified the worst treatment they gave you   lord m their family is of standing all gentlemen of it and rich and reputable let me tell you that many of our coronets would be glad they could derive their descents from no worse a stem than theirs   lovel they are a narrowsould and implacable family i hate them and though i revere the lady scorn all relation to them   lady betty i wish no worse could be said of him who is such a scorner of common failings in others   lord m how would my sister lovelace have reproached herself for all her indulgent folly to this favorite boy of hers had she lived till now and been present on this occasion   lady sarah well but begging your lordships pardon let us see if any thing can be done for this poor lady   miss chapter if mr lovelace has nothing to object against the ladys character and i presume to think he is not ashamed to do her justice though it may make against himself i cannot see but honor and generosity will compel from him all that we expect if there be any levities any weaknesses to be charged upon the lady i should not open my lips in her favor though in private i would pity her and deplore her hard hap and yet even then there might not want arguments from honor and gratitude in so particular a case to engage you sir to make good the vows it is plain you have broken   lady betty my niece charlotte has called upon you so justly and has put the question to you so properly that i cannot but wish you would speak to it directly and without evasion   all in a breath then bespoke my seriousness and my justice and in this manner i delivered myself assuming an air sincerely solemn  i am very sensible that the performance of the task you have put me upon will leave me without excuse but i will not have recourse either to evasion or palliation  as my cousin charlotte has severely observed i am not ashamed to do justice to miss harlowes merit in words although i will confess that i ought to blush that i have done it so little in deeds  i own to you all and what is more with high regret if not with shame cousin charlotte that i have a great deal to answer for in my usage of this lady the sex has not a nobler mind nor a lovelier person of it and for virtue i could not have believed excuse me ladies that there ever was a woman who gave or could have given such illustrious such uniform proofs of it for in her whole conduct she has shown herself to be equally above temptation and art and i had almost said human frailty  the step she so freely blames herself for taking was truly what she calls compulsatory for though she was provoked to think of going off with me she intended it not nor was provided to do so neither would she ever have had the thought of it had her relations left her free upon her offered composition to renounce the man she did not hate in order to avoid the man she did  it piqud my pride i own that i could so little depend upon the force of those impressions which i had the vanity to hope i had made in a heart so delicate and in my worst devices against her i encouraged myself that i abused no confidence for none had she in my honor  the evils she has suffered it would have been more than a miracle had she avoided er watchfulness rendered more plots abortive than those which contributed to her fall and they were many and various and all her greater trials and hardships were owing to her oble resistance and just resentment  i know proceeded i how much i condemn myself in the justice i am doing to this excellent creature but yet i will do her justice and cannot help it if i would and i hope this shows that i am not so totally abandoned as i have been thought to be  indeed with me she has done more honor to hte sex in her fall if it be to be called a fall in truth  ought not than ever any other could do in her standing  when at length i had given her watchful virt cause of suspicion i was then indeed obliged to mak use of power and art to hinder her from escaping from me she then formed contrivances to elude mine b all hers were such as strict truth and punctilious honor would justify she could not stoop to deceit and falsehood no not to save herself more than once justly did she tell me fired by conscious worthiness that her soul was my souls superior  forgive me ladies for saying that till i knew her i questioned a soul in a sex created as i was willing to suppose only for temporary purposes  it is not to be imagined into what absurdities men of free principles run in order to justify to themselves their free practices and to make a religion to their minds and yet in this respect i have not been so faulty as some others  no wonder that such a noble creature as this looked upon every studied artifice as a degree of baseness not to be forgiven no wonder that she could so easily become averse to the man though once she beheld him with an eye not wholly indifferent whom she thought capable of premeditated guilt  nor give me leave on the other hand to say is it to be wondered at that the man who found it so difficult to be forgiven for the sghter offenses and who had not the grace to recede or repent made desperate should be hurried on to the commission of the greater  in short ladies in a word my lord miss clarissa harlowe is an angel if ever there was or could be one in human nature and is and ever was as pure as an angel in her will and this justice i must do her although the question i see by every glistening eye is ready to be asked what then lovelace are you   lord m a devil  a damned devil i must answer and may the curse of god follow you in all you undertake if you do not make her the best amends now in your power to make her   lovl from you my lord i could expect no other but from the ladies i hope for less violence from the ingenuity of my confession  the ladies elder and younger had their handkerchiefs to their eyes at the just testimony which i bore to the merits of this exalted creature and which i would make no scruple to bear at the bar of a court of justice were i to be called to it   lady betty well sir this is a noble character if you think as you speak surely you cannot refuse to do the lady all the justice now in your power to do her   they all joined in this demand  i pleaded that i was sure she would not have me that when she had taken a resolution she was not to be moved unpersuadableness was an harlowe sin that and her name i told them were all she had of theirs  all were of opinion that she might in her present desolate circumstances be brought to forgive me lady sarah said that her sister and she would endeavor to find out the noble sufferer as they justly called her and would take her into their protection and be guaranties to her of the justice that i would do her as well after marriage as before  it was some pleasure to me to observe the placability of these ladies of my own family had they any or either of them met with a lovelace but twould be hard upon us honest fellows jack if all women were clarissas  here i am obliged to break off  letter xxxii mr lovelace in continuation it is much better jack to tell your own story when it must be know than to have an adversary tell it for you conscious of this i gave them a particular account how urgent i had been with her to fix upon the thursday after i left her it being her uncle harlowes anniversary birthday and named to oblige her for the private celebration having some days before actually procured a license which still remained with her  that not being able to prevail upon her to promise any thing while under a supposed restraint i offered to leave her at full liberty if she would give me the least hope for that day but neither did this offer avail me  that this inflexibleness making me desperate i resolved to add to my former fault by giving directions that she should not either go or correspond out of the house till i returned from m hall well knowing that if she were at full liberty i must for ever lose her  that this constraint had so much incensed her that although i wrote no less than four different letters i could not procure a single word in answer though i pressed her but for four words to signify the day and the church  i referred to my two cousins to vouch for me the extraordinary methods i took to send messengers to town though they knew not the occasion which now i told them was this  i acquainted them that i even had wrote to you jack and to another gentleman of whom i thought she had a good opinion to attend her in order to press for her compliance holding myself in readiness the last day at salthill to meet the messenger they should send and proceed to london if his message were favorable but that before they could attend her she had found means to fly away once more and is now said i perched perhaps somewhere under lady bettys window at glenham hall and there like the sweet philomela a thorn in her breast warbles forth her melancholy complaints against her barbarous tereus  lady betty declared that she was not with her nor did she know where she was she should be she added the most welcome guest to her that she ever received  in truth i had a suspicion that she was already in their knowledge and taken into their protection for lady sarah i imagined incapable of being roused to this spirit by a letter only from miss harlowe and that not directed to herself she being a very indolent and melancholy woman but her sister i find had wrought her up to it for lady betty is as officious and managing a woman as mrs how but of a much more generous and noble disposition  she is my aunt jack  i supposed i said that her ladyship might have a private direction where to send to her i spoke as i wished i would have given the world to have heard that she was inclined to cultivate the interest of any of my family  lady betty answered that she had no direction but what was in the letter which she had scratched out and which it was probable was only a temporary one in order to avoid me otherwise she would hardly have directed an answer to be left at an inn and she was of opinion that to apply to miss how would be the only certain way to succeed in any application for forgiveness would i enable that young lady to interest herself in procuring it  miss charlotte permit me to make a proposal  since we are all of one mind in relation to the justice due to miss harlowe if mr lovelace will oblige himself to marry her i will make miss how a visit little as i am acquainted with her and endeavor to engage her interest to forward the desired reconciliation and if this can be done i make no question but all may be happily accommodated for everybody knows the love there is between miss harlowe and miss how  marriage with these women thou see jack is an atonement for all we can do to them a true dramatic recompense  this motion was highly approved of and i gave my honor as desired in the fullest manner they could wish   lady sarah well then cousin charlotte begin your treaty with miss how out of hand   lady betty pray do and let miss harlowe be told that i am ready to receive her as the welcomest of guests and i will not have her out of my sight till the knot is tied   lady sarah tell her from me that she shall be my daughter  instead of my poor betsey  and shed a tear in remembrance of her lost daughter   lord m what say you sir to this   lovel content my lord i speak in the language of your house   lord m we are not to be fooled nephew no quibbling we will have no stur put upon us   lovel you shall not and yet i did not intend to marry if she exceeded the appointed thursday but i think according to her own notions that i have injure her beyond reparation although i were to make her  best of husbands as i am resolved to be if she  condescend as i will call it to have me and be thi cousin charlotte my part of your commission to say  this pleased them all   lord m give thy hand bob  thou talkest like man of honor at last i hope we may depend upon w thou say  the ladies eyes put the same question to me   lovel you may my lord you may ladies absolutely you may   then was the personal character of the lady as well as her more extraordinary talents and endowments again expatiated upon and miss patty who had once seen her launched out more than all the rest in her praise these were followed by familycogencies what never are forgotten to be inquired after in marriagetreaties the principal inducements to the sages of a family and the least to be mentioned by the parties themselves although even by them perhaps the first thought of that is to say inquisition into the ladys fortune into the particulars of the grandfathers estate and what her father and her singlesould uncles will probably do for her if a reconciliation be effected as by their means they make no doubt but it will between both families if it be not my fault the two venerables no longer tabbies with me now hinted at rich presents on their own parts and my lord declared that he would make such overtures in my behalf as should render my marriage with miss harlowe the best days work i ever made and what he doubted not but would be as agreeable to that family as to myself  thus at present by a single hair hangs over my head the matrimonial sword and thus ended my trial and thus are we all friends and cousin and cousin and nephew and nephew at every word  did ever comedy end more happily than this long trial  letter xxxiii mr lovelace to john belford esquire wedn july    so jack they think they have gained a mighty point but were i to change my mind were i to repent i fancy i am safe  and yet this very moment it rises to my mind that it is hard trusting too for surely there must be some embers where there was fire so lately that may be stirred up to give a blaze to combustibles strewn lightly upon them love like some selfpropagating plants or roots which have taken strong hold in the earth when once got deep into the heart is hardly ever totally extirpated except by matrimony indeed which is the grave of love because it allows of the end of love then these ladies all advocates for herself with herself miss how at their head perhaps  not in favor to me  i dont expect that from miss how  but perhaps in favor to herself for miss how has reason to apprehend vengeance from me i ween her hickman will be safe too as she may think if i marry her beloved friend for he has been a busy fellow and i have long wished to have a slap at him  the ladys case desperate with her friends too and likely to be so while single and her character exposed to censure  a husband is a charming cloak a figleafd apron for a wife and for a lady to be protected in liberties in diversions which her hear pants after  and all her faults even the most criminal were she to be detected to be thrown upon the husband and the ridicule too a charming eligible for a wife  but i shall have one comfort if i marry which pleases me not a little if a mans wife has a dear friend of her sex a hundred liberties may be taken with that friend which could not be taken if the single lady knowing what a title to freedoms marriage has given him with her friend was not less scrupulous with him than she ought to be as to herself then there are broad freedoms shall i call them that may be taken by the husband with his wife that may not be quite shocking which if the wife bears before her friend will serve for a lesson to that friend and if that friend bears to be present at them without check or bashfulness will show a sagacious fellow that she can bear as much herself at proper time and place chastity jack like piety is an uniform thing if in look if in speech a girl gives way to undue levity depent upon it the devil has got one of his cloven feet in her heart already  so hickman take care of thyself i advise thee whether i marry or not  thus jack have i at once reconciled myself to all my relations  and if the lady refuses me thrown the fault upon her this i knew would be in my power to do at any time and i was the more arrogant to them in order to heighten the merit of my compliance  but after all it would be very whimsical would it not if all my plots and contrivances should end in wedlock what a punishment would this come out to be upon myself too that all this while i have been plundering my own treasury  but jack two things i must insist upon with thee if this is to be the case  having put secrets of so high a nature between me and my spouse into thy power i must for my own honor and the honor of my wife and my illustrious progeny first oblige thee to give up the letters i have so profusely scribbled to thee and in the next place do by thee as i have heard whispered in france was done by the true father of a certain monarque that is to say cut thy throat to prevent thy telling of tales  i have found means to heighten the kind opinion my friends here have begun to have of me by communicating to them the contents of the four last letters which i wrote to press my elected spouse to solemnize my lord has repeated one of his phrases in my favor that he hopes it will come out that the devil is not quite so black as he is painted  now prythee dear jack since so many good consequences are to flow from these our nuptials one of which to thyself since the sooner thou die the less thou will have to answer for and that i nowandthen am apt to believe there may be something in the old fellows notion who once told us that he who kills a man has all that mans sins to answer for as well as his own because he gave him not the time to repent of them that heaven designed to allow him a fine thing for thee if thou consentest to be knocked of the head but a cursed one for the manslayer and since there may be room to fear that miss how will not give us her help i prythee now exert thyself to find out my clarissa harlowe that i may make a lovelace of her set all the city bellmen and the country criers for ten miles round the metropolis at work with their o yess and if any man woman or child can give tale or tidings  advertise her in all the newspapers and let her know that if she will repair to lady betty lawrance or to miss charlotte montague she may hear of something greatly to her advantage  my two cousins montague are actually to set out tomorrow to mrs howes to engage her vixen daughters interest with her friend to flaunt it away in a chariot and six for the greater state and significance  confounded mortification to be reduced thus low  my pride hardly knows how to brook it  lord m has engaged the two venerables to stay here to attend the issue and i standing very high at present in their good graces am to gallant them to oxford to blenheim and several other places  letter xxxiv miss how to miss clarissa harlowe thursday night july    collins sets not out tomorrow some domestic occasion hinders him rogers is but now returned from you and cannot well be spared mr hickman is gone upon an affair of my mothers and has taken both his servants with him to do credit to his employer so i am forced to venture this by the post directed by your assumed name  i am to acquaint you that i have been favored with a visit from miss montague and her sister in lord ms chariot and six my lords gentleman rode here yesterday with a request that i would receive a visit from the two young ladies on a very particular occasion the greater favor if it might be the next day  as i had so little personal knowledge of either i doubted not but it must be in relation to the interests of my dea friend and so consulting with my mother i sent them an invitation to favor me because of the distance wit their company at dinner which they kindly accepted  i hope my dear since things have been so very bad that their errand to me will be as agreeable to you a any thing that can now happen they came in the name of lord m and his two sisters to desire my interest to engage you to put yourself into the protection of lady betty lawrance who will not part with you till she sees all the justice done you that now can be done  lady sarah sadleir had not stirred out for a twelvemonth before never since she lost her agreeable daughter whom you and i saw at mrs bensons but was induced to take this journey by her sister purely to procure you reparation if possible and their joint strength united with lord ms has so far succeeded that the wretch has bound himself to them and to these young ladies in the solemnest manner to wed you in their presence if they can prevail upon you to give him your hand  this consolation you may take to yourself that all this honorable family have a duc that is the highest sense of your merit and greatly admire you the horrid creature has not spared himself in doing justice to you virtue and the young ladies gave us such an account of his confessions and selfcondemnation that my mother was quite charmed with you and we all four shed tears of joy that there is one of our sex i that that one is my dearest friend who has done so much honor to it as to deserve the selfconvicted praises he gave you though pity for the excellent creature mixed with the sensibility  he promises by them to make the best of husbands and my lord and his two sisters are both to be guarantees that he will be so noble settlements noble presents they talked of they say they left lord m and his two sisters talking of nothing else but of those presents and settlements how most to do you honor the greater in proportion for the indignities you have suffered and of changing of names by act of parliament preparative to the interest they will all join to make to get the titles to go where the bulk of the estate must go at my lords death which they apprehend to be nearer than they wish nor doubt they of a thorough reformation in his morals from your example and influence over him  i made a great many objections for you  all i believe that you could have made yourself had you been present but i have no doubt to advise you my dear and so does my mother instantly to put yourself into lady bettys protection with a resolution to take the wretch for your husband all his future grandeur he wants not pride depends upon his sincerity to you and the young ladies vouch for the depth of his concern for the wrongs he has done you  all his apprehension is in your readiness to communicate to every one as he fears the evils you have suffered which he thinks will expose you both but had you not revealed them to lady betty you had not had so warm a friend since it is owing to two letters you wrote to her that all this good as i hope it will prove was brought about but i advise you to be more sparing in exposing what is past whether you have thoughts of accepting him or not for what my dear can that avail now but to give a handle to vile wretches to triumph over your friends since every one will not know how much to your honor your very sufferings have been  your melancholy letter brought by rogers see letter xxvii p    preceding with his account of your indifferent health confirmed to rogers by the woman of the house as well as by your looks and by your faintness while you talked with him would have given me inexpressible affliction had i not been cheered by this agreeable visit from the young ladies i hope you will be equally so on my imparting the subject of it to you  indeed my dear you must not hesitate you must oblige them the alliance is splendid and honorable very few will know any thing of his brutal baseness to you all must end in a little while in a general reconciliation and you will be able to resume your course of doing the good to every deserving object which procured you blessings wherever you set your foot  i am concerned to find that your fathers rash wish affects you so much as it does upon my word my dear your mind is weakened grievously you must not indeed you must not desert yourself the penitence you talk of  it is for them to be penitent who hurried you into evils you could not well avoid you judge by the unhappy event rather than upon the true merits of your case upon my honor i think you faultless in almost every step you have taken what has not that vilely insolent and ambitious yet stupid brother of yours to answer for  that spiteful thing your sister too   but come since what is past cannot be helped let us look forward you have now happy prospects opening to you a family already nobl ready to receive and embrace you with open arms and joyful hearts and who by their love to you will teach another family who know not what an excellence they have confederated to persecute how to value you your prudence your piety will crown all it will reclaim a wretch that for an hundred sakes more than for his own one would wish to be reclaimed  like a traveller who has been put out of his way by the overflowing of some rapid stream you have only had the foreright path you were in overwhelmed a few miles about a day or two only lost as i may say and you are in a way to recover it and by quickening your speed will get up the lost time the hurry upon your spirits mean time will be all your inconvenience for it was not your fault you were stopped in your progress  think of this my dear and improve upon the allegory as you know how if you can without impeding your progress be the means of assuaging the inundation of bounding the waters within their natural channel and thereby of recovering the overwhelmed path for the sake of future passengers who travel the same way what a merit will yours be   i shall impatiently expect your next letter the young ladies proposed that you should put yourself if in town or near it into the reading stagecoach which inns somewhere in fleet street and if you give notice of the day you will be met on the road and that pretty early in your journey by some of both sexes one of whom you will not be sorry to see  mr hickman shall attend you at slough and lady betty herself and one of the misses montague with proper equipages will be at reading to receive you and carry you directly to the seat of the former for i have expressly stipulated that the

half distracted ever since saturday night  we knew not what ailed him till your letter was brought  vile wretch as he is he is however innocent of this new evil  indeed he is he must be as i shall more at large acquaint you  but will not now detain your messenger  only to satisfy your just impatience by telling you that the dear young lady is safe and we hope well  a horrid mistake of his general orders has subjected her to the terror and disgrace of an arrest  poor dear miss harlowe her sufferings have endeared her to us almost as much as her excellencies can have done to you  but she must be now quite at liberty  he has been a distracted man ever since the news was brought him and we knew not what ailed him  but that i said before  my lord m my lady sarah sadleir and my lady betty lawrance will all write to you this very afternoon  and so will the wretch himself  and send it by a servant of their own not to detain yours  i know not what i write  but you shall have all the particulars just and true and fair from  dear madam your most faithful and obedient servant chapter montague  letter xxxix miss montague to miss how m hall july    dear madam in pursuance of my promise i will minutely inform you of everything we know relating to this schocking transaction  when we returned from you on thursday night and made our report of the kind reception both we and our message met with in that you had been so good as to promise to use your interest with your dear friend it put us all into such good humor with one another and with my cousin lovelace that we resolved upon a little tour of two days the friday and saturday in order to give an airing to my lord and lady srah both having been long confined one by illness the other by melancholy my lord his two sisters and myself were in the coach and all our talk was of dear miss harlowe and of our future happiness with her mr lovelace and my sister who is his favorite as he is hers were in his phaeton and whenever we joined company that was still the subject  as to him never man praised a lady as he did her never man gave greater hopes and made better resolutions he is none of those that are governed by interest he is too proud for that but most sincerely delighted was he in talking of her and of his hopes of her returning favor he said however more than once that he feared she would not forgive him for from his heart he must say he deserved not her forgiveness and often and often that there was not such a woman in the world  this i mention to show you madam that he could not at this very time be privy to such a barbarous and disgraceful treatment  we returned not till saturday night all in as good humor with one another as went out we never had such pleasure in his company before if he would be good and as he ought to be no man would be better beloved by relations than he but never was there a greater alteration in man when he came home and received a letter from a messenger who it seems had been flattering himself in hopes of a reward and had been waiting for his return from the night before in such a fury  the man fared but badly he instantly shut himself up to write and ordered man and horse to be ready to set out before daylight the next morning to carry the letter to a friend in london  he would not see us all that night neither breakfast nor dine with us next day he ought he said never to see the light and bid my sister whom he called an innocent and she being very desirous to know the occasion of all this shun him saying he was a wretch and made so by his own inventions and the consequences of them  none of us could get out of him what so disturbed him we should too soon hear he said to the utter dissipation of all his hopes and all ours  we could easily suppose that all was not right with regard to the worthy young lady  he was out each day and said he wanted to run away from himself  late on monday night he received a letter from mr belford his most favored friend by his own messenger who came back in a foam man and horse whatever were the contents he was not easier but like a madman rather but still would not let us know the occasion but to my sister he said nobody my dear patsey who can think but of half the plagues that pursue an intriguing spirit would ever quit the right path  he was out when your messenger came but soon came in and bad enough was his reception from us all and he said that his own torments were greater than ours than miss harlowes or yours madam all put together he would see your letter he always carries everything before him and said when he had read it that he thanked god he was not such a villain as you with too much reason thought him  thus then he owned the matter to be  he had left general directions to the people of the lodgings the dear lady went from to find out where she was gone to if possible that he might have an opportunity to importune her to be his before their difference was public the wicked people officious at least if not wicked discovered where she was on wednesday and for fear she should remove before they could have his orders they put her under a gentle restraint as they call it and dispatched away a messenger to acquaint him with it and to take his orders  this messenger arrived here on friday afternoon and tarried till we returned on saturday night  and when he read the letter he brought  i have told you madam what a fury he was in  the letter he retired to write and which he dispatched away so early on sunday morning was to conjure his friend mr belford on receipt of it to fly to the lady and set her free and to order all her things to be sent her and to clear him of so black and villainous a fact as he justly called it  and by this time he doubts not that all is happily over and the beloved of his soul as he calls her at every word in an easier and happier way than she was before the horrid fact and now he owns that the reason why mr belfords letter set him into stronger ravings was because of his keeping him wilfully and on purpose to torment him in suspense and reflecting very heavily upon him for mr belford he says was ever the ladys friend and advocate and only mentioning that he had waited upon her referring to his next for further particulars which he could have told him at the time  he declares and we can vouch for him that he ha been ever since last saturday night the miserablest of men  he forbore going up himself that it might not be imagined he was guilty of so black a contrivance and went up to complete any base views in consequence of it  believe us all dear miss how under the deepest concern at this unhappy accident which will we fear exasperate the charming sufferer not too much for the occasion but too much for our hopes  o what wretches are these freeliving men who love to tread in intricate paths and when once they e know not how far out of the way their headstrong course may lead them  my sister joins her thanks with mine to your good mother and self for the favors you heaped upon us last thursday we beseech your continued interest as to the subject of our visit it shall be all our studies to oblige and recompense the dear lady to the utmost of our power for what she has suffered from the unhappy man  we are dear madam  your obliged and faithful servants charlotte montague martha montague   dear miss how we join in the above request of miss charlotte and miss patty montague for your favor and interest being convinced that the accident was an accident and no plot or contrivance of a wretch too full of them we are madam  your most obedient humble servants m sarah sadleir eliz lawrance   dear miss how after what is written above by names and characters of such unquestionable honor i might have been excused signing a name almost as hateful to myself as i know it is to you but the above will have it so since therefore i must write it shall be the truth which is that if i may be once more admitted to pay my duty to the most deserving and most injured of her sex i will be content to do it with a halter about my neck and attended by a parson on my right hand and the hangman on my left be doomed at her will either to the church or the gallows  tuesday july    your most humble servant robt lovelace  letter xl mr belford to robert lovelace esquire sunday night july    what a cursed piece of work have thou made of it with the most excellent of women thou may be in earnest or in jest as thou will but the poor lady will not be long either thy sport or the sport of fortune  i will give thee an account of a scene that wants but her affecting pen to represent it justly and it would wring all the black blood out of thy callous heart  thou only who art the author of her calamities should have attended her in her prison i am unequal to such a task nor know i any other man but would  this last act however unintended by thee yet a consequence of thy general orders and too likely to be thought agreeable to thee by those who know thy other villainies by her has finished thy barbarous work and i advise thee to trumpet forth everywhere how much in earnest thou art to marry her whether thou art or not  thou may safely do it she will not live to put thee to the trial and it will a little palliate for thy enormous usage of her and be a means to make mankind who know not what i know of the matter herd a little longer with thee and forbear to hunt thee to thy fellowsavages in the libyan wilds and deserts  your messenger found me at edgware expecting to dinner with me several friends whom i had invited three days before i sent apologies to them as in a case of life and death and speeded to town to the wicked womans for how knew i but shocking attempts might be made upon her by the cursed wretches perhaps by thy contrivance in order to mortify her into thy measures  little knows the public what villainies are committed in these abominable houses upon innocent creatures drawn into their snares  finding the lady not there i posted away to the officers although sally told me that she had been but just come from thence and that she had refused to see her or as she sent down word anybody else being resolved to have the remainder of that sunday to herself as it might perhaps be the last she should ever see  i had the same thing told me when i got thither  i sent up to let her know that i came with a commission to set her at liberty i was afraid of sending up the name of a man known to be thy friend she absolutely refused to see any man however for that day or to answer further to any thing said from me  having therefore informed myself of all that the officer and his wife and servant could acquaint me with as well in relation to the horrid arrest as to her behavior and the womens to her and her ill state of health i went back to sinclairs as i will still call her and heard the three womens story from all which i am enabled to give thee the following shocking particulars which may serve till i can see the unhappy lady herself tomorrow if then i can gain admittance to her thou will find that i have been very minute in my inquiries  thy villain it was that set the poor lady and had the impudence to appear and abet the sheriffs officers in the cursed transaction he thought no doubt that he was doing the most acceptable service to his blessed master they had got a chair the head ready up as soon as service was over and as she came out of the church at the door fronting bedfordstreet the officers stepping to her whispered that they had an action against her  she was terrified trembled and turned pale  action said she what is that  i have committed no bad action  lord bless me men what mean you  that you are our prisoner madam

demanded to see the fellows authority  they showed it is your name clarissa harlowe madam said he  yes yes indeed ready to sink my name was clarissa harlowe  but it is now wretchedness  lord be merciful to me what is to come next  you must go with these men madam said the gentleman they have authority for what they do he pitied her and retired  indeed you must said one chairman  indeed you must said the other  can nobody joined in another gentleman be applied to who will see that so fine a creature is not ill used  thy villain answered orders were given particularly for that she had rich relations she need but ask and have she would only be carried to the officers house till matters could be made up the people she had lodged with loved her but she had left her lodgings privately  o had she those tricks already cried one or two  she heard not this  but said well if i must go i must  i cannot resist  but i will not be carried to the womans  i will rather die at your feet than be carried to the womans  you will not be carried there madam cried thy fellow  only to my house madam said one of the officers  where is that  in highholborn madam  i know not where highholborn is but anywhere except to the womans  but am i to go with men only  looking about her and seeing the three passages to wit that leading to henriettastreet that to king street and the foreright one to bedfordstreet crowded she started  anywhere  anywhere said she but to the womans and stepping into the chair threw herself on the seat in the utmost distress and confusion  carry me carry me out of sight  cover me  cover me up  for ever  were her words  thy villain drew the curtains she had not power and they went away with her through a vast crowd of people  here i must rest i can write no more at present only lovelace remember all this was to a clarissa  the unhappy lady fainted away when she was taken out of the chair at the officers house  several people followed the chair to the very house which is in a wretched court sally was there and satisfied some of the inquirers that the young gentlewoman would be exceedingly well used and they soon dispersed  dorcas was also there but came not in her sight sally as a favor offered to carry her to her former lodgings but she declared they should carry her thither a corpse if they did  very gentle usage the women boast of so would a vultur could it speak with the entrails of its prey upon its rapacious talons of this thou wilt judge from what i have to recite  she asked what was meant by this usage of her  people told me said she that i must go with the men  that they had authority to take me so i submitted but now what is to be the end of this disgraceful violence  the end said the vile sally martin is for honest people to come at their own  bless me have i taken away any thing that belongs to those who have obtained this power over me  i have left very valuable things behind me but have taken nothing away that is not my own  and who do you think miss harlowe for i understand said the cursed creature you are not married who do you think is to pay for your board and your lodgings such handsome lodgings for so long a time as you were at mrs sinclairs  lord have mercy upon me miss martin i think you are miss martin  and is this the cause of such a disgraceful insult upon me in the open streets  and cause enough miss harlowe fond of gratifying her jealous revenge by calling her miss  one hundred and fifty guineas or pounds is no small sum to lose  and by a young creature who would have bilked her lodgings  you amaze me miss martin  what language do you talk in  bilk my lodgings  what is that  she stood astonished and silent for a few moments  but recovering herself and turning from her to the window she wrung her hands the cursed sally showed me how and lifting them up  now lovelace now indeed do i think i ought to forgive thee  but who shall forgive clarissa harlowe  o my sister o my brother tender mercies were your cruelties to this  after a pause her handkerchief drying up her falling tears she turned to sally now have i nothing to do but acquiesce  only let me say that if this aunt of yours this mrs sinclair or this man this mr lovelace come near me or if i am carried to the horrid house for that i suppose is to be the end of this new outrage god be merciful to the poor clarissa harlowe  look to the consequence  look i charge you to the consequence  the vile wretch told her it was not designed to carry her anywhither against her will but if it were they should take care not to be frighted again by a penknife  she cast up her eyes to heaven and was silent  and went to the farthest corner of the room and sitting down threw her handkerchief over her face  sally asked her several questions but not answering her she told her she would wait upon her byandby when she had found her speech  she ordered the people to press her to eat and drink she must be fasting nothing but her prayers and tears poor thing were the merciless devils words as she owned to me  do think i did not curse her  she went away and after her own dinner returned  the unhappy lady by this devils account of her then seemed either mortified into meekness or to have made a resolution not to be provoked by the insults of this cursed creature  sally inquired in her presence whether she had eat or drank anything and being told by the woman that she could not prevail upon her to taste a morsel or drink a drop she said this is wrong miss harlowe very wrong  your religion i think should teach you that starving yourself is selfmurder  she answered not  the wretch owned she was resolved to make her speak  she asked if mabell should attend her till it were seen what her friends would do for her in discharge of the debt mabell said she has not yet earned the clothes you were so good as to give her  am i not worth an answer miss harlowe  i would answer you said the sweet sufferer without any emotion if i knew how  i have ordered pen ink and paper to be brought you miss harlowe there they are i know you love writeing you may write to whom you please your friend miss how will expect to hear from you  i have no friend said she i deserve none  rowland for that is the officers name told her she had friends enough to pay the debt if she would write  she would trouble nobody she had no friends was all they could get from her while sally staid but yet spoken with a patience of spirit as if she enjoyed her griefs  the insolent creature went away ordering them in her hearing to be very civil to her and to let her want for nothing now had she she owned the triumph of her heart over this haughty beauty who kept them all at such a distance in their own house  what think thou lovelace of this  this wretchs triumph was over a clarissa  about six in the evening rowlands wife pressed her to drink tea she said she had rather have a glass of water for her tongue was ready to cleave to the roof of her mouth  the woman brought her a glass and some bread and butter she tried to taste the latter but could not swallow it but eagerly drank the water lifting up her eyes in thankfulness for that  the divine clarissa lovelace  reduced to rejoice for a cup of cold water  by whom reduced  about nine oclock she asked if anybody were to be her bedfellow  their maid if she pleased or as she was so weak and ill the girl should sit up with her if she chose she should  she chose to be alone both night and day she said but might she not be trusted with the keys of the room where she was to lie down for she should not put off her clothes  that they told her could not be  she was afraid not she said  but indeed she would not get away if she could  they told me that they had but one bed besides that they lay in themselves which they would fain have had her accept of and besides that their maid lay in in a garret which they called a hole of a garret and that that one bed was the prisoners bed which they made several apologies to me about i suppose it is shocking enough  but the lady would not lie in theirs was she not a prisoner she said  let her have the prisoners room  yet they owned that she started when she was conducted thither but recovering herself very well said she  why should not all be of a piece  why should not my wretchedness be complete  she found fault that all the fastenings were on the outside and none within and said she could not trust herself in a room where others could come in at their pleasure and she not go out she had not been used to it  dear dear soul  my tears flow as i write  indeed lovelace she had not been used to such treatment  they assured her that it was as much their duty to protect her from other persons insults as from escaping herself  then they were people of more honor she said than she had of late been used to  she asked if they knew mr lovelace  no was their answer  have you heard of him  no  well then you may be good sort of folks in your way  pause here a moment lovelace  and reflect  i must  again they asked her if they should send any word to her lodgings  these are my lodgings now are they not  was all her answer  she sat up in a chair all night the back against the door having it seems thrust a broken piece of a poker through the staples where a bolt had been on the inside  next morning sally and polly both went to visit her  she had begged of sally the day before that she might not see mrs sinclair nor dorcas nor the brokentoothed servant called william  polly would have ingratiated herself with her and pretended to be concerned for her misfortunes but she took no more notice of her than of the other  they asked if she had any commands  if she had she only need to mention what they were and she should be obeyed  none at all she said  how did she like the people of the house were they civil to her  pretty well considering she had no money to give them  would she accept of any money they could put it to her account  she would contract no debts  had she any money about her  she meekly put her hand in her pocket and pulled out half a guinea and a little silver yes i have a little  but here should be fees paid i believe should there not i have heard of entrancemoney to compound for not being stripped but these people are very civil people i fancy for they have not offered to take away my clothes  they have orders to be civil to you  it is very kind  but we two will bail you miss if you will go back with us to mrs sinclairs  not for the world  hers are very handsome apartments  the fitter for those who own them  these are very sad ones  the fitter for me  you may be very happy yet miss if you will  i hope i shall  if you refuse to eat or drink we will give bail and take you with us  then i will try to eat and drink anything but go with you  will you not send to your new lodgings the people will be frighted  so they will if i send so they will if they know where i am  but have you no things to send for from thence  there is what will pay for their lodgings and trouble i shall not lessen their security  but perhaps letters or messages may be left for you there  i have very few friends and to those i have i will spare the mortification of knowing what has befallen me  we are surprised at your indifference miss harlowe will you not write to any of your friends  no  why you dont think of tarrying here always  i shall not live always  do you think you are to stay here as long as you live  that is as it shall please god and those who have brought me hither  should you like to be at liberty  i am miserable  what is liberty to the miserable but to be more miserable  how miserable miss  you may make yourself as happy as you please  i hope you are both happy  we are  may you be more and more happy  but we wish you to be so too  i never shall be of your opinion i believe as to what happiness is  what do you take our opinion of happiness to be  to live at mrs sinclairs  perhaps said sally we were once as squeamish and narrowminded as you  how came it over with you  because we saw the ridiculousness of prudery  do you come hither to persuade me to hate prudery as you call it as much as you do  we came to offer our service to you  it is out of your power to serve me  perhaps not  it is not in my inclination to trouble you  you may be worse offered  perhaps i may  you are mighty short miss  as i wish your visit to be ladies  they owned to me that they cracked their fans and laughed  adieu perverse beauty  your servant ladies  adieu haughtyairs  you see me humbled   as you deserve miss harlowe pride will have a fall  better fall with what you call pride than stand with meanness  who does  i had once a better opinion of you miss horton  indeed you should not insult the miserable  neither should the miserable said sally insult people for their civility  i should be sorry if i did  mrs sinclair shall attend you byandby to know if you have any commands for her  i have no wish for any liberty but that of refusing to see her and one more person  what we came for was to know if you had any proposals to make for your enlargement  then it seems the officer put in you have very good friends madam i understand is it not better that you make it up charges will run high a hundred and fifty guineas are easier paid than two hundred let these ladies bail you and go along with them or write to your friends to make it up  sally said there is a gentleman who saw you taken and was so much moved for you miss harlowe that he would gladly advance the money for you and leave you to pay it when you can  see lovelace what cursed devils these are this is the way we know that many an innocent heart is thrown upon keeping and then upon the town but for these wretches thus to go to work with such an angel as this  how glad would have been the devilish sally to have had the least handle to report to thee a listening ear or patient spirit upon this hint  sir said she with high indignation to the officer did not you say last night that it was as much your business to protect me from the insults of others as from escaping  cannot i be permitted to see whom i please and to refuse admittance to those i like not  your creditors madam will expect to see you  not if i declare i will not treat with them  then madam you will be sent to prison  prison friend  what do thou call thy house  not a prison madam  why these ironbarred windows then why these double locks and bolts all on the outside none on the in  and down she dropped into her chair and they could not get another word from her she threw her handkerchief over her face as once before which was soon wet with tears and grievously they own she sobbed  gentle treatment lovelace  perhaps thou as well as these wretches wilt think it so  sally then ordered a dinner and said they would soon be back again and see that she eat and drank as a good christian should comporting herself to her condition and making the best of it  what has not this charming creature suffered what has she not gone through in these last three months that i know of  who would think such a delicatelyframed person could have sustained what she has sustained we sometimes talk of bravery of courage of fortitude  here they are in perfection  such bravoes as thou and i should never have been able to support ourselves under half the persecutions the disappointments and contumelies that she has met with but like cowards should have slid out of the world basely by some backdoor that is to say by a sword by a pistol by a halter or knife  but here is a fineprincipled lady who by dint of this noble consideration as i imagine what else can support her  that she has not deserved the evils she contends with and that this world is designed but as a transitory state of probation and that she is traveling to another and better puts up with all the hardships of the journey and is not to be diverted from her course by the attacks of thieves and robbers or any other terrors and difficulties being assured of an ample reward at the end of it  if thou think this reflection uncharacteristic from a companion and friend of thine imaginest thou that i prosited nothing by my attendance on my uncle for so long a time in his dying state and from the pious reflections of the good clergyman who day by day at the poor mans own request visited and prayed by him  and could i have another such instance as this to bring all these reflections home to me  then who can write of good persons and of good subjects and be capable of admiring them and not be made serious for the time if he write in character  and hence may we gather what a benefit to the morals of men the keeping of good company must be while those who keep only bad must necessarily more and more harden and be hardened  it is twelve of the clock sunday night  i can think of nothing but of this excellent creature her distresses fill my head and my heart i was drowsy for a quarter of an hour but the fit is gone off and i will continue the melancholy subject from the information of these wretches enough i dare say will arise in the visit i shall make if admitted tomorrow to send by thy servant as to the way i am likely to find her in  after the women had left her she complained of her head and her heart and seemed terrified witth apprehensions of being carried once more to sinclairs  refusing anything for breakfast mrs rowland came up to her and told her as these wretches owned they had ordered her for fear she should starve herself that she must and should have tea and bread and butter and that as she had friends who could support her if she wrote to them it was a wrong thing both for herself and them to starve herself thus  if it be for your own sakes said she that is another thing let coffee or tea or chocolate or what you will be got and put down a chicken to my account every day if you please and eat it yourselves i will taste it if i can i would do nothing to hinder you i have friends will pay you liberally when they know i am gone  they wondered at her strange composure in such distresses  they were nothing she said to what she had suffered already from the vilest of all men the disgrace of seizing her in the street multitudes of people about her shocking imputations wounding her ears had indeed been very affecting to her but that was over  every thing soon would  and she should be still more composed were it not for the apprehensions of seeing one man and one woman and being tricked or forced back to the vilest house in the world  then were it not better to give way to the two gentlewomens offer to bail her  they could tell her it was a very kind proffer and what was not be met with every day  she believed so  the ladies might possibly dispense with her going back to the house she had such an antipathy to then the compassionate gentleman who was inclined to make it up with her creditors on her own bond it was strange to them she hearkened not to so generous a proposal  did the two ladies tell you who the gentleman was  or did they say any more on that subject  yes they did and hinted to me said the woman that you had nothing to do but to receive a visit from the gentleman and the money they believed would be laid down on your own bond or note  she was startled  i charge you said she as you will answer it one day to my friends that you bring no gentleman into my company i charge you dont if you do you know not what may be the consequence  they apprehended no bad consequence they said in doing their duty and if she knew not her own good her friends would thank them for taking any innocent steps to serve her though against her will  dont push me upon extremities man  dont make me desperate woman  i have no small difficulty notwithstanding the seeming composure you just now took notice of to bear as i ought to bear the evils i suffer but if you bring a man or men to me be the pretense what it will   she stopped there and looked so earnestly and so wildly they said that they did not know but she would do some harm to herself if they disobeyed her and that would be a sad thing in their house and might be their ruin so they promised that no man should be brought to her but by her own consent  mrs rowland prevailed on her to drink a dish of tea and taste some bread and butter about eleven on saturday morning which she probably did to have an excuse not to dine with the women when they returned  but she would not quit her prisonroom as she called it to go into their parlour  unbarred windows and a lightsomer apartment she said had too cheerful an appearance for her mind  at another time the light of the sun was irksome to her the sun seemed to shine in to mock her woes  and when soon after a shower fell she looked at it through the bars how kindly said she do the elements weep to keep me company  methought added she the sun darting in a while ago and gilding those iron bars played upon me like the two women who came to insult my haggard looks by the word beauty and my dejected heart with the word haughtyairs  sally came again at dinnertime to see how she fared as she told her and that she did not starve herself and as she wanted to have some talk with her if she gave her leave she would dine with her  i cannot eat  you must try miss harlowe  and dinner being ready just then she offered her hand and desired her to walk down  no she would not stir out of her prisonroom  these sullen airs will not do miss harlowe indeed they will not  she was silent  you will have harder usage than any you have ever yet known i can tell you if you come not into some humor to make matters up  she was still silent  come miss walk down to dinner let me entreat you do miss horton is below she was once your favorite  she waited for an answer but received none  we came to make some proposals to you for your good though you affronted us so lately and we would not let mrs sinclair come in person because we thought to oblige you  that is indeed obliging  come give me your hand miss harlowe you are obliged to me i can tell you that and let us go down to miss horton  excuse me i will not stir out of this room  would you have me and miss horton dine in this filthy bedroom  it is not a bedroom to me i have not been in bed nor will while i am here  and yet you care not as i see to leave the house  and so you will not go down miss harlowe  i will not except i am forced to it  well well let it alone i shant ask miss horton to dine in this room i assure you i will send up a plate  and away the little saucy toad fluttered down  and when they had dined up they came together  well miss you would not eat any thing it seems  very pretty sullen airs these  no wonder the honest gentleman had such a hand with you  she only held up her hands and eyes the tears trickling down her cheeks  insolent devils  how much more cruel and insulting are bad women even than bad men  methinks miss said sally you are a little soily to what we have seen you pity such a nice lady should not have changes of apparel why will not you send to your lodgings for linen at least  i am not nice now  miss looks well and clean in any thing said polly but dear madam why will not you send to your lodgings it is but kind to the people they must have a concern about you and your miss how will wonder what is become of you for no doubt you correspond  she turned from them and to herself said too much too much  she tossed her handkerchief wet before with her tears from her and held her apron to her eyes  dont weep miss said the vile polly  yet do cried the viler sally if it be a relief nothing as mr lovelace once told me dries sooner than tears for once i too wept mightily  i could not bear the recital of this with patience yet i cursed them not so much as i should have done had i not had a mind to get from them all the particulars of their gentle treatment and this for two reasons the one that i might stab thee to the heart with the repetition the other that i might know upon what terms i am likely to see the unhappy lady tomorrow  well but miss harlowe cried sally do you think these forlorn airs pretty you are a good christian child mrs rowland tells me she has got you a biblebook  o there it lies  i make no doubt but you have doubled down the useful places as honest matt prior says  then rising and taking it up  ay so you have  the book of job one opens naturally here i see  my mamma made me a fine biblescholar  ecclesiasticus too  that is apocrypha as they call it  you see miss horton i know something of the book  they proposed once more to bail her and to go home with them a motion which she received with the same indignation as before  sally told her that she had written in a very favorable manner in her behalf to you and that she every hour expected an answer and made no doubt that you would come up with the messenger and generously pay the whole debt and ask her pardon for neglecting it  this disturbed her so much that they feared she would have fallen into fits she could not bear your name she said she hoped she should never see you more and were you to intrude yourself dreadful consequences might follow  surely they said she would be glad to be released from her confinement  indeed she should now they had begun to alarm her with his name who was the author of all her woes and who she now saw plainly gave way to this new outrage in order to bring her to his own infamous terms  why then they asked would she not write to her friends to pay mrs sinclairs demand  because she hoped she should not long trouble anybody and because she knew that the payment of the money if she were able to pay it was not what was aimed at  sally owned that she told her that truly she had thought herself as well descended and as well educated as herself though not entitled to such considerable fortunes and had the impudence to insist upon it to me to be truth  she had the insolence to add to the lady that she had as much reason as she to expect mr lovelace would marry her he having contracted to do so before he knew miss clarissa harlowe and that she had it under his hand and seal too  or else he had not obtained his end therefore it was not likely she should be so officious as to do his work against herself if she thought mr lovelace had designs upon her like what she presumed to hint at that for her part her only view was to procure liberty to a young gentlewoman who made those things grievous to her which would not be made such a rout about by anybody else  and to procure the payment of a just debt to her friend mrs sinclair  she besought them to leave her she wanted not these instances she said to convince her of the company she was in and told them that to get rid of such visitors and of still worse that she apprehended she would write to one friend to raise the money for her though it would be death for her to do so because that friend could not do it without her mother in whose eye it would give a selfish appearance to a friendship that was above all sordid alloys  they advised her to write out of hand  but how much must i write for what is the sum should i not have had a bill delivered me  god knows i took not your lodgings but he that could treat me as he has done could do this  dont speak against mr lovelace miss harlowe he is a man i greatly esteem cursed toad and bating that he will take his advantage where he can of us silly credulous girls he is a man of honor  she lifted up her hands and eyes instead of speaking and well she might for any words she could have used could not have expressed the anguish she must feel on being comprehended in the us  she must write for one hundred and fifty guineas at least two hundred if she were short of money might as well be written for  mrs sinclair she said had all her clothes let them be sold fairly sold and the money go as far as it would go she had also a few other valuables but no money none at all but the poor halfguinea and the little silver they had seen she would give bond to pay all that her apparel and the other matters she had would fall short of she had great effects belonging to her of right her bond would and must be paid were it for a thousand pounds but her clothes she should never want she believed if not too much undervalued those and her few valuables would answer everything she wished for no surplus but to discharge the last expenses and forty shillings would do as well for those as forty pounds let my ruin said she lifting up her eyes be large be complete in this life  for a composition let it be complete  and there she stopped no doubt alluding to her fathers futurelyextended curse  the wretches could not help wishing to me for the opportunity of making such a purchase for their own wear how i cursed them and in my heart thee  but too probable thought i that this vile sally martin may hope tho thou art incapable of it that her lovelace as she has the assurance behind thy back to call thee may present her with some of the poor ladys spoils  will not mrs sinclair proceeded she think my clothes a security till they can be sold they are very good clothes a suit or two but just put on as it were never worn they cost much more than is demanded of me my father loved to see me fine  all shall go but let me have the particulars of her demand i suppose i must pay for my destroyer that was her welladapted word and his servants as well as for myself  i am content to do so  indeed i am content to do so  i am above wishing that anybody who could thus act should be so much as expostulated with as to the justice and equity of it if i have but enough to pay the demand i shall be satisfied and will leave the baseness of such an action as this as an aggravation of a guilt which i thought could not be aggravated  i own lovelace i have malice in this particularity in order to sting thee to the heart and let me ask thee what now thou can think of thy barbarity thy unprecedented barbarity in having reduced a person of her rank fortune talents and virtue so low  the wretched women it must be owned act but in their profession a profession thou have been the principal means of reducing these two to act in and they know what thy designs have been and how far prosecuted it is in their opinions using her gently that they have forborne to bring to her the woman so justly odious to her and that they have not threatened her with the introducing to her strange men nor yet brought into her company their spiritbreakers and humblingdrones fellows not allowed to carry stings to trace and force her back to their detested house and when there into all their measures  till i came they thought thou would not be displeased at anything she suffered that could help to mortify her into a state of shame and disgrace and bring her to comply with thy views when thou should come to release her from these wretches as from a greater evil than cohabiting with thee  when thou considerest these things thou will make no difficulty of believing that this their own account of their behavior to this admirable lady has been far short of their insults and the less when i tell thee that all together their usage had such effects upon her that they left her in violent hysterics ordering an apothecary to be sent for if she should continue in them and be worse and particularly as they had done from the first that they kept out of her way any edged or pointed instrument especially a penknife which pretending to mend a pen they said she might ask for  at twelve saturday night rowland sent to tell them that she was so ill that he knew not what might be the issue and wished her out of his house  and this made them as heartily wish to hear from you for their messenger to their great surprise was not then returned from m hall and they were sure he must have reached that place by friday night  early on sunday morning both devils went to see how she did they had such an account of her weakness lowness and anguish that they forbore out of compassion they said finding their visits so disagreeable to her to see her but their apprehension of what might be the issue was no doubt their principal consideration nothing else could have softened such flinty bosoms  they sent for the apothecary rowland had had to her and gave him and roland and his wife and maid paradeful injunctions for the utmost care to be taken of her no doubt with an oldbailey forecast and they sent up to let her know what orders they had given but that understanding she had taken something to compose herself they would not disturb her  she had scrupled it seems to admit the apothecarys visit overnight because he was a man  and could not be prevailed upon till they pleaded their own safety to her  they went again from church  lord bob these creatures go to church  but she sent them down word that she must have all the remainder of the day to herself  when i first came and told them of thy execrations for what they had done and joined my own to them they were astonished the mother said she had thought she had known mr lovelace better and expected thanks and not curses  while i was with them came back halting and cursing most horribly their messenger by reason of the illusage he had received from you instead of the reward he had been taught to expect for the supposed good news that he carried down of the ladys being found out and secured  a pretty fellow art thou not to abuse people for the consequences of thy own faults  under what shocking disadvantages and with this addition to them that i am thy friend and intimate am i to make a visit to this unhappy lady tomorrow morning in thy name too  enough to be refused that i am of a sex to which for thy sake she has so justifiable an aversion nor having such a tyrant of a father and such an implacable brother has she reason to make an exception in favor of any of it on their accounts  it is three oclock i will close here and take a little rest what i have written will be a proper preparative for what shall offer byandby  thy servant is not to return without a letter he tells me and that thou expectest him back in the morning thou have fellows enough where thou art at thy command if i find any difficulty in seeing the lady thy messenger shall post away with this  let him look to broken bones and other consequences if what he carries answer not thy expectation but if i am admitted thou shall have this and the result of my audience both together in the former case thou may send another servant to wait the next advices from  j belford  letter xli mr belford to robert lovelace esquire monday july    about six this morning i went to rowlands mrs sinclair was to follow me in order to dismiss the action but not to come in sight  rowland upon inquiry told me that the lady was extremely ill and that she had desired not to let anybody but his wife or maid come near her  i said i must see her i had told him my business overnight and i must see her  his wife went up but returned presently saying she could not get her to speak to her yet that her eyelids moved though she either would not or could not open them to look up at her  oons woman said i the lady may be in a fit the lady may be dying  let me go up show me the way  a horrid hole of a house in a alley they call a court stairs wretchedly narrow even to the firstfloor rooms and into a den they led me with broken walls which had been papered as i saw by a multitude of tacks and some torn bits held on by the rusty heads  the floor indeed was clean but the ceiling was smoked with variety of figures and initials of names that had been the woeful employment of wretches who had no other way to amuse themselves  a bed at one corner with coarse curtains tacked up at the feet to the ceiling because the curtain rings were broken off but a coverlid upon it with a cleanish look though plaguily in tatters and the corners tied up in tassels that the rents in it might go no farther  the windows dark and doublebarred the tops boarded up to save mending and only a little fourpaned eylethole of a casement to let in air more however coming in at broken panes than could come in at that  four old turkeyworked chairs burstenbottomed the stuffing staring out  an old tottering wormeaten table that had more nails bestowed in mending it to make it stand than the table cost fifty years ago when new  on the mantlepiece was an iron shoveup candlestick with a lighted candle in it twinkle twinkle twinkle four of them i suppose for a penny  near that on the same shelf was an old lookingglass cracked through the middle breaking out into a thousand points the crack given it perhaps in a rage by some poor creature to whom it gave the representation of his hearts woes in his face  the chimney had two halftiles in it on one side and one whole one on the other which showed it had been in better plight but now the very mortar had followed the rest of the tiles in every other place and left the bricks bare  an old halfbarred stovegrate was in the chimney and in that a large stonebottle without a neck filled with baleful eugh as an evergreen withered southernwood and sweetbriar and sprigs of rue in flower  to finish the shocking description in a dark nook stood an old brokenbottomed cane couch without a squab or coverlid sunk at one corner and unmortised by the failing of one of its wormeaten legs which lay in two pieces under the wretched piece of furniture it could no longer support  and this thou horrid lovelace was the bedchamber of the divine clarissa  i had leisure to cast my eye on these things for going up softly the poor lady turned not about at our entrance nor till i spoke moved her head  she was kneeling in a corner of the room near the dismal window against the table on an old bolster as it seemed to be of the cane couch halfcovered with her handkerchief her back to the door which was only shut to no need of fastenings her arms crossed upon the table the forefinger of her right hand in her bible she had perhaps been reading in it and could read no longer paper pens ink lay by her book on the table her dress was white damask exceeding neat but her stays seemed not tightlaced i was told afterward that her laces had been cut when she fainted away at her entrance into this cursed place and she had not been solicitous enough about her dress to send for others her headdress was a little discomposed her charming hair in natural ringlets as you have heretofore described it but a little tangled as if not lately kembed irregularly shading one side of the loveliest neck in the world as her disordered rumpled handkerchief did the other her face o how altered from what i had seen it yet lovely in spite of all her griefs and sufferings was reclined when we entered upon her crossed arms but so as not more than one side of it to be hid  when i surveyed the room around and the kneeling lady sunk with majesty too in herwhite flowing robes for she had not on a hoop spreading the dark though not dirty floor and illuminating that horrid corner her linen beyond imagination white considering that she had not been undressed ever since she had been here i thought my concern would have choked me something rose in my throat i know not what which made me for a moment guggle as it were for speech which at last forcing its way con  con  confound you both said i to the man and woman is this an apartment for such a lady and could the cursed devils of her own sex who visited this suffering angel see her and leave her in so damned a nook  sir we would have had the lady to accept of our own bedchamber but she refused it we are poor people  and we expect nobody will stay with us longer than they can help it  you are people chosen purposely i doubt not by the damned woman who has employed you and if your usage of this lady has been but half as bad as your house you had better never to have seen the light  up then raised the charming sufferer her lovely face but with such a significance of woe overspreading it that i could not for the soul of me help being visibly affected  she waved her hand two or three times toward the door as if commanding me to withdraw and displeased at my intrusion but did not peak  permit me madam  i will not approach one step farther without your leave  permit me for one moment the favor of your ear  no  no  go go man with an emphasis  and would have said more but as if struggling in vain for words she seemed to give up speech for lost and dropped her head down once more with a deep sigh upon her left arm her right as if she had not the use of it numbed i suppose selfmoved dropping down on her side  o that thou had been there and in my place  but by what i then felt in myself i am convinced that a capacity of being moved by the distresses of our fellow creatures is far from being disgraceful to a manly heart with what pleasure at that moment could i have given up my own life could i but first have avenged this charming creature and cut the throat of her destroyer as she emphatically calls thee though the friend that i best love and yet at the same time my heart and my eyes gave way to a softness of which though not so hardened a wretch as thou it was never before so susceptible  i dare not approach you dearest lady without your leave but on my knees i beseech you to permit me to release you from this damned house and out of the power of the accursed woman who was the occasion of your being here  she lifted up her sweet face once more and beheld me on my knees never knew i before what it was to pray so heartily  are you not  are you not mr belford sir i think your name is belford  it is madam and i ever was a worshiper of your virtues and an advocate for you and i come to release you from the hands you are in  and in whose to place me o leave me leave me let me never rise from this spot let me never never more believe in man  this moment dearest lady this very moment if you please you may depart whithersoever you think fit you are absolutely free and your own mistress  i had now as lieve die here in this place as anywhere i will owe no obligation to any friend of him in whose company you have seen me so pray sir withdraw  then turning to the officer mr rowland i think your name is i am better reconciled to your house than i was at first if you can but engage that i shall have nobody come near me but your wife no man and neither of those women who have sported with my calamities i will die with you and in this very corner and you shall be well satisfied for the trouble you have had with me  i have value enough for that  for see i have a diamond ring taking it out of her bosom and i have friends will redeem it at a high price when i am gone  but for you sir looking at me i beg you to withdraw if you mean me well god i hope will reward you for your good meaning but to the friend of my destroyer will i not owe an obligation  you will owe no obligation to me nor to anybody you have been detained for a debt you do not owe the action is dismissed and you will only be so good as to give me your hand into the coach which stands as near to this house as it could draw up and i will either leave you at the coachdoor or attend you whithersoever you please till i see you safe where you would wish to be  will you then sir compel me to be beholden to you  you will inexpressibly oblige me madam to command me to do you either service or pleasure  why then sir  looking at me  but why do you mock me in that humble posture rise sir i cannot speak to you else  i arose  only sir take this ring i have a sister who will be glad to have it at the price it shall be valued at for the former owners sake  out of

sir i am very ill i would fain get a little rest if i could i find i am going to be bad again  and offering to rise she sunk down through excess of weakness and grief in a fainting fit  why lovelace wast thou not present thyself  why do thou commit such villainies as even thou thyself art afraid to appear in and yet put a weaker heart and head upon encountering with  the maid coming in just then the woman and she lifted her up on the decrepit couch and i withdrew with this rowland who wept like a child and said he never in his life was so moved  yet so hardened a wretch art thou that i question whether thou will shed a tear at my relation  they recovered her by hartshorn and water i went down mean while for the detestable woman had been below some time o how did i curse her i never before was so fluent in curses  she tried to wheedle me but i renounced her and after she had dismissed the action sent her away crying or pretending to cry because of my behavior to her  you will observe that i did not mention one word to the lady about you i was afraid to do it for twas plain that she could not bear your name your friend and the company you have seen me in were the words nearest to naming you she could speak and yet i wanted to clear your intention of this brutal this sordidlooking villainy  i sent up again by rowlands wife when i heard that the lady was recovered beseeching her to quit that devilish place and the woman assured her that she was at full liberty to do so for that the action was dismissed  but she cared not to answer her and was so weak and low that it was almost as much out of her power as inclination the woman told me to speak  i would have hastened away for my friend doctor h but the house is such a den and the room she was in such a hole that i was ashamed to be seen in it by a man of his reputation especially with a woman of such an appearance and in such uncommon distress and i found there was no prevailing on her to quit it for the peoples bedroom which was neat and lightsome  the strong room she was in the wretches told me should have been in better order but that it was but the very morning that she was brought in that an unhappy man had quitted it for a more eligible prison no doubt since there could hardly be a worse  being told that she desired not to be disturbed and seemed inclined to dose i took this opportunity to go to her lodgings in covent garden to which dorcas who first discovered her there as will was the setter from church had before given me a direction  the mans name is smith a dealer in gloves snuff and such petty merchandise his wife the shopkeeper he a maker of the gloves they sell honest people it seems  i thought to have got the woman with me to the lady but she was not within  i talked with the man and told him what had befallen the lady owing as i said to a mistake of orders and gave her the character she deserved and desired him to send his wife the moment she came in to the lady directing him whither not doubting that her attendance would be very welcome to her which he promised  he told me that a letter was left for her there on saturday and about half an hour before i came another superscribed by the same hand the first by the post the other by a countryman who having been informed of her absence and of all the circumstances they could tell him of it posted away full of concern saying that the lady he was sent from would be ready to break her heart at the tidings  i thought it right to take the two letters back with me and dismissing my coach took a chair as a more proper vehicle for the lady if i the friend of her destroyer could prevail upon her to leave rowlands  and here being obliged to give way to an indispensable avocation i will make thee taste a little in thy turn of the plague of suspense and break off without giving thee the least hint of the issue of my further proceedings i know that those least bear disappointment who love most to give it in

mondaynight july    on my return to rowlands i found that the apothecary was just gone up mrs rowland being above with him i made the less scruple to go up too as it was probable that to ask for leave would be to ask to be denied hoping also that the letters i had with me would be a good excuse  she was sitting on the side of the broken couch extremely weak and low and i observed cared not to speak to the man and no wonder for i never saw a more shocking fellow of a profession tolerably genteel nor heard a more illiterate one prate  physician in ordinary to this house and others like it i suppose he put me in mind of otways apothecary in his caius marius meagre and very rueful were his looks sharp misery had worn him to the bones  famine in his cheeks need and oppression staring in his eyes contempt and beggary hanging on his back the world no friend of his nor the worlds law   as i am in black he took me at my entrance i believe to be a doctor and slunk behind me with his hat upon his two thumbs and looked as if he expected the oracle to open and give him orders  the lady looked displeased as well at me as at rowland who followed me and at the apothecary it was not she said the least of her present misfortunes that she could not be left to her own sex and to her option to see whom she pleased  i besought her excuse and winking for the apothecary to withdraw which he did told her that i had been at her new lodgings to order everything to be got ready for her reception presuming she would choose to go thither that i had a chair at the door that mr smith and his wife i named their names that she should not have room for the least fear of sinclairs had been full of apprehensions for her safety that i had brought two letters which were left there for her one by the post the other that very morning  this took her attention she held out her charming hand for them took them and pressing them to her lips  from the only friend i have in the world said she kissing them again and looking at the seals as if to see whether they had been opened i cannot read them said she my eyes are too dim and put them in her bosom  i besought her to think of quitting that wretched hole  where could she go she asked to be safe and uninterrupted for the short remainder of her life and to avoid being again visited by the creatures who had insulted her before  i gave her the solemnest assurances that she should not be invaded in her new lodgings by anybody and said that i would particularly engage my honor that the person who had most offended her should not come near her without her own consent  your honor sir are you not that mans friend  i am not a friend madam to his vile actions to the most excellent of women  do you flatter me sir then are you a man  but oh sir your friend holding her face forward with great earnestness your barbarous friend what has he not to answer for  there she stopped her heart full and putting her hand over her eyes and forehead the tears trickled through her fingers resenting thy barbarity it seemed as caesar did the stab from his distinguished brutus  though she was so very much disordered i thought i would not lose this opportunity to assert your innocence of this villainous arrest  there is no defending the unhappy man in any of his vile actions by you madam but of this last outrage by all that is good and sacred he is innocent  o wretches what a sex is yours  have you all one dialect good and sacred  if sir you can find an oath or a vow or an adjuration that my ears have not been twenty times a day wounded with then speak it and i may again believe a man  i was excessively touched at these words knowing thy baseness and the reason she had for them  but say you sir for i would not methinks have the wretch capable of this sordid baseness  say you that he is innocent of this last wickedness can you truly say that he is  by the great god of heaven   nay sir if you swear i must doubt you  if you yourself think your word insufficient what reliance can i have on your oath  o that this my experience had not cost me so dear but were i to live a thousand years i would always suspect the veracity of a swearer excuse me sir but is it likely that he who makes so free with his god will scruple anything that may serve his turn with his fellow creature  this was a most affecting reprimand  madam said i i have a regard a regard a gentleman ought to have to my word and whenever i forfeit it to you   nay sir dont be angry with me it is grievous to me to question a gentlemans veracity but your friend calls himself a gentleman  you know not what i have suffered by a gentleman  and then again she wept  i would give you madam demonstration if your griefs and your weakness would permit it that he has no hand in this barbarous baseness and that he resents it as it ought to be resented  well well sir with quickness he will have his account to make up somewhere else not to me i should not be sorry to find him able to acquit his intention on this occasion let him know sir only one thing that when you heard me in the bitterness of my spirit most vehemently exclaim against the undeserved usage i have met with from him that even then in that passionate moment i was able to say and never did i see such an earnest and affecting exaltation of hands and eyes give him good god repentance and amendment that i may be the last poor creature who shall be ruined by him  and in thy own good time receive to thy mercy the poor wretch who had none on me  by my soul i could not speak  she had not her bible before her for nothing  i was forced to turn my head away and to take out my handkerchief  what an angel is this  even the jailer and his wife and maid wept  again i wish thou had been there that thou might have sunk down at her feet and begun that moment to reap the effect of her generous wishes for thee undeserving as thou art of anything but perdition  i represented to her that she would be less free where she was from visits she liked not than at her own lodging i told her that it would probably bring her in particular one visitor who otherwise i would engage but i durst not swear again after the severe reprimand she had just given me should not come near her without her consent and i expressed my surprise that she should be unwilling to quit such a place as this when it was more than probable that some of her friends when it was known how bad she was would visit her  she said the place when she was first brought into it was indeed very shocking to her but that she had found herself so weak and ill and her griefs had so sunk her that she did not expect to have lived till now that therefore all places had been alike to her for to die in a prison was to die and equally eligible as to die in a palace palaces she said could have no attractions for a dying person but that since she feared she was not so soon to be released as she had hoped since she was so little mistress of herself here and since she might by removal be in the way of her dear friends letters she would hope that she might depend upon the assurances i gave her of being at liberty to return to her last lodgings otherwise she would provide herself with new ones out of my knowledge as well as out of yours and that i was too much of a gentleman to be concerned in carrying her back to the house she had so much reason to abhor and to which she had been once before most vilely betrayed to her ruin  i assured her in the strongest terms but swore not that you were resolved not to molest her and as a proof of the sincerity of my professions besought her to give me directions in pursuance of my friends express desire about sending all her apparel and whatever belonged to her to her new lodgings  she seemed pleased and gave me instantly out of her pocket her keys asking me if mrs smith whom i had named might not attend me and she would give her further directions to which i cheerfully assented and then she told me that she would accept of the chair i had offered her  i withdrew and took the opportunity to be civil to rowland and his maid for she found no fault with their behavior for what they were and the fellow seems to be miserably poor i sent also for the apothecary who is as poor as the jailer and still poorer i dare say as to the skill required in his business and satisfied him beyond his hopes  the lady after i had withdrawn attempted to read the letters i brought her but she could read but a little way in one of them and had great emotions upon it  she told the woman she would take a speedy opportunity to acknowledge their civilitis and to satisfy the apothecary who might send her his bill to her lodgings  she gave the maid something probably the only halfguinea she had and then with difficulty her limbs trembling under her and supported by mrs rowland got down stairs  i offered my arm she was pleased to lean upon it i doubt sir sad she as she moved i have behaved rudely to you but if you knew all you would forgive me  i know enough madam to convince me that there is not such purity and honor in any woman upon earth nor any one that has been so barbarously treated  she looked at me very earnestly what she thought i cannot say but in general i never saw so much soul in a ladys eyes as in hers  i ordered my servant whose mourning made him less observable as such and who had not been in the ladys eye to keep the chair in view and to bring me word how she did when set down the fellow had the thought to step into the shop just before the chair entered it under pretense of buying snuff and so enabled himself to give me an account that she was received with great joy by the good woman of the house who told her she was but just come in and was preparing to attend her in highholborn  o mrs smith said she as soon at she saw her did you not think i was run away  you dont know what i have suffered since i saw you i have been in a prison  arrested for debts i owe not  but thank god i am here  will you permit your maid  i have forgot her name already   katharine madam   will you let katharine assist me to bed  i have not had my clothes off since thursday night  what she further said the fellow heard not she leaning upon the maid and going upstairs  but do thou not observe what a strange what an uncommon openness of heart reigns in this lady she had been in a prison she said before a stranger in the shop and before the maidservant and so probably she would have said had there been twenty people in the shop  the disgrace she cannot hide from herself as she says in her letter to lady betty she is not solicitous to conceal from the world  but this makes it evident to me that she is resolved to keep no terms with thee and yet to be able to put up such a prayer for thee as she did in her prison i will often mention the prisonroom to teaze thee does not this show that revenge has very little sway in her mind though she can retain so much proper resentment  and this is another excellence in this admirable womans character for whom before her have we met with in the whole sex or in ours either that know how in practice to distinguish between revenge and resentment for base and ungrateful treatment  it is a cursed thing after all that such a woman as this should be treated as she has been treated had thou been a king and done as thou have done by such a meritorious innocent i believe in my heart it would have been adjudged to be a national sin and the sword the pestilence or famine must have atoned for it  but as thou art a private man thou will certainly meet with thy punishment besides what thou may expect from the justice of thy country and the vengeance of her friends as she will her reward hereafter  it must be so if there be really such a thing as future remuneration as now i am more and more convinced there must  else what a hard fate is hers whose punishment to all appearance has so much exceeded her fault and as to thine how can temporary burnings were thou by some accident to be consumed in thy bed expiate for thy abominable vileness to her in breach of all obligations moral and divine  i was resolved to lose no time in having everything which belonged to the lady at the cursed womans sent her accordingly i took coach to smiths and procured the lady to whom i sent up my compliments and inquiries how she bore her removal ill as she sent me down word she was to give proper directions to mrs smith whom i took with me to sinclairs and who saw everything looked out and put into the trunks and boxes they were first brought in and carried away in two coaches  had i not been there sally and polly would each of them have taken to herself something of the poor ladys spoils this they declared and i had something to do to get from sally a fine brusselslace head which she had the confidence to say she would wear for miss harlowes sake nor should either i or mrs smith have known she had got it had she not been in search after the ruffles belonging to it  my resentment on this occasion and the conversation which mrs smith and i had in which i not only expatiated upon the merits of the lady but expressed my concern for her sufferings though i left her room to suppose her married yet without averring it gave me high credit with the good woman so that we are perfectly wellacquainted already by which means i shall be enabled to give you accounts from time to time of all that passes and which i will be very industrious to do provided i may depend upon the solemn promises i have given the lady in your name as well as my own that she shall be free from all personal molestation from you and thus shall i have it in my power to return in kind your writing favors and preserve my shorthand besides which till this correspondence was opened i had pretty much neglected  i ordered the abandoned women to make out your account they answered that they would do with a vengeance indeed they breathe nothing but revenge for now they say you will assuredly marry and your example will be followed by all your friends and companions  as the old one says to the utter ruin of her poor house  letter xliv mr belford to robert lovelace esquire tuesday morn july      oclock having sat up late to finish and seal up in readiness my letter to the above period i am disturbed before i wished to have risen by the arrival of thy second fellow man and horse in a foam  while he baits i will write a few lines most heartily to congratulate thee on thy expected rage and impatience and on thy recovery of mental feeling  how much does the idea thou give me of thy deserved torments by thy upright awls bodkins pins and packingneedles by thy rolling hogshead with iron spikes and by thy macerated sides delight me  i will upon every occasion that offers drive more spikes into thy hogshead and roll thee downhill and up as thou recoverest to sense or rather returnest back to senselesness thou know therefore the terms on which thou art to enjoy my correspondence am not i who have all along and in time protested against thy barbarous and ungrateful perfidies to a lady so noble entitled to drive remorse if possible into thy hithertocallous heart  only let me reinforce one thing which perhaps i mentioned too slightly before that the lady was prevailed upon by my solemn assurances only that she might depend upon being free from your visits not to remove to new lodgings where neither you nor i should be able to find her  these assurances i thought i might give her not only because of your promise but because it is necessary for you to know where she is in order to address yourself to her by your friends  enable me therefore to make good to her this my solemn engagement or adieu to all friendship at least to all correspondence with thee for ever  j belford  letter xlv mr belford to robert lovelace esquire tuesday july    afternoon i renewed my inquiries after the ladys health in the morning by my servant and as soon as i had dined i went myself  i had but a poor account of it yet sent up my compliments she returned me thanks for all my good offices and her excuses that they could not be personal just then being very low and faint but if i gave myself the trouble of coming about six this evening she should be able she hoped to drink a dish of tea with me and would then thank me herself  i am very proud of this condescension and think it looks not amiss for you as i am your avowed friend methinks i want fully to remove from her mind all doubts of you in this last villainous action and who knows then what your noble relations may be able to do for you with her if you hold your mind for your servant acquainted me with their having actually engaged miss how in their and your favor before this cursed affair happened and i desire the particulars of all from yourself that i may the better know how to serve you  she has two handsome apartments a bedchamber and dining room with light closets in each she has already a nurse the people of the house having but one maid a woman whose care diligence and honesty mrs smith highly commends she has likewise the benefit of the voluntary attendance and love as it seems of a widow gentlewoman mrs lovick her name who lodges over her apartment and of whom she seems very fond having found something in her she thinks resembling the qualities of her worthy mrs norton  about seven of clock this morning it seems the lady was so ill that she yielded to their desires to have an apothecary sent for  not the fellow thou may believe she had had before at rowlands but one mr goddard a man of skill and eminence and of conscience too demonstrated as well by general character as by his prescriptions to this lady for pronouncing her case to be grief he ordered for the present only innocent julaps by way of cordial and as soon as her stomach should be able to bear it light kitchendiet telling mrs lovick that that with air moderate exercise and cheerful company would do her more good than all the medicines in his shop  this has given me as it seems it has the lady who also praises his modest behavior paternal looks and genteel address a very good opinion of the man and i design to make myself acquainted with him and if he advises to call in a doctor to wish him for the fair patients sake more than the physicians who wants not practice my worthy friend dr h  whose character is above all exception as his humanity i am sure will distinguish him to the lady  mrs lovick gratified me with an account of a letter she had written from the ladys mouth to miss how she being unable to write herself with steadiness it was to this effect in answer it seems to her two letters whatever were the contents of them  that she had been involved in a dreadful calamity which she was sure when known would exempt her from the effects of her friendly displeasure for not answering her first having been put under an arrest  could she have believed it  that she was released but the day before and was now so weak and so low that she was obliged to get a widow gentlewoman in the same house to account thus for her silence to her two letters of the   th and   th that she would as soon as able answer them begged of her mean time not to be uneasy for her since only that this was a calamity which came upon her when she was far from being well a load laid upon the shoulders of a poor wretch ready before to sink under too heavy a burden it was nothing to the evil she had before suffered and one felicity seemed likely to issue from it which was that she should be at rest in an honest house with considerate and kindhearted people having assurance given her that she should not be molested by the wretch whom it would be death for her to see so that now she miss how needed not to send to her by private and expensive conveyances nor need collins to take precautions for fear of being dogged to her lodgings nor she to write by a fictitious name to her but by her own  you see i am in a way to oblige you you see how much she depends upon my engaging for your forbearing to intrude yourself into her company let not your flaming impatience destroy all and make me look like a villain to a lady who has reason to suspect every man she sees to be so  upon this condition you may expect all the services that can flow from true friendship and from  your sincere wellwisher john belford  letter xlvi mr belford to robert lovelace esquire tuesday night july    i am just come from the lady i was admitted into the dining room where she was sitting in an elbowchair in a very weak and low way she made an effort to stand up when i entered but was forced to keep her seat you will excuse me mr belford i ought to rise to thank you for all your kindness to me i was to blame to be so loath to leave that sad place for i am in heaven here to what i was there and good people about me too  i have not had good people about me for a long long time before so that with a halfsmile i had begun to wonder whither they were all gone  her nurse and mrs smith who were present took occasion to retire and when we were alone you seem to be a person of humanity sir said she you hinted as i was leaving my prison that you were not a stranger to my sad story if you know it truly you must know that i have been most barbarously treated and have not deserved it at the mans hands by whom i have suffered  i told her i knew enough to be convinced that she had the merit of a saint and the purity of an angel and was proceeding when she said no flighty compliments no undue attributes sir i offered to plead for my sincerity and mentioned the word politeness and would have distinguished between that and flattery nothing can be polite said she that is not just whatever i may have had i have now no vanity to gratify  i disclaimed all intention of compliment all i had said and what i should say was and should be the effect of sincere veneration my unhappy friends account of her had entitled her to that  i then mentioned your grief your penitence your resolutions of making her all the amends that were possible now to be made her and in the most earnest manner i asserted your innocence as to the last villainous outrage  her answer was to this effect it is painful to me to think of him the amends you talk of cannot be made this last violence you speak of is nothing to what preceded it that cannot be atoned for nor palliated this may and i shall not be sorry to be convinced that he cannot be guilty of so very low a wickedness  yet after his vile forgeries of hands  after his personating basenesses  what are the iniquities he is not capable of  i would then have given her an account of the trial you stood with your friends your own previous resolutions of marriage had she honored you with the requested four words all your familys earnestness to have the honor of her alliance and the application of your two cousins to miss how by general consent for that young ladys interest with her but having just touched upon these topics she cut me short saying that was a cause before another tribunal miss howes letters to her were upon that subject and she should write her thoughts to her as soon as she was able  i then attempted more particularly to clear you of having any hand in the vile sinclairs officious arrest a point she had the generosity to wish you cleared of and having mentioned the outrageous letter you had written to me on this occasion she asked if i had that letter about me  i owned i had  she wished to see it  this puzzled me horribly for you must needs think that most of the free things which among us rakes pass for wit and spirit must be shocking stuff to the ears or eyes of persons of delicacy of that sex and then such an air of levity runs through thy most serious letters such a false bravery endeavoring to carry off ludicrously the subjects that most affect thee that those letters are generally the least fit to be seen which ought to be most to thy credit  something like this i observed to her and would fain have excused myself from showing it but she was so earnest that i undertook to read some parts of it resolving to omit the most exceptionable  i know thou wilt curse me for that but i thought it better to oblige her than to be suspected myself and so not have it in my power to serve thee with her when so good a foundation was laid for it and when she knows as bad of thee as i can tell her  thou remembrest the contents i suppose of thy furious letter see p       0  her remarks upon the different parts of it which i read to her were to the following effect  upon thy two first lines all undone undone by jupiter  zounds jack what shall i do now a curse upon all my plots and contrivances thus she expressed herself  o how light how unaffected with the sense of its own crimes is the heart that could dictate to the pen this libertine froth  the paragraph which mentions the vile arrest affected her a good deal  in the next i omitted thy curse upon thy relations whom thou were gallanting and read on the seven subsequent paragraphs down to thy execrable wish which was too shocking to read to her what i read produced the following reflections from her  the plots and contrivances which he curses and the exultings of the wicked wretches on finding me out show me that all his guilt was premeditated nor doubt i that his dreadful perjuries and inhuman arts as he went along were to pass for fine stratagems for witty sport and to demonstrate a superiority of inventive talents  o my cruel cruel brother had it not been for thee i had not been thrown upon so pernicious and so despicable a plotter  but proceed sir pray proceed  at that part can thou o fatal prognosticator tell me where my punishments will end  she sighed and when i came to that sentence praying for my reformation perhaps  is that there said she sighing again  wretched man  and shed a tear for thee  by my faith lovelace i believe she hates thee not  she has at least a concern a generous concern for thy future happiness  what a noble creature have thou injured  she made a very severe reflection upon me on reading these words  on your knees for me beg her pardon  you had all your lessons sir said she when you came to redeem me  you was so condescending as to kneel i thought it was the effect of your own humanity and goodnatured earnestness to serve me excuse me sir i knew not that it was in consequence of a prescribed lesson  this concerned me not a little i could not bear to be thought such a wretched puppet such a joseph leman such a tomlinson  i endeavored therefore with some warmth to clear myself of this reflection and she again asked my excuse i was avowedly she said the friend of a man whose friendship she had reason to be sorry to say was no credit to anybody  and desired me to proceed  i did but fared not much better afterward for  on that passage where you say i had always been her friend and advocate this was her unanswerable remark i find sir by this expression that he had always designs against me and that you all along knew that he had would to heaven you had had the goodness to have contrived some way that might not have endangered your own safety to give me notice of his baseness since you approved not of it but you gentlemen i suppose had rather see an innocent fellow creature ruined than be thought capable of an action which however generous might be likely to loosen the bands of a wicked friendship  after this severe but just reflection i would have avoided reading the following although i had unawares begun the sentence but she held me to it what would i now give had i permitted you to have been a successful advocate and this was her remark upon it  so sir you see if you had been the happy means of preventing the evils designed me you would have had your friends thanks for it when he came to his consideration this satisfaction i am persuaded everyone in the long run will enjoy who has the virtue to withstand or prevent a wicked purpose i was obliged i see to your kind wishes  but it was a point of honor with you to keep his secret the greater honor perhaps the viler the secret yet permit me to wish mr belford that you were capable of relishing the pleasures that arise to a benevolent mind from virtuous friendship  none other is worthy of the sacred name you seem an humane man i hope for your own sake you will one day experience the difference and when you do think of miss how and clarissa harlowe i find you know much of my sad story who were the happiest creatures on earth in each others friendship till this friend of yours  and there she stopped and turned from me  where thou call thyself a villainous plotter to take crime to himself said she without shame o what a hardened wretch is this man  on that passage where thou say let me know how she has been treated if roughly woe be to the guilty this was her remark with an air of indignation what a man is your friend sir  is such a one as he to set himself up to punish the guilty  all the rough usage i could receive from them was infinitely less  and there she stopped a moment or two then proceeding  and who shall punish him what an assuming wretch  nobody but himself is entitled to injure the innocent  he is i suppose on earth to act the part which the malignant fiend is supposed to act below dealing out punishments at his pleasure to every inferior instrument of mischief  what thought i have i been doing i shall have this savage fellow think i have been playing him booty in reading part of his letter to this sagacious lady  yet if thou art angry it can only in reason be at thyself for who would think i might not communicate to her some of the least exceptionable parts of a letter as a proof of thy sincerity in exculpating thyself from a criminal charge which thou wrotest to thy friend to convince him of thy innocence but a bad heart and a bad cause are confounding things and so let us put it to its proper account  i passed over thy charge to me to curse them by the hour and thy names of dragon and serpents though so applicable since had i read them thou must have been supposed to know from the first what creatures they were vile fellow as thou were for bringing so much purity among them and i closed with thy own concluding paragraph a line a line a kingdom for a line etc however telling her since she saw that i omitted some sentences that there were further vehemences in it but as they were better fitted to show to me the sincerity of the writer than for so delicate an ear as hers to hear i chose to pass them over  you have read enough said she  he is a wicked wicked man  i see he intended to have me in his power at any rate and i have no doubt of what his purposes were by what his actions have been you know his vile tomlinson i suppose  you know  but what signifies talking  never was there such a premeditately false heart in man nothing can be truer thought i what has he not vowed what has he not invented and all for what  only to ruin a poor young creature whom he ought to have protected and whom he had first deprived of all other protection  she arose and turned from me her handkerchief at her eyes and after a pause came toward me again  i hope said she i talk to a man who has a better heart and i thank you sir for all your kind though ineffectual pleas in my favor formerly whether the motives for them were compassion or principle or both that they were ineffectual might very probably be owing to your want of earnestness and that as you might think to my want of merit i might not in your eye deserve to be saved  i might appear to you a giddy creature who had run away from her true and natural friends and who therefore ought to take the consequence of the lot she had drawn  i was afraid for thy sake to let her know how very earnest i had been but assured her that i had been her zealous friend and that my motives were founded upon a merit that i believed was never equalled that however indefensible mr lovelace was he had always done justice to her virtue that to a full conviction of her untainted honor it was owing that he so earnestly desired to call so inestimable a jewel his  and was proceeding when she again cut me short   enough and too much of this subject sir  if he will never more let me behold his face that is all i have now to ask of him  indeed indeed clasping her hands i never will if i can by any means not criminally desperate avoid it  what could i say for thee  there was no room however at that time to touch this string again for fear of bringing upon myself a prohibition not only of the subject but of ever attending her again  i gave some distant intimations of moneymatters i should have told thee that when i read to her that passage where thou biddest me force what sums upon her i can get her to take  she repeated no no no no several times with great quickness and i durst no more than just intimate it again  and that so darkly as left her room to seem not to understand me  indeed i know not the person man or woman i should be so much afraid of disobliging or incurring a censure from as from her she has so much true dignity in her manner without pride or arrogance which in those who have either one is tempted to mortify such a piercing eye yet softened so sweetly with rays of benignity that she commands all ones reverence  methinks i have a kind of holy love for this angel of a woman and it is matter of astonishment to me that thou could converse with her a quarter of an hour together and hold thy devilish purposes  guarded as she was by piety prudence virtue dignity family fortune and a purity of heart that never woman before her boasted what a true devil must he be yet i doubt i shall make thee proud who could resolve to break through so many fences  for my own part i am more and more sensible that i ought not to have contented myself with representing against and expostulating with thee upon thy base intentions and indeed i had it in my head more than once to try to do something for her but wretch that i was i was withheld by notions of false honor as she justly reproached me because of thy own voluntary communications to me of thy purposes and then as she was brought into such a cursed house and was so watched by thyself as well as by thy infernal agents i thought knowing my man that i should only accelerate the intended mischiefs  moreover finding thee so much overawed by her virtue that thou had not at thy first carrying her thither the courage to attempt her and that she had more than once without knowing thy base views obliged thee to abandon them and to resolve to do her justice and thyself honor i hardly doubted that her merit would be triumphant at last  it is my opinion if thou hold thy purposes to marry that thou can not do better than to procure thy real aunts and thy real cousins to pay her a visit and to be thy advocates but if they decline personal visits letters from them and from my lord m supported by miss howes interest may perhaps effect something in thy favor  but these are only my hopes founded on what i wish for thy sake the lady i really think would choose death rather than thee and the two women are of opinion though they know not half of what she has suffered that her heart is actually broken  at taking my leave i tendered my best services to her and besought her to permit me frequently to inquire after her health  she made me no answer but by bowing her head  letter xlvii mr belford to robert lovelace esquire wednesday july    this morning i took chair to smiths and being told that the lady had a very bad night but was up i sent for her worthy apothecary who on his coming to me approving of my proposal of calling in dr h i bid the women acquaint her with the designed visit  it seems she was at first displeased yet withdrew her objection but after a pause asked them what she should do she had effects of value some of which she intended as soon as she could to turn into money but till then had not a single guinea to give the doctor for his fee  mrs lovick said she had five guineas by her they were at her service  she would accept of three she said if she would take that pulling a diamond ring from her finger till she repaid her but on no other terms  having been told i was below with mr goddard she desired to speak one word with me before she saw the doctor  she was sitting in an elbowchair leaning her head on a pillow mrs smith and the widow on each side her chair her nurse with a phial of hartshorn behind her in her own hand her salts  raising her head at my entrance she inquired if the doctor knew mr lovelace  i told her no and that i believed you never saw him in your life  was the doctor my friend  he was and a very worthy and skilful man i named him for his eminence in his profession and mr goddard said he knew not a better physician  i have but one condition to make before i see the gentleman that he refuse not his fees from me if i am poor sir i am proud i will not be under obligation you may believe sir i will not i suffer this visit because i would not appear ungrateful to the few friends i have left nor obstinate to such of my relations as may some time hence for their private satisfaction inquire after my behavior in my sick hours so sir you know the condition and dont let me be vexed i am very ill and cannot debate the matter  seeing her so determined i told her if it must be so it should  then sir the gentleman may come but i shall not be able to answer many questions nurse you can tell him at the window there what a night i have had and how i have been for two days past and mr goddard if he be here can let him know what i have taken pray let me be as little questioned as possible  the doctor paid his respects to her with the gentlemanly address for which he is noted and she cast up her sweet eyes to him with that benignity which accompanies her every graceful look  i would have retired but she forbid it  he took her hand the lily not of so beautiful a white indeed madam you are very low said he but give me leave to say that you can do more for yourself than all the faculty can do for you  he then withdrew to the window and after a short conference with the women he turned to me and to mr goddard at the other window we can do nothing here speaking low but by cordials and nourishment what friends has the lady she seems to be a person of condition and ill as she is a very fine woman  a single lady i presume  i whisperingly told him she was that there were extraordinary circumstances in her case as i would have apprised him had i met with him yesterday that her friends were very cruel to her but that she could not hear them named without reproaching herself though they were much more to blame than she  i knew i was right said the doctor a lovecase mr goddard a lovecase mr belford there is one person in the world who can do her more service than all the faculty  mr goddard said he had apprehended her disorder was in her mind and had treated her accordingly and then told the doctor what he had done which he approving of again taking her charming hand said my good young lady you will require very little of our assistance you must in a great measure be your own doctress come dear madam forgive me the familiar tenderness your aspect commands love as well as reverence and a father of children some of them older than yourself may be excused for them cheer up your spirits resolve to do all in your power to be well and you will soon grow better  you are very kind sir said she i will take whatever you direct my spirits have been hurried i shall be better i believe before i am worse the care of my good friends here looking at the women shall not meet with an ungrateful return  the doctor wrote he would fain have declined his fee as her malady he said was rather to be relieved by the soothings of a friend than by the prescriptions of a physician he should think himself greatly honored to be admitted rather to advise her in the one character than to prescribe to her in the other  she answered that she should be always glad to see so humane a gentleman that his visits would keep her in charity with his sex but that were she to forget that he was her physician she might be apt to abate of the confidence in his skill which might be necessary to effect the amendment that was the end of his visits  and when he urged her still further which he did in a very polite manner and as passing by the door two or three times a day she said she should always have pleasure in considering him in the kind light he offered himself to her that that might be very generous in one person to offer which would be as ungenerous in another to accept that indeed she was not at present high in circumstance and he saw by the tender which he must accept of that she had greater respect to her own convenience than to his merit or than to the pleasure she should take in his visits  we all withdrew together and the doctor and mr goddard having a great curiosity to know something more of her story at the motion of the latter we went into a neighboring coffeehouse and i gave them in confidence a brief relation of it making all as light for you as i could and yet you will suppose that in order to do but common justice to the ladys character heavy must be that light  three of clock afternoon i just now called again at smiths and am told she is somewhat better which she attributed to the soothings of her doctor she expressed herself highly pleased with both gentlemen and said that their behavior to her was perfectly paternal   paternal poor lady  never having been till very lately from under her parents wings and now abandoned by all her friends she is for finding out something paternal and maternal in every one the latter qualities in mrs lovick and mrs smith to supply to herself the father and mother her dutiful heart pants after  mrs smith told me that after we were gone she gave the keys of her trunks and drawers to her and the widow lovick and desired them to take an inventory of them which they did in her presence  they also informed me that she had requested them to find her a purchaser for two rich dressed suits one never worn the other not above once or twice  this shocked me exceedingly perhaps it may thee a little  her reason for so doing she told them was that she should never live to wear them that her sister and other relations were above wearing them that her mother would not endure in her sight anything that was hers that she wanted the money that she would not be obliged to anybody when she had effects by her which she had no occasion for and yet said she i expect not that they will fetch a price answerable to their value  they were both very much concerned as they owned and asked my advice upon it and the richness of her apparel having given them a still higher notion of her rank than they had before they supposed she must be of quality and again wanted to know her story  i told them that she was indeed a lady of family and fortune i still gave them room to suppose her married but left it to her to tell them all in her own time and manner all i would say was that she had been very vilely treated deserved it not and was all innocence and purity  you may suppose that they both expressed their astonishment that there could be a man in the world who could illtreat so fine a creature  as to disposing of the two suits of apparel i told mrs smith that she should pretend that upon inquiry she had found a friend who would purchase the richest of them but that she might not mistrust would stand upon a good bargain and having twenty guineas about me i left them with her in part of payment and bid her pretend to get her to part with it for as little more as she could induce her to take  i am setting out for edgware with poor belton  more of whom in my next i shall return tomorrow and leave this in readiness for your messenger if he shall call in my absence adieu  letter xlviii mr lovelace to john belford esquire  in answer to letter xlvi m hall wedn night july    thou might well apprehend that i should think thou were playing me booty in communicating my letter to the lady  thou ask who would think thou might not read to her the least exceptionable parts of a letter written in my own defense to thee  i will tell thee who  the man who in the same letter that he asks this question tells the friend whom he exposes to her resentment that there is such an air of levity runs through his most serious letters that those of his are least fit to be seen which ought to be most to his credit and now what think thou of thy selfcondemned folly be however i charge thee more circumspect for the future that so this clumsy error may stand singly by itself  it is painful to her to think of me libertine froth so pernicious and so despicable a plotter a man whose friendship is no credit to anybody hardened wretch the devils counterpart a wicked wicked man  but did she could she dared she to say or imply all this  and say it to a man whom she praises for humanity and prefers to myself for that virtue when all the humanity he shows and she knows it too is by my direction  so robs me of the credit of my own works admirably entitled all this shows her to thy refinement upon the words resentment and revenge but thou were always aiming and blundering at something thou never could make out  the praise thou give to her ingenuousness is another of thy peculiars i think not as thou do of her telltale recapitulations and exclamations  what end can they answer  only that thou have an holy love the devil fetch thee for thy oddity or it is extremely provoking to suppose one sees such a charming creature stand upright before a libertine and talk of the sin against her that cannot be forgiven  i wish at my heart that these chaste ladies would have a little modesty in their anger  it would sound very strange if i robert lovelace should pretend to have more true delicacy in a point that requires the utmost than miss clarissa harlowe  i think i will put it into the head of her nurse norton and her miss how by some one of my agents to chide the dear novice for her proclamations  but to be serious let me tell thee that severe as she is and saucy in asking so contemptuously what a man is your friend sir to set himself to punish guilty people i will never forgive the cursed woman who could commit this last horrid violence on so excellent a creature  the barbarous insults of the two nymphs in their visits to her the choice of the most execrable den that could be found out in order no doubt to induce her to go back to theirs and the still more execrable attempt to propose to her a man who would pay the debt a snare i make no question laid for her despairing and resenting heart by that devilish sally thinking her no doubt a woman in order to ruin her with me and to provoke me in a fury to give her up to their remorseless cruelty are outrages that to express myself in her style i never can never will forgive  but as to thy opinion and the two womens at smiths that her heart is broken that is the true womens language i wonder how thou came into it thou who have seen and heard of so many female deaths and revivals  i will tell thee what makes against this notion of theirs  her time of life and charming constitution the good she ever delighted to do and fancied she was born to do and which she may still continue to do to as high a degree as ever nay higher since i am no sordid varlet thou know her religious turn a turn that will always teach her to bear inevitable evils with patience the contemplation upon her last noble triumph over me and over the whole crew and upon her succeeding escape from us all her will unviolated and the inward pride of having not deserved the treatment she has met with  how is it possible to imagine that a woman who has all these consolatories to reflect upon will die of a broken heart  on the contrary i make no doubt but that as she recovers from the dejection into which this last scurvy villainy which none but wretches of her own sex could have been guilty of has thrown her returning love will reenter her timepacified mind her thoughts will then turn once more on the conjugal pivot of course she will have livelier notions in her head and these will make her perform all her circumvolutions with ease and pleasure though not with so high a degree of either as if the dear proud rogue could have exalted herself above the rest of her sex as she turned round  thou ask on reciting the bitter invectives that the lady made against thy poor friend standing before her i suppose with thy fingers in thy mouth what could thou say for me  have i not in my former letters suggested an hundred things which a friend in earnest to vindicate or excuse a friend might say on such an occasion  but now to current topics and the present state of matters here  it is true as my servant told thee that miss how had engaged before this cursed womans officiousness to use her interest with her friend in my behalf and yet she told my cousins in the visit they made her that it was her opinion that she would never forgive me  i long to know what miss how wrote to her friend in order to induce her to marry the despicable plotter the man whose friendship is no credit to anybody the wicked wicked man thou had the two letters in thy hand had they been in mine the seal would have yielded to the touch of my warm finger perhaps without the help of the post office bullet and the folds as other plications have done opened of themselves to oblige my curiosity a wicked omission jack not to contrive to send them down to me by man and horse it might have passed that the messenger who brought the second letter took them both back i could have returned them by another when copied as from miss how and nobody but myself and thee the wiser  my two aunts finding the treaty upon the success of which they have set their foolish hearts likely to run into length are about departing to their own seats having taken from me the best security the nature of the case will admit of that is to say my word to marry the lady if she will have me  all i have to do in my present uncertainty is to brighten up my faculties by filing off the rust they have contracted by the town smoke a long imprisonment in my close attendance to so little purpose on my fair perverse and to brace up if i can the relaxed fibers of my mind which have been twitchd and convulsed like the nerves of some tottering paralytic by means of the tumults she has excited in it that so i may be able to present to her a husband as worthy as i can be of her acceptance or if she reject me be in a capacity to resume my usual gaiety of heart and show others of the misleading sex that i am not discouraged by the difficulties i have met with from this sweet individual of it from endeavoring to make myself as acceptable to them as before  in this latter case one tour to france and italy i dare say will do the business miss harlowe will by that time have forgotten all she has suffered from the ungrateful lovelace though it will be impossible that her lovelace should ever forget a woman whose equal he despairs to meet with were he to travel from one end of the world to the other  if thou continuest paying off the heavy debts my long letters for so many weeks together have made thee groan under i will endeavor to restrain myself in the desires i have importunate as they are of going to town to throw myself at the feet of my souls beloved policy and honesty both join to strengthen the restraint my own promise and thy engagement have laid me under on this head i would not afresh provoke on the contrary would give time for her resentments to subside that so all that follows may be her own act and deed  hickman i have a mortal aversion to that fellow has by a line which i have just now received requested an interview with me on friday at mr dormers as at a common friends does the business he wants to meet me upon require that it should be at a common friends  a challenge implied int it belford  i shall not be civil to him i doubt he has been an intermeddler  then i envy him on miss howes account for if i have a right notion of this hickman it is impossible that that virago can ever love him  a charming encouragement for a man of intrigue when he has reason to believe that the woman he has a view upon has no love for her husband what good principles must that wife have who is kept in against temptation by a sense of her duty and plighted faith where affection has no hold of her  prythee let us know very particularly how it fares with poor belton  it is an honest fellow  something more than his thomasine seems to stick with him  tourville mowbray and myself pass away our time as pleasantly as possibly we can without thee i wish we dont add to lord ms gouty days by the joy we give him  this is one advantage as i believe i have elsewhere observed that we maledelinquents in lovematters have of the other sex  for while they poor things sit sighing in holes and corners or run to woods and groves to bemoan themselves for their baffled hopes we can rant and roar hunt and hawk and by new loves banish from our hearts all remembrance of the old ones  merrily however as we pass our time my reflections upon the injuries done to this noble creature bring a qualm upon my heart very often but i know she will permit me to make her amends after she has plagued me heartily and that is my consolation  an honest fellow still  clap thy wings and crow jack   letter xlix miss how to miss clarissa harlowe thursday morn july  0 what my dearest creature have been your sufferings  what must have been your anguish on so disgraceful an insult committed in the open streets and in the open day  no end i think of the undeserved calamities of a dear soul who has been so unhappily driven and betrayed into the hands of a vile libertine  how was i shocked at the receiving of your letter written by another hand and only dictated by you  you must be very ill nor is it to be wondered at but i hope it is rather from hurry and surprise and lowness which may be overcome than from a grief given way to which may be attended with effects i cannot bear to think of  but whatever you do my dear you must not despond indeed you must not despond hitherto you have been in no fault but despair would be all your own and the worst fault you can be guilty of  i cannot bear to look upon another hand instead of yours my dear creature send me a few lines though ever so few in your own hand if possible  for they will revive my heart especially if they can acquaint me of your amended health  i expect your answer to my letter of the   th we all expect it with impatience  his relations are persons of so much honor  they are so very earnest to rank you among them  the wretch is so very penitent every one of his family says he is  your own are so implacable  your last distress though the consequence of his former villainy yet neither brought on by his direction nor with his knowledge and so much resented by him  that my mamma is absolutely of opinion that you should be his  especially if yielding to my wishes as in my letter and those of all his friends you would have complied had it not been for this horrid arrest  i will enclose the copy of the letter i wrote to miss montague last tuesday on hearing that nobody knew what was become of you and the answer to it underwritten and signed by lord m and lady sarah sadleir and lady betty lawrance as well as by the young ladies  and also by the wretch himself  i own that i like not the turn of what he has written to me and before i will further interest myself in his favor i have determined to inform myself by a friend from his own mouth of his sincerity and whether his whole inclination be in his request to me exclusive of the wishes of his relations yet my heart rises against him on the supposition that there is the shadow of a reason for such a question the lady miss clarissa harlowe  but i think with my mother that marriage is now the only means left to make your future life tolerably easy  happy there is no saying  in the eye of the world itself his disgraces in that case will be more than yours  and to those who know you glorious will be your triumph  i am obliged to accompany my mother soon to the isle of wight my aunt harman is in a declining way and insists upon seeing us both and mr hickman too i think  his sister of whom we had heard so much with her lord were brought the other day to visit us she strangely likes me or says she does  i cannot say but that i think she answers the excellent character we have heard of her  it would be death to me to set out for the little island and not see you first and yet my mother fond of exerting an authority that she herself by that exertion often brings into question insists that my next visit to you must be a congratulatory one as mrs lovelace  when i know what will be the result of the questions to be put in my name to that wretch and what is your mind on my letter of the   th i

about me i beseech you  i do not despond my dear i hope i may say i will not despond is not my condition greatly mended i thank heaven it is  i am no prisoner now in a vile house i am not now in the power of that mans devices i am not now obliged to hide myself in corners for fear of him one of his intimate companions is become my warm friend and engages to keep him from me and that by his own consent i am among honest people i have all my clothes and effects restored me the wretch himself bears testimony to my honor  indeed i am very weak and ill but i have an excellent physician dr h and

shall have sinkings sometimes i must expect such and my fathers maledict  but you will chide me for introducing that now i am enumerating my comforts  but i charge you my dear that you do not suffer my calamities to sit too heavy upon your own mind if you do that will be to newpoint some of those arrows that have been blunted and lost their sharpness  if you would contribute to my happiness give

say  our views must now be different  resolve my dear to make a worthy man happy because a worthy man must make you so  and so my dearest love for the present adieu  adieu my dearest love  but i shall soon write again i hope  letter li mr belford to robert lovelace esquire  in answer to letter xlviii thursday july  0 i read that part of your conclusion to poor belton where you inquire after him and mention how merrily you and the rest pass your time at m hall he fetched a deep sigh you are all very happy were his words  i am sorry they were his words for poor fellow he is going very fast change of air he hopes will mend him joined to the cheerful company i have left him in but nothing i dare say will  a consuming malady and a consuming mistress to an indulgent keeper are dreadful things to struggle with both together violence must be used to get rid of the latter and yet he has not spirit left him to exert himself his house is thomasines house not his he has not been within his doors for a fortnight past vagabonding about from inn to inn entering each for a bait only and staying two or three days without power to remove and hardly knowing which to go to next his malady is within him and he cannot run away from it  her boys once he thought them his are sturdy enough to shoulder him in his own house as they pass by him siding with the mother they in a manner expel him and in his absence riot away on the remnant of his broken fortunes as to their mother who was once so tender so submissive so studious to oblige that we all pronounced him happy and his course of life the eligible she is now so termagant so insolent that he cannot contend with her without doing infinite prejudice to his health a brokenspirited defensive hardly a defensive therefore reduced to and this to a heart for so many years waging offensive war nor valuing whom the opponent what a reduction  now comparing himself to the superannuated lion in the fable kicked in the jaws and laid sprawling by the spurning heel of an ignoble ass  i have undertaken his cause he has given me leave yet not without reluctance to put him into possession of his own house and to place in it for him his unhappy sister whom he has hitherto slighted because unhappy it is hard he told me and wept poor fellow when he said it that he cannot be permitted to die quietly in his own house  the fruits of blessed keeping these   though but lately apprised of her infidelity it now comes out to have been of so long continuance that he has no room to believe the boys to be his yet how fond did he use to be of them  if i have occasion for your assistance and that of our compeers in reinstating the poor fellow i will give you notice mean time i have just now been told that thomasine declares she will not stir for it seems she suspects that measures will be fallen upon to make her quit she is mrs belton she says and will prove her marriage  if she give herself these airs in his lifetime what would she attempt to do after his death  her boys threaten anybody who shall presume to insult their mother their father as they call poor belton they speak of as an unnatural one and their probably true father is for ever there hostilely there passing for her cousin as usual now her protecting cousin  hardly ever i dare say was there a keeper that did not make a keeperess who lavished away on her keptfellow what she obtained from the extravagant folly of him who kept her  i will do without you if i can the case will be only as i conceive like that of the ancient sarmatians returning after many years absence to their homes their wives then in possession of their slaves so that they had to contend not only with those wives conscious of their infidelity and with their slaves but with the children of those slaves grown up to manhood resolute to defend their mothers and their long manumitted fathers but the noble sarmatians scorning to attack their slaves with equal weapons only provided themselves with the same sort of whips with which they used formerly to chastise them and attacking them with them the miscreants fled before them  in memory of which to this day the device on the coin in novogrod in russia a city of the ancient sarmatia is a man on horseback with a whip in his hand  the poor fellow takes it ill that you did not press him more than you did to be of your party at m hall it is owing to mowbray he is sure that he had so very slight an invitation from one whose invitations used to be so warm  mowbrays speech to him he says he never will forgive why tom said the brutal fellow with a curse thou droopest like a pip or roupcloaking chicken thou should grow perter or submit to a solitary quarantine if thou would not infect the whole brood  for my own part only that this poor fellow is in distress as well in his affairs as in his mind or i should be sick of you all such is the relish i have of the conversation and such my admiration of the deportment and sentiments of this divine lady that i would forego a month even of thy company to be admitted into hers but for one hour and i am highly in conceit with myself greatly as i used to value thine for being able spontaneously as i may say to make this preference  it is after all a devilish life we have lived and to consider how it all ends in a very few years to see what a state of ill health this poor fellow is so soon reduced to and then to observe how every one of ye run away from the unhappy being as rats from a falling house is fine comfort to help a man to look back upon companions illchosen and a life misspent  for my own part if i can get some good family to credit me with a sister or a daughter as i have now an increased fortune which will enable me to propose handsome settlements i will desert ye all marry and live a life of reason rather than a life of brute for the time to come  letter lii mr belford to robert lovelace esquire thursday night i was forced to take back my twenty guineas how the women managed it i cannot tell i suppose too readily found a purchaser for the rich suit but she mistrusted that i was the advancer of the money and would not let the clothes go but mrs lovick has actually sold for fifteen guineas some rich lace worth three times the sum out of which she repaid her the money she borrowed for fees to the doctor in an illness occasioned by the barbarity of the most savage of men thou knwest his name  the doctor called on her in the morning it seems and had a short debate with her about fees she insisted that he should take one every time he came write or not write mistrusting that he only gave verbal directions to mrs lovick or the nurse to avoid taking any  he said that it would have been impossible for him had he not been a physician to forbear inquiries after the health and welfare of so excellent a person he had not the thought of paying her a compliment in declining the offered fee but he knew her case could not so suddenly vary as to demand his daily visits she must permit him therefore to inquire after her health of the women below and he must not think of coming up if he were to be pecuniarily rewarded for the satisfaction he was so desirous to give himself  it ended in a compromise for a fee each other time which she unwillingly submitted to telling him that though she was at present desolate and in disgrace yet her circumstances were of right high and no expenses could rise so as to be scrupled whether she lived or died but she submitted she added to the compromise in hopes to see him as often as he had opportunity for she really looked upon him and mr goddard from their kind and tender treatment of her with a regard next to filial  i hope thou will make thyself acquainted with this worthy doctor when thou come to town and give him thy thanks for putting her into conceit with the sex that thou have given her so much reason to execrate  farewell  letter liii mr lovelace to john belford esquire m hall friday july    just returned from an interview with this hickman a precise fop of a fellow as starched as his ruffles  thou know i love him not jack and whom we love not we cannot allow a merit to perhaps not the merit they should be granted  however i am in earnest when i say that he seems to me to be so set so prim so affected so mincing yet so clouterly in his person that i dare engage for thy opinion if thou do justice to him and to thyself that thou never beheldest such another except in a pierglass  i will tell thee how i played him off  he came in his own chariot to dormers and we took a turn in the garden at his request he was devilish ceremonious and made a bushel of apologies for the freedom he was going to take and after half a hundred hums and haws told me that he came  that he came  to wait on me  at the request of dear miss how on the account  on the account  of miss harlowe  well sir speak on said i but give me leave to say that if your book be as long as your preface it will take up a week to read it  this was pretty rough thou wilt say but there is nothing like balking these formalists at first when they are put out of their road they are filled with doubts of themselves and can never get into it again so that an honest fellow impertinently attacked as i was has all the game in his own hand quite through the conference  he stroakd his chin and hardly knew what to say at last after parenthesis within parenthesis apologizing for apologies in imitation i suppose of swifts digressions in praise of digressions  i presume i presume sir you were privy to the visit made to miss how by the young ladies your cousins in the name of lord m and lady sarah sadleir and lady betty lawrance  i was sir and miss how had a letter afterward signed by his lordship and those ladies and underwritten by myself have you seen it sir  i cannot say but i have it is the principal cause of this visit for miss how thinks your part of it is written with such an air of levity  pardon me sir  that she knows not whether you are in earnest or not in your address to her for her interest to her friend see p     of this volume   will miss how permit me to explain myself in person to her mr hickman  o sir by no means miss how i am sure would not give you that trouble  i should not think it a trouble i will most readily attend you sir to miss how and satisfy her in all her scruples come sir i will wait upon you now you have a chariot are alone we can talk as we ride  he hesitated wriggled winced stroaked his ruffles set his wig and pulled his neckcloth which was long enough for a bib  i am not going directly back to miss how sir it will be as well if you will be so good as to satisfy miss how by me  what is it she scruples mr hickman  why sir miss how observes that in your part of the letter you say  but let me see sir i have a copy of what you wrote  pulling it out  will you give me leave sir  thus you begin  dear miss how   no offense i hope mr hickman  none in the least sir  none at all sir  taking aim as it were to read  do you use spectacles mr hickman  spectacles sir his whole broad face lifted up at me spectacles  what makes you ask me such a question such a young man as i use spectacles sir   they do in spain mr hickman young as well as old to save their eyes  have you ever read priors alma mr hickman  i have sir  custom is everything in nations as well as with individuals i know the meaning of your question  but it is not the english custom   was you ever in spain mr hickman  no sir i have been in holland  in holland sir  never in france or italy  i was resolved to travel with him into the land of puzzledom  no sir i cannot say i have as yet  that is a wonder sir when on the continent  i went on a particular affair i was obliged to return soon  well sir you was going to read  pray be pleased to proceed  again he took aim as if his eyes were older than the rest of him and read after what is written above and signed by names and characters of such unquestionable honor  to be sure taking off his eye nobody questions the honor of lord m nor that of the good ladies who signed the letter  i hope mr hickman nobody questions mine neither  if you please sir i will read on  i might have been excused signing a name almost as hateful to myself you are pleased to say as i know it is to you   well mr hickman i must interrupt you at this place in what i wrote to miss how i distinguished the word know i had a reason for it miss how has been very free with my character i have never done her any harm i take it very ill of her and i hope sir you come in her name to make excuses for it  miss how sir is a very polite young lady she is not accustomed to treat any gentlemans character unbecomingly  then i have the more reason to take it amiss mr hickman  why sir you know the friendship   no friendship should warrant such freedoms as miss how has taken with my character  i believe he began to wish he had not come near me he seemed quite disconcerted  have you not heard miss how treat my name with great   sir i come not to offend or affront you but you know what a love there is between miss how and miss harlowe  i doubt sir you have not treated miss harlowe as so fine a young lady deserved to be treated and if love for her friend has made miss how take freedoms as you call them a generous mind on such an occasion will rather be sorry for having given the cause than   i know your consequence sir  but i would rather have this reproof from a lady than from a gentleman i have a great desire to wait upon miss how i am persuaded we should soon come to a good understanding generous minds are always of kin i know we should agree in everything pray mr hickman be so kind as to introduce me to miss how  sir  i can signify your desire if you please to miss how  do so be pleased to read on mr hickman  he did very formally as if i remembered not what i had written and when he came to the passage about the halter the parson and the hangman reading it why sir says he does not this look like a jest  miss how thinks it does it is not in the ladys power you know sir to doom you to the gallows  then if it were mr hickman you think she would  you say here to miss how proceeded he that miss harlowe is the most injured of her sex i know from miss how that she highly resents the injuries you own insomuch that miss how doubts that she shall ever prevail upon her to overlook them and as your family are all desirous you should repair her wrongs and likewise desire miss howes interposition with her friend miss how fears from this part of your letter that you are too much in jest and that your offer to do her justice is rather in compliment to your friends entreaties than proceeding from your own inclinations and she desires to know your true sentiments on this occasion before she interposes further  do you think mr hickman that if i am capable of deceiving my own relations i have so much obligation to miss how who has always treated me with great freedom as to acknowledge to her what i dont to them  sir i beg pardon  but miss how thinks that as you have written to her she may ask you by me for an explanation of what you have written  you see mr hickman something of me  do you think i am in jest or in earnest  i see sir you are a gay gentleman of fine spirits and all that  all i beg in miss howes name is to know if you really and bona fide join with your friends in desiring her to use her interest to reconcile you to miss harlowe  i should be extremely glad to be reconciled to miss harlowe and should owe great obligations to miss how if she could bring about so happy an event  well sir and you have no objections to marriage i presume as the terms of that reconciliation  i never liked matrimony in my life i must be plain with you mr hickman  i am sorry for it i think it a very happy state  i hope you will find it so mr hickman  i doubt not but i shall sir and i dare say so would you if you were to have miss harlowe  if i could be happy in it with anybody it would be with miss harlowe  i am surprised sir  then after all you dont think of marrying miss harlowe  after the hard usage   what hard usage mr hickman i dont doubt but a lady of her niceness has represented what would appear trifles to any other in a very strong light  if what i have had hinted to me sir  excuse me  has been offered to the lady she has more than trifles to complain of  let me know what you have heard mr hickman i will very truly answer to the accusations  sir you know best what you have done you own the lady is the most injured as well as the most deserving of her sex  i do sir and yet i would be glad to know what you have heard for on that perhaps depends my answer to the questions miss how puts to me by you  why then sir since you ask it you cannot be displeased if i answer you  in the first place sir you will acknowledge i suppose that you promised miss harlowe marriage and all that  well sir and i suppose what you have to charge me with is that i was desirous to have all that without marriage  cotso sir i know you are deemed to be a man of wit but may i not ask if these things sit not too light upon you  when a thing is done and cannot be helped it is right to make the best of it i wish the lady would think so too  i think sir ladies should not be deceived i think a promise to a lady should be as binding as to any other person at the least  i believe you think so mr hickman and i believe you are a very honest good sort of a man  i would always keep my word sir whether to man or woman  you say well and far be it from me to persuade you to do otherwise but what have you farther heard  thou will think jack i must be very desirous to know in what light my elected spouse had represented things to miss how and how far miss how had communicated them to mr hickman  sir this is no part of my present business  but mr hickman it is part of mine i hope you would not expect that i should answer your questions at the same time that you refuse to answer mine what pray have you farther heard  why then sir if i must say i am told that miss harlowe was carried to a very bad house  why indeed the people did not prove so good as they should be  what farther have you heard  i have heard sir that the lady had strange advantages taken of her very unfair ones but what i cannot say  and cannot you say cannot you guess then i will tell you sir perhaps some liberty was taken with her when she was asleep do you think no lady ever was taken at such an advantage  you know mr hickman that ladies are very shy of trusting themselves with the modestest of our sex when they are disposed to sleep and why so if they did not expect that advantages would be taken of them at such times  but sir had not the lady something given her to make her sleep  ay mr hickman that is the question i want to know if the lady says she had  i have not seen all she has written but by what i have heard it is a very black affair  excuse me sir  i do excuse you mr hickman but supposing it were so do you think a lady was never imposed upon by wine or so  do you think the most cautious woman in the world might not be cheated by a stronger liquor for a smaller when she was thirsty after a fatigue in this very warm weather and do you think if she was thus thrown into a profound sleep that she is the only lady that was ever taken at such advantage  even as you make it mr lovelace this matter is not a light one but i fear it is a great deal heavier than as you put it  what reasons have you to fear this sir what has the lady said pray let me know i have reason to be so earnest  why sir miss how herself knows not the whole the lady promises to give her all the particulars at a proper time if she lives but has said enough to make it out to be a very bad affair  i am glad miss harlowe has not yet given all the particulars and since she has not you may tell miss how from me that neither she nor any lady in the world can be more virtuous than miss harlowe is to this hour as to her own mind tell her that i hope she never will know the particulars but that she has been unworthily used tell her that though i know not what she has said yet i have such an opinion of her veracity that i would blindly subscribe to the truth of every tittle of it though it make me ever so black tell her that i have but three things to blame her for one that she will not give me an opportunity of repairing her wrongs the second that she is so ready to acquaint everybody with what she has suffered that it will put it out of my power to redress those wrongs with any tolerable reputation to either of us will this mr hickman answer any part of the intention of this visit  why sir this is talking like a man of honor i own but you say there is a third thing you blame the lady for may i ask what that is  i dont know sir whether i ought to tell it you or not perhaps you will not believe it if i do but though the lady will tell the truth and nothing but the truth yet perhaps she will not tell the whole truth  pray sir  but it may not be proper  yet you give me great curiosity sure there is no misconduct in the lady i hope there is not i am sure if miss how did not believe her to be faultless in every particular she would not interest herself so much in her favor as she does dearly as she loves her  i love the lady too well mr hickman to wish to lessen her in miss howes opinion especially as she is abandoned of every other friend but perhaps it would hardly be credited if i should tell you  i should be very sorry sir and so would miss how if this poor ladys conduct had laid her under obligation to you for this reserve  you have so much the appearance of a gentleman as well as are so much distinguished in your family and fortunes that i hope you are incapable of loading such a young lady as this in order to lighten yourself  excuse me sir  i do i do mr hickman you say you came not with any intention to affront me i take freedom and i give it  i should be very loath i repeat to say anything that may weaken miss harlowe in the good opinion of the only friend she thinks she has left  it may not be proper said he for me to know your third article against this unhappy lady but i never heard of any body out of her own implacable family that had the least doubt of her honor mrs how indeed once said after a conference with one of her uncles that she feared all was not right of her side  but else i never heard   oons sir in a fierce tone and with an erect mien stopping short upon him which made him start back  it is next to blasphemy to question the ladys honor she is more pure than a vestal for vestals have been often warmed by their own fires no age from the first to the present ever produced nor will the future to the end of the world i dare averr ever produce a young blooming lady tried as she has been tried who has stood all trials as she has done  let me tell you sir that you never saw never knew never heard of such another lady as miss harlowe  sir sir i beg your pardon far be it from me to question the lady you have not heard me say a word that could be so construed i have the utmost honor for her miss how loves her as she loves her own soul and that she would not do if she were not sure she were as virtuous as herself  as herself sir  i have a high opinion of miss how sir  but i dare say   what sir dare you say of miss how  i hope sir you will not presume to say anything to the disparagement of miss how  presume mr hickman  that is presuming language let me tell you mr hickman  the occasion for it mr lovelace if designed is presuming if you please  i am not a man ready to take offense sir  especially where i am employed as a mediator but no man breathing shall say disparaging things of miss how in my hearing without observation  well said mr hickman i dislike not your spirit on such a supposed occasion but what i was going to say is this that there is not in my opinion a woman in the world who ought to compare herself with miss clarissa harlowe till she has stood her trials and has behaved under them and after them as she has done you see sir i speak against myself you see i do for libertine as i am thought to be i never will attempt to bring down the measures of right and wrong to the standard of my actions  why sir this is very right it is very noble i will say but it is pity  excuse me sir  it is pity that the man who can pronounce so fine a sentence will not square his actions accordingly  that mr hickman is another point we all err in some things i wish not that miss how should have miss harlowes trials and i rejoice that she is in no danger of any such from so good a man  poor hickman  he looked as if he knew not whether i meant a compliment or a reflection  but proceeded i since i find that i have excited your curiosity that you may not go away with a doubt that may be injurious to the most admirable of women i am inclined to hint to you what i have in the third place to blame her for  sir as you please  it may not be proper   it cannot be very improper mr hickman  so let me ask you what would miss how think if her friend is the more determined against me because she thinks in revenge to me i verily believe that of encouraging another lover  how sir  sure this cannot be the case  i can tell you sir if miss how thought this she would not approve of it at all for little as you think miss how likes you sir and little as she approves of your actions by her friend i know she is of opinion that she ought to have nobody living but you and should continue single all her life if she be not yours  revenge and obstinacy mr hickman will make women the best of them do very unaccountable things  rather than not put out both eyes of the man they are offended with they will give up one of their own  i dont know what to say to this sir but sure she cannot encourage any other persons address  so soon too  why sir she is as we are told so ill and so weak   not in resentment weak i will assure you i am well acquainted with all her movements  and i tell you believe it or not that she refuses me in view of another lover  can it be  it is true by my soul  has she not hinted this to miss how do you think  no indeed sir if she had i should not have troubled you at this time from miss how  well then you see i am right that though she cannot be guilty of a falsehood yet she has not told her friend the whole truth  what shall a man say to these things looking most stupidly perplexed  say say mr hickman  who can account for the workings and ways of a passionate and offended lady endless would be the histories i could give you within my own knowledge of the dreadful effects of womens passionate resentments and what that sex will do when disappointed but can there be a stronger instance than this of such a person as miss harlowe who at this very instant and ill as she is not only encourages but in a manner makes court to one of the most odious dogs that ever was seen i think miss how should not be told this and yet she ought too in order to dissuade her from such a preposterous rashness  o fie o strange miss how knows nothing of this to be sure she will not look upon her if this be true  it is true very true mr hickman true as i am here to tell you so  and he is an ugly fellow too uglier to look at than me  than you sir why to be sure you are one of the handsomest men in england  well but the wretch she so spitefully prefers to me is a misshapen meager varlet more like a skeleton than a man then he dresses  you never saw a devil so bedizened hardly a coat to his back nor a shoe to his foot a baldpated villain yet grudges to buy a peruke to hide his baldness for he is as covetous as hell never satisfied yet plaguey rich  why sir there is some joke in this surely a man of common parts knows not how to take such gentlemen as you but sir if there be any truth in the story what is he some jew or miserly citizen i suppose that may have presumed on the ladys distressful circumstances and your lively wit points him out as it pleases  why the rascal has estates in every county in england and out of england too  some east india governor i suppose if there be anything in it the lady once had thoughts of going abroad but i fancy all this time you are in jest sir if not we must surely have heard of him   heard of him ay sir we have all heard of him  but none of us care to be intimate with him  except this lady  and that as i told you in spite to me  his name in short is death  death sir stamping and speaking loud and full in his ear which made him jump half a yard high  thou never beheldest any man so disconcerted he looked as if the frightful skeleton was before him and he had not his accounts ready when a little recovered he fribbled with his waistcoat buttons as if he had been telling his beads  this sir proceeded i is her wooer  nay she is so forward a girl that she wooes him but i hope it never will be a match  he had before behaved and now looked with more spirit than i expected from him  i came sir said he as a mediator of differences it behooves me to keep my temper but sir and turned short upon me as much as i love peace and to promote it i will not be illused  as i had played so much upon him it would have been wrong to take him at his more than halfmenace yet i think i owe him a grudge for his presuming to address miss how  you mean no defiance i presume mr hickman any more than i do offense on that presumption i ask your excuse but this is my way i mean no harm i cannot let sorrow touch my heart i cannot be grave six minutes together for the blood of me i am a descendent of old chancellor more i believe and should not forbear to cut a joke were i upon the scaffold but you may gather from what i have said that i prefer miss harlowe and that upon the justest grounds to all the women in the world and i wonder that there should be any difficulty to believe from what i have signed and from what i have promised to my relations and enabled them to promise for me that i should be glad to marry that excellent lady upon her own terms i acknowledge to you mr hickman that i have basely injured her if she will honor me with her hand i declare that it is my intention to make her the best of husbands but nevertheless i must say that if she goes on appealing her case and exposing us both as she does it is impossible to think the knot can be knit with reputation to either and although mr hickman i have delivered my apprehensions under so ludicrous a figure i am afraid that she will ruin her constitution and by seeking death when she may shun him will not be able to avoid him when she would be glad to do so  this cool and honest speech let down his stiffened muscles into complacency he was my very obedient and faithful humble servant several times over as i waited on him to his chariot and i was his almost as often  and so exit hickman  letter live mr lovelace to john belford esquire  in answer to letters xlvii li lii friday night july    i will throw away a few paragraphs upon the contents of thy last shocking letters just brought me and send what i shall write by the fellow who carries mine on the interview with hickman  reformation i see is coming fast upon thee thy uncles slow death and thy attendance upon him through every stage toward it prepared thee for it but go thou on in thy own way as i will in mine happiness consists in being pleased with what we do and if thou can find delight in being sad it will be as well for thee as if thou were merry though no other person should join to keep thee in countenance  i am nevertheless exceedingly disturbed at the ladys ill health it is entirely owing to the cursed arrest she was absolutely triumphant over me and the whole crew before thou believe me guiltless of that so i hope does she  the rest as i have often said is a common case only a little uncommonly circumstanced that is all why then all these severe things from her and thee  as to selling her clothes and her laces and so forth it has i own a shocking sound with it what an implacable as well as unjust set of wretches are those of her unkindredly kin who have money of hers in their hands as well as large arrears of her own estate yet withhold both avowedly to distress her but may she not have money of that proud and saucy friend of hers miss how more than she wants  and should i not be overjoyed think thou to serve her  what then is there in the parting with her apparel but female perverseness  and i am not sure whether i ought not to be glad if she does this out of spite to me  some disappointed fairones would have hanged some drowned themselves my beloved only revenges herself upon her clothes different ways of working has passion in different bosoms as humor and complexion induce  besides do think i shall grudge to replace to three times the value what she disposes of so jack there is no great matter in this  thou see how sensible she is of the soothings of the polite doctor this will enable thee to judge how dreadfully the horrid arrest and her gloomy fathers curse must have hurt her i have great hope if she will but see me that my behavior my contrition my soothings may have some happy effects upon her  but thou art too ready to give me up let me seriously tell thee that all excellence as she is i think the earnest interposition of my relations the implored mediation of that little fury miss how and the commissions thou actest under from myself are such instances of condescension and high value in them and such contrition in me that nothing farther can be done  so here let the matter rest for the present till she considers better of it  but now a few words upon poor beltons case i own i was at first a little startled at the infidelity of his thomasine her hypocrisy to be for so many years undetected  i have very lately had some intimations given me of her vileness and had intended to mention it to thee when i saw thee to say the truth i always suspected her eye the eye thou know is the casement at which the heart generally looks out many a woman who will not show herself at the door has tipped the sly the intelligible win from the windows  but tom had no management at all a very careless fellow would never look into his own affairs the estate his uncle left him was his ruin wife or mistress whoever was must have had his fortune to sport with  i have often hinted his weaknesses of this sort to him and the danger he was in of becoming the property of designing people but he hated to take pains he would ever run away from his accounts as now poor fellow he would be glad to do from himself had he not had a woman to fleece him his coachman or valet would have been his prime minister and done it as effectually  but yet for many years i thought she was true to his bed at least i thought the boys were his own for though they are muscular and bigboned yet i supposed the healthy mother might have furnished them with legs and shoulders for she is not of a delicate frame and then tom some years ago looked up and spoke more like a man than he has done of late squeaking inwardly poor fellow for some time past from contracted quailpipes and wheesing from lungs half spit away  he complains thou say that we all run away from him why after all belford it is no pleasant thing to see a poor fellow one loves dying by inches yet unable to do him good there are friendships which are only bottledeep i should be loath to have it thought that mine for any of my vassals is such a one yet to gay hearts which became intimate because they were gay the reason for their first intimacy ceasing the friendship will fade that sort of friendship i mean which may be distinguished more properly by the word companionship  but mine as i said is deeper than this i would still be as ready as ever i was in my life to the utmost of my power to do him service  as one instance of this my readiness to extricate him from all his difficulties as to thomasine do thou care to propose to him an expedient that is just come into my head  it is this i would engage thomasine and her cubs if belton be convinced they are neither of them his in a party of pleasure she was always complaisant to me it should be in a boat hired for the purpose to sail to tilbury to the isle of sheepy or a pleasuring up the medway and it is but contriving to turn the boat bottomupward i can swim like a fish another boat should be ready to take up whom i should direct for fear of the worst and then if tom has a mind to be decent one suit of mourning will serve for all three nay the hostlercousin may take his plunge from the steerage and who knows but they may be thrown up on the beach thomasine and he hand in hand  this thou wilt say is no common instance of friendship  mean time do thou prevail upon him to come down to us he never was more welcome in his life than he shall be now if he will not let him find me some other service and i will clap a pair of wings to my shoulders and he shall see me come flying in at his windows at the word of command  as for thy resolution of repenting and marrying i would have thee consider which thou will set about first if thou will follow my advice thou shall make short work of it let matrimony take place of the other for the thou will very possibly have repentance come tumbling in fast upon thee as a consequence and so have both i one  letter lv mr belford to robert lovelace esquire friday noon july    this morning i was admitted as soon as i sent up my name into the presence of the divine lady such i may call her as what i have to relate will fully prove  she had had a tolerable night and was much better in spirits though weak in person and visibly declining in looks  mrs lovick and mrs smith were with her and accused her in a gentle manner of having applied herself too assiduously to her pen for her strength having been up ever since five she said she had rested better the she had done for many nights she had found her spirit free and her mind tolerably easy and having as she had reason to think but a short time and much to do in it she must be a good housewife of her hours  she had been writing she said a letter to her sister but had not pleased herself in it though she had made two or three essays but that the last must go  by hints i had dropped from time to time she had reason she said to think that i knew everything that concerned her and her family and if so must be acquainted with the heavy curse her father had laid upon her which had been dreadfully fulfilled in one part as to her temporary prospects and that in a very short time which gave her great apprehensions for the other she had been applying herself to her sister to obtain a revocation of it i hope my father will revoke it said she or i shall be very miserable  yet and she gasped as she spoke with apprehension  i am ready to tremble at what the answer may be for my sister is hardhearted  i said something reflecting upon her friends as to what they would deserve to be thought of if the unmerited imprecation were not withdrawn  upon which she took me up and talked in such a dutiful manner of her parents as must doubly condemn them if they remain implacable for their inhuman treatment of such a daughter  she said i must not blame her parents it was her dear miss howes fault but what an enormity was there in her crime which could set the best of parents as they had been to her till she disobliged them in a bad light for resenting the rashness of a child from whose education they had reason to expect better fruits there were some hard circumstances in her case it was true but my friend could tell me that no one body throughout the whole fatal transaction had acted out of character but herself she submitted therefore to the penalty she had incurred if they had any fault it was only that they would not inform themselves of some circumstances which would alleviate a little her misdeed and that supposing her a guiltier creature than she was they punished her without a hearing  lord  i was going to curse thee lovelace how every instance of excellence in this allexcelling creature condemns thee  thou will have reason to think thyself of all men most accursed if she die  i then besought her while she was capable of such glorious instances of generosity and forgiveness to extend her goodness to a man whose heart bled in every vein of it for the injuries he had done her and who would make it the study of his whole life to repair them  the women would have withdrawn when the subject became so particular but she would not permit them to go she told me that if after this time i was for entering with so much earnestness into a subject so very disagreeable to her my visits must not be repeated nor was there occasion she said for my friendly offices in your favor since she had begun to write her whole mind upon that subject to miss how in answer to letters from her in which miss how urged the same arguments in compliment to the wishes of your noble and worthy relations  mean time you may let him know said she that i reject him with my whole heart  yet that although i say this with such a determination as shall leave no room for doubt however i say it not with passion on the contrary tell him that i am trying to bring my mind into such a frame as to be able to pity him poor perjured wretch what has he not to answer for and that i shall not think myself qualified for the state i am aspiring to if after a few struggles more i cannot forgive him too and i hope clasping her hands together uplifted as were her eyes my dear earthly father will set me the example my heavenly one has already set us all and by forgiving his fallen daughter teach her to forgive the man who then i hope will not have destroyed my eternal prospects as he has my temporal  stop here thou wretch  but i need not bid thee  for i can go no farther  letter lvi mr belford in continuation you will imagine how affecting her noble speech and behavior was to me at the time when the bare recollection and transcription obliged me to drop my pen the women had tears in their eyes i was silent for a few moments  at last matchless excellence inimitable goodness i called her with a voice so accented that i was halfashamed of myself as it was before the women  but who could stand such sublime generosity of soul in so young a creature her loveliness giving grace to all she said  methinks said i and i really in a manner involuntarily bent my knee i have before me an angel indeed i can hardly forbear prostration and to beg your influence to draw me after you to the world you are aspiring to  yet  but what shall i say  only dearest excellence make me in some small instances serviceable to you that i may if i survive you have the glory to think i was able to contribute to your satisfaction while among us  here i stopped she was silent i proceeded  have you no commission to employ me in deserted as you are by all your friends among strangers though i doubt not worthy people cannot i be serviceable by message by letterwriting by attending personally with either message or letter your father your uncles your brother your sister miss how lord m or the ladies his sisters any office to be employed in to serve you absolutely independent of my friends wishes or of my own wishes to oblige him think madam if i cannot  i thank you sir very heartily i thank you but in nothing that i can at present think of or at least resolve upon can you do me service i will see what return the letter i have written will bring me  till then   my life and my fortune interrupted i are devoted to your service permit me to observe that here you are without one natural friend and so much do i know of your unhappy case that you must be in a manner destitute of the means to make friends   she was going to interrupt me with a prohibitory kind of earnestness in her manner   i beg leave to proceed madam i have cast about twenty ways how to mention this before but never dared till now suffer me now that i have broke the ice to tender myself  as your banker only  i know you will not be obliged you need not you have sufficient of your own if it were in your hands and from that whether you live or die will i consent to be reimbursed i do assure you that the unhappy man shall never know either my offer or your acceptance  only permit me this small   and down behind her chair i dropped a bank note of  00 l which i had brought with me intending some how or other to leave it behind me nor should thou ever have known it had she favored me with the acceptance of it and so i told her  you give me great pain mr belford said she by these instances of your humanity and yet considering the company i have seen you in i am not sorry to find you capable of such methinks i am glad for the sake of human nature that there could be but one such man in the world as him you and i know  but as to your kind offer whatever it be if you take it not up you will greatly disturb me i have no need of your kindness i have effects enough which i never can want to supply my present occasions and if needful can have recourse to miss how i have promised that i would  so pray sir urge not upon me this favor  take it up yourself  if you mean me peace and ease of mind urge not this favor  and she spoke with impatience  i beg madam but one word   not one sir till you have taken back what you have let fall i doubt not either the honor or the kindness of your offer but you must not say one word more on this subject i cannot bear it  she was stooping but with pain i therefore prevented her and besought her to forgive me for a tender which i saw had been more discomposing to her than i had hoped from the purity of my intentions it would be but i could not bear to think that such a mind as hers should be distressed since the want of the conveniences she was used to abound in might affect and disturb her in the divine course she was in  you are very kind to me sir said she and very favorable in your opinion of me but i hope that i cannot now be easily put out of my present course my declining health will more and more confirm me in it those who arrested and conined me no doubt thought they had fallen upon the ready method to distress me so as to bring me into all their measures but i presume to hope that i have a mind that cannot be debased in essential instances by temporary calamities little do those poor wretches know of the force of innate principles forgive my own implied vanity was her word who imagine that a prison or penury or want can bring a rightturned mind to be guilty of a wilful baseness in order to avoid such shortlived evils  she then turned from me toward the window with a dignity suitable to her words and such as showed her to be more of soul than of body at that instant  what magnanimity  no wonder a virtue so solidly based could baffle all thy arts  and that it forced thee in order to carry thy accursed point to have recourse to those unnatural ones which robbed her of her charming senses  the women were extremely affected mrs lovick especially  who said whisperingly to mrs smith we have an angel not a woman with us mrs smith  i repeated my offers to write to any of her friends and told her that having taken the liberty to acquaint dr h with the cruel displeasure of her relations as what i presumed lay nearest her heart he had proposed to write himself to acquaint her friends how ill she was if she would not take it amiss  it was kind in the doctor she said but begged that no step of that sort might be taken without her knowledge and consent she would wait to see what effects her letter to her sister would have all she had to hope for was that her father would revoke his malediction for the rest her friends would think she could not suffer too much and she was content to suffer for now nothing could happen that could make her wish to live  mrs smith went down and soon returning asked if the lady and i would not dine with her that day for it yes her wedding day she had engaged mrs lovick see said and should have nobody else if we would do her that favor  the charming creature sighed and shook her head  wedding day repeated she  i wish you mrs smith many happy weddingdays  but you will excuse me  mr smith came up with the same request they both applied to me  on condition the lady would i should make no scruple and would suspend an engagement which i actually had  she then desired they would all sit down you have several times mrs lovick and mrs smith hinted your wishes that i would give you some little history of myself now if you are at leisure that this gentleman who i have reason to believe knows it all is present and can tell you if i give it justly or not i will oblige your curiosity  they all eagerly the man smith too sat down and she began an account of herself which i will endeavor to repeat as nearly in her own words as i possibly can for i know you will think it of importance to be apprised of her manner of relating your barbarity to her as well as what her sentiments are of it and what room there is for the hopes your friends have in your favor from her  at first when i took these lodgings said she i thought of staying but a short time in them and so mrs smith i told you i therefore avoided giving any other account of myself than that i was a very unhappy young creature seduced from good friends and escaped from very vile wretches  this account i thought myself obliged to give that you might the less wonder at seeing a young body rushing through your shop into your back apartment all trembling and out of breath an ordinary garb over my own craving lodging and protection only giving my bare word that you should be handsomely paid all my effects contained in a pockethandkerchief  my sudden absence for three days and nights together when arrested must still further surprise you and although this gentleman who perhaps knows more of the darker part of my story than i do myself has informed you as you mrs lovick tell me that i am only an unhappy not a guilty creature yet i think it incumbent upon me not to suffer honest minds to be in doubt about my character  you must know then that i have been in one instance i had like to have said but in one instance but that was a capital one an undutiful child to the most indulgent of parents for what some people call cruelty in them is owing but to the excess of their love and to their disappointment having had reason to expect better from me  i was visited at first with my friends connivance by a man of birth and fortune but of worse principles as it proved than i believed any man could have my brother a very headstrong young man was absent at that time and when he returned from an old grudge and knowing the gentleman it is plain better than i knew him entirely disapproved of his visits and having a great sway in our family brought other gentlemen to address me and at last several having been rejected he introduced one extremely disagreeable in every indifferent bodys eyes disagreeable i could not love him they all joined to compel me to have him a rencounter between the gentleman my friends were set against and my brother having confirmed them all his enemies  to be short i was conined and treated so very hardly that in a rash sit i appointed to go off with the man they hated a wicked intention you will say but i was greatly provoked nevertheless i repented and resolved not to go off with him yet i did not mistrust his honor to me neither nor his love because nobody thought me unworthy of the latter and my fortune was not to be despised but foolishly wickedly as my friends still think and contrivingly with a design as they imagine to abandon them giving him a private meeting i was tricked away poorly enough tricked away i must needs say though others who had been first guilty of so rash a step as the meeting of him was might have been so deceived and surprised as well as i  after remaining some time at a farmhouse in the country behaving to me all the time with honor he brought me to handsome lodgings in town till still better provision could be made for me but they proved to be as he indeed knew and designed at a vile a very vile creatures though it was long before i found her out to be so for i knew nothing of the town or its ways  there is no repeating what followed such unprecedented vile arts  for i gave him no opportunity to take me at any disreputable advantage   and here half covering her sweet face with her handkerchief put to her tearful eyes she stopped  hastily as if she would fly from the hateful remembrance she resumed  i made my escape afterward from the abominable house in his absence and came to yours and this gentleman has almost prevailed on me to think that the ungrateful man did not connive at the vile arrest which was made no doubt in order to get me once more to those wicked lodgings for nothing do i owe them except i were to pay them  she sighed and again wiped her charming eyes  adding in a softer lower voice  for being ruined   indeed madam said i guilty abominably guilty as he is in all the rest he is innocent of this last wicked outrage  well and so i wish him to be that evil heavy as it was is one of the slightest evils i have suffered but hence you will observe mrs lovick for you seemed this morning curious to know if i were not a wife that i never was married  you mr belford no doubt knew before that i am no wife and now i never will be one yet i bless god that i am not a guilty creature  as to my parentage i am of no mean family i have in my own right by the intended favor of my grandfather a fortune not contemptible independent of my father if i had pleased but i never will please  my father is very rich i went by another name when i came to you first but that was to avoid being discovered to the perfidious man who now engages by this gentleman not to molest me  my real name you now know to be harlowe clarissa harlowe i am not yet twenty years of age  i have an excellent mother as well as father a woman of family and fine sense  worthy of a better child  they both doated upon me  i have two good uncles men of great fortune jealous of the honor of their family which i have wounded  i was the joy of their hearts and with theirs and my fathers i had three houses to call my own for they used to have me with them by turns and almost kindly to quarrel for me so that i was two months in the year at ones house two months at the others six months at my fathers and two at the houses of others of my dear friends who thought themselves happy in me and whenever i was at any ones i was crowded upon with letters by all the rest who longed for my return to them  in short i was beloved by everybody the poor  i used to make glad their hearts i never shut my hand to any distress wherever i was  but now i am poor myself  so mrs smith so mrs lovick i am not married it is but just to tell you so and i am now as i ought to be in a state of humiliation and penitence for the rash step which has been followed by so much evil god i hope will forgive me as i am endeavoring to bring my mind to forgive all the world even the man who has ingratefully and by dreadful perjuries poor wretch he thought all his wickedness to be wit reduced to this a young creature who had his happiness in her view and in her wish even beyond this life and who was believed to be of rank and fortune and expectations considerable enough to make it the interest of any gentleman in england to be faithful to his vows to her but i cannot expect that my parents will forgive me my refuge must be death the most painful kind of which i would suffer rather than be the wife of one who could act by me as the man has acted upon whose birth education and honor i had so much reason to found better expectations  i see continued she that i who once was everyones delight am now the cause of grief to everyone  you that are strangers to me are moved for me it is kind  but it is time to stop your compassionate hearts mrs smith and mrs lovick are too much touched for the women sobbd again and the man was also affected it is barbarous in me with my woes thus to sadden your wedding day then turning to mr and mrs smith  may you see many happy ones honest good couple  how agreeable is it to see you both join so kindly to celebrate it after many years are gone over you  i once  but no more  all my prospects of felicity as to this life are at an end my hopes like opening buds or blossoms in an overforward spring have been nipt by a severe frost  blighted by an eastern wind  but i can but once die and if life be spared me but till i am discharged from a heavy malediction which my father in his wrath laid upon me and which is fulfilled literally in every article relating to this world it is all i have to wish for and death will be welcomer to me than rest to the most wearied traveller that ever reached his journeysend  and then she sunk her head against the back of her chair and hiding her face with her handkerchief endeavored to conceal her tears from us  not a soul of us could speak a word thy presence perhaps thou hardened wretch might have made us ashamed of a weakness which perhaps thou will deride me in particular for when thou read this   she retired to her chamber soon after and was forced it seems to lie down we all went down together and for an hour and half dwelt upon her praises mrs smith and mrs lovick repeatedly expressing their astonishment that there could be a man in the world capable of offending much more of wilfully injuring such a lady and repeating that they had an angel in their house  i thought they had and that as assuredly as there was a devil under the roof of good lord m  i hate thee heartily  by my faith i do  every hour i hate thee more than the former   j belford  letter lvii mr lovelace to john belford esquire sat july    what do hate me for belford  and why more and more  have i been guilty of any offense thou knew not before  if pathos can move such a heart as thine can it alter facts  did i not always do this incomparable creature as much justice as thou can do her for the heart of thee or as she can do herself  what nonsense then thy hatred thy augmented hatred when i still persist to marry her pursuant to word given to thee and to faith plighted to all my relations but hate if thou will so thou do but write thou can not hate me so much as i do myself and yet i know if thou really hatedst me thou would not venture to tell me so  well but after all what need of her history to these women she will certainly repent some time hence that she has thus needlessly exposed us both  sickness palls every appetite and makes us hate what we loved but renewed health changes the scene disposes us to be pleased with ourselves and then we are in a way to be pleased with everyone else every hope then rises upon us every hour presents itself to us on dancing feet and what mr addison says of liberty may with still greater propriety be said of health for what is liberty itself without health it makes the gloomy face of nature gay gives beauty to the sun and pleasure to the day and i rejoice that she is already so much better as to hold with strangers such a long and interesting conversation  strange confoundedly strange and as perverse that is to say as womanly as strange that she should refuse and sooner choose to die  o the obscene word and yet how free does thy pen make with it to me than be mine who offended her by acting in character while her parents acted shamefully out of theirs and when i am now willing to act out of my own to oblige her yet i not to be forgiven they to be faultless with her  and marriage the only medium to repair all breaches and to salve her own honor  surely thou must see the inconsistence of her forgiving unforgivingness as i may call it  yet heavy varlet as thou art thou want to be drawn up after her and what a figure do thou make with thy speeches stiff as hickmans ruffles with thy aspirations and prostrations  unused thy weak head to bear the sublimities that fall even in common conversation from the lips of this evercharming creature  but the prettiest whim of all was to drop the bank note behind her chair instead of presenting it on thy knees to her hand  to make such a lady as this doubly stoop  by the acceptance and to take it from the ground  what an ungraceful benefitconferrer art thou how awkward to take it into thy head that the best way of making a present to a lady was to throw the present behind her chair  i am very desirous to see what she has written to her sister what she is about to write to miss how and what return she will have from the harlowearabella can thou not form some scheme to come at the copies of these letters or at the substance of them at least and of that of her other correspondencies mrs lovick thou seem to say is a pious woman the lady having given such a particular history of herself will acquaint her with everything and art thou not about to reform  will not this consent of minds between thee and the widow what age is she jack the devil never trumpt up a friendship between a man and a woman of anything like years which did not end in matrimony or the dissipation of both their morals will not it strike out an intimacy between ye that may enable thee to gratify me in this particular a proselyte i can tell thee has great influence upon your good people such a one is a saint of their own creation and they will water and cultivate and cherish him as a plant of their own raising and this from a pride truly spiritual  but one consolation arises to me from the pretty regrets this admirable creature seems to have in indulging reflections on the peoples wedding day  i once  thou make her break off with saying  she once what  o belford why did thou not urge her to explain what she once hoped  what once a lady hopes in lovematters she always hopes while there is room for hope and are we not both single can she be any mans but mine will i be any womans but hers  i never will i never can  and i tell thee that i am every day every hour more and more in love with her and at this instant have a more vehement passion for her than ever i had in my life  and that with views absolutely honorable in her own sense of the word nor have i varied so much as in wish for this week past firmly fixed and wrought into my very nature as the life of honor or of generous confidence in me was in preference to the life of doubt and distrust that must be a life of doubt and distrust surely where the woman confides nothing and ties up a man for his good behavior for life taking church and state sanctions in aid of the obligation she imposes upon him  i shall go on monday morning to a kind of ball to which colonel ambrose has invited me it is given on a family account i care not on what for all that delights me in the thing is that mrs and miss how are to be there hickman of course for the old lady will not stir abroad without him the colonel is in hopes that miss arabella harlowe will be there likewise for all the fellows and women of fashion round him are invited  i fell in by accident with the colonel who i believe hardly thought i would accept of the invitation but he knows me not if he thinks i am ashamed to appear at any place where ladies dare show their faces yet he hinted to me that my name was up on miss harlowes account but to allude to one of my uncles phrases if it be i will not lie abed when anything joyous is going forward  as i shall go in my lords chariot i would have had one of my cousins montague to go with me but they both refused and i shant choose to take either of thy brethren it would look as if i thought i wanted a bodyguard besides one of them is too rough the other too smooth and too great a fop for some of the staid company that will be there and for me in particular men are known by their companions and a fop as tourville for example takes great pains to hang out a sign by his dress of what he has in his shop thou indeed art an exception dressing like a coxcomb yet a very clever fellow nevertheless so clumsy a beau that thou seem to me to owe thyself a double spite making thy ungracefulness appear the more ungraceful by thy remarkable tawdriness when thou art out of mourning  i remember when i first saw thee my mind labored with a strong puzzle whether i should put thee down for a great fool or a smatterer in wit something i saw was wrong in thee by thy dress if this fellow thought i delights not so much in ridicule that he will not spare himself he must be plaguey silly to take so much pains to make his ugliness more conspicuous than it would otherwise be  plain dress for an ordinary man or woman implies at least modesty and always procures kind quarter from the censorious who will ridicule a personal imperfection in one that seems conscious that it is an imperfection who ever said an anchoret was poor but to such as appear proud of their deformity or bestow tinsel upon it in hopes to set it off who would spare so very absurd a wronghead  but although i put on these lively airs i am sick at my soul  my whole heart is with my charmer with what indifference shall i look upon all the assemblee at the colonels my beloved in my ideal eye and engrossing my whole heart  letter lviii miss how to miss arabella harlowe thursday july  0 miss harlowe i cannot help acquainting you however it may be received as coming from me that

distinguish between a kind intention to you all that you might have the less to reproach yourselves with if a deplorable case should happen and an officiousness i owed you not by reason of freedoms at least reciprocal i will not for the unhappy bodys sake as you call a sister you have helped to make so say all that i could say if what i fear happen you shall hear whether desired or not all the mind of  anna how  letter lxi miss arabella harlowe to miss how friday july    miss ann how your pert letter i have received you that spare nobody i cannot expect should spare me you are very happy in a prudent and watchful mother  but else  mine cannot be exceeded in prudence but we had all too good an opinion of somebody to think watchfulness needful there may possibly be some reason why you are so much attached to her in an error of this flagrant nature  i help to make a sister unhappy  it is false miss  it is all her own doings  except indeed what she may owe to somebodys advice  you know who can best answer for that  let us know your mind as soon as you please as we shall know it to be your mind we shall judge what attention to give it that is all from etc  ar h  letter lxii miss how to miss arabella harlowe sat july    it may be the misfortune of some people to engage everybodys notice others may be the happier though they may be the more envious for nobodys thinking them worthy of any but one would be glad people had the sense to be thankful for that want of consequence which subjected them not to hazards they would hardly have been able to manage under  i own to you that had it not been for the prudent advice of that admirable somebody whose principal fault is the superiority of her talents and whose misfortune to be brotherd and sisterd by a couple of creatures who are not able to comprehend her excellencies i might at one time have been plunged into difficulties but pert as the superlatively pert may think me i thought not myself wiser because i was older nor for that poor reason qualified to prescribe to much less to maltreat a genius so outsoaring  i repeat it with gratitude that the dear creatures advice was of very great service to me  and this before my mothers watchfulness became necessary but how it would have fared with me i cannot say had i had a brother or sister who had deemed it their interest as well as a gratification of their sordid envy to misrepresent me  your admirable sister in effect saved you miss as well as me  with this difference  you against your will  me with mine and but for your own brother and his own sister would not have been lost herself  would to god both sisters had been obliged with their own wills  the most admirable of her sex would never then have been out of her fathers house  you miss  i dont know what had become of you  but let what would have happened you would have met with the humanity you have not shown whether you had deserved it or not  nor at worst lost either a kind sister or a pitying friend in the most excellent of sisters  but why run i into length to such a poor thing  why push i so weak an adversary whose first letter is all low malice and whose next is made up of falsehood and inconsistence as well as spite and illmanners yet i was willing to give you a part of my mind  call for more of it it shall be at your service from one who though she thanks god she is not your sister is not your enemy but that she is not the latter is withheld but by two considerations one that you bear though unworthily a relation to a sister so excellent the other that you are not of consequence enough to engage anything but the pity and contempt of  a h  letter lxiii mrs harlowe to mrs how sat july    dear madam i send you enclosed copies of five letters that have passed between miss how and my arabella you are a person of so much prudence and good sense and being a mother yourself can so well enter into the distresses of all our family upon the rashness and ingratitude of a child we once doated upon that i dare say you will not countenance the strange freedoms your daughter has taken with us all these are not the only ones we have to complain of but we were silent on the others as they did not as these have done spread themselves out upon paper we only beg that we may not be reflected upon by a young lady who knows not what we have suffered and do suffer by the rashness of a naughty creature who has brought ruin upon herself and disgrace upon a family which she has robbed of all comfort i offer not to prescribe to your known wisdom in this case but leave it to you to do as you think most proper  i am madam your most humble servant charl harlowe  letter lxiv mrs how in answer sat july    dear madam i am highly offended with my daughters letters to miss harlowe i knew nothing at all of her having taken such a liberty these young creatures have such romantic notions some of love some of friendship that there is no governing them in either nothing but time and dear experience will convince them of their absurdities in both i have chidden miss how very severely i had before so just a notion of what your whole familys distress must be that as i told your brother mr antony harlowe i had often forbid her corresponding with the poor fallen angel  for surely never did young lady more resemble what we imagine of angels both in person and mind but tired out with her headstrong ways i am sorry to say this of my own child i was forced to give way to it again and indeed so sturdy was she in her will that i was afraid it would end in a fit of sickness as too often it did in fits of sullens  none but parents know the trouble that children give they are happiest i have often thought who have none and these womengrown girls bless my heart how ungovernable   i believe however you will have no more such letters from my nancy i have been forced to use compulsion with her upon miss clarys illness and it seems she is very bad or she would have run away to london to attend upon her and this she calls doing the duty of a friend forgetting that she sacrifices to her romantic friendship her duty to a fond indulgent mother  there are a thousand excellencies in the poor sufferer notwithstanding her fault and if the hints she has given to my daughter be true she has been most grievously abused but i think your forgiveness and her fathers forgiveness of her ought to be all at your own choice and nobody should intermeddle in that for the sake of due authority in parents and besides as miss harlowe writes it was what everybody expected though miss clary would not believe it till she smarted for her credulity and for these reasons i offer not to plead anything in alleiation of her fault which is aggravated by her admirable sense and a judgment above her years  i am madam with compliments to good mr harlowe and all your afflicted family  your most humble servant annabella how i shall set out for the isle of wight in a few days with my daughter i will hasten our settingout on purpose to break her mind from her friends distresses which afflict us as much nearly as miss clarys rashness has done you    letter lxv miss how to miss clarissa harlowe sat july    my dearest friend we are busy in preparing for our little journey and voyage but i will be ill i will be very ill if i cannot hear you are better before i go  rogers greatly afflicted me by telling me the bad way you are in but now you have been able to hold a pen and as your sense is strong and clear i hope that the amusement you will receive from writing will make you better  i dispatch this by an extraordinary way that it may reach you time enough to move you to consider well before you absolutely decide upon the contents of mine of the   th on the subject of the two misses montagues visit to me since according to what you write must i answer them  in your last you conclude very positively that you will not be his to be sure he rather deserves an infamous death than such a wife but as i really believe him innocent of the arrest and as all his family are such earnest pleaders and will be guarantees for him i think the compliance with their entreaties and his own will be now the best step you can take your own family remaining implacable as i can assure you they do he is a man of sense and it is not impossible but he may make you a good husband and in time may become no bad man  my mother is entirely of my opinion and on friday pursuant to a hint i gave you in my last mr hickma had a conference with the strange wretch and though he liked not by any means his behavior to himself no indeed had reason to do so yet he is of opinion that he is sincerely determined to marry you if you will condescend to have him  perhaps mr hickman may make you a private visit before we set out if i may not attend you myself i shall not be easy except he does and he will then give you an account of the admirable character the surprising wretch gave of you and of the justice he does to your virtue  he was as acknowleging to his relations though to his own condemnation as his two cousins told me all that he apprehends as he said to mr hickman is that if you go on appealing your case and exposing him wedlock itself will not wipe off the dishonor to both and moreover that you would ruin your constitution by your immoderate sorrow and by seeking death when you might avoid it would not be able to escape it when you would wish to do so  so my dearest friend i charge you if you can to get over your aversion to this vile man you may yet live to see many happy days and be once more the delight of all your friends neighbors and acquaintance as well as a stay a comfort and a blessing to your anna how  i long to have your answer to mine of the   th pray keep

birth and marriage both in one the gentry all round the neighborhood are invited this time on some good news they have received from mrs ambroses brother the governor  my mother promised the colonel for me and herself in my absence i would fain have excused myself to her and the rather as i had exceptions on account of the day the   th of july miss clarissa harlowes anniversary birthday  but she is almost as young as her daughter and thinking it not so well to go without me she told me she could propose nothing that was agreeable to me and having had a few sparring blows with each other very lately i think i must comply for i dont love angling when i can help it though i seldom make it my study to avoid the occasion when it offers of itself i dont know if either were not a little afraid of the other whether it would be possible that we could live together  i all my father  my mamma  what  all my mother  what else should i say  o my dear how many things happen in this life to give us displeasure how few to give us joy  i am sure i shall have none on this occasion since the true partner of my heart the principal half of the one soul that it used to be said animated the pair of friends as we were called you my dear who used to irradiate every circle you set your foot into and to give me real significance in a second place to yourself cannot be there  one hour of your company

clarissa harlowe to miss how sunday july    what pain my dearest friend does your kind solicitude for my welfare give me how much more binding and tender are the ties of pure friendship and the union of like minds than the ties of nature well might the sweet singer of israel when he was carrying to the utmost extent the praises of the friendship between him and his beloved friend say that the love of jonathan to him was wonderful that it surpassed the love of women what an exalted idea does it give of the soul of jonathan sweetly attemperd for this sacred band if we may suppose it but equal to that of my anna how for her fallen clarissa but although i can glory in you kind love for me think my dear what concern  fill a mind not ungenerous when the obligation lies a on one side and when at the same time that your light is the brighter for my darkness i must give pain to a d friend to whom i delighted to give pleasure and  the same time discredit for supporting my blighted fa against the busy tongues of uncharitable censurers   this it is that makes me in the words of my admired exclaimer very little altered often repeat o  i were as in months past as in the days when god preserved me when his candle shined upon my he and when by his light i walked through darkness as i was in the days of my childhood  when the almighty was yet with me when i was in my fathers h when i washed my steps with butter and the ro poured me out rivers of oil  you set before me your reasons enforced by the opinion of your honored mother why i should think  mr lovelace for a husband see the preceding letter   and i have before me your letter of the   th see p     of this volume  cotaining the account of the visit and proposals and ki interposition of the two misses montague in the name of the good ladies sarah sadleir and betty lawrance and that of lord m  also yours of the   th see p     of this volume  demanding me as i may say of those ladies and of that family when i was so infamously and cruelly arrested and you knew not what was become of me  the answer likewise of those ladies signed in so full and so generous a manner by themselves see p      and by that nobleman and those two venerable ladies and in his light way by the wretch himself  these my dearest miss how and your letter of the   th see p      which came when i was under arrest and which i received not till some days after  are all before me  and i have as well weighed the whole matter and your arguments in support of your advice as at present my head and my heart will let me weigh them  i am moreover willing to believe not only from your own opinion but from the assurances of one of mr lovelaces friends mr belford a goodnatured and humane man who spares not to censure the author of my calamities  i think with undissembled and undesigning sincerity that that man is innocent of the disgraceful arrest  and even if you please in sincere compliment to your opinion and to that of mr hickman that overpersuaded by his friends and ashamed of his unmerited baseness to me he in earnest would marry me if i would have him  those parts of this letter which are marked with inverted commas thus  were transcribed afterward by miss how in a letter to the ladies of mr lovelaces family dated july    and are thus distinguished to avoid the necessity of repeating them when that letter comes to be inserted well and now what is the result of all  it is this  that i must abide by what i have already declared  and that is dont be angry at me my best friend that i have much more pleasure in thinking of death than of such a husband in short as i declared in my last that i cannot  forgive me if i say i will not  ever be his  but you will expect my reasons i know you will and if i give them not will conclude me either obstinate or implacable or both and those would be sad imputations if just to be laid to the charge of a person who thinks and talks of dying and yet to say that resentment and disappointment have no part in my determination would be saying a thing hardly to be credited for i own i have resentments strong resentments but not unreasonable ones as you will be convinced if already you are not so when you know all my story  if ever you do know it  for i begin to fear so many things more necessary to be thought of than either this man or my own vindication have i to do that i shall not have time to compass what i have intended and in a manner promised you see letter xxv p      i have one reason to give in support of my resolution that i believe yourself will allow of but having owned that i have resentments i will begin with those considerations in which anger and disappointment have too great a share in hopes that having once disburdend my mind upon paper and to my anna how of those corroding uneasy passions i shall prevent them for ever from returning to my heart and to have their place supplied by better milder and more agreeable ones  my pride then my dearest friend although a great deal mortified is not sufficiently mortified if it be necessary for me to submit to make that man my choice whose actions are and ought to be my abhorrence  what  shall i who have been treated with such premeditated and perfidious barbarity as is painful to be thought of and cannot with modesty be described think of taking the violator to my heart can i vow duty to one so wicked and hazard my salvation by joining myself to so great a profligate now i know him to be so do you think your clarissa harlowe so lost so sunk at least as that she could for the sake of patching up in the worlds eye a broken reputation meanly appear indebted to the generosity or compassion perhaps of a man who has by means so inhuman robbed her of it indeed my dear i should not think my penitence for the rash step i took any thing better than a specious delusion if i had not got above the least wish to have mr lovelace for my husband  yes i warrant i must creep to the violator and be thankful to him for doing me poor justice  do you not already see me pursuing the advice you give with a downcast eye appear before his friends and before my own supposing the latter would at last condescend to own me divested of that noble confidence which arises from a mind unconscious of having deserved reproach  do you not see me creep about my own house preferring all my honest maidens to myself  as if afraid too to open my lips either by way of reproof or admonition lest their bolder eyes should bid me look inward and not expect perfection from them  and shall i entitle the wretch to upbraid me with his generosity and his pity and perhaps to reproach me for having been capable of forgiving crimes of such a nature  i once indeed hoped little thinking him so premeditatedly vile a man that i might have the happiness to reclaim him i vainly believed that he loved me well enough to suffer my advice for his good and the example i humbly presumed i should be enabled to set him to have weight with him and the rather as he had no mean opinion of my morals and understanding but now what hope is there left for this my prime hope were i to marry him what a figure should i make preaching virtue and morality to a man whom i had trusted with opportunities to seduce me from all my own duties  and then supposing i were to have children by such a husband must it not think you cut a thoughtful person to the heart to look round upon her little family and think she had given them a father destined without a miracle to perdition and whose immoralities propagated among them by his vile example might too probably bring down a curse upon them and after all who knows but that my own sinful compliances with a man who would think himself entitled to my obedience might taint my own morals and make me instead of a reformer an imitator of him  for who can touch pitch and not be defiled  let me then repeat that i truly despise this man if i know my own heart indeed i do  i pity him  beneath my very pity as he is i nevertheless pity him  but this i could not do if i still loved him for my dear one must be greatly sensible of the baseness and ingratitude of those we love i love him not therefore my soul disdains communion with him  but although thus much is due to resentment yet have i not been so far carried away by its angry effects as to be rendered incapable of casting about what i ought to do and what could be done if the almighty in order to lengthen the time of my penitence were to bid me to live  the single life at such times has offered to me as the life the only life to be chosen but in that must i not now sit brooding over my past afflictions and mourning my faults till the hour of my release and would not everyone be able to assign the reason why clarissa harlowe chose solitude and to sequester herself from the world would not the look of every creature who beheld me appear as a reproach to me and would not my conscious eye confess my fault whether the eyes of others accused me or not one of my delights was to enter the cots of my poor neighbors to leave lessons to the boys and cautions to the elder girls and how should i be able unconscious and without pain to say to the latter fly the delusions of men who had been supposed to have run away with one  what then my dear and only friend can i wish for but death  and what after all is death it is but a cessation from mortal life it is but the finishing of an appointed course the refreshing inn after a fatiguing journey the end of a life of cares and troubles and if happy the beginning of a life of immortal happiness  if i die not now it may possibly happen that i may be taken when i am less prepared had i escaped the evils i labor under it might have been in the midst of some gay promising hope when my heart had beat high with the desire of life and when the vanity of this earth had taken hold of me  but now my dear for your satisfaction let me say that although i wish not for life yet would i not like a poor coward desert my post when i can maintain it and when it is my duty to maintain it  more than once indeed was i urged by thoughts so sinful but then it was in the height of my distress and once particularly i have reason to believe i saved myself by my desperation from the most shocking personal insults from a repetition as far as i know of his vileness the base women with so much reason dreaded by me present to intimidate me if not to assist him  o my dear you know not what i suffered on that occasion  nor do i what i escaped at the time if the wicked man had approached me to execute the horrid purposes of his vile heart high resolution a courage i never knew before a settled not a rash courage and such a command of my passions  i can only say i know not how i came by such an uncommon elevation of mind if it were not given me in answer to my earnest prayers to heaven for such a command of myself before i entered into the horrid company  as i am of opinion that it would have manifested more of revenge and despair than of principle had i committed a violence upon myself when the villainy was perpetrated so i should think it equally criminal were i now wilfully to neglect myself were i purposely to run into the arms of death as that man supposes i shall do when i might avoid it  nor my dear whatever are the suppositions of such a shortsighted such a lowsouled man must you impute to gloom to melancholy to despondency nor yet to a spirit of faulty pride or still more faulty revenge the resolution i have taken never to marry this and if not this any man so far from deserving this imputation i do assure you my dear and only love that i will do everything i can to prolong my life till god in mercy to me shall be pleased to call for it i have reason to think my punishment is but the due consequence of my fault and i will not run away from it but beg of heaven to sanctify it to me when appetite serves i will eat and drink what is sufficient to support nature a very little you know will do for that and whatever my physicians shall think fit to prescribe i will take though ever so disagreeable in short i will do everything i can do to convince all my friends who hereafter may think it worth their while to inquire after my last behavior that i possessed my soul with tolerable patience and endeavored to bear with a lot of my own drawing for thus in humble imitation of the sublimest exemplar i often say  lord it is thy will and it shall be mine thou art just in all thy dealings with the children of men and i know thou will not afflict me beyond what i can bear and if i can bear it i ought to bear it and thy grace assisting me i will bear it  but here my dear is another reason a reason that will convince you yourself that i ought not to think of wedlock but of a quite different preparation i am persuaded as much as that i am now alive that i shall not long live the strong sense i have ever had of my fault the loss of my reputation my disappointments the determined resentment of my friends aiding the barbarous usage i have met with where i least deserved it have seized upon my heart seized upon it before it was so well fortified by religious considerations as i hope it now is dont be concerned my dear  but i am sure if i may say it with as little presumption as grief in the words of job that god will soon dissolve my substance and bring me to death and to the house appointed for all living  and now my dearest friend you know all my mind and you will be pleased to write to the ladies of mr lovelaces family that i think myself infinitely obliged to them for their good opinion of me and that it has given me greater pleasure than i thought i had to come in this life that upon the little knowledge they have of me and that not personal i was thought worthy after the ill usage i have received of an alliance with their honorable family but that i can by no means think of their kinsman for a husband and do you my dear extract from the above such reasons as you think have any weight in them  i would write myself to acknowledge their favor had i not more employment for my head my heart and my fingers than i doubt they will be able to go through  i should be glad to know when you set out on your journey as also your little stages and your time of stay at your aunt harmans that my prayers may locally attend you whithersoever you go and wherever you are  clarissa harlowe  letter lxvii miss clarissa harlowe to miss how sunday july    the letter accompanying this being upon a very peculiar subject i would not embarass it as i may say with any other and yet having some further matters upon my mind which will want your excuse for directing them to you i hope the following lines will have that excuse  my good mrs norton so long ago as in a letter dated the  d of this month see p       of this volume hinted to me that my relations took amiss some severe things you was pleased in love to me to say of them mrs norton mentioned it with that respectful love which she bears to my dearest friend but wished for my sake that you would reinin a vivacity which on most other occasions so charmingly becomes you this was her sense you know that i am warranted to speak and write freer to my anna how than mrs norton would do  i durst not mention it to you at that time because appearances were so strong against me on mr lovelaces getting me again into his power after my escape to hamstead as made you very angry with me when you answered mine on my second escape and soon afterward i was put under that barbarous arrest so that i could not well touch upon that subject till now  now therefore my dearest miss how let me repeat my earnest request for this is not the first time by several that i have been obliged to chide you on this occasion that you will spare my parents and other relations in all your conversations about me  indeed i wish they had thought fit to take other measures with me but who shall judge for them  the event has justified them and condemned me they expected nothing good of this vile man he has not therefore deceived them but they expected other things from me and i have and they have the more reason to be set against me if as my aunt hervey wrote formerly see vol iii letter l p      they intended not to force my inclinations in favor of mr solmes and if they believe that my going off was the effect of choice and premeditation  i have no desire to be received to favor by them for why should i sit down to wish for what i have no reason to expect  besides i could not look them in the face if they would receive me indeed i could not all i have to hope for is first that my father will absolve me from his heavy malediction and next for a last blessing the obtaining of these favors are needful to my peace of mind  i have written to my sister but have only mentioned the absolution  i am afraid i shall receive a very harsh answer from her my fault in the eyes of my family is of so enormous a nature that my first application will hardly be encouraged then they know not nor perhaps will believe that i am so very ill as i am so that were i actually to die before they could have time to take the necessary informations you must not blame them too severely you must call it a fatality i know not what you must call it for alas i have made them as miserable as i am myself and yet sometimes i think that were they cheerfully to pronounce me forgiven i know not whether my concern for having offended them would not be augmented since i imagine that nothing can be more wounding to a spirit not ungenerous than a generous forgiveness  i hope your mamma will permit our correspondence for one month more although i do not take her advice as to having this man only for one month i will not desire it longer when catastrophes are consummating what changes changes that make ones heart shudder to think of may one short month produce  but if she will not  why then my dear it becomes us both to acquiesce  you cannot think what my apprehensions would have been had i known mr hickman was to have had a meeting on such a questioning occasion as must have been his errand from you with that haughty and uncontrollable man  you give me hope of a visit from him let him expect to see me greatly altered i know he loves me for he loves everyone whom you love a painful interview i doubt but i shall be glad to see a man whom you will one day and an early day i hope make happy and whose gentle manners and unbounded love for you will make you so if it be not your own fault  i am my dearest kindest friend the sweet companion of my happy hours the friend ever dearest and nearest to my fond heart  your equally obliged and faithful clarissa harlowe  letter lxviii mrs norton to miss clarissa harlowe monday july    excuse my dearest young lady my long silence i have been extremely ill my poor boy has also been at deaths door and when i hoped that he was better he has relapsed alas my dear he is very dangerously ill let us both have your prayers  very angry letters have passed between your sister and miss how everyone of your family is incensed against that young lady i wish you would remonstrate against her warmth since it can do no good for they will not believe but that her interposition has your connivance nor that you are so ill as miss how assures them you are  before she wrote they were going to send up young mr brand the clergyman to make private inquiries of your health and way of life  but now they are so exasperated that they have laid aside their intention  we have flying reports here and at harloweplace of some fresh insults which you have undergone and that you are about to put yourself into lady betty lawrances protection i believe they would now be glad as i should be that you would do so and this perhaps will make them suspend for the present any determination in your favor  how unhappy am i that the dangerous way my son is in prevents my attendance on you let me beg of you to write me word how you are both as to person and mind a servant of sir robert beachcroft who rides post on his masters business to town will present you with this and perhaps will bring me the favor of a few lines in return he will be obliged to stay in town several hours for an answer to his dispatches  this is the anniversary that used to give joy to as many as had the pleasure and honor of knowing you may the almighty bless you and grant that it may be the only unhappy one that may be ever known by you my dearest young lady and by  your everaffectionate judith norton  letter lxix miss clarissa harlowe to mrs norton monday night july    my dear mrs norton had i not fallen into fresh troubles which disabled me for several days from holding a pen i should not have forborne inquiring after your health and that of your son for i should have been but too ready to impute your own silence to the cause to which to my very great concern i find it was owing i pray to heaven my dear good friend to give you comfort in the way most desirable to yourself  i am exceedingly concerned at miss howes writing about me to my friends i do assure you that i was as ignorant of her intention so to do as of the contents of her letter nor has she yet let me know discouraged i suppose by her ill success that she did write impossible to share the delight which such charming spirits give without the inconvenience that will attend their volatility  so mixed are our best enjoyments  it was but yesterday that i wrote to chide the dear creature for freedoms of that nature which her unseasonable love for me had made her take as you wrote me word in your former i was afraid that all such freedoms would be attributed to me and i am sure that nothing but my own application to my friends and a full conviction of my contrition will procure me favor least of all can i expect that either your mediation or hers both of whose fond and partial love of me is so well known will avail me  she then gives a brief account of the arrest of her dejection under it of her apprehensions of being carried to her former lodgings of mr lovelaces avowed innocence as to that insult of her release by mr belford of mr lovelaces promise not to molest her of her clothes being sent her of the earnest desire of all his friends and of himself to marry her of miss howes advice to comply with their requests and of her declared resolution rather to die than be his sent to miss how to be given to his relations but as yesterday after which she thus proceeds now my dear mrs norton you will be surprised perhaps that i should have returned such an answer but when you have everything before you you who know me so well will not think me wrong and besides i am upon a better preparation than for an earthly husband  nor let it be imagined my dear and evervenerable friend that my present turn of mind proceeds from gloominess or melancholy for although it was brought on by disappointment the world showing me early even at my first rushing into it its true and ugly face yet i hope that it has obtained a better root and will every day more and more by its fruits demonstrate to me and to all my friends that it has  i have written to my sister last friday i wrote so the dye is thrown i hope for a gentle answer but perhaps they will not vouchsafe me any it is my first direct application you know i wish miss how had left me to my own workings in this tender point  it will be a great satisfaction to me to hear of your perfect recovery and that my fosterbrother is out of danger but why said i out of danger  when can this be justly said of creatures who hold by so uncertain a tenure this is one of those forms of common speech that proves the frailty and the presumption of poor mortals at the same time  dont be uneasy you cannot answer your wishes to be with me i am happier than i could have expected to be among mere strangers it was grievous at first but use reconciles everything to us the people of the house where i am are courteous and honest there is a widow who lodges in it have i not said so formerly a good woman who is the better for having been a proficient in the school of affliction  an excellent school my dear mrs norton in which we are taught to know ourselves to be able to compasonate and bear with one another and to look up to a better hope  i have as humane a physician whose fees are his least regard and as worthy an apothecary as ever patient was visited by my nurse is diligent obliging silent and sober so i am not unhappy without and within  i hope my dear mrs norton that i shall be every day more and more happy within  no doubt it would be one of the greatest comforts i could know to have you with me you who love me so dearly who have been the watchful sustainer of my helpless infancy you by whose precepts i have been so much benefited  in your dear bosom could i repose all my griefs and by your piety and experience in the ways of heaven should i be strengthened in what i am still to go through  but as it must not be i will acquiesce and so i hope will you for you see in what respects i am not unhappy and in those that i am they lie not in your power to remedy  then as i have told you i have all my clothes in my own possession so i am rich enough as to this world and in common conveniences  so you see my venerable and dear friend that i am not always turning the dark side of my prospects in order to move compassion a trick imputed to me too often by my hardhearted sister when if i know my own heart it is above all trick or artifice yet i hope at last i shall be so happy as to receive benefit rather than reproach from this talent if it be my talent at last i say for whose heart have i hitherto moved  not one i am sure that was not predetermined in my favor  as to the day  i have passed it as i ought to pass it  it has been a very heavy day to me  more for my friends sake too than for my own  how did they use to pass it  what a gala  how have they now passed it  to imagine it how grievous  say not that those are cruel who suffer so much for my fault and who for eighteen years together rejoiced in me and rejoiced me by their indulgent goodness  but i will think the rest  adieu my dearest mrs norton  adieu  letter lxx miss cl harlowe to miss arab harlowe friday july    if my dearest sister i did not think the state of my health very precarious and that it was my duty to take this step i should hardly have dared to approach you although but with my pen after having found your censures so dreadfully justified as they have been  i have not the courage to write to my father himself nor yet to my mother and it is with trembling that i address myself to you to beg of you to intercede for me that my father will have the goodness to revoke that heaviest part of the very heavy curse he laid upon me which relates to hereafter for as to the here i have indeed met with my punishment from the very wretch in whom i was supposed to place my confidence  as i hope not for restoration to favor i may be allowed to be very earnest on this head yet will i not use any arguments in support of my request because i am sure my father cannot wish to have his poor child miserable for ever  i have the most grateful sense of my mothers goodness in sending me up my clothes i would have acknowleged the favor the moment i received them with the most thankful duty but that i feared any line from me would be unacceptable  i would not give fresh offense so will decline all other commendations of duty and love appealing to my heart for both where both are flaming with an ardour that nothing but death can extinguish therefore only subscribe myself without so much as a name  my dear and happy sister your afflicted servant a letter directed for me at mr smiths a glover in king street covent garden will come to hand    letter lxxi mr belford to robert lovelace esquire  in answer to his letters number livelvii edgware monday july    what pains thou take to persuade thyself that the ladys ill health is owing to the vile arrest and to her friends implacableness both primarily if they were to be laid at thy door what poor excuses will good heads make for the evils they are put upon by bad hearts  but it is no wonder that he who can sit down premeditatedly to do a bad action will content himself with a bad excuse and yet what fools must he suppose the rest of the world to be if he imagines them as easily to be imposed upon as he can impose upon himself  in vain do thou impute to pride or wilfulness the necessity to which thou have reduced this lady of parting with her clothes for can she do otherwise and be the nobleminded creature she is  her implacable friends have refused her the current cash she left behind her and wished as her sister wrote to her to see her reduced to want probably therefore they will not be sorry that she is reduced to such streights and will take it for a justification from heaven of their wicked hardheartedness thou can not suppose she would take supplies from thee to take them from me would in her opinion be taking them from thee miss howes mother is an avaritious woman and perhaps the daughter could do nothing of that sort unknown to her and if she could is too noble a girl to deny it if charged and then miss harlowe is firmly of opinion that she shall never want nor wear the things she disposes of  having heard nothing from town that obliges me to go thither i shall gratify poor belton with my company till tomorrow or perhaps till wednesday for the unhappy man is more and more loath to part with me i shall soon set out for epsom to endeavor to serve him there and reinstate him in his own house poor fellow he is most horribly lowspirited mopes about and nothing diverts him i pity him at my heart but can do him no good  what consolation can i give him either from his past life or from his future prospects  our friendships and intimacies lovelace are only calculated for strong life and health when sickness comes we look round us and upon one another like frighted birds at the sight of a kite ready to souse upon them then with all our bravery what miserable wretches are we  thou tellest me that thou see reformation is coming swiftly upon me i hope it is i see so much difference in the behavior of this admirable woman in her illness and that of poor belton in his that it is plain to me the sinner is the real coward and the saint the true hero and sooner or later we shall all find it to be so if we are not cut off suddenly  the lady shut herself up at six oclock yesterday afternoon and intends not to see company till seven or eight this not even her nurse imposing upon herself a severe fast and why it is her birthday  blooming yet declining in her blossom  every birthday till this no doubt happy  what must be her reflections  what ought to be thine  what sport do thou make with my aspirations and my prostrations as thou call them and with my dropping of the bank note behind her chair i had too much awe of her at the time and too much apprehended her displeasure at the offer to make it with the grace that would better have become my intention but the action if awkward was modest indeed the fitter subject for ridicule with thee who can no more taste the beauty and delicacy of modest obligingness than of modest love for the same may be said of inviolable respect that the poet says of unfeigned affection  i speak i know not what  speak ever so and if i answer you i know not what it shows the more of love love is a child that talks in broken language yet then it speaks most plain the like may be pleaded in behalf of that modest respect which made the humble offerer afraid to invade the awful eye or the revered hand but aukwardly to drop its incense beside the altar it should have been laid upon but how should that soul which could treat delicacy itself brutally know anything of this  but i am still more amazed at thy courage to think of throwing thyself in the way of miss how and miss arabella harlowe  thou will not dare surely to carry this thought into execution  as to my dress and thy dress i have only to say that the sum total of thy observation is this that my outside is the worst of me and thine the best of thee and what gettest thou by the comparison do thou reform the one and i will try to mend the other i challenge thee to begin  mrs lovick gave me at my request the copy of a meditation she showed me which was extracted by the lady from the scriptures while under arrest at rowlands as appears by the date she is not to know that she has taken such a liberty  you and i always admired the noble simplicity and natural ease and dignity of style which are the distinguishing characteristics of these books whenever any passages from them by way of quotation in the works of other authors popt upon us and once i remember you even you observed that those passages always appeared to you like a rich vein of golden ore which runs through baser metals embellishing the work they were brought to authenticate  try lovelace if thou can relish a divine beauty i think it must strike transient if not permanent remorse into thy heart thou boastest of thy ingenuity let this be the test of it and whether thou can be serious on a subject so deep the occasion of it resulting from thyself  meditation saturday july    o that my grief were thoroughly weighed and my calamity laid in the balance together  for now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea therefore my words are swallowed up  for the arrows of the almighty are within me the poison whereof drinks up my spirit the terrors of god do set themselves in array against me  when i lie down i say when shall i arise when will the night be gone and i am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day  my days are swifter than a weavers shuttle and are spent without hope  mine eye shall no more see good  wherefore is light given to her that is in misery and life unto the bitter in soul  who longs for death but it comes not and diggeth for it more than for hid treasures  why is light given to one whose way is hid and whom god has hedged in  for the thing which i greatly feared is come upon me  i was not in safety neither had i rest neither was i quiet yet trouble came  o that my words were now written o that they were printed in a book that they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the book for ever  i have a little leisure and am in a scribbling vein indulge me lovelace a few reflections on these sacred books  we are taught to read the bible when children and as a rudiment only and as far as i know this may be the reason why we think ourselves above it when at a maturer age for you know that our parents as well as we wisely rate our proficiency by the books we are advanced to and not by our understanding what we have passed through but in my uncles illness i had the curiosity in some of my dull hours lighting upon one in his closet to dip into it and then i found where ever i turned that there were admirable things in it i have borrowed one on receiving from mrs lovick the above meditations for i had a mind to compare them by the book hardly believing they could be so exceedingly apposite as i find they are and one time or other it is very likely that i shall make a resolution to give it a thorough perusal by way of course as i may say  this mean time i will venture to repeat is certain that the style is that truly easy simple and natural one which we should admire in other authors excessively then all the world join in an opinion of its antiquity and authenticity too and the learned are fond of strengthening their different arguments by its sanctions indeed i was so much taken with it at my uncles that i was half ashamed that it appeared so new to me and yet i cannot but say that i have some of the old testament history as it is called in my head but perhaps am more obliged for it to josephus than to the bible itself  odd enough with all our pride of learning that we choose to derive the little we know from the undercurrents perhaps muddy ones too when the clear the pellucid fountainhead is much nearer at hand and easier to be come at  slighted the more possibly for that very reason  but man is a pragmatical foolish creature and the more we look into him the more we must despise him  lords of the creation  who can forbear indignant laughter when we see not one of the individuals of that creation except his perpetually excentric self but acts within its own natural and original appointments and all the time proud and vain as the conceited wretch is of fancied and selfdependent excellence he is obliged not only for the ornaments but for the necessaries of life that is to say for food as well as raiment to all the other creatures strutting with their blood and spirits in his veins and with their plumage on his back for what has he of his own but a very mischievous monkeylike bad nature yet thinks himself at liberty to kick and cuff and elbow out every worthier creature and when he has none of the animal creation to hunt down and abuse will make use of his power his strength or his wealth to oppress the less powerful and weaker of his own species  when you and i meet next let us enter more largely into this subject and i dare say we shall take it by turns in imitation of the two sages of antiquity to laugh and to weep at the thoughts of what miserable yet conceited beings men in general but we libertines in particular are  i fell upon a piece at dorrells this very evening entitled the sacred classics written by one blackwall  i took it home with me and had not read a dozen pages when i was convinced that i ought to be ashamed of myself to think how greatly i have admired less noble and less natural beauties in pagan authors while i have known nothing of this allexcelling collection of beauties the bible by my faith lovelace i shall for the future have a better opinion of the good sense and taste of half a score parsons whom i have fallen in with in my time and despised for magnifying as i thought they did the language and the sentiments to be found in it in preference to all the ancient poets and philosophers and this is now a convincing proof to me and shames as much an infidels presumption a his ignorance that those who know least are the greatest scoffers a pretty pack of wouldbewits of us who censure without knowledge laugh without reason and are most noisy and loud against things we know least of  letter lxxii mr belford to robert lovelace esquire wednesday july    i came not to town till this morning early poor belton clinging to me as a man destitute of all other hold  i hastened to smiths and had but a very indifferent account of the ladys health i sent up my compliments and she desired to see me in the afternoon  mrs lovick told me that after i went away on saturday she actually parted with one of her best suits of clothes to a gentlewoman who is her mrs lovicks benefactress and who bought them for a niece who is very speedily to be married and whom she fits out and portions as her intended heiress the lady was so jealous that the money might come from you or me that she would see the purchaser who owned to mrs lovick that she bought them for half their worth but yet though her conscience permitted her to take them at such an underrate the widow says her friend admired the lady as one of the loveliest of her sex and having been let into a little of her story could not help tears at taking away her purchase  she may be a good sort of woman mrs lovick says she is but self is an odious devil that reconciles to some people the most cruel and dishonest actions but nevertheless it is my opinion that those who can suffer themselves to take advantage of the necessities of their fellow creatures in order to buy any thing at a less rate than would allow them the legal interest of their purchasemoney supposing they purchase before they want are no better than robbers for the difference  to plunder a wreck and to rob at a fire are indeed higher degrees of wickedness but do not these as well as the others heighten the distresses of the distressed and heap more misery on the miserable whom it is the duty of every one to relieve  about three oclock i went again to smiths the lady was writing when i sent up my name but admitted of my visit i saw a visible alteration in her countenance for the worse and mrs lovick respectfully accusing her of too great assiduity to her pen early and late and of her abstinence the day before i took notice of the alteration and told her that her physician had greater hopes of her than she had of herself and i would take the liberty to say that despair of recovery allowed not room for cure  she said she neither despaired nor hoped then stepping to the glass with great composure my countenance says she is indeed an honest picture of my heart but the mind will run away with the body at any time  writing is all my diversion continued she and i have subjects that cannot be dispensed with as to my hours i have always been an early riser but now rest is less in my power than ever sleep has a long time ago quarrelled with me and will not be friends although i have made the first advances what will be must  she then stepped to her closet and brought to me a parcel sealed up with three seals be so kind said she as to give this to your friend a very grateful present it ought to be to him for sir this packet contains all his letters to me such letters they are as compared with his actions would reflect dishonor upon all his sex were they to fall into other hands  as to my letters to him they are not many he may either keep or destroy them as he pleases  i thought i ought not to forego this opportunity to plead for you i therefore with the packet in my hand urged all the arguments i could think of in your favor  she heard me out with more attention than i could have promised myself considering her determined resolution  i would not interrupt you mr belford said she though i am far from being pleased with the subject of your discourse the motives for your pleas in his favor are generous i love to see instances of generous friendship in either sex but i have written my full mind on this subject to miss how who will communicate it to the ladies of his family no more therefore i pray you upon a topic that may lead to disagreeable recriminations  her apothecary came in he advised her to the air and blamed her for so great an application as he was told she made to her pen and he gave it as the doctors opinion as well as his own that she would recover if she herself desired to recover and would use the means  the lady may indeed write too much for her health perhaps but i have observed on several occasions that when the physical men are at a loss what to prescribe they forbid their patients what they best like and are most diverted with  but nobleminded as they see this lady is they know not half her nobleness of mind nor how deeply she is wounded and depend too much upon her youth which i doubt will not do in this case and upon time which will not alleviate the woes of such a mind for having been bent upon doing good and upon reclaiming a libertine whom she loved she is disappointed in all her darling views and will never be able i fear to look up with satisfaction enough in herself to make life desirable to her for this lady had other views in living than the common ones of eating sleeping dressing visiting and those other fashionable amusements which fill up the time of most of her sex especially of those of it who think themselves fitted to shine in and adorn polite assemblies her grief in short seems to me to be of such a nature that time which alleviates most other persons afflictions will as the poet says give increase to hers  thou lovelace might have seen all this superior excellence as thou wentest along in every word in every sentiment in every action is it visible  but thy cursed inventions and intriguing spirit ran away with thee it is fit that the subject of thy wicked boast and of talents so egregiously misapplied should be thy punishment and thy curse  mr goddard took his leave and i was going to do so too when the maid came up and told her a gentleman was below who very earnestly inquired after her health and desired to see her his name hickman  she was overjoyed and bid the maid desire the gentleman to walk up  i would have withdrawn but i suppose she thought it was likely i should have met him upon the stairs and so she forbid it  she shot to the stairshead to receive him and taking his hand asked half a dozen questions without waiting for any answer in relation to miss howes health acknowleging in high terms her goodness in sending him to see her before she set out upon her little journey  he gave her a letter from that young lady which she put into her bosom saying she would read it byandby  he was visibly shocked to see how ill she looked  you look at me with concern mr hickman said sheoh sir times are strangely altered with me since i saw you last at my dear miss howes  what a cheerful creature was i then  my heart at rest my prospects charming and beloved by everybody  but i will not pain you  indeed madam said he i am grieved for you at my soul  he turned away his face with visible grief in it  her own eyes glistend but she turned to each of us presenting one to the other him to me as a gentleman truly deserving to be called so me to him as your friend indeed how was i at that instant ashamed of myself but nevertheless as a man of humanity detesting my friends baseness and desirous of doing her all manner of good offices  mr hickman received my civilities with a coldness which however was rather to be expected on your account than that it deserved exception on mine and the lady invited us both to breakfast with her in the morning he being obliged to return next day  i left them together and called upon mr dorrell my attorney to consult him upon poor beltons affairs and then went home and wrote thus far preparative to what may occur in my breakfastingvisit in the morning  letter lxxiii mr belford to robert lovelace esquire thursday july    i went this morning according to the ladys invitation to breakfast and found mr hickman with her  a good deal of heaviness and concern hung upon his countenance but he received me with more respect than he did yesterday which i presume was owing to the ladys favorable character of me  he spoke very little for i suppose they had all their talk out yesterday and before i came this morning  by the hints that dropped i perceived that miss howes letter gave an account of your interview with her at col ambroses  of your professions to miss how and miss howes opinion that marrying you was the only way now left to repair her wrongs  mr hickman as i also gathered had pressed her in miss howes name to let her find her on her return from the isle of wight at a neighboring farmhouse where neat apartments would be made ready to receive her she asked how long it would be before they returned and he told her it was proposed to be no more than a fortnight out and in upon which she said she should then perhaps have time to consider of that kind proposal  he had tendered her money from miss how but could not induce her to take any no wonder i was refused she only said that if she had occasion she would be obliged to nobody but miss how  mr goddard her apothecary came in before breakfast was over at her desire he sat down with us mr hickman asked him if he could give him any consolation in relation to miss harlowes recovery to carry down to a lady who loved her as she loved her own life  the lady said he will do very well if she will resolve upon it herself indeed you will madam the doctor is entirely of this opinion and has ordered nothing for you but weak jellies and innocent cordials lest you should starve yourself and let me tell you madam that so much watching so little nourishment and so much grief as you seem to indulge is enough to impair the most vigorous health and to wear out the strongest constitution  what sir said she can i do i have no appetite nothing you call nourishing will stay on my stomach i do what i can and have such kind directors in dr h and you that i should be inexcusable if i did not  i will give you a regimen madam replied he which i am sure the doctor will approve of and will make physic unnecessary in your case and that is go to rest at ten at night rise not till seven in the morning let your breakfast be water gruel or milkpottage or weak broths your dinner anything you like so you will but eat a dish of tea with milk in the afternoon and sagoe for your supper and my life for yours this diet and a months countryair will set you up  we were much pleased with the worthy gentlemans disinterested regimen and she said referring to her nurse who vouched for her pray mr hickman let miss how know the good hands i am in and as to the kind charge of the gentleman assure her that all i promised to her in the longest of my two last letters on the subject of my health i do and will to the utmost of my power observe i have engaged sir to mr goddard i have engaged sir to me to miss how to avoid all wilful neglects it would be an unpardonable fault and very ill become the character i would be glad to deserve or the temper of mind i wish my friends hereafter to think me mistress of if i did not  mr hickman and i went afterward to a neighboring coffeehouse and he gave me some account of your behavior at the ball on monday night and of your treatment of him in the conference he had with you before that which he represented in a more favorable light than you had done yourself and yet he gave his sentiments of you with great freedom but with the politeness of a gentleman  he told me how very determined the lady was against marrying you that she had early this morning set herself to write a letter to miss how in answer to one he brought her which he was to call for at twelve it being almost finished before he saw her at breakfast and that at three he proposed to set out on his return  he told me that miss how and her mother and himself were to begin their little journey for the isle of wight on monday next but that he must make the most favorable representation of miss harlowes bad health or they should have a very uneasy absence he expressed the pleasure he had in finding the lady in such good hands proposed to call on dr h to take his opinion whether it was likely she would recover and hoped he should find it favorable  as he was resolved to make the best of the matter and as the lady had refused to accept of money offered by mr hickman i said nothing of her parting with her clothes i thought it would serve no other end to mention it but to shock miss how for it has such a sound with it that a lady of her rank and fortune should be so reduced that i cannot myself think of it with patience nor know i but one man in the world who can  this gentleman is a little finical and formal but i think him an agreeable sensible man and not at all deserving of the treatment or the character you give him  but you are really a strange mortal because you have advantages in your person in your air and intellect above all the men i know and a face that would deceive the devil you cannot think any man else tolerable  it is upon this modest principle that thou deridest some of us who not having thy confidence in their outside appearance seek to hide their defects by the taylors and perukemakers assistance mistakenly enough if it be really done so absurdly as to expose them more and say that we do but hang out a sign in our dress of what we have in the shop of our minds this no doubt thou think is smartly observed but prythee lovelace tell me if thou can what sort of a sign must thou hang out were thou obliged to give us a clear idea by it of the furniture of thy mind  mr hickman tells me he should have been happy with miss how some weeks ago for all the settlements have been some time engrossed but that she will not marry she declares while her dear friend is so unhappy  this is truly a charming instance of the force of female friendship which you and i and our brother rakes have constantly ridiculed as a chimerical and impossible thing in ladies of equal age rank and perfections  but really lovelace i see more and more that there are not in the world with all our conceited pride narrowersould wretches than we rakes and libertines are and i will tell thee how it comes about  our early love of roguery makes us generally run away from instruction and so we become mere smatterers in the sciences we are put to learn and because we will know no more think there is no more to be known  with an infinite deal of vanity unreined imaginations and no judgments at all we next commence halfwits and then think we have the whole field of knowledge in possession and despise every one who takes more pains and is more serious than ourselves as phlegmatic stupid fellows who have no taste for the most poignant pleasures of life  this makes us insufferable to men of modesty and merit and obliges us to herd with those of our own cast and by this means we have no opportunities of seeing or conversing with anybody who could or would show us what we are and so we conclude that we are the cleverest fellows in the world and the only men of spirit in it and looking down with supercilious eyes on all who give not themselves the liberties we take imagine the world made for us and for us only  thus as to useful knowledge while others go to the bottom we only skim the surface are despised by people of solid sense of true honor and superior talents and shutting our eyes move round and round like so many blind mill horses in one narrow circle while we imagine we have all the world to range in  i threw myself in mr hickmans way on his return from the lady and we took a small repast at the lebecks head in chandosstreet  he was excessively moved at taking leave of her being afraid as he said to me though he would not tell her so that he should never see her again she charged him to represent everything to miss how in the most favorable light that the truth would bear  he told me of a tender passage at parting which was that having saluted her at her closetdoor he could not help once more taking the same liberty in a more fervent manner at the stairshead whither she accompanied him and this in the thought that it was the last time he should ever have that honor and offering to apologize for his freedom for he had pressed her to his heart with a vehemence that he could neither account for or resist  excuse you mr hickman that i will you are my brother and my friend and to show you that the good man who is to be happy with my beloved miss how is very dear to me you shall carry to her this token of my love offering her sweet face to his salute and pressing his hand between hers and perhaps her love of me will make it more agreeable to her than her punctilio would otherwise allow it to be and tell her said she dropping on one knee with clasped hands and uplifted eyes that in this posture you see me in the last moment of our parting begging a blessing upon you both and that you may be the delight and comfort of each other for many very many happy years  tears said he fell from my eyes i even sobbd with mingled joy and sorrow and she retreating as soon as i raised her i went down stairs highly dissatisfied with myself for going yet unable to stay my eyes fixed the contrary way to my feet as long as i could behold the skirts of her raiment  i went into the backshop continued the worthy man and recommended the angelic lady to the best care of mrs smith and when i was in the street cast my eye up at her window there for the last time i doubt said he that i shall ever behold her i saw her and she waved her charming hand to me and with such a look of smiling goodness and mingled concern as i cannot describe  prythee tell me thou vile lovelace if thou have not a notion even from these jejune descriptions of mine as i have from reflecting upon the occasion that there must be a more exalted pleasure in intellectual friendship than ever thou could taste in the grosser fumes of senssuality and whether it may not be possible for thee in time to give that preference to the infinitely preferable which i hope now that i shall always give  i will leave thee to make the most of this reflection from  thy true friend j belford  letter lxxiv miss how to miss clarissa harlowe tuesday july    your two affecting letters were brought to me as i had directed any letter from you should be to the colonels about an hour before we broke up i could not forbear dipping into them there and shedding more tears over them than i will tell you of although i dried my eyes as well as i could that the company i was obliged to return to and my mamma should see as little of my concern as possible  i am yet and was then still more excessively fluttered the occasion i will communicate to you byandby for nothing but the flutters given by the stroke of death could divert my first attention from the sad and solemn contents of your last favor these therefore i must begin with  how can i bear the thoughts of losing so dear a friend i will not so much as suppose it indeed i cannot such a mind as yours was not vested in humanity to be snatched away from us so soon there must be still a great deal for you to do for the good of all who have the happiness to know you  you enumerate in your letter of thursday last letter l p      the particulars in which your situation is already mended let me see by effects that you are in earnest in that enumeration and that you really have the courage to resolve to get above the sense of injuries you could not avoid and then will i trust to providence and my humble prayers for your perfect recovery and glad at my heart shall i be on my return from the little island to find you well enough to be near us according to the proposal mr hickman has to make you  you chide me in yours of sunday on the freedom i take with your friends see p       i may be warm i know i am  too warm  yet warmth in friendship surely cannot be a crime especially when our friend has great merit labors under oppression and is struggling with undeserved calamity  i have no notion of coldness in friendship be it dignified or distinguished by the name of prudence or what it will  you may excuse your relations it was ever your way to do so but my dear other people must be allowed to judge as they please i am not their daughter nor the sister of your brother and sister  i thank heaven i am not  but if you are displeased with me for the freedoms i took so long ago as you mention i am afraid if you knew what passed upon an application i made to your sister very lately to procure you the absolution your heart is so much set upon that you would be still more concerned but they have been even with me but i must not tell you all i hope however that these unforgivers my mother is among them were always good dutiful passive children to their parents  once more forgive me i owned i was too warm but i have no example to the contrary but from you and the treatment you meet with is very little encouragement to me to endeavor to imitate you in your dutiful meekness  you leave it to me to give a negative to the hopes of the noble family whose only disgrace is that so very vile a man is so nearly related to them but yet  alas my dear i am so fearful of consequences of selfishly fearful if this negative must be given  i dont know what i should say  but give me leave to suspend however this negative till i hear from you again  their earnest courtship of you into their splendid family is so very honorable to you  they so justly admire you  you must have had such a noble triumph over the base man  he is so much in earnest  the world knows so much of the unhappy affair  you may do still so much good  your will is so inviolate  your relations are so implacable  think my dear and rethink  and let me leave you to do so while i give you the occasion of the flutter i mentioned at the beginning of this letter in the conclusion of which you will find the obligation i have consented to lay myself under to refer this important point once more to your discussion before i give in your name the negative that cannot when given be with honor to yourself repented of or recalled  know then my dear that i accompanied my mother to colonel ambroses on the occasion i mentioned to you in my former many ladies and gentlemen were there whom you know particularly miss kitty doily miss lloyd miss biddy dollyffe miss biddulph and their respective admirers with the colonels two nieces fine women both besides many whom you know not for they were strangers to me but by name a splendid company and all pleased with one another till colonel ambrose introduced one who the moment he was brought into the great hall set the whole assemblee into a kind of agitation  it was your villain  i thought i should have sunk as soon as i set my eyes upon him my mother was also affected and coming to me nancy whispered she can you bear the sight of that wretch without too much emotion  if not withdraw into the next apartment  i could not remove everybodys eyes were glanced from him to me i sat down and fanned myself and was forced to order a glass of water o that i had the eye the basilisk is reported to have thought i and that his life were within the power of it  directly would i kill him  he entered with an air so hateful to me but so agreeable to every other eye that i could have looked him dead for that too  after the general salutations he singled out mr hickman and told him he had recollected some parts of his behavior to him when he saw him last which had made him think himself under obligation to his patience and politeness  and so indeed he was  miss doily upon his complimenting her among a knot of ladies asked him in their hearing how miss clarissa harlowe did  he heard he said you were not so well as he wished you to be and as you deserved to be  o mr lovelace said she what have you to answer for on that young ladys account if all be true that i have heard  i have a great deal to answer for said the unblushing villain but that dear lady has so many excellencies and so much delicay that little sins are great ones in her eye  little sins replied the lady mr lovelaces character is so well known that nobody believes he can commit little sins  you are very good to me miss doily  indeed i am not  then i am the only person to whom you are not very good and so i am the less obliged to you  he turned with an unconcerned air to miss playford and made her some genteel compliments i believe you know her not she visits his cousins montague indeed he had something in his specious manner to say to everybody and this too soon quieted the disgust each person had at his entrance  i still kept my seat and he either saw me not or would not yet see me and addressing himself to my mother taking her unwilling hand with an air of high assurance i am glad to see you here madam i hope miss how is well i have reason to complain greatly of her but hope to owe to her the highest obligations that can be laid on man  my daughter sir is accustomed to be too warm and too zealous in her friendships for either my tranquillity or her own  there had indeed been some late occasion given for mutual displeasure between my mother and me but i think she might have spared this to him though nobody heard it i believe but the person to whom it was spoken and the lady who told it to me for my mother spoke it low  we are not wholly madam to live for ourselves said the vile hypocrite it is not everyone who has a soul capable of friendship and what a heart must that be which can be insensible to the interests of a suffering friend  this sentiment from mr lovelaces mouth said my mother  forgive me sir but you can have no end surely in endeavoring to make me think as well of you as some innocent creatures have thought of you to their cost  she would have flung from him but detaining her hand  less severe dear madam said he be less severe in this place i beseech you you will allow that a very faulty person may see his errors and when he does and owns them and repents should he not be treated mercifully  your air sir seems not to be that of a penitent but the place may as properly excuse this subject as what you call my severity  but dearest madam permit me to say that i hope for your interest with your charming daughter was his sycophant world to have it put into my power to convince all the world that there never was a truer penitent and why why this anger dear madam for she struggled to get her hand out of his these violent airs so maidenly  impudent fellow  may i not ask if miss how be here  she would not have been here replied my mother had she known whom she had been to see  and is she here then  thank heaven  he disengaged her hand and stepped forward into company  dear miss lloyd said he with an air taking her hand as he quitted my mothers tell me tell me is miss arabella harlowe here or will she be here i was informed she would and this and the opportunity of paying my compliments to your friend miss how were great inducements with me to attend the colonel  superlative assurance was it not my dear  miss arabella harlowe excuse me sir said miss lloyd would be very little inclined to meet you here or anywhere else  perhaps so my dear miss lloyd but perhaps for that very reason i am more desirous to see her  miss harlowe sir said miss biddulph with a threatening air will hardly be here without her brother i imagine if one come both will come  heaven grant they both may said the wretch nothing miss biddulph shall begin from me to disturb this assemblee i assure you if they do one calm halfhours conversation with that brother and sister would be a most fortunate opportunity to me in presence of the colonel and his lady or whom else they should choose  then turning round as if desirous to find out the one or the other or both he spied me and with a very low bow approached me  i was all in a flutter you may suppose he would have taken my hand i refused it all glowing with indignation everybodys eyes upon us  i went from him to the other end of the room and sat down as i thought out of his hated sight but presently i heard his odious voice whispering behind my chair he leaning upon the back of it with impudent unconcern charming miss how looking over my shoulder one request  i started up from my seat but could hardly stand neither for very indignation  o this sweet but becoming disdain whispered on the insufferable creature  i am sorry to give you all this emotion but either here or at your own house let me entreat from you one quarter of an hours audience  i beseech you madam but one quarter of an hour in any of the adjoining apartments  not for a kingdom fluttering my fan  i knew not what i did  but i could have killed him  we are so much observed  else on my knees my dear miss how would i beg your interest with your charming friend  she will have nothing to say to you  i had not then your letters my dear  killing words  but indeed i have deserved them and a dagger in my heart besides  i am so conscious of my demerits that i have no hope but in your interposition  could i owe that favor to miss howes mediation which i cannot hope for on any other account   my mediation vilest of men  my mediation  i abhor you  from my soul i abhor you vilest of men  three or four times i repeated these words stammering too  i was excessively fluttered  you can call me nothing madam so bad as i will call myself  i have been indeed the vilest of men  but now i am not so  permit me everybodys eyes upon us but one moments audience  to exchange but ten words with you dearest miss how  in whose presence you please  for your dear friends sake  but ten words with you in the next apartment  it is an insult upon me to presume that i would exchange one with you if i could help it  out of my way and my sight fellow  and away i would have flung but he took my hand i was excessively disordered  everybodys eyes more and more intent upon us  mr hickman whom my mother had drawn on one side to injoin him a patience which perhaps need not to have been enforced came up just then with my mother who had him by his leadingstrings  by his sleeve i should say  mr hickman said the bold wretch be my advocate but for ten words in the next apartment with miss how in your presence and in yours madam to my mother  hear nancy what he has to say to you to get rid of him hear his ten words  excuse me madam his very breath  unhand me sir  he sighed and looked  o how the practiced villain sighed and looked he then let go my hand with such a reverence in his manner as brought blame upon me from some that i would not hear him  and this incensed me the more o my dear this man is a devil  this man is indeed a devil  so much patience when he pleases so much gentleness  yet so resolute so persisting so audacious  i was going out of the assemblee in great disorder he was at the door as soon as i  how kind this is said the wretch and ready to follow me opened the door for me  i turned back upon this and not knowing what i did snappd my fan just in his face as he turned short upon me and the powder flew from his wig  everybody seemed as much pleased as i was vexed  he turned to mr hickman nettled at the powder flying and at the smiles of the company upon him mr hickman you will be one of the happiest men in the world because you are a good man and will do nothing to provoke this passionate lady and because she has too much good sense to be provoked without reason but else the lord have mercy upon you  this man this mr hickman my dear is too meek for a man indeed he is  but my patient mother twits me that her passionate daughter ought to like him the better for that but meek men abroad are not always meek men at home i have observed that in more instances than one and if they were i should not i verily think like them the better for being so  he then turned to my mother resolved to be even with her too where good madam could miss get all this spirit  the company round smiled for i need not tell you that my mothers highspiritedness is pretty well known and she sadly vexed said sir you treat me as you do the rest of the world  but   i beg pardon madam interrupted he i might have spared my question  and instantly i retiring to the other end of the hall he turned to miss playford what would i give miss to hear you sing that song you obliged us with at lord ms  he then as if nothing had happened fell into a conversation with her and miss dollyffe upon music and whisperingly sung to miss playford holding her two hands with such airs of genteel unconcern that it vexed me not a little to look round and see how pleased half the giddy fools of our sex were with him notwithstanding his notorious wicked character  to this it is that such vile fellows owe much of their vileness whereas if they found themselves shunned and despised and treated as beasts of prey as they are they would run to their caverns there howl by themselves and none but such as sad accident or unpitiable presumption threw in their way would suffer by them  he afterward talked very seriously at times to mr hickman at times i say for it was with such breaks and starts of gaiety turning to this lady and to that and then to mr hickman again resuming a serious or a gay air at pleasure that he took everybodys eye the womens especially who were full of their whispering admirations of him qualified with ifs and buts and what pitys and such sort of stuff that showed in their very dispraises too much liking  well may our sex be the sport and ridicule of such libertines unthinking eyegoverned creatures  would not a little reflection teach us that a man of merit must be a man of modesty because a diffident one and that such a wretch as this must have taken his degrees in wickedness and gone through a course of vileness before he could arrive at this impenetrable effrontery an effrontery which can proceed only from the light opinion he has of us and the high one of himself  but our sex are generally modest and bashful themselves and are too apt to consider that which in the main is their principal grace as a defect and finely do they judge when they think of supplying that defect by choosing a man who cannot be ashamed  his discourse to mr hickman turned upon you and his acknowleged injuries of you though he could so lightly start from the subject and return to it  i have no patience with such a devil  man he cannot be called to be sure he would behave in the same manner anywhere or in any presence even at the altar itself if a lady were with him there  it shall ever be a rule with me that he who does not regard a woman with some degree of reverence will look upon her and occasionally treat her with contempt  he had the confidence to offer to take me out but i absolutely refused him and shunned him all i could putting on the most contemptuous airs but nothing could mortify him  i wished twenty times i had not been there  the gentlemen were as ready as i to wish he had broken his neck rather than been present i believe for nobody was regarded but him so little of the fop yet so elegant and rich in his dress his person so specious his manner so intrepid so much meaning and penetration in his face so much gaiety yet so little of the monkey though a traveled gentleman yet no affectation no mere toupetman but all manly and his courage and wit the one so known the other so dreaded you must think the petitsmaitres of which there were four or five present were most deplorably off in his company and one grave gentleman observed to me pleased to see me shun him as i did that the poets observation was too true that the generality of ladies were rakes in their hearts or they could not be so much taken with a man who had so notorious a character  i told him the reflection both of the poet and applier was much too general and made with more ill nature than good manners  when the wretch saw how industriously i avoided him shifting from one part of the hall to another he at last boldly stepped up to me as my mother and mr hickman were talking to me and thus before them accosted me  i beg your pardon madam but by your mothers leave i must have a few moments conversation with you either here or at your own house and i beg you will give me the opportunity  nancy said my mother hear what he has to say to you in my presence you may and better in the adjoining apartment if it must be than to come to you at our own house  i retired to one corner of the hall my mother following me and he taking mr hickman under the arm following her  well sir said i what have you to say  tell me here  i have been telling mr hickman said he how much i am concerned for the injuries i have done to the most excellent woman in the world and yet that she obtained such a glorious triumph over me the last time i had the honor to see her as with my penitence ought to have qualified her former resentments but that i will with all my soul enter into any measures to obtain her forgiveness of me my cousins montague have told you this lady betty and lady sarah and my lord m are engaged for my honor i know your power with the dear creature my cousins told me you gave them hopes you would use it in my behalf my lord m and his two sisters are impatiently expecting the fruits of it you must have heard from her before now i hope you have and will you be so good as to tell me if i may have any hopes  if i must speak on this subject let me tell you that you have broken her heart you know not the value of the lady you have injured you deserve her not and she despises you as she ought  dear miss how mingle not passion with denunciations so severe i must know my fate i will go abroad once more if i find her absolutely irreconcilable but i hope she will give me leave to attend upon her to know my doom from her own mouth  it would be death immediate for her to see you and what must you be to be able to look her in the face  i then reproached him with vehemence enough you may believe on his baseness and the evils he had made you suffer the distress he had reduced you to all your friends made your enemies the vile house he had carried you to hinted at his villainous arts the dreadful arrest and told him of your present deplorable illness and resolution to die rather than have him  he vindicated not any part of his conduct but that of the arrest and so solemnly protested his sorrow for his usage of you accusing himself in the freest manner and by deserved appellations that i promised to lay before you this part of our conversation and now you have it  my mother as well as mr hickman believes from what passed on this occasion that he is touched in conscience for the wrongs he has done you but by his whole behavior i must own it seems to me that nothing can touch him for half an hour together yet i have no doubt that he would willingly marry you and it piques his pride i could see that he should be denied as it did mine that such a wretch had dared to think it in his power to have such a woman whenever he pleased and that it must be accounted a condescension and matter of obligation by all his own family at least that he would vouchsafe to think of marriage  now my dear you have the reason before you why i suspend the decisive negative to the ladies of his family my mother miss lloyd and miss biddulph who were inquisitive after the subject of our retired conversation and whose curiosity i thought it was right in some degree to gratify especially as those young ladies are of our select acquaintance are all of opinion that you should be his  you will let mr hickman know your whole mind and when he acquaints me with it i will tell you all my own  mean time may the news he will bring me of the state of your health be favorable prays with the utmost fervency  your everfaithful and affectionate anna how  letter lxxv miss clarissa harlowe to miss how thursday july    my dearest miss how after i have thankfully acknowleged your favor in sending mr hickman to visit me before you set out upon your intended journey i must chide you in the sincerity of that faithful love which could not be the love it is if it would not admit of that cementing freedom for suspending the decisive negative which upon such full deliberation i had entreated you to give to mr lovelaces relations  i am sorry that i am obliged to repeat to you my dear who know me so well that were i sure i should live many years i would not have mr lovelace much less can i think of him as it is probable i may not live one  as to the world and its censures you know my dear that however desirous i always was of a fair fame yet i never thought it right to give more than a second place to the worlds opinion the challenges made to mr lovelace by miss doily in public company are a fresh proof that i have lost my reputation and what advantage would it be to me were it retrievable and were i to live long if i could not acquit myself to myself  having in my former said so much on the freedoms you have taken with my friends i shall say the less now but your hint that something else has newly passed between some of them and you gives me great concern and that as well for my own sake as for theirs since it must necessarily incense them against me i wish my dear that i had been left to my own course on an occasion so vry interesting to myself but since what is done cannot be helped i must abide the consequences yet i dread more than before what may be my sisters answer if an answer be at all vouchsafed  will you give me leave my dear to close this subject with one remark  it is this that my beloved friend in points where her own laudable zeal is concerned has ever seemed more ready to fly from the rebuke than the fault if you will excuse this freedom i will acknowledge thus far in favor of your way of thinking as to the conduct of some parents in these nice cases that indiscreet opposition does frequently as much mischief as giddy love  as to the invitation you are so kind as to give me to remove privately into your neighborhood i have told mr hickman that i will consider of it but believe if you will be so good as to excuse me that i shall not accept of it even should i be able to remove i will give you my reasons for declining it and so i ought when both my love and my gratitude would make a visit nowandthen from my dear miss how the most consolatory thing in the world to me  you must know then that this great town wicked as i is wants not opportunities of being better having daily prayers at several churches in it and i am desirous as my strength will admit to embrace those opportunities the method i have proposed to myself and was beginning to practice when that cruel arrest deprived me both of freedom and strength is this when i was disposed to gentle exercise i took a chair to st dunstans church in fleet street where are prayers at seven in the morning i proposed if the weather favored to walk if not to take chair to lincolns end chapel where at eleven in the morning and at five in the afternoon are the same desirable opportunities and at other times to go no farther that covent garden church where are early morning prayers likewise  this method pursued i doubt not will greatly help as it has already done to calm my disturbed thoughts and to bring me to that perfect resignation which i aspire after for i must own my dear that sometimes still my griefs and my reflections are too heavy for me and a the aid i can draw from religious duties is hardly sufficien to support my staggering reason i am a very young creature you know my dear to be left to my own conduct in such circumstances as i am in  another reason why i choose not to go down into your neighborhood is the displeasure that might arise on my account between your mother and you  if indeed you were actually married and the worthy man who would then have a title to all your regard were earnestly desirous of my near neighborhood i know not what i might do for although i might not perhaps intend to give up my other important reasons at the time i should make you a congratulatory visit yet i might not know how to deny myself the pleasure of continuing near you when there  i send you enclosed the copy of my letter to my sister i hope it will be thought to be written with a true penitent spirit for indeed it is i desire that you will not think i stoop too low in it since there can be no such thing as that in a child to parents whom she has unhappily offended  but if still perhaps more disgusted than before at your freedom with them they should pass it by with the contempt of silence for i have not yet been favored with an answer i must learn to think it right in them so to do especially as it is my first direct application for i have often censured the boldness of those who applying for a favor which it is in a persons option to grant or to refuse take the liberty of being offended if they are not gratified as if the petitionedto had not as good a right to reject as the petitioner to ask  but if my letter should be answered and that in such terms as will make me loath to communicate it to so warm a friend  you must not my dear take upon you to censure my relations but allow for them as they know not what i have suffered as being filled with just resentments against me  just to them if they think them just and as not being able to judge of the reality of my penitence  and after all what can they do for me  they can only pity me and what will that do but augment their own grief to which at present their resentment is an alleviation for can they by their pity restore to me my lost reputation can they by it purchase a sponge that will wipe out from the year the past fatal five months of my life she takes in the time that she appointed to meet mr lovelace   your account of the gay unconcerned behavior of mr lovelace at the colonels does not surprise me at all after i am told that he had the intrepidity to go thither knowing who were invited and expected  only this my dear i really wonder at that miss how could imagine that i could have a thought of such a man for a husband  poor wretch i pity him to see him fluttering about abusing talents that were given him for excellent purposes taking courage for wit and dancing fearless of danger on the edge of a precipice  but indeed his threatening to see me most sensibly alarms and shocks me i cannot but hope that i never never more shall see him in this world  since you are so loath my dear to send the desired negative to the ladies of his family i will only trouble you to transmit the letter i shall enclose for that purpose directed indeed to yourself because it was to you that those ladies applied themselves on this occasion but to be sent by you to any one of the ladies at your own choice  i commend myself my dearest miss how to your prayers and conclude with repeated thanks for sending mr hickman to me and with wishes for your health and happiness and for the speedy celebration of your nuptials  your everaffectionate and obliged clarissa harlowe  letter lxxvi miss clarissa harlowe to miss how  enclosed in the preceding thursday july    my dearest miss how since you seem loath to acquiesce in my determined resolution signified to you as soon as i was able to hold a pen i beg the favor of you by this or by any other way you think most proper to acquaint the worthy ladies who have applied to you in behalf of their relation that although i am infinitely obliged to their generous opinion of me yet i cannot consent to sanctify as i may say mr lovelaces repeated breaches of all moral sanctions and hazard my future happiness by an union with a man through whose premeditated injuries in a long train of the basest contrivances i have forfeited my temporal hopes  he himself when he reflects upon his own actions must surely bear testimony to the justice as well as fitness of my determination the ladies i dare say would were they to know the whole of my unhappy story  be pleased to acquaint them that i deceive myself if my resolution on this head however ingratefully and even inhumanly he has treated me be not owing more to principle than passion nor can i give a stronger proof of the truth of this assurance than by declaring that i can and will forgive him on this one easy condition that he will never molest me more  in whatever way you choose to make this declaration be pleased to let my most respectful compliments to the ladies of the noble family and to my lord m accompany it and do you my dear believe that i shall be to the last moment of my life  your everobliged and affectionate clarissa harlowe  letter lxxvii mr lovelace to john belford esquire friday july    i have three letters of thine to take notice of letters lxxilxxiilxxiii  but am divided in my mind whether to quarrel with thee on thy unmerciful reflections or to thank thee for thy acceptable particularity and diligence but several of my sweet dears have i indeed in my time made to cry and laugh in a breath nay one side of their pretty faces laugh before the cry could go off of the other why may i not therefore curse and applaud thee in the same moment o take both in one and what follows as it shall rise from my pen  how often have i ingenuously confessed my sins against is excellent creature  yet thou never sparest me although  bad a man as myself since then i get so little by my fessions i had a good mind to try to defend myself and that not only from ancient and modern story but from common practice and yet avoid repeating anything i have suggested before in my own behalf  i am in a humor to play the fool with my pen briefly then from ancient story first  do thou not think that i am as much entitled to forgiveness on miss harlowes account as virgils hero was on queen didos for what an ungrateful varlet was that vagabond to the hospitable princess who had willingly conferred upon him the last favor  stealing away whence i suppose the ironical phrase of trusty trojan to this day like a thief pretendedly indeed at the command of the gods but could that be when the errand he went upon was to rob other princes not only of their dominions but of their lives  yet this fellow is at every word the pius aeneas with the immortal bard who celebrates him  should miss harlowe even break her heart which heaven forbid for the usage she has received to say nothing of her disappointed pride to which her death would be attributable more than to reason what comparison will her fate hold to queen didos and have i half the obligation to her that aeneas had to the queen of carthage the latter placing a confidence the former none in he man  then whom else have i robbed whom else have i injured her brothers worthless life i gave him instead of taking any mans as the trojan vagabond did the lives of thousands why then should it not be the pius lovelace as well as the pius aeneas for do thou think had a conflagration happened and had it bee in my power that i would not have saved my old anchises as he did his from the ilion bonfire even at the expense of my creusa had i had a wife of that name  but for a more modern instance in my favor  have  used miss harlowe as our famous maidenqueen as she was called used one of her own blood a sisterqueen who threw herself into her protection from her rebelsubjects and whom she detained prisoner eighteen years and at last cut off her head yet credited by worse and weake reigns a succession four deep do not honest protestant pronounce her pious too  and call her particularly th queen  as to common practice  who let me ask that has it i his power to gratify a predominant passion be it what it will denies himself the gratification  leaving it to cooler deliberation and if he be a great man to his flatterers to find a reason for it afterward  then as to the worst part of my treatment of this lady  how many men are there who as well as i have sought by intoxicating liquors first to inebriate then to subdue what signifies what the potations were when the same end was in view  let me tell thee upon the whole that neither the queen of carthage nor the queen of scots would have thought they had any reason to complain of cruelty had they been used no worse than i have used the queen of my heart and then do i not aspire with my whole soul to repair by marriage would the pius aeneas think thou have done such a piece of justice by dido had she lived  come come belford let people run away with notions as they will i am comparatively a very innocent man and if by these and other like reasonings i have quieted my own conscience a great end is answered what have i to do with the world  and now i sit me peaceably down to consider thy letters  i hope thy pleas in my favor see p          when she gave thee so generously gave thee for me my letters were urged with an honest energy but i suspect thee much for being too ready to give up thy client then thou have such a misgiving aspect an aspect rather inviting rejection than carrying persuasion with it and art such an hesitateing such an humming and hawing caitiff that i shall attribute my failure if i do fail rather to the inability and ill looks of my advocate than to my cause again thou art deprived of the force men of our cast give to arguments for she will not let thee swear  art moreover a very heavy thoughtless fellow tolerable only at a second rebound a horrid dunce at the impromptu these encountering with such a lady are great disadvantages  and still a greater is thy balancing as thou do at present between old rakery and new reformation since this puts thee into the same situation with her as they told me at leipsick martin luther was in at the first public dispute which he held in defense of his supposed new doctrines with eckius for martin was then but a linseywolsey reformer he retained some dogma which by natural consequence made others that he held untenable so that eckius in some points had the better of him but from that time he made clear work renouncing all that stood in his way and then his doctrines ran upon all fours he was never puzzled afterward and could boldly declare that he would defend them in the face of angels and men and to his friends who would have dissuaded him from venturing to appear before the emperor charles the fifth at spires that were there as many devils at spires as tiles upon the houses he would go an answer that is admired by every protestant saxon to this day  since then thy unhappy aukwardness destroys the force of thy arguments i think thou had better for the present however forbear to urge her on the subject of accepting the reparation i offer lest the continual teazing of her to forgive me should but strengthen her in her denials of forgiveness till for consistency sake she will be forced to adhere to a resolution so often avowed whereas if left to herself a little time and better health which will bring on better spirits will give her quicker resentments those quicker resentments will lead her into vehemence that vehemence will subside and turn into expostulation and parley my friends will then interpose and guaranty for me and all our trouble on both sides will be over  such is the natural course of things  i cannot endure thee for thy hopelesness in the ladys recovery see p      and that in contradiction to the doctor and apothecary  time in the words of congreve thou say will give increase to her afflictions but why so know thou not that those words so contrary to common experience were applied to the case of a person while passion was in its full vigor  at such a time everyone in a heavy grief thinks the same but as enthusiasts do by scripture so do thou by the poets thou have read anything that carries the most distant allusion from either to the case in hand is put down by both for gospel however incongruous to the general scope of either and to that case so once in a pulpit i heard one of the former very vehemently declare himself to be a dead dog when every man woman and child were convinced to the contrary by his howling  i can tell thee that if nothing else will do i am determined in spite of thy buskinairs and of thy engagements for me to the contrary to see her myself  face to face have i known many a quarrel made up which distance would have kept alive and widened thou will be a madder jack than him in the tale of a tub if thou give an active opposition to this interview  in short i cannot bear the thought that a lady whom once i had bound to me in the silken cords of love should slip through my fingers and be able while my heart flames out with a violent passion for her to despise me and to set both love and me at defiance thou can not imagine how much i envy thee and her doctor and her apothecary and everyone whom i hear of being admitted to her presence and conversation and wish to be the one or the other in turn  wherefore if nothing else will do i will see her i will tell thee of an admirable expedient just come cross me to save thy promise and my own  mrs lovick you say is a good woman if the lady be worse she shall advise her to send for a parson to pray by her unknown to her unknown to the lady unknown to thee for so it may pass i will contrive to be the man petticoated out and vested in a gown and cassock i once for a certain purpose did assume the canonicals and i was thought to make a fine sleek appearance my broad rosebound beaver became me mightily and i was much admired upon the whole by all who saw me  methinks it must be charmingly apropos to see me kneeling down by her bedside i am sure i shall pray heartily beginning out of the common prayer book the sick office for the restoration of the languishing lady and concluding with an exhortation to charity and forgiveness for myself  i will consider of this matter but in whatever shape i shall choose to appear of this thou may assure thyself i will apprise thee beforehand of my determinedupon visit that thou may contrive to be out of the way and to know nothing of the matter this will save thy word and as to mine can she think worse of me than she does at present  an indispensable of true love and profound respect in thy wise opinion see p      is absurdity or aukwardness  it is surprising that thou should be one of those partial mortals who take their measures of right and wrong from what they find themselves to be and cannot help being  so aukwardness is a perfection in the awkward  at this rate no man ever can be in the wrong but i insist upon it that an awkward fellow will do everything aukwardly and if he be like thee will rack his unmeaning brain for excuses as awkward as his first fault respectful love is an inspirer of actions worthy of itself and he who cannot show it where he most means it manifests that he is an unpolite rough creature a perfect belford and has it not in him  but here thou wilt throw out that notable witticism that my outside is the best of me thine the worst of thee and that if i set about mending my mind thou will mend thy appearance  but prythee jack dont stay for that but set about thy amendment in dress when thou leavest off thy mourning for why should thou prepossess in thy disfavour all those who never saw thee before  it is hard to remove earlytaken prejudices whether of liking or distaste people will hunt as i may say for reasons to confirm first impressions in compliment to their own sagacity nor is it every mind that has the ingenuity to confess itself mistaken when it finds itself to be wrong thou thyself art an adept in the pretended science of reading of men and whenever thou art out wilt study to find some reasons why it was more probable that thou should have been right and wilt watch every motion and action and every word and sentiment in the person thou have once censured for proofs in order to help thee to revive and maintain thy first opinion and indeed as thou seldom errest on the favorable side human nature is so vile a thing that thou art likely to be right five times in six on the other and perhaps it is but guessing of others by what thou find in thy own heart to have reason to compliment thyself on thy penetration  here is preachment for thy preachment and i hope if thou likest thy own thou will thank me for mine the rather as thou may be the better for it if thou will since it is calculated for thy own meridian  well but the lady refers my destiny to the letter she has written actually written to miss how to whom it seems she has given her reasons why she will not have me i long to know the contents of this letter but am in great hopes that she has so expressed her denials as shall give room to think she only wants to be persuaded to the contrary in order to reconcile herself to herself  i could make some pretty observations upon one or two places of the ladys meditation but wicked as i am thought to be i never was so abandoned as to turn into ridicule or even to treat with levity things sacred i think it the highest degree of ill manners to jest upon those subjects which the world in general look upon with veneration and call divine i would not even treat the mythology of the heathen to a heathen with the ridicule that perhaps would fairly lie from some of the absurdities that strike every common observer nor when at rome and in other popish countries did i ever behave shockingly at those ceremonies which i thought very extraordinary for i saw some people affected and seemingly edified by them and i contented myself to think though they were beyond my comprehension that if they answered any good end to the many there was religion enough in them or civil policy at least to exempt them from the ridicule of even a bad man who had common sense and good manners  for the like reason i have never given noisy or tumultuous instances of dislike to a new play if i thought it ever so indifferent for i concluded first that every one was entitled to see quietly what he paid for and next as the theater the epitome of the world consisted of pit boxes and gallery it was hard i thought if there could be such a performance exhibited as would not please somebody in that mixed multitude and if it did those somebodies had as much right to enjoy their own judgments undisturbedly as i had to enjoy mine  this was my way of showing my disapprobation i never went again and as a man is at his option whether he will go to a play or not he has not the same excuse for expressing his dislike clamorously as if he were compelled to see it  i have ever thou know declared against those shallow libertines who could not make out their pretensions to wit but on two subjects to which every man of tr wit will scorn to be beholden profaneness and obscenity i mean which must shock the ears of every man or woman of sense without answering any end but of showing a very low and abandoned nature and till i came acquainted with the brutal mowbray no great praise to myself from such a tutor i was far from making so free as i now do with oaths and curses for then i was forced to outswear him sometimes to keep him in his allegiance to me his general nay i often check myself to myself for this empty unprofitable liberty of speech in which we are outdone by the sons of the common sewer  all my vice is women and the love of plots and intrigues and i cannot but wonder how i fell into those shocking freedoms of speech since generallyspeaking they are far from helping forward my main end only nowandthen indeed a little novice rises to ones notice who seems to think dress and oaths and curses the diagnostics of the rakish spirit she is inclined to favor and indeed they are the only qualifications that some who are called rakes and pretty fellows have to boast of but what must the women be who can be attracted by such emptysould profligates  since wickedness with wit is hardly excusable but without it is equally shocking and contemptible  there again is preachment for thy preachment and thou will be apt to think that i am reforming too but no such matter if this were new light darting in upon me as thy morality seems to be to thee something of this kind might be apprehended but this was always my way of thinking and i defy thee or any of thy brethren to name a time when i have either ridiculed religion or talked obscenely on the contrary thou know how often i have checked that bear in lovematters mowbray and the finical tourville and thyself too for what ye have called the doubleentendre in love as in points that required a manly resentment it has always been my maxim to act rather than talk and i do assure thee as to the first the ladies themselves will excuse the one sooner than the other  as to the admiration thou expressest for the books of scripture thou art certainly right in it but it is strange to me that thou were ignorant of their beauty and noble simplicity till now their antiquity always made me reverence them and how was it possible that thou could not for that reason if for no other give them a perusal  i will tell thee a short story which i had from my tutor admonishing me against exposing myself by ignorant wonder when i should quit college go to town or travel  the first time drydens alexanders feast fell into his hands he told me he was prodigiously charmed with it and having never heard anybody speak of it before thought as thou do of the bible that he had made a new discovery  he hastened to an appointment which he had with several wits for he was then in town one of whom was a noted critic who according to him had more merit than good fortune for all the little nibblers in wit whose writings would not stand the test of criticism made it he said a common cause to run him down as men would a mad dog  the young gentleman for young he then was set forth magnificently in the praises of that inimitable performance and gave himself airs of secondhand merit for finding out its beauties  the old bard heard him out with a smile which the collegian took for approbation till he spoke and then it was in these mortifying words sdeath sir where have you lived till now or with what sort of company have you conversed young as you are that you have never before heard of the finest piece in the english language  this story had such an effect upon me who had ever a proud heart and wanted to be thought a clever fellow that in order to avoid the like disgrace i laid down two rules to myself the first whenever i went into company where there were strangers to hear everyone of them speak before i gave myself liberty to prate the other if i found any of them above my match to give up all title to new discoveries contenting myself to praise what they praised as beauties familiar to me though i had never heard of them before and so by degrees i got the reputation of a wit myself and when i threw off all restraint and books and learned conversation and fell in with some of our brethren who are now wandering in erebus and with such others as belton mowbray tourville and thyself i set up on my own stock and like what we have been told of sir richard in his latter days valued myself on being the emperor of the company for having fathomed the depth of them all and afraid of no rival but thee whom also i had got a little under by my gaiety and promptitude at least i proudly like addisons cato delighted to give laws to my little senate  proceed with thee byandby  letter lxxviii mr lovelace to john belford esquire but now i have cleared myself of any intentional levity on occasion of my beloveds meditation which as thou observest is finely suited to her case that is to say as she and you have drawn her case i cannot help expressing my pleasure that by one or two verses of it the arrow jack and what she feared being come upon her i am encouraged to hope what it will be very surprising to me if it do not happen that is in plain english that the dear creature is in the way to be a mamma  this cursed arrest because of the ill effects the terror might have had upon her in that hopedfor circumstance has concerned me more than on any other account it would be the pride of my life to prove in this charming frostpiece the triumph of nature over principle and to have a young loveace by such an angel and then for its sake i am confident she will live and will legitimate it and what a meritorious little cherub would it be that should lay an obligation upon both parents before it was born which neither of them would be able to repay  could i be sure it is so i should be out of all pain for her recovery pain i say since were she to die  die abominable word how i hate it i verily think i should be the most miserable man in the world  as for the earnestness she expresses for death she has found the words ready to her hand in honest job else she would not have delivered herself with such strength and vehemence  her innate piety as i have more than once observed will not permit her to shorten her own life either by violence or neglect she has a mind too noble for that and would have done it before now had she designed any such thing for to do it like the roman matron when the mischief is over and it can serve no end and when the man however a tarquin as some may think him in this action is not a tarquin in power so that no national point can be made of it is what she has too much good sense to think of  then as i observed in a like case a little while ago the distress when this was written was strong upon her and she saw no end of it but all was darkness and apprehension before her moreover has she it not in her power to disappoint as much as she has been disappointed revenge jack has induced many a woman to cherish a life which grief and despair would otherwise have put an end to  and after all death is no such eligible thing as job in his calamities makes it and a death desired merely from worldly disappointment shows not a right mind let me tell this lady whatever she may think of it mr lovelace could not know that the lady was so thoroughly sensible of the solidity of this doctrine as she really was for in letter lxix to mrs norton p     of this volume she says  nor let it be imagined that my present turn of mind proceeds from gloominess or melancholy for although it was brought on by disappointment the world showing me early even at my first rushing into it its true and ugly face yet i hope that it has obtaind a better root and will every day more and more by its fruits demonstrate to me and to all my friends that it has  you and i jack although not afraid in the height of passion or resentment to rush into those dangers which might be followed by a sudden and violent death whenever a point of honor calls upon us would shudder at his cool and deliberate approach in a lingering sickness which had debilitated the spirits  so we read of a french general in the reign of harry the ivth i forget his name if it were not marshall biron who having faced with intrepidity the ghastly varlet on an hundred occasions in the field was the most dejected of wretches when having forfeited his life for treason he was led with all the cruel parade of preparation and surrounding guards to the scaffold  the poet says well it is not the stoic lesson got by rote the pomp of words and pedant dissertation that can support us in the hour of terror books have taught cowards to talk nobly of it but when the trial comes they start and stand oghast   very true for then it is the old man in the fable with his bundle of sticks  the lady is well read in shakespeare our english pride and glory and must sometimes reason with herself in his words so greatly expressed that the subject affecting as it is cannot produce any thing more so  ay but to di and go we know not where to lie in cold obstruction and to rot this sensible warm motion to become a kneaded cld and the delighted spirit to bathe in fiery floods or to reside in thrilling regions of thickribbed ice to be imprisoned in the viewless winds or blown with restless violence about the pendent worlds or to be worse than worst of those that lawless and uncertain thought imagines howling it is too horrible the weariest and most loaded worldly life that pain age penury and imprisonment can lay on nature is a paradise to what we fear of death i find by one of thy three letters that my beloved had some account from hickman of my interview with miss how at col ambroses i had a very agreeable time of it there although severely raillied by several of the assemblee it concerns me however not a little to find our affair so generally known among the flippanti of both sexes it is all her own fault there never surely was such an odd little soul as this  not to keep her own secret when the revealing of it could answer no possible good end and when she wants not one would think to raise to herself either pity or friends or to me enemies by the proclamation  why jack must not all her own sex laugh in their sleeves at her weakness what would become of the peace of the world if all women should take it into their heads to follow her example what a fine time of it would the heads of families have their wives always filling their ears with their confessions their daughters with theirs sisters would be every day setting their brothers about cutting of throats if they had at heart the honor of their families as it is called and the whole world would either be a scene of confusion or cuckoldom must be as much the fashion as it is in lithuania in lithuania the women are said to have so allowedly their gallants called adjutores that the husbands hardly ever enter upon any party of pleasure without them   i am glad however that miss how as much as she hates me kept her word with my cousins on their visit to her and with me at the colonels to endeavor to persuade her friend to make up all matters by matrimony which no doubt is the best nay the only method she can take for her own honor and that of her family  i had once thoughts of revenging myself on that little vixen and particularly as thou may this plot of his is mentioned vol iv p     remember had planned something to this purpose on the journey she is going to take which had been talked of some time but i think  let me see  yes i think i will let this hickman have her safe and entire as thou believe the fellow to be a tolerable sort of a mortal and that i had made the worst of him and i am glad for his own sake he has not launched out too virulently against me to thee  and thus if i pay thee not in quality i do in quantity and yet leave a multitude of things unobserved upon for i begin not to know what to do with myself here  tired with lord m who in his recovery has played upon me the fable of the nurse the crying child and the wolf  tired with my cousins montague though charming girls were they not so near of kin  tired with mowbray and tourville and their everlasting identity  tired with the country  tired of myself longing for what i have not i must go to town and there have an interview with the charmer of my soul for desperate diseases must have desperate remedies and i only wait to know my doom from miss how and then if it be rejection i will try my fate and receive my sentence at her feet  but i will apprise thee of it beforehand as i told thee that thou may keep thy parole with the lady in the best manner thou can  letter lxxix miss how to miss clarissa harlowe  in answer to hers of july    p     friday night july    i will now my dearest friend write to you all my mind without reserve on your resolution not to have this vilest of men you gave me in yours of sunday the   d reasons so worthy of the pure mind of my clarissa harlowe in support of this your resolution that nothing but selflove lest i should lose my everamiable friend could have prevailed upon me to wish you to alter it  indeed i thought it was impossible there could be however desirable so noble an instance given by any of our sex of a passion conquered when there were so many inducements to give way to it and therefore i was willing to urge you once more to overcome your just indignation and to be prevailed upon by the solicitations of his friends before you carried your resentments to so great a height that it would be more difficult for you and less to your honor to comply than if you had complied at first  but now my dear that i see you fixed in your noble resolution and that it is impossible for your pure mind to join itself with that of so perjured a miscreant i congratulate you most heartily upon it and beg your pardon for but seeming to doubt that theory and practice were not the same thing with my beloved clarissa harlowe  i have only one thing that saddens my heart on this occasion and that is the bad state of health mr hickman unwillingly owns you are in for although you so well observe the doctrine you always laid down to me that a censured person should first seek to be justified to herself and give but a second place to the worlds opinion of her and in all cases where the two could not be reconciled to prefer the first to the last and though you are so well justified to your anna how and to your own heart yet my dear let me beseech you to endeavor to recover your health and spirits by all possible means and this as what if it can be effected will crown the work and show the world that you were indeed got above the base wretch and though put out of your course for a little while could resume it again and go on blessing all within your knowledge as well by your example as by your precepts  for heavens sake then for the worlds sake for the honor of our sex and for my sake once more i beseech you try to overcome this shock and if you can overcome it i shall then be as happy as i wish to be for i cannot indeed i cannot think of parting with you for many many years to come  the reasons you give for discouraging my wishes to have you near us are so convincing that i ought at present to acquiesce in them but my dear when your mind is fully settled as now you are so absolutely determined in it with regard to this wretch i hope it will soon be i shall expect you with us or near us and then you shall chalk out every path that i will set my foot in nor will i turn aside either to the right hand or to the left  you wish i had not mediated for you to your friends i wish so too because it was ineffectual because it may give new ground for the malice of some of them to work upon and because you are angry with me for doing so but how as i said in my former could i sit down quietly knowing how uneasy their implacableness must make you but i will tear myself from the subject  for i see i shall be warm again  and displease you  and there is not one thing in the world that i would do however agreeable to myself if i thought it would disoblige you nor any one that i would omit to do if i knew it would give you pleasure and indeed my dear halfsevere friend i will try if i cannot avoid the fault as willingly as i would the rebuke  for this reason i forbear saying anything on so nice a subject as your letter to your sister it must be right because you think it so  and if it be taken as it ought that will show you that it is but if it beget insults and revilings as it is but too likely  i find you dont intend to let me know it  you were always so ready to accuse yourself for other peoples faults and to suspect your own conduct rather than the judgment of your relations that i have often told you i cannot imitate you in this it is not a necessary point of belief with me that all people in years are therefore wise or that all young people are therefore rash and headstrong it may be generally the case as far as i know and possibly it may be so in the case of my mother and her girl but i will venture to say that it has not yet appeared to be so between the principals of harloweplace and their second daughter  you are for excusing them beforehand for their expected cruelty as not knowing what you have suffered nor how ill you are they have heard of the former and are not sorry for it of the latter they have been told and i have most reason to know how they have taken it  but i shall be far from avoiding the fault and as surely shall incur the rebuke if i say any more upon this subject i will therefore only add at present that your reasonings in their behalf show you to be all excellence their returns to you that they are all  do my dear let me end with a little bit of spiteful justice  but you will not i know  so i have done quite done however reluctantly yet if you think of the word i would have said dont doubt the justice of it and fill up the blank with it  you put me in hope that were i actually married and mr hickman to desire it you would think of obliging me with a visit on the occasion and that perhaps when with me it would be difficult for you to remove far from me  lord my dear what a stress do you seem to lay upon mr hickmans desiring it to be sure he does and would of all things desire to have you near us and with us if we might be so favored policy as well as veneration for you would undoubtedly make the man if not a fool desire this but let me tell you that if mr hickman after marriage should pretend to dispute with me my friendships as i hope i am not quite a fool i should let him know how far his own quiet was concerned in such an impertinence especially if they were such friendships as were contracted before i knew him  i know i always differed from you on this subject for you think more highly of a husbands prerogative than most people do of the royal one  these notions my dear from a person of your sense and judgment are noway advantageous to us inasmuch as they justify that insolent sex in their assumptions when hardly one out of ten of them their opportunities considered deserve any prerogative at all look through all the families we know and we shall not find onethird of them have half the sense of their wives  and yet these are to be vested with prerogatives  and a woman of twice their sense has nothing to do but hear tremble and obey  and for conscience sake too i warrant  but mr hickman and i may perhaps have a little discourse upon these sort of subjects before i suffer him to talk of the day and then i shall let him know what he has to trust to as he will me if he be a sincere man what he pretends to expect from me but let me tell you my dear that it is more in your power than perhaps you think it to hasten the day so much pressedfor by my mother as well as wished for by you  for the very day that you can assure me that you are in a tolerable state of health and have discharged your doctor and apothecary at their own motions on that account  some day in a month from that desirable news shall be it  so my dear make haste and be well and then this matter will be brought to effect in a manner more agreeable to your anne how than it otherwise ever can  i send this day by a particular hand to the misses montague your letter of just reprobation of the greatest profligate in the kingdom and hope i shall not have done amiss that i transcribe some of the paragraphs of your letter of the   d and send them with it as you at first intended should be done  you are it seems and that too much for your health employed in writing i hope it is in penning down the particulars of your tragical story and my mother has put me in mind to press you to it with a view that one day if it might be published under feigned names it would be of as much use as honor to the sex my mother says she cannot help admiring you for the propriety of your resentment in your refusal of the wretch and she would be extremely glad to have her advice of penning your sad story complied with and then she says your noble conduct throughout your trials and calamities will afford not only a shining example to your sex but at the same time those calamities befalling such a person a fearful warning to the inconsiderate young creatures of it  on monday we shall set out on our journey and i hope to be back in a fortnight and on my return will have one pull more with my mother for a london journey and if the pretense must be the buying of clothes the principal motive will be that of seeing once more my dear friend while i can say i have not finally given consent to the change of a visitor into a relation and so can call myself my own as well as  your anna how  letter lxxx miss how to the two misses montague sat july    dear ladies i have not been wanting to use all my interest with my beloved friend to induce her to forgive and be reconciled to your kinsman though he has so ill deserved it and have even repeated my earnest advice to her on this head this repetition and the waiting for her answer having taken up time have been the cause that i could not sooner do myself the honor of writing to you on this subject  you will see by the enclosed her immovable resolution grounded on noble and highsould motives which i cannot but regret and applaud at the same time applaud for the justice of her determination which will confirm all your worthy house in the opinion you had conceived of her unequalled merit and regret because i have but too much reason to apprehend as well by that as by the report of a gentleman just come from her that she is in such a declining way as to her health that her thoughts are very differently employed than on a continuance here  the enclosed letter she thought fit to send to me unsealed that after i had perused it i might forward it to you and this is the reason it is superscribed by myself and sealed with my seal it is very full and peremptory but as she had been pleased in a letter to me dated the   d instant as soon as she could hold a pen to give me ampler reasons why she could not comply with your pressing requests as well as mine i will transcribe some of the passages in that letter which will give one of the wickedest men in the world if he sees them reason to think himself one of the unhappiest in the loss of so incomparable a wife as he might have gloried in had he not been so superlatively wicked these are the passages sec for these passages miss harlowes letter no lxvi dated july    marked with turned commas thus  and now ladies you have before you my beloved friends reasons for her refusal of a man unworthy of the relation he bears to so many excellent persons and i will add for i cannot help it that the merit and rank of the person considered and the vile manner of his proceedings there never was a greater villainy committed and since she thinks her first and only fault cannot be expiated but by death i pray to god daily and will hourly from the moment i shall hear of that sad catastrophe that he will be pleased to make him the subject of his vengeance in some such way as that all who know of his perfidious crime may see the hand of heaven in the punishment of it  you will forgive me ladies i love not my own soul better than i do miss clarissa harlowe and the distresses she has gone through and the persecutions she suffers from all her friends the curse she lies under for his sake from her implacable father her reduced health and circumstances from high health and affluence and that execrable arrest and confinement which have deepened all her other calamities and which must be laid at his door as the action of his vile agents that whether from his immediate orders or not naturally flowed from his preceding baseness the sex dishonored in the eye of the world in the person of one of the greatest ornaments of it his unmanly methods whatever they were for i know not all as yet of compassing her ruin all join to justify my warmth and my execrations against a man whom i think excluded by his crimes from the benefit even of christian forgiveness  and were you to see all she writes and the admirable talents she is mistress of you yourselves would join to admire her and execrate him as i do  believe me to be with a high sense of your merits  dear ladies your most obedient humble servant anna how  letter lxxxi mrs norton to miss clarissa harlowe friday july    my dearest young lady i have the consolation to tell you that my son is once again in an hopeful way as to his health he desires his duty to you he is very low and weak and so am i but this is the first time that i have been able for several days past to sit up to write or i would not have been so long silent  your letter to your sister is received and answered you have the answer by this time i suppose i wish it may be to your satisfaction but am afraid it will not for by betty barnes i find they were in a great ferment on receiving yours and much divided whether it should be answered or not they will not yet believe that you are so ill as to my infinite concern i find you are what passed between miss harlowe and miss how as i feared has been an aggravation  i showed betty two or three passages in your letter to me and she seemed moved and said she would report them favorably and would procure me a visit from miss harlowe if i would promise to show the same to her but i have heard no more of that  methinks i am sorry you refuse the wicked man but doubt not nevertheless that your motives for doing so are righter than my wishes that you would not but as you would be resolved as i may say on life if you gave way to such a thought and as i have so much interest in it i cannot forbear showing this regard to myself as to ask you cannot you my dear young lady get over your just resentments  but i dare say no more on this subject  what a dreadful thing indeed was it for my dearest tender young lady to be arrested in the streets of london  how does my heart go over again for you what yours must have suffered at that time  yet this to such a mind as yours must be light compared to what you had suffered before  o my dearest miss clary how shall we know what to pray for when we pray for any thing but that gods will may be done and that we may be resigned to it  when at nine years old and afterward at eleven you had a dangerous fever how incessantly did we all grieve and pray and put up our vows to the throne of grace for your recovery for all our lives were bound up in your life  yet now my dear as it has proved especially if we are soon to lose you what a much more desirable event both for you and for us had we then lost you  a sad thing to say but as it is in pure love to you that i say it and in full conviction that we are not always fit to be our own choosers i hope it may be excuseable and the rather as the same reflection will naturally lead both you and me to acquiesce under the present dispensation since we are assured that nothing happens by chance and that the greatest good may for aught we know be produced from the heaviest evils  i am glad you are with such honest people and that you have all your effects restored  how dreadfully have you been used that one should be glad of such a poor piece of justice as that  your talent at moving the passions is always hinted at and this betty of your sisters never comes near me that she is not full of it but as you say whom has it moved that you wished to move yet were it not for this unhappy notion i am sure your mamma would relent forgive me my dear miss clary for i must try one way to be convinced if my opinion be not just but i will not tell you what that is unless it succeeds i will try in pure duty and love to them as well as to you  may heaven be your support in all your trials is the constant prayer my dearest young lady of  your everaffectionate friend and servant judith norton  letter lxxxii mrs norton to mrs harlowe friday july    honored madam being forbidden without leave to send you anything i might happen to receive from my beloved miss clary and so ill that i cannot attend to ask your leave i give you this trouble to let you know that i have received a letter from her which i think i should hereafter be held inexcuseable as things may happen if i did not desire permission to communicate it to you and that as soon as possible  applications have been made to the dear young lady from lord m from the two ladi his sisters and from both his nieces and from the wicked man himself to forgive and marry him this in noble indignation for the usage she has received from him she has absolutely refused and perhaps madam if you and the honored family should be of opinion that to comply with their wishes is now the properest measure that can be taken the circumstances of things may require your authority or advice either to induce her to change her mind or to confirm her in it  i have reason to believe that one motive for her refusal is her full conviction that she shall not long be a trouble to anybody and so she would not give a husband a right to interfere with her family in relation to the estate her grandfather bequeathed to her but of this however i have not the least intimation from her nor would she i dare say mention it as a reason having still stronger to refuse him from his vile treatment of her  the letter i have received will show how truly penitent the dear creature is and if i have your permission i will send it sealed up with a copy of mine to which it is an answer but as i resolve upon this step without her knowledge and indeed i do i will not acquaint her with it unless it be attended with desirable effects because otherwise besides making me incur her displeasure it might quite break her already halfbroken heart  i am honored madam  your dutiful and everobliged servant judith norton  letter lxxxiii mrs harlowe to mrs judith norton sunday july  0 we all know your virtuous prudence worthy woman we all do but your partiality to this your rash favorite is likewise known and we are no less acquainted with the unhappy bodys power of painting her distresses so as to pierce a stone  everyone is of opinion that the dear naughty creature is working about to be forgiven and received and for this reason it is that betty has been forbidden not by me you may be sure to mention any more of her letters for she did speak to my bella of some moving passages you read to her  this will convince you that nothing will be heard in her favor to what purpose then should i mention any thing about her  but you may be sure that i will if i can have but one second however that is not at all likely until we see what the consquences of her crime will be and who can tell that  she may  how can i speak it and my once darling daughter unmarried  she may be with child  this would perpetuate her stain her brother may come to some harm which god forbid  one childs ruin i hope will not be followed by anothers murder  as to her grief and her present misery whatever it be she must bear with it and it must be short of what i hourly bear for her indeed i am afraid nothing but her being at the last extremity of all will make her father and her uncles and her other friends forgive her  the easy pardon perverse children meet with when they have done the rashest and most rebellious thing they can do is the reason as is pleaded to us every day that so many follow their example they depend upon the indulgent weakness of their parents tempers and in that dependence harden their own hearts and a little humiliation when they have brought themselves into the foretold misery is to be a sufficient atonement for the greatest perverseness  but for such a child as this i mention what others hourly say but what i must sorrowfully subscribe to to lay plots and stratagems to deceive her parents as well as herself and to run away with a libertine can there be any atonement for her crime and is she not answerable to god to us to you and to all the world who knew her for the abuse of such talents as she has abused  you say her heart is halfbroken is it to be wondered at was not her sin committed equally against warning and the light of her own knowledge  that he would now marry her or that she would refuse him if she believed him in earnest as she has circumstanced herself is not at all probable and were i inclined to believe it nobody else here would he values not his relations and would deceive them as soon as any others his aversion to marriage he has always openly declared and still occasionally declares it but if he be now in earnest which every one who knows him must doubt which do you think hating us too as he professes to hate and despise us all would be soonest to be chosen here to hear of her death or of her marriage with such a vile man  to all of us yet i cannot say for oh my good mrs norton you know what a mothers tenderness for the child of her heart would make her choose notwithstanding all that childs faults rather than lose her for ever  but i must sail with the tide my own judgment also joining with it or i should make the unhappiness of the more worthy still greater my dear mr harlowes particularly which is already more than enough to make them unhappy for the remainder of their days this i know if i were to oppose the rest our son would fly out to find this libertine and who could tell what would be the issue of that with such a man of violence and blood as that lovelace is known to be  all i can expect to prevail for her is that in a week or so mr brand may be sent up to inquire privately about her present state and way of life and to see she is not altogether destitute for nothing she writes herself will be regarded  her father indeed has at her earnest request withdrawn the curse which in a passion he laid upon her at her first wicked flight from us but miss how it is a sad thing mrs norton to suffer so many ways at once had made matters so difficult by her undue liberties with us all as well by speech in all companies as by letters written to my bella that we could hardly prevail upon him to hear her letter read  these liberties of miss how with us the general cry against us abroad wherever we are spoken of and the visible and not seldom audible disrespectfulness which high and low treat us with to our faces as we go to and from church and even at church for nowhere else have we the heart to go as if none of us had been regarded but upon her account and as if she were innocent we all in fault are constant aggravations you must needs think to the whole family  she has made my lot heavy i am sure that was far from being light before  i am injoined to tell you truth not to receive any thing of hers from any hand without leave should i therefore gratify my yearnings after her so far as to receive privately the letter you mention what would the case be but to torment myself without being able to do her good  and were it to be known  mr harlowe is so passionate  and should it throw his gout into his stomach as her rash flight did  indeed indeed i am very unhappy  for oh my good woman she is my child still  but unless it were more in my power  yet do i long to see the letter  you say it tells of her present way and circumstances  the poor child who ought to be in possession of thousands  and will  for her father will be a faithful steward for her  but it must be in his own way and at his own time  and is she really ill  so very ill  but she ought to sorrow  she has given a double measure of it  but does she really believe she shall not long trouble us  but oh my norton  she must she will long trouble us  for can she think her death if we should be deprived of her will put an end to our afflictions  can it be thought that the fall of such a child will not be regretted by us to the last hour of our lives  but in the letter you have does she without reserve express her contrition has she in it no reflecting hints does she not aim at extenuations  if i were to see it will it not shock me so much that my apparent grief may expose me to harshnesses  can it be contrived   but to what purpose  dont send it  i charge you dont  i dare not see it   yet   but alas   o forgive the distractedthoughted mother you can  you know how to allow for all this  so i will let it go  i will not write over again this part of my letter  but i choose not to know more of her than is communicated to us all  no more than i dare own i have seen  and what some of them may rather communicate to me than receive from me and this for the sake of my outward quiet although my inward peace suffers more and more by the compelled reserve  i was forced to break off but i will now try to conclude my long letter  i am sorry you are ill but if you were well i could not for your own sake wish you to go up as betty tells us you long to do if you went nothing would be minded that came from you as they already think you too partial in her favor your going up would confirm it and do yourself prejudice and her no good and as everybody values you here i advise you not to interest yourself too warmly in her favor especially before my bellas betty till i can let you know a proper time yet to forbid you to love the dear naughty creature who can o my norton you must love her  and so must i  i send you five guineas to help you in your present illness and your sons for it must have lain heavy upon you what a sad sad thing my dear good woman that all your pains and all my pains for eighteen or nineteen years together have in so few months been rendered thus deplorably vain yet i must be always your friend and pity you for the very reason that i myself deserve every ones pity  perhaps i may find an opportunity to pay you a visit as in your illness and then may weep over the letter you mention with you but for the future write nothing to me about the poor girl that you think may not be communicated to us all  and i charge you as you value my friendship as you wish my peace not to say anything of a letter you have from me either to the naughtyone or to anybody else i was some little relief the occasion given to write to you who must in so particular a manner share my affliction a mother mrs norton cannot forget her child though that child could abandon her mother and in so doing run away with all her mothers comforts  as i can truly say is the case of  your unhappy friend charlotte harlowe  letter lxxxiv miss cl harlowe to mrs judith norton sat july    i congratulate you my dear mrs norton with all my heart on your sons recovery which i pray to god with your own health to perfect  i write in some hurry being apprehensive of the consequence of the hints you give of some method you propose to try in my favor with my relations i presume you mean but you will not tell me what you say if it prove unsuccessful  now i must beg of you that you will not take any step in my favor with which you do not first acquaint me  i have but one request to make to them besides what is contained in my letter to my sister and i would not methinks for their own future peace of minds sake that they should be teazed so by your wellmeant kindness and miss howes as to be put upon denying me that and why should more be asked for me than i can partake of more than is absolutely necessary for my own peace  you suppose i should have my sisters answer to my letter by the time yours reached my hand i have it and a severe one a very severe one it is yet considering my fault in their eyes and the provocations i am to suppose they so newly had from my dear miss how i am to look upon it as a favor that it was answered at all i will send you a copy of it soon as also of mine to which it is an answer  i have reason to be very thankful that my father has withdrawn that heavy malediction which affected me so much  a parents curse my dear mrs norton what child could die in peace under a parents curse so literally fulfilled too as this has been in what relates to this life  my heart is too full to touch upon the particulars of my sisters letter  i can make but one atonement for my fault may that be accepted and may it soon be forgotten by every dear relation that there was such an unhappy daughter sister or niece as clarissa harlowe  my cousin morden was one of those who was so earned in prayers for my recovery at nine and eleven years of age as you mention my sister thinks he will be one of those who will wish i never had a being but pray when he does come let me hear of it with the first  you think that were it not for that unhappy notion of my moving talent my mamma would relent what would i give to see her once more and although unknown to her to kiss but the hem of her garment  could i have thought that the last time i saw her would have been the last with what difficulty should i have been torn from her embraced feet  and when skreend behind the yewhedge on the  th of april last vol ii p      i saw my father and my uncle antony and my brother and sister how little did i think that that would be the last time i should ever see them and in so short a space that so many dreadful evils would befall me  but i can write nothing but what must give you trouble i will therefore after repeating my desire that you will not intercede for me but with my previous consent conclude with the assurance that i am and ever will be  your most affecionate and dutiful clarissa harlowe  letter lxxxv miss ar harlowe to miss cl harlowe in answer to hers of friday july    p     thursday july    o my unhappy lost sister what a miserable hand have you made of your romantic and giddy expedition i pity you at my heart  you may well grieve and repent  lovelace has left you  in what way or circumstances you know best  i wish your conduct had made your case more pitiable but it is your own seeking  god help you  for you have not a friend will look upon you  poor wicked undone creature  fallen as you are against warning against expostulation against duty  but it signifies nothing to reproach you i weep over you  my poor mamma  your rashness and folly have made her more miserable than you can be yet she has besought my papa to grant your request  my uncles joined with her for they thought there was a little more modesty in your letter than in those of your pert advocate and he is pleased to give me leave to write but only these words for him and no more that he withdraws the curse he laid upon you at the first hearing of your wicked flight so far as it is in his power to do it and hopes that your present punishment may be all you will meet with for the rest he will never own you nor forgive you and grieves he has such a daughter in the world  all this and more you have deserved from him and from all of us but what have you done to this abandoned libertine to deserve what you have met with at his hands  i fear i fear sister  but no more  a blessed four months work have you made of it  my brother is now at edinburgh sent thither by my father though he knows not this to be the motive that he may not meet this triumphant deluder  we are told he would be glad to marry you but why then did he abandon you he had kept you till he was tired of you no question and it is not likely he would wish to have you but upon the terms you have already without all doubt been his  you ought to advise your friend miss how to concern herself less in your matters than she does except she could do it with more decency she has written three letters to me very insolent ones your favourer poor mrs norton thinks you know nothing of the pert creatures writeing i hope you dont but then the more impertinent the writer but believing the fond woman i sat down the more readily to answer your letter and write with less severity than otherwise i should have done if i had answered it at all  monday last was your birthday think poor ungrateful wretch as you are how we all used to keep it and you will not wonder to be told that we ran away from one another that day but god give you true penitence if you have it not already and it will be true if it be equal to the shame and the sorrow you have given us all  your afflicted sister arabella harlowe your cousin morden is every day expected in england he as well as others of the family when he comes to hear what a blessed piece of work you have made of it will wish you never had a being    letter lxxxvi miss clarissa harlowe to miss how sunday july  0 you have given me great pleasure my dearest friend by your approbation of my reasonings and of my resolution founded upon them never to have mr lovelace this approbation is so right a thing give me leave to say from the nature of the case and from the strict honor and true dignity of mind which i always admired in my anna how that i could hardly tell to what but to my evil destiny that of late would not let me please anybody to attribute the advice you gave me to the contrary  but let not the ill state of my health and what that may naturally tend to sadden you i have told you that i will not run away from life nor avoid the means that may continue it if god see fit and if he do not who shall repine at his will  if it shall be found that i have not acted unworthy of your love and of my own character in my greater trials that will be a happiness to both on reflection  the shock which you so earnestly advise me to try to get over was a shock the greatest that i could receive but my dear as it was not incurred by my fault i hope i am already got above it i hope i am  i am more grieved at times however for others than for myself and so i ought for as to myself i cannot but reflect that i have had an escape rather than a loss in missing mr lovelace for a husband even had he not committed the vilest of all outrages  let any one who knows my story collect his character from his behavior to me before that outrage and then judge whether it was in the least probable for such a man to make me happy but to collect his character from his principles with regard to the sex in general and from his enterprises upon many of them and to consider the cruelty of his nature and the sportiveness of his invention together with the high opinion he has of himself it will not be doubted that a wife of his must have been miserable and more miserable if she loved him than if she could have been indifferent to him  a twelvemonth might very probably have put a period to my life situated as i was with my friends persecuted and harassed as i had been by my brother and sister and my very heart torn in pieces by the wilful and as it is now apparent premeditated suspenses of the man whose gratitude i wished to engage and whose protection i was the more entitled to expect as he had robbed me of every other and hating my own family had reduced me to an absolute dependence upon himself this once as i thought all his view and uncomfortable enough for me if it had been all  can it be thought my dear that my heart was not affected happy as i was before i knew mr lovelace by such an unhappy change in my circumstances  nor perhaps was the wicked violence wanting to have cut short though not so very short perhaps a life that he has sported with  had i been his but a month he must have possessed the estate on which my relations had set their hearts the more to their regret as they hated him as much as he hated them  have i not reason these things considered to think myself happier without mr lovelace than with him  my will too unviolated and very little nay not anything as to him to reproach myself with  but with my relations it is otherwise they indeed deserve to be pitied they are and no doubt will long be unhappy  to judge of their resentments and of their conduct we must put ourselves in their situation  and while they think me more in fault than themselves whether my favorers are of their opinion or not and have a right to judge for themselves they ought to have great allowances made for them my parents especially they stand at least selfacquitted that cannot i and the rather as they can recollect to their pain their past indulgencies to me and their unquestionable love  your partiality for the friend you so much value will not easily let you come into this way of thinking but only my dear be pleased to consider the matter in the following light  here was my mother one of the most prudent persons of her sex married into a family not perhaps so happily tempered as herself but every one of which she had the address for a great while absolutely to govern as she pleased by her directing wisdom at the same time that they knew not but her prescriptions were the dictates of their own hearts such a sweet art had she of conquering by seeming to yield think my dear what must be the pride and the pleasure of such a mother that in my brother she could give a son to the family she distinguished with her preferable love not unworthy of their wishes a daughter in my sister of whom she had no reason to be ashamed and in me a second daughter whom everybody complimented such was their partial favor to me as being the still more immediate likeness of herself how selfpleased could she smile round upon a family she had so blessed what compliments were paid her upon the example she had given us which were followed with such hopeful effects with what a noble confidence could she look upon her dear mr harlowe as a person made happy by her and be delighted to think that nothing but purity streamed from a fountain so pure  now my dear reverse as i daily do this charming prospect see my dear mamma sorrowing in her closet endeavoring to suppress her sorrow at her table and in those retirements where sorrow was before a stranger hanging down her pensive head smiles no more beaming over her benign aspect her virtue made to suffer for faults she could not be guilty of her patience continually tried because she has more of it than any other with repetitions of faults she is as much wounded by as those can be from whom she so often hears of them taking to herself as the fountainhead a taint which only had infected one of the undercurrents afraid to open her lips were she willing in my favor lest it should be thought she has any byas in her own mind to failings that never otherwise could have been suspected in her robbed of that conscious merit which the mother of hopeful children may glory in every one who visits her or is visited by her by dumb show and looks that mean more than words can express condoling where they used to congratulate the affected silence wounding the compassionating look reminding the halfsuppressed sigh in them calling up deeper sighs from her and their averted eyes endeavoring to restrain the rising tear provoking tears from her that will not be restrained  when i consider these things and added to these the pangs that tear in pieces my fathers stronger heart because it cannot relieve itself by those tears which carry the torturing grief to the eyes of softer spirits the overboiling tumults of my impatient and uncontrollable brother piqued to the heart of his honor in the fall of a sister in whom he once gloried the pride of an elder sister who had given unwilling way to the honors paid over her head to one born after her and lastly the dishonor i have brought upon two uncles who each contended which should most favor their then happy niece when i say i reflect upon my fault in these strong yet just lights what room can there be to censure anybody but my unhappy self and how much reason have i to say if i justify myself mine own heart shall condemn me if i say i am perfect it shall also prove me perverse  here permit me to lay down my pen for a few moments  you are very obliging to me intentionally i know when you tell me it is in my power to hasten the day of mr hickmans happiness but yet give me leave to say that i admire this kind assurance less than any other paragraph of your letter  in the first place you know it is not in my power to say when i can dismiss my physician and you should not put the celebration of a marriage intended by yourself and so desirable to your mother upon so precarious an issue nor will i accept of a compliment which must mean a slight to her  if anything could give me a relish for life after what i have suffered it would be the hopes of the continuance of the more than sisterly love which has for years uninterruptedly bound us together as one mind  and why my dear should you defer giving by a tie still stronger aoher friend to one who has so few  i am glad you have sent my letter to miss montague i hope i shall hear no more of this unhappy man  i had begun the particulars of my tragical story but it is so painful a task and i have so many more important things to do and as i apprehend so little time to do them in that could i avoid it i would go no farther in it  then to this hour i know not by what means several of his machinations to ruin me were brought about so that some material parts of my sad story must be defective if i were to sit down to write it but i have been thinking of a way that will answer the end wished for by your mother and you full as well perhaps better  mr lovelace it seems has communicated to his friend mr belford all that has passed between himself and me as he went on mr belford has not been able to deny it so that as we may observe by the way a poor young creature whose indiscretion has given a libertine power over her has a reason she little thinks of to regret her folly since these wretches who have no more honor in one point than in another scruple not to make her weakness a part of their triumph to their brother libertines  i have nothing to apprehend of this sort if i have the justice done me in his letters which mr belford assures me that i have and therefore the particulars of my story and the base arts of this vile man will i think be best collected from those very letters of his if mr belford can be prevailed upon to communicate them to which i dare appeal with the same truth and fervor as he did who says  o that one would hear me and that mine adversary had written a book  surely i would take it upon my shoulders and bind it to me as a crown for i covered not my transgressions as adam by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom  there is one way which may be fallen upon to induce mr belford to communicate these letters since he seems to have and declares he always had a sincere abhorrence of his friends baseness to me but that you will say when you hear it is a strange one nevertheless i am very earnest upon it at present  it is no other than this  i think to make mr belford the executor of my last will dont be surprised and with this view i permit his visits with the less scruple and every time i see him from his concern for me am more and more inclined to do so if i hold in the same mind and if he accept the trust and will communicate the materials in his power those joined with what you can furnish will answer the whole end  i know you will start at my notion of such an executor but pray my dear consider in my present circumstances what i can do better as i am empowered to make a will and have considerable matters in my own disposal  your mother i am sure would not consent that you should take this office upon you it might subject mr hickman to the insults of that violent man mrs norton cannot for several reasons respecting herself my brother looks upon what i ought to have as his right my uncle harlowe is already my trustee with my cousin morden for the estate my grandfather left me but you see i could not get from my own family the few pieces i left behind me at harloweplace and my uncle antony once threatened to have my grandfathers will controverted my father  to be sure my dear i could not expect that my father would do all i wish should be done and a will to be executed by a father for a daughter parts of it perhaps absolutely against his own judgment carries somewhat daring and prescriptive in the very word  if indeed my cousin morden were to come in time and would undertake this trust  but even him it might subject to hazards and the more as he is a man of great spirit and as the other man of as great looks upon me unprotected as i have long been as his property  now mr belford knows as i have already mentioned everything that has passed he is a man of spirit and it seems as fearless as the other with more humane qualities you dont know my dear what instances of sincere humanity this mr belford has shown not only on occasion of the cruel arrest but on several occasions since and mrs lovick has taken pains to inquire after his general character and hears a very good one of him for justice and generosity in all his concerns of meum and tuum as they are called he has a knowledge of lawmatters and has two executorships upon him at this time in the discharge of which his honor is unquestioned  all these reasons have already in a manner determined me to ask this favor of him although it will have an odd sound with it to make an intimate friend of mr lovelace my executor  this is certain my brother will be more acquiescent a great deal in such a case with the articles of my will as he will see that it will be to no purpose to controvert some of them which else i dare say he would controvert or persuade my other friends to do so and who would involve an executor in a lawsuit if they could help it which would be the case if anybody were left whom my brother could hope to awe or control since my father who is governed by him has possession of all nor would i wish you may believe to have effects torn out of my fathers hands while mr belford who is a man of fortune and a good oeconomist in his own affairs would have no interest but to do justice  then he exceedingly presses for some occasion to show his readiness to serve me and he would be able to manage his violent friend over whom he has more influence than any other person  but after all i know not if it were not more eligible by far that my story should be forgotten as soon as possible and myself too and of this i shall have the less doubt if the character of my parents cannot be guarded you will forgive me my dear from the unqualified bitterness which from your affectionate zeal for me has sometimes mingled with your ink a point that ought and i insist upon it must be well considered of if anything be done which your mother and you are desirous should be done  my father has been so good as to take off from me the heavy malediction he laid me under i must be now solicitous for a last blessing and that is all i shall presume to ask my sisters letter communicating this grace is a severe one but as she writes to me as from everybody how could i expect it to be otherwise  if you set out tomorrow this letter cannot reach you till you get to your aunt harmans i shall therefore direct it thither as mr hickman instructed me  i hope you will have met with no inconveniences in your little journey and voyage and that you will have found in good health all whom you wish to see well  let me recommend to you my dear that if your friends and relations in the little island join their solicitations with your mothers commands to have your nuptials celebrated before you leave them you do not refuse to oblige them how grateful will the notification that you have done so be to  your everfaithful and affectionate cl harlowe  letter lxxxvii miss cl harlowe to miss harlowe saturday july    i repine not my dear sister at the severity you have been pleased to express in the letter you favored me with because that severity was accompanied with the grace i had petitioned for and because the reproaches of my own heart are stronger than any other persons reproaches can be although i am not half so culpable as i am imagined to be as would be allowed if all the circumstances of my unhappy story were known and which i shall be ready to communicate to mrs norton if she be commissioned to inquire into them or to you my sister if you can have patience to hear them  i remembered with a bleeding heart what day the   th of july was i began with the eve of it and i passed the day itself  as it was fit i should pass it nor have i any comfort to give to my dear and everhonoured father and mother and to you my bella but this  that as it was the first unhappy anniversary of my birth in all probability it will be the last  believe me my dear sister i say not this merely to move compassion but from the best grounds and as i think it of the highest importance to my peace of mind to obtain one further favor i would choose to owe to your intercession as my sister the leave i beg to address half a dozen lines with the hope of having them answered as i wish to either or to both my honored parents to beg their last blessing  this blessing is all the favor i have now to ask it is all i dare to ask yet am afraid to rush at once though by letter into the presence of either and if i did not ask it it might seem to be owing to stubbornness and want of duty when my heart is all humility and penitence only be so good as to embolden me to attempt this task write but this one line clary harlowe you are at liberty to write as you desire this will be enough  and shall to my last hour be acknowleged as the greatest favor by  your truly penitent sister clarissa harlowe  letter lxxxviii mrs norton to miss clarissa harlowe monday july    my dearest young lady i must indeed own that i took the liberty to write to your mamma offering to enclose to her if she gave me leave yours of the   th by which i thought she would see what was the state of your mind what the nature of your last troubles was from the wicked arrest what the people are where you lodge what proposals were made you from lord ms family also your sincere penitence and how much miss howes writing to them in the terms she wrote in disturbed you  but as you have taken the matter into your own hands and forbid me in your last to act in this nice affair unknown to you i am glad the letter was not required of me and indeed it may be better that the matter lie wholly between you and them since my affection for you is thought to proceed from partiality  they would choose no doubt that you should owe to themselves and not to my humble mediation the favor you so earnestly sue for and which i would not have you despair of for i will venture to assure you that your mother is ready to take the first opportunity to show her maternal tenderness for you and this i gather from several hints i am not at liberty to explain myself upon  i long to be with you now i am better and now my son is in a fine way of recovery but is it not hard to have it signified to me that at present it will not be taken well if i go  i suppose while the reconciliation which i hope will take place is negotiating by means of the correspondence so newly opened between you and your sister but if you would have me come i will rely on my good intentions and risque everyones displeasure  mr brand has business in town to solicit for a benefice which it is expected the incumbent will be obliged to quit for a better preferment and when there he is to inquire privately after your way of life and of your health  he is a very officious young man and but that your uncle harlowe who has chosen him for this errand regards him as an oracle your mother had rather anybody else had been sent  he is one of those puzzling overdoing gentlemen who think they see farther into matters than anybody else and are fond of discoering mysteries where there are none in order to be thought a shrewd man  i cannot say i like him either in the pulpit or out of it i who had a father one of the soundest divines and finest scholars in the kingdom who never made an ostentation of what he knew but loved and venerated the gospel he taught preferring it to all other learning to be obliged to hear a young man depart from his text as soon as he has named it so contrary too to the example set him by his learned and worthy principal dr lewin  when his health permits him to preach and throwing about to a christian and country audience scraps of latin and greek from the pagan classics and not always brought in with great propriety neither if i am to judge by the only way given me to judge of them by the english he puts them into is an indication of something wrong either in his head or his heart or both for otherwise his education at the university must have taught him better you know my dear miss clary the honor i have for the cloth it is owing to that that i say what i do  i know not the day he is to set out and as his inquiries are to be private be pleased to take no notice of this intelligence i have no doubt that your life and conversation are such as may defy the scrutinies of the most officious inquirer  i am just now told that you have written a second letter to your sister but am afraid they will wait for mr brands report before further favor will be obtained from them for they will not yet believe you are so ill as i fear you are  but you would soon find that you have an indulgent mother were she at liberty to act according to her own inclination and this gives me great hopes that all will end well at last for i verily think you are in the right way to a reconciliation god give a blessing to it and restore your health and you to all your friends prays  your everaffectionate servant judith norton your good mamma has privately sent me five guineas she is pleased to say to help us in the illness we have been afflicted with but more likely that i might send them to you as from myself i hope therefore i may send them up with ten more i have still left  i will send you word of mr mordens arrival the moment i know it  if agreeable i should be glad to know all that passes between your relations and you    letter lxxxix miss clarissa harlowe to mrs norton wednesday aug   you give me my dear mrs norton great pleasure in hearing of yours and your sons recovery may you continue for many many years a blessing to each other  you tell me that you did actually write to my mamma offering to enclose mine of the   th past and you say it was not required of you that is to say although you cover it over as gently as you could that your offer was rejected which makes it evident that no plea will be heard for me yet you bid me hope that the grace i sued for would in time be granted  the grace i then sued for was indeed granted but you are afraid you say that they will wait for mr brands report before favor will be obtained in return to the second letter which i wrote to my sister and you add that i have an indulgent mamma were she at liberty to act according to her own inclination and that all will end well at last  but what my dear mrs norton what is the grace i sue for in my second letter  it is not that they will receive me into favor  if they think it is they are mistaken i do not i cannot expect that nor as i have often said should i if they would receive me bear to live in the eye of those dear friends whom i have so grievously offended it is only simply a blessing i ask a blessing to die with not to live with  do they know that and do they know that their unkindness will perhaps shorten my date so that their favor if ever they intend to grant it may come too late  once more i desire you not to think of coming to me i have no uneasiness now but what proceeds from the apprehension of seeing a man i would not see for the world if i could help it and from the severity of my nearest and dearest relations a severity entirely their own i doubt for you tell me that my brother is at edinburgh you would therefore heighten their severity and make yourself enemies besides if you were to come to me  dont you see that you would  mr brand may come if he will he is a clergyman and must mean well or i must think so let him say of me what he will all my fear is that as he knows i am in disgrace with a family whose esteem he is desirous to cultivate and as he has obligations to my uncle harlowe and to my father he will be but a languid acquitter not that i am afraid of what he or anybody in the world can hear as to my conduct you may my beloved and dear friend indeed you may rest satisfied that that is such as may warrant me to challenge the inquiries of the most officious  i will send you copies of what passes as you desire when i have an answer to my second letter i now begin to wish that i had taken the heart to write to my father himself or to my mother at least instead of to my sister and yet i doubt my poor mother can do nothing for me of herself a strong confederacy my dear mrs norton a strong confederacy indeed against a poor girl their daughter sister niece  my brother perhaps got it renewed before he left them he needed not  his work is done and more than done  dont afflict yourself about moneymatters on my account i have no occasion for money i am glad my mother was so considerate to you i was in pain for you on the same subject but heaven will not permit so good a woman to want the humble blessings she was always satisfied with i wish every individual of our family were but as rich as you  o my mamma norton you are rich you are rich indeed  the true riches are such content as you are blessed with  and i hope in god that i am in the way to be rich too  adieu my everindulgent friend you say all will be at last happy  and i know it will  i confide that it will with as much security as you may that i will be to my last hour  your evergrateful and affectionate cl harlowe  letter xc mr lovelace to john belford esquire tuesday aug   i am most confoundedly chagrined and disappointed for here on saturday arrived a messenger from miss how with a letter to my cousins see letter lxxx p      which i knew nothing of till yesterday when my two aunts were procured to be here to sit in judgment upon it with the old peer and my two kinswomen and never was bear so miserably baited as thy poor friend  and for what  why for the cruelty of miss harlowe for have i committed any new offense and would i not have succeeded in her favor upon her own terms if i could and is it fair to punish me for what is my misfortune and not my fault such eventjudging fools as i have for my relations i am ashamed of them all  in that of miss how was enclosed one to her from miss harlowe see letter lxxvi p      to be sent to my cousins containing a final rejection of me and that in very vehement and positive terms yet pretends that in this rejection she is governed more by principle than passion  damned lie as ever was told and as a proof that she is says that she can forgive me and does on this one condition that i will never molest her more the whole letter so written as to make herself more admired me more detested  what we have been told of the agitations and workings and sighings and sobbings of the french prophets among us formerly were nothing at all to the scene exhibited by these maudlin souls at the reading of these letters and of some affecting passages extracted from another of my fair implacables to miss how  such lamentations for the loss of so charming a relation such applaudings of her virtue of her exaltedness of soul and sentiment such menaces of disinherisons i not needing their reproaches to be stung to the heart with my own reflections and with the rage of disappointment and as sincerely as any of them admiring her  what the devil cried i is all this for  is it not enough to be despised and rejected can i help her implacable spirit  would i not repair the evils i have made her suffer  then was i ready to curse them all herself and miss how for company  and heartily i swore that she should yet be mine  i now swear it overagain to thee  were her death to follow in a week after the knot is tied by the lord of heaven it shall be tied and she shall die a lovelace  tell her so if thou will but at the same time tell her that i have no view to her fortune and that i will solemnly resign that and all pretensions to it in whose favor she pleases if she resign life issueless  i am not so lowminded a wretch as to be guilty of any sordid views to her fortune let her judge for herself then whether it be not for her honor rather to leave this world a lovelace than a harlowe  but do not think i will entirely rest a cause so near my heart upon an advocate who so much more admires his clients adversary than his client i will go to town in a few days in order to throw myself at her feet bringing with me or having at hand a resolute wellprepared parson and the ceremony shall be performed let what will be the consequence  but if she will permit me to attend her for this purpose at either of the churches mentioned in the license which she has by her and thank heaven has not returned me with my letters then will i not disturb her but meet her at the altar in either church and will engage to bring my two cousins to attend her and even lady sarah and lady betty and my lord m in person to give her to me  or if it will be still more agreeable to her i will undertake that either or both my aunts shall go to town and attend her down and the marriage shall be celebrated in theirs and lord ms presence here or elsewhere at her own choice  do not play me booty belford but sincerely and warmly use all the eloquence thou art master of to prevail upon her to choose one of these three methods one of them she must choose  by my soul she must  here is charlotte tapping at my closetdoor for admittance what a devil wants charlotte  i will bear no more reproaches  come in girl  my cousin charlotte finding me writing on with too much earnestness to have any regard for politeness to her and guessing at my subject besought me to let her see what i had written  i obliged her and she was so highly pleased on seeing me so much in earnest that she offered and i accepted her offer to write herself to miss harlowe with permission to treat me in it as she thought fit  i shall enclose a copy of her letter  when she had written it she brought it to me with apologies for the freedom taken with me in it but i excused it and she was ready to give me a kiss for joy of my approbation and i gave her two for writing it telling her i had hopes of success from it and that i thought she had luckily hit it off  everyone approves of it as well as i and is pleased with me for so patiently submitting to be abused and undertaken for  if it do not succeed all the blame will be thrown upon the dear creatures perverseness her charitable or forgiving disposition about which she makes such a parade will be justly questioned and the pity of which she is now in full possession will be transferred to me  putting therefore my whole confidence in this letter i postpone all my other alternatives as also my going to town till my empress send an answer to my cousin montague  but if she persist and will not promise to take time to consider of the matter thou may communicate to her what i had written as above before my cousin entered and if she be still perverse assure her that i must and will see her  but this with all honor all humility and if i cannot move her in my favor i will then go abroad and perhaps never more return to england  i am sorry thou art at this critical time so busily employed as thou informest me thou art in thy watford affairs and in preparing to do belton justice if thou want my assistance in the latter command me though engrossed and plagued as i am with this perverse beauty i will obey thy first summons  i have great dependence upon thy zeal and thy friendship hasten back to her therefore and resume a task so interesting to me that it is equally the subject of my dreams as of my waking hours  letter xci miss montague to miss clar harlowe tuesday aug   dearest madam all our family is deeply sensible of the injuries you have received at the hands of one of it whom you only can render in any manner worthy of the relation he stands in to us all and if as an act of mercy and charity the greatest your pious heart can show you will be pleased to look over his past wickedness and ingratitude and suffer yourself to be our kinswoman you will make us the happiest family in the world and i can engage that lord m and lady sarah sadleir and lady betty lawrance and my sister who are all admirers of your virtues and of your nobleness of mind will for ever love and reverence you and do everything in all our powers to make you amends for what you have suffered from mr lovelace this madam we should not however dare to petition for were we not assured that he is most sincerely sorry for his past vileness to you and that he will on his knees beg your pardon and vow eternal love and honor to you  wherefore my dearest cousin how you will charm us all if this agreeable style may be permitted for all our sakes for his souls sake you must i am sure be so good a lady as to wish to save a soul and allow me to say for your own fames sake condescend to our joint requests and if by way of encouragement you will but say you will be glad to see and to be as much known personally as you are by fame to charlotte montague i will in two days time from the receipt of your permission wait upon you with or without my sister and receive your further commands  let me our dearest cousin we cannot deny ourselves the pleasure of calling you so let me entreat you to give me your permission for my journey to london and put it in the power of lord m and of the ladies of the family to make you what reparation they can make you for the injuries which a person of the greatest merit in the world has received from one of the most audacious men in it and you will infinitely oblige us all and particularly her who repeatedly presumes to style herself  your affectionate cousin and obliged servant charlotte montague  letter xcii mr belford to robert lovelace esquire thursday morning aug   six oclock i have been so much employed in my own and beltons affairs that i could not come to town till last night having contented myself with sending to mrs lovick to know from time to time the state of the ladys health of which i received but very indifferent accounts owing in a great measure to letters or advices brought her from her implacable family  i have now completed my own affairs and next week shall go to epsom to endeavor to put beltons sister into possession of his own house for him after which i shall devote myself wholly to your service and to that of the lady  i was admitted to her presence last night and found her visibly altered for the worse when i went home i had your letter of tuesday last put into my hands let me tell thee lovelace that i insist upon the performance of thy engagement to me that thou will not personally molest her  mr belford dates again on thursday morning  0 of clock and gives an account of a conversation which he had just held with the lady upon the subject of miss montagues letter to her preceding and upon mr lovelaces alternatives as mentioned in letter no xc which mr belford supported with the utmost earnestness but as the result of this conversation will be found in the subsequent letters mr belfords pleas and arguments and the ladys answers are omitted letter xciii miss clarissa harlowe to miss montague thursday aug   dear madam i am infinitely obliged to you for your kind and condescending letter a letter however which heightens my regrets as it gives me a new instance of what a happy creature i might have been in an alliance so much approved of by such worthy ladies and which on their accounts and on that of lord m would have been so reputable to myself and once so desirable  but indeed indeed madam my heart sincerely repulses the man who descended from such a family could be guilty first of such premeditated violence as he has been guilty of and as he knows further intended me on the night previous to the day he set out for berkshire and next pretending to spirit be so mean as to wish to lift into that family a person he was capable of abasing into a companionship with the most abandoned of her sex  allow me then dear madam to declare with fervor that i think i never could deserve to be ranked with the ladies of a family so splendid and so noble if by vowing love and honor at the altar to such a violator i could sanctify as i may say his unprecedented and elaborate wickedness  permit me however to make one request to my good lord m and to the two ladies his lordships sisters and to your kind self and your sister  it is that you will all be pleased to join your authority and interests to prevail upon mr lovelace not to molest me further  be pleased to tell him that if i am designed for life it will be very cruel in him to attempt to hunt me out of it for i am determined never to see him more if i can help it the more cruel because he knows that i have nobody to protect me from him nor do i wish to engage anybody to his hurt or to their own  if i am on the other hand destined for death it will be no less cruel if he will not permit me to die in peace  since a peaceable and happy end i wish him indeed i do  every worldly good attend you dear madam and every branch of the honorable family is the wish of one whose misfortune it is that she is obliged to disclaim any other title than that of  dear madam your and their obliged and faithful servant clarissa harlowe  letter xciv mr belford to robert lovelace esquire thursday afternoon aug   i am just now agreeably surprised by the following letter delivered into my hands by a messenger from the lady the letter she mentions as enclosed see miss montagues letter preceding  i have returned without taking a copy of it the contents of it will soon be communicated to you i presume by another way they contain an absolute rejection of thee  poor lovelace   to john belford esquire aug   sir you have frequently offered to oblige me in anything that shall be within your power and i have such an opinion of you as to be willing to hope you meant me at the times more than mere compliment  i have therefore two requests to make to you the first i will now mention the other if this shall be complied with otherwise not  it behooves me to leave behind me such an account as may clear up my conduct to several of my friends who will not at present concern themselves about me and mis how and her mother are very solicitous that i will do so  i am apprehensive that i shall not have time to do this and you will not wonder that i have less and less inclination to set about such a painful task especially as i find myself unable to look back with patience on what i have suffered and shall be too much discomposed by it to proceed with the requisite temper in a task of still greater importance which i have before me  it is very evident to me that your wicked friend has given you from time to time a circumstantial account of all his behavior to me and devices against me and you have more than once assured me that both by writing and speech he has done my character all the justice i could wish for  now sir if i may have a fair a faithful specimen from his letters or accounts to you upon some of the most interesting occasions i shall be able to judge whether there will or will not be a necessity for me for my honors sake to enter upon the solicited task  you may be assured from my enclosed answer to the letter which miss montague has honored me with and which you will be pleased to return me as soon as read that it is impossible for me ever to think of your friend in the way i am importuned to think of him he cannot therefore receive any detriment from the requested specimen and i give you my honor that no use shall be made of it to his prejudice in law or otherwise and that it may not after i am no more i assure you that it is a main part of my view that the passages you shall oblige me with shall be always in your own power and not in that of any other person  if sir you think fit to comply with my request the passages i would wish to be transcribed making neither better nor worse of the matter are those which he has written to you on or about the  th and  th of june when i was alarmed by the wicked pretense of a fire and what he has written from sunday june    to the   th and in doing this you will much oblige  your humble servant cl harlowe   now lovelace since there are no hopes for thee of her returning favor since some praise may lie for thy ingenuity having never offered as more diminutiveminded libertines would have done to palliate thy crimes by aspersing the lady or her sex since she may be made easier by it since thou must fare better from thy own pen than from hers and finally since thy actions have manifested that thy letters are not the most guilty part of what she knows of thee i see not why i may not oblige her upon her honor and under the restrictions and for the reasons she has given and this without breach of the confidence due to friendly communications especially as i might have added since thou gloriest in thy pen and in thy wickedness and can not be ashamed  but be this as it may she will be obliged before thy remonstrances or clamours against it can come so prythee now make the best of it and rave not except for the sake of a pretense against me and to exercise thy talent of execration  and if thou likest to do so for these reasons rave and welcome  i long to know what the second request is but this i know that if it be anything less than cutting thy throat or endangering my own neck i will certainly comply and be proud of having it in my power to oblige her  and now i am actually going to be busy in the extracts  letter xcv mr belford to miss clarissa harlowe aug     madam you have engaged me to communicate to you upon honor making neither better nor worse of the matter what mr lovelace has written to me in relation to yourself in the period preceding your going to hamstead and in that between the   th and   th of june and you assure me you have no view in this request but to see if it be necessary for you from the account he gives to touch the painful subjects yourself for the sake of your own character  your commands madam are of a very delicate nature as they may seem to affect the secrets of private friendship but as i know you are not capable of a view the motives to which you will not own and as i think the communication may do some credit to my unhappy friends character as an ingenuous man though his actions by the most excellent woman in the world have lost him all title to that of an honorable one i obey you with the greater cheerfulness  he then proceeds with his extracts and concludes them with an address to her in his friends behalf in the following words and now madam i have fulfilled your commands and i hope not disserved my friend with you since you will hereby see the justice he does to your virtue in every line he writes he does the same in all his letters though to his own condemnation and give me leave to add that if this everamiable sufferer could but think it in any manner consistent with her honor to receive his vows at the altar on his truly penitent turn of mind i have not the least doubt but that he would make her the best and tenderest of husbands what obligation would not the admirable lady hereby lay upon all his noble family who so greatly admire her and i will presume to say upon her own when the unhappy family aversion which certainly has been carried to an unreasonable height against him is got over and a general reconciliation take place for who is it that would not give these two admirable persons to each other were not his morals an objection  however this be i would humbly refer to you madam whether as you will be mistress of very delicate particulars from me his friend you should not in honor think yourself concerned to pass them by as if you had never seen them and not to take any advantage of the communication not even in argument as some perhaps might lie with respect to the premeditated design he seems to have had not against you as you but as against the sex over whom i am sorry i can bear witness myself it is the villainous aim of all libertines to triumph and i would not if any misunderstanding should arise between him and me give him room to reproach me that his losing of you or through his usage of you his losing of his own friends were owing to what perhaps he would call breach of trust were he to judge rather by the events if such should happen than by my intention  i am madam with the most profound veneration  your most faithful humble servant j belford  letter xcvi miss cl harlowe to john belford esquire friday aug   sir i hold myself extremely obliged to you for your communications i will make no use of them that you shall have reason to reproach either yourself or me with i wanted no new lights to make the unhappy mans premeditated baseness to me unquestionable as my answer to miss montagues letter might convince you see letter xciii   i must own in his favor that he has observed some decency in his accounts to you of the most indecent and shocking actions and if all his strangelycommunicative narrations are equally decent nothing will be rendered criminally odious by them but the vile heart that could meditate such contrivances as were much stronger evidences of his inhumanity than of his wit since men of very contemptible parts and understanding may succeed in the vilest attempts if they can get above regarding the moral sanctions which bind man to man and sooner upon an innocent heart than upon any other because knowing its own integrity it is the less apt to suspect that of others  i find i have had great reason to think myself obliged to your intention in the whole progress of my sufferings it is however impossible sir to miss the natural inference on this occasion that lies against his predetermined baseness but i say the less because you shall not think i borrow from your communications aggravations that are not needed  and now sir that i may spare you the trouble of offering any future arguments in his favor let me tell you that i have weighed everything thoroughly all that human vanity could suggest all that a desirable reconciliation with my friends and the kind respects of his own could bid me hope for the enjoyment of miss howes friendship the dearest consideration to me now of all worldly ones all these i have weighed and the result is and was before you favored me with these communications that i have more satisfaction in the hope that in one month there will be an end of all with me than in the most agreeable things that could happen from an alliance with mr lovelace although i were to be assured he would make the best and tenderest of husbands but as to the rest if satisfied with the evils he has brought upon me he will forbear all further persecutions of me i will to my last hour wish him good although he has overwhelmed the fatherless and dug a pit for his friend fatherless may she well be called and motherless too who has been denied all paternal protection and motherly forgiveness  and now sir acknowleging gratefully your favor in the extracts i come to the second part of my request which requires a great deal of courage to mention to you and which courage nothing but a great deal of distress and a very destitute condition can give but if improper i can but be denied and dare to say i shall be at least excused thus then i preface it  you see sir that i am thrown absolutely into the hands of strangers who although as kind and compassionate as strangers can be wished to be are nevertheless persons from whom i cannot expect anything more than pity and good wishes nor can my memory receive from them any more protection than my person if either should need it  if then i request it of the only gentleman possessed of materials that will enable him to do my character justice  and who has courage independence and ability to oblige me  to be the protector of my memory as i may say  and to be my executor and to see some of my dying requests performed  and if i leave it to him to do the whole in his own way manner and time consulting however in requisite cases my dear miss how  i presume to hope that this part of my request may be granted  and if it may these satisfactions will accrue to me from the favor done me and the office undertaken  it will be an honor to my memory with all those who shall know that i was so well satisfied of my innocence that having not time to write my own story i could entrust it to the relation which the destroyer of my fame and fortunes has given of it  i shall not be apprehensive of involving any one in troubles or hazards by this task either with my own relations or with your friend having dispositions to make which perhaps my own friends will not be so well pleased with as it were to be wished they would be for i intend not unreasonable ones but you know sir where self is judge matters even with good people will not always be rightly judged of  i shall also be freed from the pain of recollecting things that my soul is vexed at and this at a time when its tumults should be allayed in order to make way for the most important preparation  and who knows but that the man who already from a principle of humanity is touched at my misfortunes when he comes to revolve the whole story placed before him in one strong light and when he shall have the catastrophe likewise before him and shall become in a manner interested in it who knows but that from a still higher principle he may so regulate his future actions as to find his own reward in the everlasting welfare which is wished him by his  obliged servant clarissa harlowe  letter xcvii mr belford to miss clarissa harlowe friday aug   madam i am so sensible of the honor done me in yours of this day that i would not delay for one moment the answering of it i hope you will live to see many happy years and to be your own executrix in those points which your heart is most set upon but in case of survivorship i most cheerfully accept of the sacred office you are pleased to offer me and you may absolutely rely upon my fidelity and if possible upon the literal performance of every article you shall injoin me  the effect of the kind wish you conclude with has been my concern ever since i have been admitted to the honor of your conversation it shall be my whole endeavor that it be not vain the happiness of approaching you which this trust as i presume will give me frequent opportunities of doing must necessarily promote the desirable end since it will be impossible to be a witness of your piety equanimity and other virtues and not aspire to emulate you all i beg is that you will not suffer any future candidate or event to displace me unless some new instances of unworthiness appear either in the morals or behavior of  madam your most obliged and faithful servant j belford  letter xcviii mr belford to robert lovelace esquire friday night aug   i have actually delivered to the lady the extracts she requested me to give her from thy letters i do assure thee that i have made the very best of the matter for thee not that conscience but that friendship could oblige me to make i have changed or omitted some free words the warm description of her person in the firescene as i may call it i have omitted i have told her that i have done justice to you in the justice you have done to her unexampled virtue but take the very words which i wrote to her immediately following the extracts  and now madam  see the paragraph marked with inverted commas thus p   0  the lady is extremely uneasy at the thoughts of your attempting to visit her for heavens sake your word being given and for pitys sake for she is really in a very weak and languishing way let me beg of you not to think of it  yesterday afternoon she received a cruel letter as mrs lovick supposes it to be by the effect it had upon her from her sister in answer to one written last saturday entreating a blessing and forgiveness from her parents  she acknowleges that if all thy letters are written with equal decency and justice as i have assured her they are she shall think herself freed from the necessity of writeing her own story and this is an advantage to the accruing from the extracts i have obliged her with though thou perhaps wilt not thank me for so doing  but what think thou is the second request she had to make to me no other than that i would be her executor  her motives will appear before thee in proper time and then i dare answer for them will be satisfactory  you cannot imagine how proud i am of this trust i am afraid i shall too soon come into the execution of it as she is always writing what a melancholy pleasure will the perusal and disposition of her papers afford me such a sweetness of temper so much patience and resignation as she seems to be mistress of yet writing of and in the midst of present distresses how much more lively and affecting for that reason must her style be than all that can be read in the dry narrative unanimated style of persons relating difficulties and dangers surmounted the minds of such not laboring in suspense not tortured by the pangs of uncertainty about events still hidden in the womb of fate but on the contrary perfectly at ease the relater unmoved by his own story how then able to move the hearer or reader  saturday morning aug   i am just returned from visiting the lady and thanking her in person for the honor she has done me and assuring her if called to the sacred trust of the utmost fidelity and exactness i found her very ill i took notice of it she said she had received a second hardhearted letter from her sister and she had been writing a letter and that on her knees directly to her mother which before she had not the courage to do it was for a last blessing and forgiveness no wonder she said that i saw her affected now that i had accepted of the last charitable office for her for which as well as for complying with her other request she thanked me i should one day have all these letters before me and could she have a kind one in return to that she had been now writing to counterbalance the unkind one she had from her sister she might be induced to show me both together  i knew she would be displeased if i had censured the cruelty of her relations i therefore only said that surely she must have enemies who hoped to find their account in keeping up the resentments of her friends against her  it may be so mr belford said she the unhappy never want enemies one fault wilfully committed authorizes the imputation of many more where the ear is opened to accusations accusers will not be wanting and everyone will officiously come with stories against a disgraced child where nothing dare be said in her favor i should have been wise in time and not have needed to be convinced by my own misfortunes of the truth of what common experience daily demonstrates mr lovelaces baseness my fathers inflexibility my sisters reproaches are the natural consequences of my own rashness so i must make the best of my hard lot only as these consequences follow one another so closely while they are new how can i help being anew affected  i asked if a letter written by myself by her doctor or apothecary to any of her friends representing her low state of health and great humility would be acceptable or if a journey to any of them would be of service i would gladly undertake it in person and strictly conform to her orders to whomsoever she would direct me to apply  she earnestly desired that nothing of this sort might be attempted especially without her knowledge and consent miss how she said had done harm by her kindlyintended zeal and if there were room to expect favor by mediation she had ready at hand a kind friend mrs norton who for piety and prudence had few equals and who would let slip no opportunity to do her service  i let her know that i was going out of town till monday she wished me pleasure and said she should be glad to see me on my return  adieu letter xcix miss ar harlowe to miss cr harlowe in answer to hers of saturday july    p     thursday morn aug   sister clary i wish you would not trouble me with any more of your letters you had always a knack at writing and depended upon making every one do what you would when you wrote but your wit and your folly have undone you and now as all naughty creatures do when they cannot help themselves you come begging and praying and make others as uneasy as yourself  when i wrote last to you i expected that i should not be at rest  and so you would creep on by little and little till you will want to be received again  but you only hope for forgiveness and a blessing you say a blessing for what sister clary think for what  however i read your letter to my father and mother  i will not tell you what my papa said  one who has the true sense you boast to have of your misdeeds may guess without my telling you what a justly incensed father would say on such an occasion  my poor mamma  o wretch what has not your ungrateful folly cost my poor mamma  had you been less a darling you would not perhaps have been so graceless but i never in my life saw a cockerd favorite come to good  my heart is full and i cannot help writing my mind for your crimes have disgraced us all and i am afraid and ashamed to go to any public or private assemblee or diversion and why  i need not say why when your actions are the subjects either of the open talk or of the affronting whispers of both sexes at all such places  upon the whole i am sorry i have no more comfort to send you but i find nobody willing to forgive you i dont know what time may do for you and when it is seen that your penitence is not owing more to disappointment than true conviction for it is too probable miss clary that had you gone on as swimmingly as you expected and had not your featherheaded villain abandoned you we should have heard nothing of these moving supplications nor of anything but defiances from him and a guilt gloried in from you and this is everyones opinion as well as that of  your grieved sister arabella harlowe i send this by a particular hand who undertakes to give it you or leave it for you by tomorrow night    letter c miss clarissa harlowe to her mother sat aug   honored madam no selfconvicted criminal ever approached her angry and just judge with greater awe nor with a truer contrition than i do you by these lines  indeed i must say that if the matter of my humble prayer had not respected my future welfare i had not dared to take this liberty but my heart is set upon it as upon a thing next to god almightys forgiveness necessary for me  had my happy sister known my distresses she would not have wrung my heart as she has done by a severity which i must needs think unkind and unsisterly  but complaint of any unkindness from her belongs not to me yet as she is pleased to write that it must be seen that my penitence is less owing to disappointment than to true conviction permit me madam to insist upon it that i am actually entitled to the blessing i sue for since my humble prayer is founded upon a true and unfeigned repentance and this you will the readier believe if the creature who never to the best of her remembrance told her mamma a wilful falsehood may be credited when she declares as she does in the most solemn manner that she met the seducer with a determination not to go off with him that the rash step was owing more to compulsion than infatuation and that her heart was so little in it that she repented and grieved from the moment she found herself in his power and for every moment after for several weeks before she had any cause from him to apprehend the usage she met with  wherefore on my knees my everhonoured mamma for on my knees i write this letter i do most humbly beg your blessing say but in so many words i ask you not to call me your daughter  lost unhappy wretch i forgive you and may god bless you  this is all let me on a blessed scrap of paper but see one sentence to this effect under your dear hand that i may hold it to my heart in my most trying struggles and i shall think it a passport to heaven and if i do not too much presume and it were we instead of i and both your honored names subjoined to it i should then have nothing more to wish then would i say great and merciful god thou see here in this paper thy poor unworthy creature absolved by her justlyoffended parents o join for my redeemers sake thy allgracious fiat and receive a repentant sinner to the arms of thy mercy  i can conjure you madam by no subject of motherly tenderness that will not in the opinion of my severe censurers before whom this humble address must appear add to my reproach let me therefore for gods sake prevail upon you to pronounce me blessed and forgiven since you will thereby sprinkle comfort through the last hours of  your clarissa harlowe  letter ci miss montague to miss cl harlowe in answer to hers of thursday aug   see p     monday aug   dear madam we were all of opinion before your letter came that mr lovelace was utterly unworthy of you and deserved condign punishment rather than the blessing of such a wife and hoped far more from your kind consideration for us than any we supposed you could have for so base an injurer for we were all determined to love you and admire you let his behavior to you be what it would  but after your letter what can be said  i am however commanded to write in all the subscribing names to let you know how greatly your sufferings have affected us to tell you that my lord m has forbid him ever more to darken the doors of the apartments where he shall be and as you labor under the unhappy effects of your friends displeasure which may subject you to inconveniences his lordship and lady sarah and lady betty beg of you to accept for your life or at least till you are admitted to enjoy your own estate of one hundred guineas per quarter which will be regularly brought you by an especial hand and of the enclosed bank bill for a beginning and do not dearest madam we all beseech you do not think you are beholden for this token of lord ms and lady sarahs and lady bettys love to you to the friends of this vile man for he has not one friend left among us  we each of us desire to be favored with a place in your esteem and to be considered upon the same foot of relationship as if what once was so much our pleasure to hope would be had been and it shall be our united prayer that you may recover health and spirits and live to see many happy years and since this wretch can no more be pleaded for that when he is gone abroad as he now is preparing to do we may be permitted the honor of a personal acquaintance with a lady who has no equal these are the earnest requests dearest young lady of  your affectionate friends and most faithful servants m sarah sadleir eliz lawrance charl montague marth montague  you will break the hearts of the three firstnamed more particularly if you refuse them your acceptance dearest miss harlowe punish not them for his crimes we send by a particular hand which will bring us we hope your accepting favor  mr lovelace writes by the same hand but he knows nothing of ours nor we of his for we shun each other and one part of the house holds us another him the remotest from each other    letter cii mr lovelace to john belford esquire sat aug   i am so excessively disturbed at the contents of miss harlowes answer to my cousin charlottes letter of tuesday last which was given her by the same fellow that gave me yours that i have hardly patience or consideration enough to weigh what you write  she had need indeed to cry out for mercy herself from her friends who knows not how to show any she is a true daughter of the harlowes  by my soul jack she is a true daughter of the harlowes yet has she so many excellencies that i must love her and fool that i am love her the more for her despising me  thou runnest on with thy cursed nonsensical reformadorote of dying dying dying and having once got the word by the end can not help foisting it in at every period the devil take me if i dont think thou would give her poison with thy own hands rather than she should recover and rob thee of the merit of being a conjurer  but no more of thy cursed knell thy changes upon deaths candlestick turned bottomupwards she will live to bury me i see that for by my soul i can neither eat drink nor sleep nor what is still worse love any woman in the world but her nor care i to look upon a woman now on the contrary i turn my head from every one i meet except by chance an eye an air a feature strikes me resembling hers in some glancingby face and then i cannot forbear looking again though the second look recovers me for there can be nobody like her  but surely belford the devils in this lady the more i think of her nonsense and obstinacy the less patience i have with her is it possible she can do herself her family her friends so much justice any other way as by marrying me were she sure she should live but a day she ought to die a wife if her christian revenge will not let her wish to do so for her own sake ought she not for the sake of her family and of her sex which she pretends sometimes to have so much concern for and if no sake is dear enough to move her harlowespirit in my favor has she any title to the pity thou so pitifully art always bespeaking for her  as to the difference which her letter has made between me and the stupid family here and i must tell thee we are all broke in pieces i value not that of a button they are fools to anathematize and curse me who can give them ten curses for one were they to hold it for a day together  i have one half of the house to myself and that the best for the great enjoy that least which costs them most grandeur and use are two things the common part is theirs the state part is mine and here i lord it and will lord it as long as i please while the two pursy sisters the old gouty brother and the two musty nieces are stived up in the other half and dare not stir for fear of meeting me whom that is the jest of it they have forbidden coming into their apartments as i have them into mine and so i have them all prisoners while i range about as i please pretty dogs and doggesses to quarrel and bark at me and yet whenever i appear afraid to pop out of their kennels or if out before they see me at the sight of me run growling in again with their flapt ears their sweeping dewlaps and their quivering tails curling inwards  and here while i am thus worthily waging war with beetles drones wasps and hornets and am all on fire with the rage of slighted love thou art regaling thyself with phlegm and rockwater and art going on with thy reformationscheme and thy exultations in my misfortunes  the devil take thee for an insensible doughbakd varlet i have no more patience with thee than with the lady for thou know nothing either of love or friendship but art as incapable of the one as unworthy of the other else would thou not rejoice as thou do under the grimace of pity in my disappointments  and thou art a pretty fellow art thou not to engage to transcribe for her some parts of my letters written to thee in confidence letters that thou should sooner have parted with thy cursed tongue than have owned thou ever had received such yet these are now to be communicated to her but i charge thee and woe be to thee if it be too late that thou do not oblige her with a line of mine  if thou have done it the least vengeance i will take is to break through my honor given to thee not to visit her as thou will have broken through thine to me in communicating letters written under the seal of friendship  i am now convinced too sadly for my hopes by her letter to my cousin charlotte that she is determined never to have me  unprecedented wickedness she calls mine to her but how does she know what the ardor of flaming love will stimulate how does she know the requisite distinctions of the words she uses in this case  to think the worst and to be able to make comparisons in these very delicate situations must she not be less delicate than i had imagined her to be  but she has heard that the devil is black and having a mind to make one of me brays together in the mortar of her wild fancy twenty chimneysweepers in order to make one sootier than ordinary rise out of the dirty mass  but what a whirlwind does she raise in my soul by her proud contempts of me never never was mortal mans pride so mortified how does she sink me even in my own eyes  her heart sincerely repulses me she says for my meanness  yet she intends to reap the benefit of what she calls so  curse upon her haughtiness and her meanness at the same time  her haughtiness to me and her meanness to her own relations more unworthy of kindred with her than i can be or i am mean indeed  yet who but must admire who but must adore her  o that cursed cursed house but for the women of that  then their damned potions but for those had her unimpaired intellects and the majesty of her virtue saved her as once it did by her humble eloquence in the firescene vol iv p      another time by her terrifying menaces against her own life vol v letter l   yet in both these to find her power over me and my love for her and to hate to despise and to refuse me  she might have done this with some show of justice had the lastintended violation been perpetrated  but to go away conqueress and triumphant in every light  well may she despise me for suffering her to do so  she left me low and mean indeed  and the impression holds with her  i could tear my flesh that i gave her not cause  that i humbled her not indeed  or that i staid not in town till i could have exalted myself by giving myself a wife superior to all trial to all temptation  i will venture one more letter to her however and if that dont do or procure me an answer then will i endeavor to see her let what will be the consequence if she get out of my way i will do some noble mischief to the vixen girl whom she most loves and then quit the kingdom for ever  and now jack since thy hand is in at communicating the contents of private letters tell her this if thou will and add to it that if she abandon me god will and it is no matter then what becomes of  her lovelace  letter ciii mr lovelace to john belford esquire  in answer to his of friday night aug   p     monday aug   and so you have actually delivered to the fair implacable extracts of letters written in the confidence of friendship take care  take care belford  i do indeed love you better than i love any man in the world but this is a very delicate point the matter is grown very serious to me my heart is bent upon having her and have her i will though i marry her in the agonies of death  she is very earnest you say that i will not offer to molest her that let me tell her will absolutely depend upon herself and the answer she returns whether by pen and ink or the contemptuous one of silence which she bestowed upon my last four to her and i will write it in such humble and in such reasonable terms that if she is not a true harlowe she shall forgive me but as to the executorship she is for conferring upon thee  thou shall not be her executor let me perish if thou shall  nor shall she die nobody shall be anything nobody shall dare to be anything to her but me  thy happiness is already too great to be admitted daily to her presence to look upon her to talk to her to hear her talk while i am forbid to come within view of her window  what a reprobation is this of the man who was once more dear to her than all the men in the world  and now to be able to look down upon me while her exalted head is hid from me among the stars sometimes with low scorn at other times with abject pity i cannot bear it  this i tell thee that if i have not success in my effort by letter i will overcome the creeping folly that has found its way to my heart or i will tear it out in her presence and throw it at hers that she may see how much more tender than her own that organ is which she and you and everyone else have taken the liberty to call callous  give notice to the people who live back and edge and on either hand of the cursed mother to remove their best effects if i am rejected for the first vengeance i shall take will be to set fire to that den of serpents nor will there be any fear of taking them when they are in any act that has the relish of salvation in it as shakespeare says  so that my revenge if they perish in the flames i shall light up will be complete as to them  letter civ mr lovelace to miss clarissa harlowe monday aug   little as i have reason to expect either your patient ear or forgiving heart yet cannot i forbear to write to you once more as a more pardonable intrusion perhaps than a visit would be to beg of you to put it in my power to atone as far as it is possible to atone for the injuries i have done you  your angelic purity and my awakened conscience are standing records of your exalted merit and of my detestable baseness but your forgiveness will lay me under an eternal obligation to you  forgive me then my dearest life my earthly good the visible anchor of my future hope as you who believe you have something to be forgiven for hope for pardon yourself forgive me and consent to meet me upon your own conditions and in whose company you please at the holy altar and to give yourself a title to the most repentant and affectionate heart that ever beat in a human bosom  but perhaps a time of probation may be required it may be impossible for you as well from indisposition as doubt so soon to receive me to absolute favor as my heart wishes to be received in this case i will submit to your pleasure and there shall be no penance which you can impose that i will not cheerfully undergo if you will be pleased to give me hope that after an expiation suppose of months wherein the regularity of my future life and actions shall convince you of my reformation you will at last be mine  let me beg the favor then of a few lines encouraging me in this conditional hope if it must not be a still nearer hope and a more generous encouragement  if you refuse me this you will make me desperate but even then i must at all events throw myself at your feet that i may not charge myself with the omission of any earnest any humble effort to move you in my favor for in you madam in your forgiveness are centred my hopes as to both worlds since to be reprobated finally by you will leave me without expectation of mercy from above  for i am now awakened enough to think that to be forgiven by injured innocents is necessary to the divine pardon the almighty putting into the power of such as is reasonable to believe the wretch who causelessly and capitally offends them and who can be entitled to this power if you are not  your cause madam in a word i look upon to be the cause of virtue and as such the cause of god and may i not expect that he will assert it in the perdition of a man who has acted by a person of the most spotless purity as i have done if you by rejecting me show that i have offended beyond the possibility of forgiveness  i do most solemnly assure you that no temporal or worldly views induce me to this earnest address i deserve not forgiveness from you nor do my lord m and his sisters from me i despise them from my heart for presuming to imagine that i will be controuled by the prospect of any benefits in their power to confer there is not a person breathing but yourself who shall prescribe to me your whole conduct madam has been so nobly principled and your resentments are so admirably just that you appear to me even in a divine light and in an infinitely more amiable one at the same time than you could have appeared in had you not suffered the barbarous wrongs that now fill my mind with anguish and horror at my own recollected villainy to the most excellent of women  i repeat that all i beg for the present is a few lines to guide my doubtful steps and if possible for you so far to condescend to encourage me to hope that if i can justify my present vows by my future conduct i may be permitted the honor to style myself  eternally yours r lovelace  letter cv miss clarissa harlowe to lord m and to the ladies of his house in reply to miss montagues of monday aug   p   0 tuesday aug   excuse me my good lord and my everhonoured ladies from accepting of your noble quarterly bounty and allow me to return with all grateful acknowlegement and true humility the enclosed earnest of your goodness to me indeed i have no need of the one and cannot possibly want the other but nevertheless have such a sense of your generous favor that to my last hour i shall have pleasure in contemplating upon it and be proud of the place i hold in the esteem of such venerable personages to whom i once had the ambition to hope to be related  but give me leave to express my concern that you have banished your kinsman from your presence and favor since now perhaps he will be under less restraint than ever and since i in particular who had hoped by your influences to remain unmolested for the remainder of my days may be again subjected to his persecutions  he has not my good lord and my dear ladies offended against you as he has against me and yet you could all very generously intercede for him with me and shall i be very improper if i desire for my own peacesake for the sake of other poor creatures who may be still injured by him if he be made quite desperate and for the sake of all your worthy family that you will extend to him that forgiveness which you hoped for from me and this the rather as i presume to think that his daring and impetuous spirit will not be subdued by violent methods since i have no doubt that the gratifying of a present passion will be always more prevalent with him than any future prospects however unwarrantable the one or beneficial the other  your resentments on my account are extremely generous as your goodness to me is truly noble but i am not without hope that he will be properly affected by the evils he has made me suffer and that when i am laid low and forgotten your whole honorable family will be enabled to rejoice in his reformation and see many of those happy years together which my good lord and my dear ladies you so kindly wish to  your evergrateful and obliged clarissa harlowe  letter cvi mr belford to robert lovelace esquire thursday night aug  0 you have been informed by tourville how much beltons illness and affairs have engaged me as well as mowbray and him since my former i called at smiths on monday in my way to epsom  the lady was gone to chapel but i had the satisfaction to hear she was not worse and left my compliments and an intimation that i should be out of town for three or four days  i refer myself to tourville who will let you know the difficulty we had to drive out this meek mistress and frugal manager with her cubs and to give the poor fellows sister possession for him of his own house he skulking mean while at an inn at croydon too dispirited to appear in his own cause  but i must observe that we were probably but just in time to save the shattered remains of his fortune from this rapacious woman and her accomplices for as he cannot live long and she thinks so we found she had certainly taken measures to set up a marriage and keep possession of all for herself and her sons  tourville will tell you how i was forced to chastise the quondam hostler in her sight before i could drive him out of the house he had the insolence to lay hands on me and i made him take but one step from the top to the bottom of a pair of stairs i thought his neck and all his bones had been broken and then he being carried out neckandheels thomasine thought fit to walk out after him  charming consequences of keeping the state we have been so fond of extolling  whatever it may be in strong health sickness and declining spirits in the keeper will let him see the difference  she should soon have him she told a confident in the space of six foot by five meaning his bed and then she would let nobody come near him but whom she pleased the hostlerfellow i suppose would then have been his physician his will ready made for him  and widowsweeds probably ready provided who knows but to appear in them in his ownsight as once i knew an instance in a wicked wife insulting a husband she hated when she thought him past recovery though it gave the man such spirits and such a turn that he got over it and lived to see her in her coffin dressed out in the very weeds she had insulted him in  so much for the present for belton and his thomasine  i begin to pity thee heartily now i see thee in earnest in the fruitless love thou expressest to this angel of a lady and the rather as say what thou will it is impossible she should get over her illness and her friends implacableness of which she has had fresh instances  i hope thou art not indeed displeased with the extracts i have made from thy letters for her the letting her know the justice thou have done to her virtue in them is so much in favor of thy ingenuity that i think in my heart i was right though to any other woman and to one who had not known the worst of thee that she could know it might have been wrong  if the end will justify the means it is plain that i have done well with regard to you both since i have made her easier and you appear in a better light to her than otherwise you would have done  but if nevertheless you are dissatisfied with my having obliged her in a point which i acknowledge to be delicate let us canvas this matter at our first meeting and then i will show you what the extracts were and what connexions i gave them in your favor  but surely thou do not pretend to say what i shall or shall not do as to the executorship  i am my own man i hope i think thou should be glad to have the justification of her memory left to one who at the same time thou may be assured will treat thee and thy actions with all the lenity the case will admit  i cannot help expressing my surprise at one instance of thy selfpartiality and that is where thou say she had need indeed to cry out for mercy herself from her friends who knows not how to show any  surely thou can not think the cases alike  for she as i understand desires but a last blessing and a last forgiveness for a fault in a manner involuntary if a fault at all and hopes not to be received thou to be forgiven premeditated wrongs which nevertheless she forgives on condition to be no more molested by thee and hopest to be received into favor and to make the finest jewel in the world thy absolute property in consequence of that forgiveness  i will now briefly proceed to relate what has passed since my last as to the poor lady by which thou will see she has troubles enough upon her all springing originally from thee without thy needing to add more to them by new vexations and as long as thou can exert thyself so very cavalierly at m hall where everyone is thy prisoner i see not but the bravery of thy spirit may be as well gratified in domineering there over half a dozen persons of rank and distinction as it could be over a helpless orphan as i may call this lady since she has not a single friend to stand by her if i do not and who will think herself happy if she can refuge herself from thee and from all the world in the arms of death  my last was dated on saturday  on sunday in compliance with her doctors advice she took a little airing mrs lovick and mr smith and his wife were with her after being at highgate chapel at divine service she treated them with a little repast and in the afternoon was at islington church in her way home returning tolerably cheerful  she had received several letters in my absence as mrs lovick acquainted me besides yours yours it seems much distressed her but she ordered the messenger who pressed for an answer to be told that it did not require an immediate one  on wednesday she received a letter from her uncle harlowe see letter cix p      in answer to one she had written to her mother on saturday on her knees it must be a very cruel one mrs lovick says by the effects it had upon her for when she received it she was intending to take an afternoon airing in a coach but was thrown into so violent a fit of hysterics upon it that she was forced to lie down and being not recovered thereby to go to bed about eight oclock  on thursday morning she was up very early and had recourse to the scriptures to calm her mind as she told mrs lovick and weak as she was would go in a chair to lincolns end chapel about eleven she was brought home a little better and then sat down to write to her uncle but was obliged to leave off several times  to struggle as she told mrs lovick for an humble temper my heart said she to the good woman is a proud heart and not yet i find enough mortified to my condition but do what i can will be for prescribing resenting things to my pen  i arrived in town from beltons this thursday evening and went directly to smiths she was too ill to receive my visit but on sending up my compliments she sent me down word that she should be glad to see me in the morning  mrs lovick obliged me with the copy of a meditation collected by the lady from the scriptures she has entitled it poor mortals the cause of their own misery so entitled i presume with intention to take off the edge of her repineings at hardships so disproportioned to her fault were her fault even as great as she is inclined to think it we may see by this the method she takes to fortify her mind and to which she owes in a great measure the magnanimity with which she bears her undeserved persecutions  meditation poor mortals the cause of their own misery  say not thou it is through the lord that i fell away for thou ought not to do the thing that he hates  say not thou he has caused me to err for he has no need of the sinful man  he himself made man from the beginning and left him in the hand of his own counsel  if thou will to keep the commandments and to perform acceptable faithfulness  he has set fire and water before thee stretch forth thine hand to whether thou will  he has commanded no man to do wickedly neither has he given any man license to sin  and now lord what is my hope truly my hope is only in thee  deliver me from all my offenses and make me not a rebuke unto the foolish  when thou with rebuke do chasten man for sin thou make his beauty to consume away like as it were a moth fretting a garment every man therefore is vanity  turn thee unto me and have mercy upon me for i am desolate and afflicted  the troubles of my heart are enlarged o bring thou me out of my distresses  mrs smith gave me the following particulars of a conversation that passed between herself and a young clergyman on tuesday afternoon who as it appears was employed to make inquiries about the lady by her friends  he came into the shop in a ridinghabit and asked for some spanish snuff and finding only herself there he desired to have a little talk with her in the backshop  he beat about the bush in several distant questions and at last began to talk more directly about miss harlowe  he said he knew her before her fall that was his impudent word and gave the substance of the following account of her as i collected it from mrs smith  she was then he said the admiration and delight of everybody he lamented with great solemnity her backsliding another of his phrases mrs smith said he was a fine scholar for he spoke several things she understood not and either in latin or greek she could not tell which but was so good as to give her the english of them without asking a fine thing she said for a scholar to be so condescending  he said her going off with so vile a rake had given great scandal and offense to all the neighboring ladies as well as to her friends  he told mrs smith how much she used to be followed by everyones eye whenever she went abroad or to church and praised and blessed by every tongue as she passed especially by the poor that she gave the fashion to the fashionable without seeming herself to intend it or to know she did that however it was pleasant to see ladies imitate her in dress and behavior who being unable to come up to her in grace and ease exposed but their own affectation and aukwardness at the time that they thought themselves secure of a general approbation because they wore the same things and put them on in the same manner that she did who had everybodys admiration little considering that were her person like theirs or if she had had their defects she would have brought up a very different fashion for that nature was her guide in everything and ease her study which joined with a mingled dignity and condescension in her air and manner whether she received or paid a compliment distinguished her above all her sex  he spoke not he said his own sentiments only on this occasion but those of everybody for that the praises of miss clarissa harlowe were such a favorite topic that a person who could not speak well upon any other subject was sure to speak well upon that because he could say nothing but what he had heard repeated and applauded twenty times over  hence it was perhaps that this gentleman accounted for the best things that he said himself though i must own that the personal knowledge of the lady which i am favored with made it easy to me to lick into shape what the good woman reported to me as the character given her by the young levite for who even now in her decline of health sees not that all these attributes belong to her  i suppose he has not been long come from college and now thinks he has nothing to do but to blaze away for a scholar among the ignorant as such young fellows are apt to think those who cannot cap verses with them and tell us how an ancient author expressed himself in latin on a point which however they may know how as well as that author to express in english  mrs smith was so taken with him that she would fain have introduced him to the lady not questioning but it would be very acceptable to her to see one who knew her and her friends so well but this he declined for several reasons which he gave one was that persons of his cloth should be very cautious of the company they were in especially where sex was concerned and where a lady had slurred her reputation  i wish i had been there when he gave himself these airs another that he was desired to inform himself of her present way of life and who her visiters were for as to the praises mrs smith gave the lady he hinted that she seemed to be a goodnatured woman and might though for the ladys sake he hoped not be too partial and shortsighted to be trusted to absolutely in a concern of so high a nature as he intimated the task was which he had undertaken nodding out words of doubtful import and assuming airs of great significance as i could gather throughout the whole conversation and when mrs smith told him that the lady was in a very bad state of health he gave a careless shrug  she may be very ill says he her disappointments must have touched her to the quick but she is not bad enough i dare say yet to atone for her very great lapse and to expect to be forgiven by those whom she has so much disgraced  a starched conceited novice what would i give he had fallen in my way  he went away highly satisfied with himself no doubt and assured of mrs smiths great opinion of his sagacity and learning but bid her not say anything to the lady about him or his inquiries and i for very different reasons injoined the same thing  i am glad however for her peace of minds sake that they begin to think it behooves them to inquire about her  letter cvii mr belford to robert lovelace esquire friday aug    mr belford acquaints his friend with the generosity of lord m and the ladies of his family and with the ladys grateful sentiments upon the occasion  he says that in hopes to avoid the pain of seeing him she intends to answer his letter of the  th though much against her inclination she took great notice says mr belford of that passage in yours which makes necessary to the divine pardon the forgiveness of a person causelessly injured  her grandfather i find has enabled her at eighteen years of age to make her will and to devise great part of his estate to whom she pleases of the family and the rest out of it if she die single at her own discretion and this to create respect to her as he apprehended that she would be envied and she now resolves to set about making her will out of hand  mr belford insists upon the promise he had made him not to molest the lady and gives him the contents of her answer to lord m and the ladies declining their generous offers see letter cv p      letter cviii miss cl harlowe to rob lovelace esquire friday aug    it is a cruel alternative to be either forced to see you or to write to you but a will of my own has been long denied me and to avoid a greater evil nay now i may say the greatest i write  were i capable of disguising or concealing my real sentiments i might safely i dare say give you the remote hope you request and yet keep all my resolutions but i must tell you sir it becomes my character to tell you that were i to live more years than perhaps i may weeks and there were not another man in the world i could not i would not be yours  there is no merit in performing a duty  religion injoins me not only to forgive injuries but to return good for evil it is all my consolation and i bless god for giving me that that i am now in such a state of mind with regard to you that i can cheerfully obey its dictates and accordingly i tell you that wherever you go i wish you happy and in this i mean to include every good wish  and now having with great reluctance i own complied with one of your

them almost break the hearts of us all  were we sure you had seen your folly and were truly penitent and at the same time that you were so very ill as you intimate i know not what might be done for you but we are all acquainted with your moving ways when you want to carry a point  unhappy girl how miserable have you made us all we who used to visit with so much pleasure now cannot endure to look upon one another  if you had not known upon an hundred occasions how dear you once was to us you might judge of it now were you to know how much your folly has unhinged us all  naughty naughty girl you see the fruits of preferring a rake and libertine to a man of sobriety and morals against full warning against better knowledge and such a modest creature too as you was how could you think of such an unworthy preference  your mother cannot ask and your sister knows not in modesty how to ask and so i ask you if you have any reason to think yourself with child by this villain  you must answer this and answer it truly before any thing can be resolved upon about you  you may well be touched with a deep remorse for your misdeeds could i ever have thought that my doatingpiece as everyone called you would have done thus to be sure i loved you too well but that is over now yet though i will not pretend to answer for anybody but myself for my own part i say god forgive you and this is all from  your afflicted uncle john harlowe the following meditation was stitched to the bottom of this letter with black silk  meditation o that thou would hide me in the grave that thou would keep me secret till thy wrath be past  my face is foul with weeping and on my eyelid is the shadow of death  my friends scorn me but mine eye pours out tears unto god  a dreadful sound is in my ears in prosperity the destroyer came upon me  i have sinned what shall i do unto thee 0 thou preserver of men why have thou set me as a mark against thee so that i am a burden to myself  when i say my bed shall comfort me my couch shall ease my complaint  then thou scarest me with dreams and terrifiest me through visions  so that my soul chooses strangling and death rather than life  i loath it i would not live always  let me alone for my days are vanity  he has made me a byword of the people and aforetime i was as a tabret  my days are past my purposes are broken off even the thoughts of my heart  when i looked for good then evil came unto me and when i waited for light then came darkness  and where now is my hope   yet all the days of my appointed time will i wait till my change come

severe sister oh that i had not written to her is pleased to say is my view let that grace be denied me when i do  i could not look forward to my last scene with comfort without seeking at least to obtain the blessing i petitioned for and that with a contrition so deep that i deserved not were it known to be turned over from the tender nature of a mother to the upbraiding pen of an uncle and to be wounded by a cruel question put by him in a shocking manner and which a little a very little time will better answer than i can for i am not either a hardened or shameless creature if i were i should not have been so solicitous to obtain the favor i sued for  and permit me to say that i asked it as well for my father and mothers sake as for my own for i am sure they at least will be uneasy after i am gone that they refused it to me  i should still be glad to have theirs and yours sir and all your blessings and your prayers but denied in such a manner i will not presume again to ask it

as i hope and cannot bear to apprehend the contrary that you will still live many many years  mr hickman indeed speaks very handsomely of mr belford but he poor man has not much penetration if he had he would hardly think so well of me as he does  i have a particular opportunity of sending this by a friend of my aunt harmans who is ready to set out for london and this occasions my hurry and is to

that my friends are very severe too severe for anybody who loves them not to see their letters you my dear would not call them my friends you said long ago but my relations indeed i cannot call them my relations i think  but i am ill and therefore perhaps more peevish than i should be it is difficult to go out of ourselves to give a judgment against ourselves and yet oftentimes to pass a just judgment we ought  i thought i should alarm you in the choice of my executor but the sad necessity i am reduced to must excuse me  i shall not repeat anything i have said before on that subject but if your objections will not be answered to your satisfaction by the papers and letters i shall enclose marked         to   i must think myself in another instance unhappy since i am engaged too far and

aug  0 aug    unhappy girl as your uncle harlowe chooses not to answer your pert letter to him and as mine written to you before vol i p     was written as if it were in the spirit of prophecy as you have found to your sorrow and as you are now making yourself worse than you are in your health and better than you are in your penitence as we are very well assured in order to move compassion which you do not deserve having had so much warning for all these reasons i take up my pen once more though i had told your brother at his going to edinburgh that i would not write to you even were you to write to me without letting him know so indeed had we all for he prognosticated what would happen as to your applying to us when you knew not how to help it  brother john has hurt your niceness it seems by asking you a plain question which your mothers heart is too full of grief to let her ask and modesty will not let your sister ask though but the consequence of your actions  and yet it must be answered before you will obtain from your father and mother and us the notice you hope for i can tell you that  you lived several guilty weeks with one of the vilest fellows that ever drew breath at bed as well as board no doubt for is not his character known and pray dont be ashamed to be asked after what may naturally come of such free living this modesty indeed would have become you for eighteen years of your life  you will be pleased to mark that  but makes no good figure compared with your behavior since the beginning of april last so pray dont take it up and wipe your mouth upon it as if nothing had happened  but may be i likewise am too shocking to your niceness  oh girl girl your modesty had better been shown at the right time and place  everybody but you believed what the rake was but you would believe nothing bad of him  what think you now  your folly has ruined all our peace and who knows where it may yet end  your poor father but yesterday showed me this text with bitter grief he showed it me poor man and do you lay it to your heart  a father waketh for his daughter when no man knows and the care for her takes away his sleep  when she is young lest she pass away the flower of her age and you know what proposals were made to you at different times and being married lest she should be hated in her virginity lest she should be defiled and gotten with child in her fathers house i dont make the words mind that and having an husband lest she should misbehave herself and what follows keep a sure watch over a shameless daughter yet no watch could hold you lest she make thee a laughing stock to thine enemies as you have made us all to this cursed lovelace and a byeword in the city and a reproach among the people and make thee ashamed before the multitude ecclus xlii    0 etc  now will you wish you had not written pertly your sisters severities  never girl say that is severe that is deserved you know the meaning of words nobody better would to the lord you had acted up but to one half of what you know then had we not been disappointed and grieved as we all have been and nobody more than him who was  your loving uncle antony harlowe this will be with you tomorrow perhaps you may be suffered to have some part of your estate after you have smarted a little more your pertlyanswered uncle john who is your trustee will not have you be destitute but we hope all is not true that we hear of you  only take care i advise you that bad as you have acted you act not still worse if it be possible to act worse improve upon the hint    letter cxiv miss cl harlowe to ant harlowe esquire sunday aug    honored sir i am very sorry for my pert letter to my uncle harlowe yet i did not intend it to be pert people new to misfortune may be too easily moved to impatience  the fall of a regular person no doubt is dreadful and inexcusable it is like the sin of apostasy would to heaven however that i had had the circumstances of mine inquired into  if sir i make myself worse than i am in my health and better than i am in my penitence it is fit i should be punished for my double dissimulation and you have the pleasure of being one of my punishers my sincerity in both respects will however be best justified by the event to that i refer  may heaven give you always as much comfort in reflecting upon the reprobation i have met with as you seem to have pleasure in mortifying a poor creature extremely mortified and that from a right sense as she presumes to hope of her own fault  what you have heard of me i cannot tell when the nearest and dearest relations give up an unhappy wretch it is not to be wondered at that those who are not related to her are ready to take up and propagate slanders against her yet i think i may defy calumny itself and excepting the fatal though involuntary step of april  0 wrap myself in my own innocence and be easy i thank you sir nevertheless for your caution mean it what it will  as to the question required of me to answer and which is allowed to be too shocking either for a mother to put to a daughter or a sister to a sister and which however you say i must answer  o sir  and must i answer  this then be my answer  a little time a much less time than is imagined will afford a more satisfactory answer to my whole family and even to my brother and sister than i can give in words  nevertheless be pleased to let it be remembered that i did not petition for a restoration to favor i could not hope for that nor yet to be put in possession of any part of my own estate nor even for means of necessary subsistence from the produce of that estate  but only for a blessing for a last blessing  and this i will further add because it is true that i have no wilful crime to charge against myself no free living at bed and at board as you phrase it  why why sir were not other inquiries made of me as well as this shocking one  inquiries that modesty would have permitted a mother or a sister to make and which if i may be excused to say so would have been still lss improper and more charitable to have been made by uncles were the mother forbid or the sister not inclined to make them than those they have made  although my humble application has brought upon me so much severe reproach i repent not that i have written to my mamma although i cannot but wish that i had not written to my sister because i have satisfied a dutiful consciousness by it however unanswered by the wishedfor success nevertheless i cannot help saying that mine is indeed a hard fate that i cannot beg pardon for my capital error without doing it in such terms as shall be an aggravation of the offense  but i had best leave off lest as my full mind i find is rising to my pen i have other pardons to beg as i multiply lines where none at all will be given  god almighty bless preserve and comfort my dear sorrowing and grievously offended father and mother  and continue in honor favor and merit my happy sister  may god forgive my brother and protect him from the violence of his own temper as well as from the destroyer of his sisters honor  and may you my dear uncle and your no less now than ever dear brother my second papa as he used to bid me call him be blessed and happy in them all and in each other  and in order to this may you all speedily banish from your remembrance for ever  the unhappy clarissa harlowe  letter cxv mrs norton to miss clarissa harlowe monday aug    all your friends here my dear young lady now seem set upon proposing to you to go to one of the plantations this i believe is owing to some misrepresentations of mr brand from whom they have received a letter  i wish with all my heart that you could consistently with your own notions of honor yield to the pressing requests of all mr lovelaces family in his behalf this i think would stop every mouth and in time reconcile everybody to you for your own friends will not believe that he is in earnest to marry you and the hatred between the families is such that they will not condescend to inform themselves better nor would believe him if he were ever so solemnly to avow that he is  i should be very glad to have in readiness upon occasion some brief particulars of your sad story under your own hand but let me tell you at the same time that no misrepresentations nor even your own confession shall lessen my opinion either of your piety or of your prudence in essential points because i know it was always your humble way to make light faults heavy against yourself and well might you my dearest young lady aggravate your own failings who have ever had so few and those few so slight that your ingenuity has turned most of them into excellencies  nevertheless let me advise you my dear miss clary to discountenance any visits that may with the censorious affect your character as that has not hitherto suffered by your wilful default i hope you will not in a desponding negligence satisfying yourself with a consciousness of your own innocence permit it to suffer difficult situations you know my dear young lady are the tests not only of prudence but of virtue  i think i must own to you that since mr brands letter has been received i have a renewed prohibition to attend you however if you will give me leave that shall not detain me from you nor would i stay for that leave if i were not in hopes that in this critical situation i may be able to do you service here  i have often had messages and inquiries after your health from the truly reverend dr lewen who has always expressed and still expresses infinite concern for you he entirely disapproves of the measures of the family with regard to you he is too much indisposed to go abroad but were he in good health he would not as i understand visit at harloweplace having been unhandsomely treated some time ago by your brother on his offering to mediate between your family and you  i am just now informed that your cousin morden is arrived in england he is at canterbury it seems looking after some concerns he has there and is soon expected in these parts who knows what may arise from his arrival  god be with you my dearest miss clary and be your comforter and sustainer and never fear but he will for i am sure i am very sure that you put your whole trust in him  and what after all is this world on which we so much depend for durable good poor creatures that we are  when all the joys of it and what is a balancing comfort all the troubles of it are but momentary and vanish like a morning dream  and be this remembered my dearest young lady that worldly joy claims no kindred with the joys we are bid to aspire after these latter we must be fitted for by affliction and disappointment you are therefore in the direct road to glory however thorny the path you are in and i had almost said that it depends upon yourself by your patience and by your resignedness to the dispensation god enabling you who never fails the true penitent and sincere invoker to be an heir of a blessed immortality  but this glory i humbly pray that you may not be permitted to enter into ripe as you are so soon likely to be for it till with your gentle hand a pleasure i have so often as you know promised to myself you have closed the eyes of  your maternallyaffectionate judith norton  letter cxvi miss clarissa harlowe to mrs norton thursday aug    what mr brand or anybody can have written or said to my prejudice i cannot imagine and yet some evil reports have gone out against me as i find by some hints in a very severe letter written to me by my uncle antony such a letter as i believe was never written to any poor creature who by ill health of body as well as of mind was before tottering on the brink of the grave but my friends may possibly be better justified than the reporters  for who knows what they may have heard  you give me a kind caution which seems to imply more than you express when you advise me against countenancing of visitors that may discredit me you should in so tender a point my dear mrs norton have spoken quite out surely i have had afflictions enough to make my mind fitted to bear anything but i will not puzzle myself by conjectural evils i might if i had not enough that were certain and i shall hear all when it is thought proper that i should mean time let me say for your satisfaction that i know not that i have anything criminal or disreputable to answer for either in word or deed since the fatal  0th of april last  you desire an account of what passes between me and my friends and also particulars or brief heads of my sad story in order to serve me as occasions shall offer my dear good mrs norton you shall have a whole packet of papers which i have sent to my miss how when she returns them and you shall have besides another packet and that with this letter which i cannot at present think of sending to that dear friend for the sake of my own relations whom she is already but too eager to censure heavily from these you will be able to collect a great deal of my story but for what is previous to these papers and which more particularly relates to what i have suffered from mr lovelace you must have patience for at present i have neither head nor heart for such subjects the papers i send you with this will be those mentioned in the margin   a copy of mine to my sister begging off my fathers malediction dated july      my sisters answer dated july      copy of my second letter to my sister dated july      my sisters answer dated aug     copy of my letter to my mother dated aug     my uncle harlowes letter dated aug     cpy of my answer to it dated the  0th   letter from my uncle antony dated the   th   and lastly the copy of my answer to it dated the   th   you must restore them to me as soon as perused and upon your honor make no use of any intelligence you have from me but by my consent  these communications you must not my good mrs norton look upon as appeals against my relations on the contrary i am heartily sorry that they have incurred the displeasure of so excellent a divine as dr lewen but you desire to have everything before you and i think you ought for who knows as you say but you may be applied to at last to administer comfort from their conceding hearts to one that wants it and who sometimes judging by what she knows of her own heart thinks herself entitled to it  i know that i have a most indulgent and sweettempered mother but having to deal with violent spirits she has too often forfeited that peace of mind which she so much prefers by her overconcern to preserve it  i am sure she would not have turned me over for an answer to a letter written with so contrite and fervent a spirit as was mine to her to a manly spirit had she been left to herself  but my dear mrs norton might not think you the revered lady have favored me with one private line  if not might not she have permitted you to have written by her order or connivance one softening one motherly line when she saw her poor girl borne so hard upon  o no she might not  because her heart to be sure is in their measures  and if she think them right perhaps they must be right  at least knowing only what they know  and yet they might know all if they would  and possibly in their own good time they think to make proper inquiry  my application was made to them but lately  yet how grievous will it be to their hearts if their time should be out of time  by the letters i have sent to miss how you will see when you have them before you that lord m and the ladies of his family jealous as they are of the honor of their house to express myself in their language think better of me than my own relations do you will see an instance of their generosity to me which has extremely affected me  some of the letters in the same packet will also let you into the knowledge of a strange step which i have taken strange you will think it and at the same time give you my reasons for it she means that of making mr belford her executor   it must be expected that situations uncommonly difficult will make necessary some extraordinary steps which but for those situations would be hardly excuseable it will be very happy indeed and somewhat wonderful if all the measures i have been driven to take should be right a pure intention void of all undutiful resentment is what must be my consolation whatever others may think of those measures when they come to know them which however will hardly be till it is out of my power to justify them or to answer for myself  i am glad to hear of my cousin mordens safe arrival i should wish to see him methinks but i am afraid that he will sail with the stream as it must be expected that he will hear what they have to say first  but what i most fear is that he will take upon himself to avenge me  rather than this should happen i would have him look upon me as a creature utterly unworthy of his concern at least of his vindictive concern  how soothing to the wounded heart of your clarissa how balmy are the assurances of your continued love and favor  love me my dear mamma norton continue to love me to the end  i now think that i may without presumption promise to deserve your love to the end and when i am gone cherish my memory in your worthy heart for in so doing you will cherish the memory of one who loves and honors you more than she can express  but when i am no more get over i charge you as soon as you can the smarting pangs of grief that will attend a recent loss and let all be early turned into that sweetlymelancholy regard to memory which engaging us to forget all faults and to remember nothing but what was thought amiable gives more pleasure than pain to survivors  especially if they can comfort themselves with the humble hope that the divine mercy has taken the dear departed to itself  and what is the space of time to look backward upon between an early departure and the longest survivance  and what the consolation attending the sweet hope of meeting again never more to be separated never more to be pained grieved or aspersed  but mutually blessing and being blessed to all eternity  in the contemplation of this happy state in which i hope in gods good time to rejoice with you my beloved mrs norton and also with my dear relations all reconciled to and blessing the child against whom they are now so much incensed i conclude myself  your everdutiful and affectionate clarissa harlowe  letter cxvii mr lovelace to john belford esquire sunday aug    i dont know what a devil ails me but i never was so much indisposed in my life at first i thought some of my blessed relations here had got a dose administered to me in order to get the whole house to themselves but as i am the hopes of the family i believe they would not be so wicked  i must lay down my pen i cannot write with any spirit at all what a plague can be the matter with me  lord m paid me just now a cursed gloomy visit to ask how i do after bleeding his sisters both drove away yesterday god be thanked but they asked not my leave and hardly bid me goodbye my lord was more tender and more dutiful than i expected men are less unforgiving than women i have reason to say so i am sure for besides implacable miss harlowe and the old ladies the two montague apes hant been near me yet  neither eat drink nor sleep  a piteous case jack if i should die like a fool now people would say miss harlowe had broke my heart  that she vexes me to the heart is certain  confounded squeamish i would fain write it off but must lay down my pen again it will not do poor lovelace  what a devil ails thee  well but now let us try for it  hoy  hoy  hoy confound me for a gaping puppy how i yawn  where shall i begin at thy executorship  thou shall have a double office of it for i really think thou may send me a coffin and a shroud i shall be ready for them by the time they can come down  what a little fool is this miss harlowe i warrant she will now repent that she refused me such a lovely young widow  what a charming widow would she have made how would she have adorned the weeds to be a widow in the first twelvemonth is one of the greatest felicities that can befall a fine lady such pretty employment in new dismals when she had hardly worn round her blazing joyfuls such lights and such shades how would they set off one another and be adorned by the wearer   go to the devil  i will write  can i do anything else  they would not have me write belford  i must be ill indeed when i cannot write   but thou seem nettled jack is it because i was stung it is not for two friends any more than for man and wife to be out of patience at one time  what must be the consequence if they are  i am in no fighting mood just now but as patient and passive as the chickens that are brought me in broth  for i am come to that already  but i can tell thee for all this be thy own man if thou will as to the executorship i will never suffer thee to expose my letters they are too ingenuous by half to be seen and i absolutely insist upon it that on receipt of this thou burn them all  i will never forgive thee that impudent and unfriendly reflection of my cavaliering it here over half a dozen persons of distinction remember too thy poor helpless orphan  these reflections are too serious and thou art also too serious for me to let these things go off as jesting notwithstanding the roman style is preserved and indeed but just preserved by my soul jack if i had not been taken thus egregiously cropsick i would have been up with thee and the lady too before now  but write on however and send me copies if thou can of all that passes between our charlotte and miss harlowe i will take no notice of what thou communicatest of that sort i like not the people here the worse for their generous offer to the lady but you see she is as proud as implacable there is no obliging her she would rather sell her clothes than be beholden to anybody although she would oblige by permitting the obligation  oh lord oh lord  mortal ill  adieu jack  i was forced to leave off i was so ill at this place and what do think my uncle brought the parson of the parish to pray by me for his chaplain is at oxford i was lain down in my nightgown over my waistcoat and in a doze and when i opened my eyes who should i see but the parson kneeling on one side the bed lord m on the other mrs greme who had been sent for to tend me as they call it at the feet god be thanked my lord said i in an ecstasy  where is miss  for i thought they were going to marry me  they thought me delirious at first and prayed louder and louder  this roused me off the bed i started slid my feet into my slippers put my hand in my waistcoat pocket and pulled out thy letter with my beloveds meditations in it my lord dr wright mrs greme you have thought me a very wicked fellow but see i can read you as good as you can read me  they stared at one another i gaped and read poor mo  or  tals the cau  o  ause of their own  their own mis  ser  ry  it is as suitable to my case as to the ladys as thou wilt observe if thou read it again see p      at the passage where it is said that when a man is chastened for sin his beauty consumes away i stepped to the glass a poor figure by jupiter cried i  and they all praised and admired me lifted up their hands and their eyes and the doctor said he always thought it impossible that a man of my sense could be so wild as the world said i was my lord chuckled for joy congratulated me and thank my dear miss harlowe i got high reputation among good bad and indifferent in short i have established myself for ever with all here  but o belford even this will not do  i must leave off again  a visit from the montague sisters led in by my hobling uncle to congratulate my amendment and reformation both in one what a lucky event this illness with this meditation in my pocket for we were all to pieces before thus when a boy have i joined with a crowd coming out of church and have been thought to have been there myself  i am incensed at the insolence of the young levite thou will highly oblige me if thou wilt find him out and send me his ears in the next letter  my charmer mistakes me if she thinks i proposed her writing to me as an alternative that should dispense with my attendance upon her that it shall not do nor did i intend it should unless she had pleased me better in the contents of it than she has done bid her read again i gave no such hopes i would have been with her in spite of you both by tomorrow at farthest had i not been laid by the heels thus like a helpless miscreant  but i grow better and better every hour i say the doctor says not but i am sure i know best and i will soon be in london depend on it but say nothing of this to my dear cruel and implacable miss harlowe  a  dieu  u ja  aack  what a gaping puppy yaw  n yaw  n yaw  n  thy lovelace  letter cxviii mr belford to robert lovelace esquire monday aug    i am extremely concerned for thy illness i should be very sorry to lose thee yet if thou die so soon i could wish from my soul it had been before the beginning of last april and this as well for thy sake as for the sake of the most excellent woman in the world for then thou would not have had the most crying sin of thy life to answer for  i was told on saturday that thou were very much out of order and this made me forbear writing till i heard further harry on his return from thee confirmed the bad way thou art in but i hope lord m in his unmerited tenderness for thee thinks the worst of thee what can it be bob a violent fever they say but attended with odd and severe symptoms  i will not trouble thee in the way thou art in with what passes here with miss harlowe i wish thy repentance as swift as thy illness and as efficacious if thou die for it is else to be feared that she and you will never meet in one place  i told her how ill you are poor man said she dangerously ill say you  dangerously indeed madam  so lord m sends me word  god be merciful to him if he die said the admirable creature  then after a pause poor wretch  may he meet with the mercy he has not shown  i send this by a special messenger for i am impatient to hear how it goes with thee  if i have received thy last letter what melancholy reflections will that last so full of shocking levity give to  thy true friend john belford  letter cxix mr lovelace to john belford esquire tuesday aug    thank thee jack most heartily i thank thee for the sober conclusion of thy last  i have a good mind for the sake of it to forgive thy tillnow absolutely unpardonable extracts  but do think i will lose such an angel such a forgiving angel as this  by my soul i will not  to pray for mercy for such an ungrateful miscreant  how she wounds how she cuts me to the soul by her exalted generosity  but she must have mercy upon me first  then will she teach me a reliance for the sake of which her prayer for me will be answered  but hasten hasten to me particulars of her health of her employments of her conversation  i am sick only of love  o that i could have called her mine  it would then have been worth while to be sick  to have sent for her down to me from town and to have had her with healing in her dovelike wings flying to my comfort her duty and her choice to pray for me and to bid me live for her sake  o jack what an angel have i   but i have not lost her  i will not lose her i am almost well should be quite well but for these prescribing rascals who to do credit to their skill will make the disease of importance  and i will make her mine  and be sick again to entitle myself to her dutiful tenderness and pious as well as personal concern  god for ever bless her  hasten hasten particulars of her  i am sick of love  such generous goodness  by all that is great and good i will not lose her so tell her  she says that she could not pity me if she thought of being mine this according to miss howes transcriptions to charlotte  but bid her hate me and have me and my behavior to her shall soon turn that hate to love  for body and mind i will be wholly hers  letter cxx mr belford to robert lovelace esquire thursday aug    i am sincerely rejoiced to hear that thou art already so much amended as thy servant tells me thou art thy letter looks as if thy morals were mending with thy health this was a letter i could show as i did to the lady  she is very ill cursed letters received from her implacable family so i could not have much conversation with her in thy favor upon it  but what passed will make thee more and more adore her  she was very attentive to me as i read it and when i had done poor man said she what a letter is this he had timely instances that my temper was not ungenerous if generosity could have obliged him but his remorse and that for his own sake is all the punishment i wish him  yet i must be more reserved if you write to him everything i say  i extolled her unbounded goodness  how could i help it though to her face  no goodness in it she said  it was a frame of mind she had endeavored after for her own sake she suffered too much in want of mercy not to wish it to a penitent heart  he seems to be penitent said she and it is not for me to judge beyond appearances  if he be not he deceives himself more than anybody else  she was so ill that this was all that passed on the occasion  what a fine subject for tragedy would the injuries of this lady and her behavior under them both with regard to her implacable friends and to her persecutor make with a grand objection as to the moral nevertheless mr belfords objection that virtue ought not to suffer in a tragedy is not well considered monimia in the orphan belvidera in venice preserved athenais in theodosius cordelia in shakespeares king lear desdemona in othello hamlet to name no more are instances that a tragedy could hardly be justly called a tragedy if virtue did not temporarily suffer and vice for a while triumph but he recovers himself in the same paragraph and leads us to look up to the future for the reward of virtue and for the punishment of guilt and observes not amiss when he says he knows not but that the virtue of such a woman as clarissa is rewarded in missing such a man as lovelace  for here virtue is punished except indeed we look forward to the rewards of hereafter which morally she must be sure of or who can yet after all i know not so sad a fellow art thou and so vile an husband might thou have made whether her virtue is not rewarded in missing thee for things the most grievous to human nature when they happen as this charming creature once observed are often the happiest for us in the event  i have frequently thought in my attendance on this lady that if beltons admired author nic row had had such a character before him he would have drawn another sort of a penitent than he has done or given his play which he calls the fair penitent a fitter title miss harlowe is a penitent indeed i think if i am not guilty of a contradiction in terms a penitent without a fault her parents conduct toward her from the first considered  the whole story of the other is a pack of damned stuff lothario it is true seems such another wicked ungenerous varlet as thou know who the author knew how to draw a rake but not to paint a penitent calista is a desiring luscious wench and her penitence is nothing else but rage insolence and scorn her passions are all storm and tumult nothing of the finer passions of the sex which if naturally drawn will distinguish themselves from the masculine passions by a softness that will even mine through rage and despair her character is made up of deceit and disguise she has no virtue is all pride and her devil is as much within her as without her  how then can the fall of such a one create a proper distress when all the circumstances of it are considered for does she not brazen out her crime even after detection knowing her own guilt she calls for altamonts vengeance on his best friend as if he had traduced her yields to marry altamont though criminal with another and actually beds that whining puppy when she had given up herself body and soul to lothario who nevertheless refused to marry her  her penitence when begun she justly styles the phrensy of her soul and as i said after having as long as she could most audaciously brazened out her crime and done all the mischief she could do occasioning the death of lothario of her father and others she stabs herself  and can this be an act of penitence  but indeed our poets hardly know how to create a distress without horror and murder and must shock your soul to bring tears from your eyes  altamont indeed who is an amorous blockhead a credulous cuckold and though painted as a brave fellow and a soldier  a whining tom essence and a quarreller with his best friend dies like a fool without sword or popgun of mere grief and nonsense for one of the vilest of her sex but the fair penitent as she is called dies by her own hand and having no title by her past crimes to laudable pity forfeits all claim to true penitence and in all probability to future mercy  but here is miss harlowe virtuous noble wise pious unhappily ensnared by the vows and oaths of a vile rake whom she believes to be a man of honor and being ill used by her friends for his sake is in a manner forced to throw herself upon his protection who in order to obtain her confidence never scruples the deepest and most solemn protestations of honor after a series of plots and contrivances all baffled by her virtue and vigilance he basely has recourse to the vilest of arts and to rob her of her honor is forced first to rob her of her senses unable to bring her notwithstanding to his ungenerous views of cohabitation she awes him in the very entrance of a fresh act of premeditated guilt in presence of the most abandoned of women assembled to assist his cursed purpose triumphs over them all by virtue only of her innocence and escapes from the vile hands he had put her into nobly not franticly resents refuses to see or to marry the wretch who repenting his usage of so divine a creature would fain move her to forgive his baseness and make him her husband and though persecuted by all her friends and abandoned to the deepest distress obliged from ample fortunes to make away with her apparel for subsistence surrounded by strangers and forced in want of others to make a friend of the friend of her seducer though longing for death and making all the proper preparatives for it convinced that grief and ill usage have broken her noble heart she abhors the impious thought of shortening her allotted period and as much a stranger to revenge as despair is able to forgive the author of her ruin wishes his repentance and that she may be the last victim to his barbarous perfidy and is solicitous for nothing so much in this life as to prevent vindictive mischief to and from the man who has used her so basely  this is penitence this is piety and hence a distress naturally arises that must worthily affect every heart  whatever the illusage of this excellent lady is from her relations it breaks not out into excesses she strives on the contrary to find reason to justify them at her own expense and seems more concerned for their cruelty to her for their sakes hereafter when she shall be no more than for her own for as to herself she is sure she says god will forgive her though nobody else will  on every extraordinary provocation she has recourse to the scriptures and endeavors to regulate her vehemence by sacred precedents better people she says have been more afflicted than she grievous as she sometimes thinks her afflictions and shall she not bear what less faulty persons have born on the very occasion i have mentioned some new instances of implacableness from her friends the enclosed meditation will show how mildly she complains and yet how forcibly see if thou in the wicked levity of thy heart can apply it as thou did the other to thy case if thou can not give way to thy conscience and that will make the properest application  meditation how long will ye vex my soul and break me in pieces with words  be it indeed that i have erred mine error remains with myself  to her that is afflicted pity should be shown from her friend  but she that is ready to slip with her feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of them that are at ease  there is a shame which brings sin and there is a shame which brings glory and grace  have pity upon me have pity upon me o ye my friends for the hand of god has touched me  if your soul were in my souls stead i also could speak as ye do i could heap up words against you   but i would strengthen you with my mouth and the moveing of my lips should assuage your grief  why will ye break a leaf driven to and fro why will ye pursue the dry stubble why will ye write bitter words against me and make me possess the iniquities of my youth  mercy is seasonable in the time of affliction as clouds of rain in the time of drought  are not my days few cease then and let me alone that i may take comfort a little  before i go whence i shall not return even to the land of darkness and shadow of death  postscript this excellent lady is informed by a letter from mrs norton that colonel morden is just arrived in england he is now the only person she wishes to see  i expressed some jealousy upon it lest he should have place given over me in the executorship she said that she had no thoughts to do so now for that such a trust were he to accept of it which she doubted might from the nature of some of the papers which in that case would necessarily pass through his hands occasion mischiefs between my friend and him that would be worse than death for her to think of  poor belton i hear is at deaths door a messenger is just come from him who tells me he cannot die till he sees me i hope the poor fellow will not go off yet since neither his affairs in this world nor for the other are in tolerable order i cannot avoid going to the poor man yet am unwilling to stir till i have an assurance from thee that thou will not disturb the lady for i know he will be very loath to part with me when he gets me to him  tourville tells me how fast thou mendest let me conjure thee not to think of molesting this incomparable woman for thy own sake i request this as well as for hers and for the sake of thy given promise for should she die within a few weeks as i fear she will it will be said and perhaps too justly that thy visit has hastened her end  in hopes thou will not i wish thy perfect recovery else that thou may relapse and be confined to thy bed    letter cxxi mr belford to miss clarissa harlowe sat morn aug    madam i think myself obliged in honor to acquaint you that i am afraid mr lovelace will try his fate by an interview with you  i wish to heaven you could prevail upon yourself to receive his visit all that is respectful even to veneration and all that is penitent will you see in his behavior if you can admit of it but as i am obliged to set out directly for epsom to perform as i apprehend the last friendly offices for poor mr belton whom once you saw and as i think it more likely that mr lovelace will not be prevailed upon than that he will i thought fit to give you this intimation lest otherwise if he should come you should be too much surprised  he flatters himself that you are not so ill as i represent you to be when he sees you he will be convinced that the most obliging things he can do will be as proper to be done for the sake of his own future peace of mind as for your healthsake and i dare say in fear of hurting the latter he will forbear the thoughts of any further intrusion at least while you are so much indisposed so that one halfhours shock if it will be a shock to see the unhappy man but just got up himself from a dangerous fever will be all you will have occasion to stand  i beg you will not too much hurry and discompose yourself it is impossible he can be in town till monday at soonest and if he resolve to come i hope to be at mr smiths before him  i am madam with the profoundest veneration  your most faithful and most obedient servant j belford  letter cxxii mr lovelace to john belford esquire  in answer to his of aug    p     sunday aug  0 what an unmerciful fellow art thou a man has no need of a conscience who has such an impertinent monitor but if nic row wrote a play that answers not his title am i to be reflected upon for that  i have sinned i repent i would repair  she forgives my sin she accepts my repentance but she will not let me repair  what would have me do  but get thee gone to belton as soon as thou can yet whether thou go or not up i must go and see what i can do with the sweet oddity myself the moment these prescribing varlets will let me depend upon it i go nay lord m thinks she ought to permit me one interview his opinion has great authority with me  when it squares with my own and i have assured him and my two cousins that i will behave with all the decency and respect that man can behave with to the person whom he most respects and so i will of this if thou choosest not to go to belton mean time thou shall be witness  colonel morden thou have heard me say is a man of honor and bravery  but colonel morden has had his girls as well as you and i and indeed either openly or secretly who has not the devil always baits with a pretty wench when he angles for a man be his age rank or degree what it will  i have often heard my beloved speak of the colonel with great distinction and esteem i wish he could make matters a little easier for her minds sake between the rest of the implacables and herself  methinks i am sorry for honest belton but a man cannot be ill or vapourish but thou liftest up thy shriekowl note and killest him immediately none but a fellow who is fit for a drummer in deaths forlornhope could take so much delight as thou do in beating a deadmarch with thy goosequills  i shall call thee seriously to account when i see thee for the extracts thou have given the lady from my letters notwithstanding what i said in my last especially if she continue to refuse me an hundred times have i known a woman deny yet comply at last but by these extracts thou have i doubt made her bar up the door of her heart as she used to do her chamber door against me  this therefore is a disloyalty that friendship cannot bear nor honor allow me to forgive  letter cxxiii mr lovelace to john belford esquire london aug    monday i believe i am bound to curse thee jack nevertheless i will not anticipate but proceed to write thee a longer letter than thou have had from me for some time past so here goes  that thou might have as little notice as possible of the time i was resolved to be in town i set out in my lords chariot and six yesterday as soon as i had dispatched my letter to thee and arrived in town last night for i knew i could have no dependence on thy friendship where miss harlowes humor was concerned  i had no other place so ready and so was forced to go to my old lodgings where also my wardrobe is and there i poured out millions of curses upon the whole crew and refused to see either sally or polly and this not only for suffering the lady to escape but for the villainous arrest and for their insolence to her at the officers house  i dressed myself in a neverworn suit which i had intended for one of my weddingsuits  and liked myself so well that i began to think with thee that my outside was the best of me  i took a chair to smiths my heart bounding in almost audible thumps to my throat with the assured expectation of seeing my beloved i clasped my fingers as i was danced along i charged my eyes to languish and sparkle by turns i talked to my knees telling them how they must bend and in the language of a charming describer acted my part in fancy as well as spoke it to myself tenderly kneeling thus will i complain thus court her pity and thus plead my pain thus sigh for fancied frowns if frowns should rise and thus meet favor in her softning eyes   in this manner entertained i myself till i arrived at smiths and there the fellows set down their gay burden off went their hats will ready at hand in a new livery up went the head out rushed my honor the woman behind the compter all in flutters  respect and fear giving due solemnity to her features and her knees i doubt not knocking against the inside of her wainscot fence  your servant madam  will let the fellows move to some distance and wait  you have a young lady lodges here miss harlowe madam is she above  sir sir and please your honor the woman is struck with my figure thinks i miss harlowe sir there is indeed such a young lady lodges here  but but   but what madam  i

familiarity  my dear said she the gentleman will not believe miss harlowe is abroad  john bowed to my fine clothes your servant sir  indeed the lady is abroad she went out of town this morning by six oclock  into the country  by the doctors advice  still i would not believe either john or his wife i am sure said i she cannot be abroad i heard she was very ill  she is not able to go out in a coach do you know mr belford friend  yes sir i have the honor to know squire belford he is gone into the country to visit a sick friend he went on saturday sir  this had also been told from thy lodgings to

for it i am a justice of peace i have a search warrant  and up i went they following me muttering and in a plaguey flutter  the first door i came to was locked i tappd at it  the lady sir has the key of her own apartment  on the inside i question not my honest friend tapping again and being assured if she heard my voice that her timorous and soft temper would make her betray herself by some flutters to my listening ear i said aloud i am confident miss harlowe is here dearest madam open the door admit me but for one moment to your presence  but neither answer nor fluttering saluted my ear and the people being very quiet i led on to the next apartment and the key being on the outside i opened it and looked all round it and into the closet  the man said he never saw so uncivil a gentleman in his life  hark thee friend said i let me advise thee to be a little decent or i shall teach thee a lesson thou never learned in all thy life  sir said he it is not like a gentleman to affront a man in his own house  then prythee man replied i dont crow upon thine own dunghill  i stepped back to the locked door my dear miss harlowe i beg of you to open the door or i will break it open  pushing hard against it that it cracked again  the man looked pale and trembling and with his fright made a plaguey long face and called to one of his bodicemakers above joseph come down quickly  joseph came down a lionsface grinning fellow thick and short and bushyheaded like an old oakpollard then did master john put on a sturdier look but i only hummd a tune traversed all the other apartments sounded the passages with my knuckles to find whether there were private doors and walked up the next pair of stairs singing all the way john and joseph and mrs smith following me trembling  i looked round me there and went into two opendoor bedchambers searched the closets the passages and peeped through the keyhole of another no miss harlowe by jupiter what shall i do  what shall i do  now will she be grieved that she is out of the way  i said this on purpose to find out whether these people knew the ladys story and had the answer i expected from mrs smith  i believe not sir said she  why so mrs smith do you know who i am  i can guess sir  whom do you guess me to be  your name is mr lovelace sir i make no doubt  the very same but how came you to guess so well dame smith you never saw me before  did you  here jack i laid out for a compliment and missed it  it is easy to guess sir for there cannot be two such gentlemen as you  well said dame smith  but mean you good or bad  handsome was the least i thought she would have said  i leave you to guess sir  condemned thinks i by myself on this appeal  why father smith thy wife is a wit man  did thou ever find that out before  but where is widow lovick dame smith my cousin john belford says she is a very good woman is she within or is she gone with miss harlowe too  she will be within byandby sir she is not with the lady  well but my good dear mrs smith where is the lady gone and when will she return  i cannot tell sir  dont tell fibs dame smith dont tell fibs chucking her under the chin which made johns upperlip with chin shortened rise to his nose  i am sure you know  but here is another pair of stairs let us see who lives up there  but hold here is another room locked up tapping at the door  who is at home cried i  that is mrs lovicks apartment she is gone out and has the key with her  widow lovick rapping again i believe you are at home pray open the door  john and joseph muttered and whispered together  no whispering honest friends it is not manners to whisper joseph what said john to thee  john sir disdainfully repeated the good woman  i beg pardon mrs smith but you see the force of example had you showed your honest man more respect i should let me give you a piece of advice  women who treat their husbands irreverently teach strangers to use them with contempt there honest master john why do not pull off thy hat to me  o so thou would if thou had it on but thou never wearest thy hat in thy wifes presence i believe do thou  none of your fleers and your jeers sir cried john i wish every married pair lived as happily as we do  i wish so too honest friend but i will be hanged if thou have any children  why so sir  have thou  answer me man have thou or not  perhaps not sir but what of that  what of that  why i will tell thee the man who has no children by his wife must put up with plain john had thou a child or two thou would be called mr smith with a courtesy or a smile at least at every word  you are very pleasant sir replied my dame i fancy if either my husband or i had as much to answer for as i know whom we should not be so merry  why then dame smith so much the worse for those who were obliged to keep you company but i am not merry  i am sad  heyho  where shall i find my dear miss harlowe  my beloved miss harlowe calling at the foot of the third pair of stairs if you are above for gods sake answer me i am coming up  sir said the good man i wish you would walk down the servants rooms and the working rooms are up those stairs and another pair and nobodys there that you want  shall i go up and see if miss harlowe be there mrs smith  you may sir if you please  then i will not for if she was you would not be so obliging  i am ashamed to give you all this attendance you are the politest traders i ever knew honest joseph slapping him upon the shoulders on a sudden which made him jump did ever grin for a wager man  for the rascal seemed not displeased with me and cracking his flat face from ear to ear with a distended mouth showed his teeth as broad and as black as his thumbnails but dont i hinder thee what can earn a day man  half a crown i can earn a day with an air of pride and petulance at being startled  there then is a days wages for thee but thou need not attend me further  come mrs smith come john master smith i should say let us walk down and give me an account where the lady is gone and when she will return  so down stairs led i john and joseph though i had discharged the latter and my dame following me to show their complaisance to a stranger  i reentered one of the firstfloor rooms i have a great mind to be your lodger for i never saw such obliging folks in my life what rooms have you to let  none at all sir  i am sorry for that but whose is this  mine sir chuffily said john  thine man why then i will take it of thee this and a bedchamber and a garret for my servant will content me i will give thee thy own price and half a guinea a day over for those conveniences  for ten guineas a day sir   hold john master smith i should say  before thou speak consider  i will not be affronted man  sir i wish you would walk down said the good woman really sir you take   great liberties i hope you would not say mrs smith  indeed sir i was going to say something like it  well then i am glad i prevented you for the words better become my mouth than yours but i must lodge with you till the lady returns i believe i must however you may be wanted in the shop so well talk that over there  down i went they paying diligent attendance on my steps  when i came into the shop seeing no chair or sool i went behind the compter and sat down under an arched kind of canopy of carvedwork which these proud traders emulating the royal nichfillers often give themselves while a jointstool perhaps serves those by whom they get their bread such is the dignity of trade in this mercantile nation  i looked about me and above me and told them i was very proud of my seat asking if john were ever permitted to fill this superb nich  perhaps he was he said very surlily  that is it cried i that makes thee look so like a statue man  john looked plaguey glum upon me but his man joseph and my man will turned round with their backs to us to hide their grinning with each his fist in his mouth  i asked what it was they sold  powder and washballs and snuff they said and gloves and stockens  o come i will be your customer will do i want washballs  yes and please your honor you can dispense with one or two  give him half a dozen dame smith  she told me she must come where i was to serve them pray sir walk from behind the compter  indeed but i will not the shop shall be mine where are they if a customer should come in  she pointed over my head with a pursemouth as if she would not have simperd could she have helped it i reached down the glass and gave will six there  put em up sirrah  he did grinning with his teeth out before which touching my conscience as the loss of them was owing to me joseph said i come hither come hither man when i bid thee  he stalked toward me his hands behind him half willing and half unwilling  i suddenly wrapped my arm round his neck will thy penknife this moment d  n the fellow where is thy penknife  o lord said the pollardheaded dog struggling to get his head loose from under my arm while my other hand was muzzling about his cursed chaps as if i would take his teeth out  i will pay thee a good price man dont struggle thus the penknife will  o lord cried joseph struggling still more and more and out comes wills pruningknife for the rascal is a gardener in the country i have only this sir  the best in the world to launch a gum d  n the fellow why do struggle thus  master and mistress smith being afraid i suppose that i had a design upon josephs throat because he was their champion and this indeed made me take the more notice of him coming toward me with countenances tragicomical i let him go  i only wanted said i to take out two or three of this rascals broad teeth to put them into my servants jaws  and i would have paid him his price for them  i would by my soul joseph  joseph shook his ears and with both hands stroaked down smooth as it would lie his bushy hair and looked at me as if he knew not whether he should laugh or be angry but after a stupid stare or two stalked off to the other end of the shop nodding his head at me as he went still stroaking down his hair and took his stand by his master facing about and muttering that i was plaguey strong in the arms and he thought would have throttled him then folding his arms and shaking his bristled head added twas well i was a gentleman or he would not have taken such an affront  i demanded where their rappee was the good woman pointed to the place and i took up a scollopshell of it refusing to let her weigh it and filled my box and now mrs smith said i where are your gloves  she showed me and i chose four pair of them and set joseph who looked as if he wanted to be taken notice of again to open the fingers  a female customer who had been gaping at the door came in for some scots snuff and i would serve her the wench was plaguey homely and i told her so or else i said i would have treated her she in anger no woman is homely in her own opinion threw down her penny and i put it in my pocket  just then turning my eye to the door i saw a pretty genteel lady with a footman after her peeping in with a what is the matter good folks to the starers and i ran to her from behind the compter and as she was making off took her hand and drew her into the shop begging that she would be my customer for that i had but just begun trade  what do you sell sir said she smiling but a little surprised  tapes ribbands silklaces pins and needles for i am a pedlar powder patches washballs stockens garters snuffs and pincushions  dont we goody smith  so in i gently drew her to the compter running behind it myself with an air of great diligence and obligingness i have excellent gloves and washballs madam rappee scots portugal and all sorts of snuff  well said she in very good humor i will encourage a young beginner for once here andrew to her footman you want a pair of gloves dont you  i took down a parcel of gloves which mrs smith pointed to and came round to the fellow to fit them on myself  no matter for opening them said i thy fingers friend are as stiff as drumsticks push  you are an awkward dog i wonder such a pretty lady will be followed by such a clumsy varlet  the fellow had no strength for laughing and joseph was mightily pleased in hopes i suppose i would borrow a few of andrews teeth to keep him in countenance and like all the world as the jest was turned from themselves father and mother smith seemed diverted with the humor  the fellow said the gloves were too little  thrust and be d  nd to thee said i why fellow thou have not the strength of a cat  sir sir said he laughing i shall hurt your honors side  d  n thee thrust i say  he did and burst out the sides of the glove  will said i where is thy pruningknife by my soul friend i had a good mind to pare thy cursed paws but come here is a larger pair try them when thou gettest home and let thy sweetheart if thou have one mend the other and so take both  the lady laughed at the humor as did my fellow and mrs smith and joseph even john laughed though he seemed by the force put upon his countenance to be but half pleased with me neither  madam said i and stepped behind the compter bowing over it now i hope you will buy something for yourself nobody shall use you better nor sell you cheaper  come said she give me six penyworth of portugal snuff  they showed me where it was and i served her and said when she would have paid me i took nothing at my opening  if i treated her footman she told me i should not treat her  well with all my heart said i it is not for us tradesmen to be saucy  is it mrs smith  i put her sixpence in my pocket and seizing her hand took notice to her of the crowd that had gathered about the door and besought her to walk into the back shop with me  she struggled her hand out of mine and would stay no longer  so i bowed and bid her kindly welcome and thanked her and hoped i should have her custom another time  she went away smiling and andrew after her who made me a fine bow  i began to be out of countenance at the crowd which thickened apace and bid will order the chair to the door  well mrs smith with a grave air i am heartily sorry miss harlowe is abroad you dont tell me where she is  indeed sir i cannot  you will not you mean  she could have no notion of my coming i came to town but last night  have been very ill she has almost broke my heart by her cruelty you know my story i doubt not tell her i must go out of town tomorrow morning but i will send my servant to know if she will favor me with one halfhours conversation for as soon as i get down i shall set out for dover in my way to france if i have not a countermand from her who has the sole disposal of my fate  and so flinging down a portugal sixandthirty i took mr smith by the hand telling him i was sorry we had not more time to be better acquainted and bidding honest joseph farewell who pursd up his mouth as i passed by him as if he thought his teeth still in jeopardy and bidding mrs smith adieu and to recommend me to her fair lodger hummd an air and the chair being come whipped into it the people about the door seeming to be in good humor with me one crying a pleasant gentleman i warrant him and away i was carried to whites according to direction  as soon as i came thither i ordered will to go and change his clothes and to disguise himself by putting on his black wig and keeping his mouth shut and then to dodge about smiths to inform himself of the ladys motions  i give thee this impudent account of myself that thou may rave at me and call me hardened and what thou will for in the first place i who had been so lately ill was glad i was alive and then i was so balked by my charmers unexpected absence and so ruffled by that and by the bluff treatment of father john that i had no other way to avoid being out of humor with all i met with moreover i was rejoiced to find by the ladys absence and by her going out at six in the morning that it was impossible she should be so ill as thou representedst her to be and this gave me still higher spirits then i know the sex always love cheerful and humorous fellows the dear creature herself used to be pleased with my gay temper and lively manner and had she been told that i was blubbering for her in the back shop she would have despised me still more than she does  furthermore i was sensible that the people of the house must needs have a terrible notion of me as a savage bloodyminded obdurate fellow a perfect womaneater and no doubt expected to see me with the claws of a lion and the fangs of a tiger and it was but policy to show them what a harmless pleasant fellow i am in order to familiarize the johns and the josephs to me for it was evident to me by the good womans calling them down that she thought me a dangerous man whereas now john and i having shaken hands together and dame smith having seen that i have the face and hands and looks of a man and walk upright and prate and laugh and joke like other people and joseph that i can talk of taking his teeth out of his head without doing him the least hurt they will all at my next visit be much more easy and pleasant with me than andrews gloves were to him and we shall be hail fellow well met as the saying is and as thoroughly acquainted as if we had known one another a twelvemonth  when i returned to our mothers i again cursed her and all her nymphs together and still refused to see either sally or polly i raved at the horrid arrest and told the old dragon that it was owing to her and hers that the fairest virtue in the world was ruined my reputation for ever blasted and that i was not married and happy in the love of the most excellent of her sex  she to pacify me said she would show me a new face that would please me since i would not see my sally who was dying for grief  where is this new face cried i let me see her though i shall never see any face with pleasure but miss harlowes  she will not come down replied she she will not be at the word of command yet  is but just in the tramels and must be waited upon i will assure you and courted much besides  ay said i that looks well lead me to her this instant  i followed her up and who should she be but that little toad sally  o curse you said i for a devil is it you is yours the new face  o my dear dear mr lovelace cried she i am glad anything will bring you to me and so the little beast threw herself about my neck and there clung like a cat come said she what will you give me and i will be virtuous for a quarter of an hour and mimic your clarissa to the life  i was belforded all over i could not bear such an insult upon the dear creature for i have a soft and generous nature in the main whatever you think and cursed her most devoutly for taking her name in her mouth in such a way but the little devil was not to be balked but fell a crying sobbing praying begging exclaiming fainting so that i never saw my lovely girl so well aped and i was almost taken in for i could have fancied i had her before me once more  o this sex this artful sex there is no minding them at first indeed their grief and their concern may be real but give way to the hurricane and it will soon die away in soft murmurs trilling upon your ears like the notes of a welltuned viol and by sally one sees that art will generally so well supply the place of nature that you shall not easily know the difference miss harlowe indeed is the only woman in the world i believe that can say in the words of her favorite job for i can quote a text as well as she but it is not so with me  they were very inquisitive about my fair one they told me that you seldom came near them that when you did you put on plaguey grave airs would hardly stay five minutes and did nothing but praise miss harlowe and lament her hard fate in short that you despised them was full of sentences and they doubted not in a little while would be a lost man and marry  a pretty character for thee is it not thou art in a blessed way yet have nothing to do but to go on in it and then what a work have thou to go through if thou turnest back these sorceresses will be like the czars cossacks at pultowa i think it was who were planted with ready primed and cocked pieces behind the regulars in order to shoot them dead if they did not push on and conquer and then will thou be most lamentably despised by every harlot thou have made  and o jack how formidable in that case will be the number of thy enemies  i intend to regulate my motions by wills intelligence for see this dear creature i must and will yet i have promised lord m to be down in two or three days at farthest for he is grown plaguey fond of me since i was ill  i am in hopes that the word i left that i am to go out of town tomorrow morning will soon bring the lady back again  mean time i thought i would write to divert thee while thou art of such importance about the dying and as thy servant it seems comes backward and forward every day perhaps i may send thee another tomorrow with the particulars of the interview between the dear lady and me after which my soul thirsts  letter cxxiv mr lovelace to john belford esquire tuesday aug    i must write on to divert myself for i can get no rest no refreshing rest i awaked just now in a cursed fright how a man may be affected by dreams  methought i had an interview with my beloved i found her all goodness condescension and forgiveness she suffered herself to be overcome in my favor by the joint intercessions of lord m lady sarah lady betty and my two cousins montague who waited upon her in deep mourning the ladies in long trains sweeping after them lord m in a long black mantle trailing after him they told her they came in these robes to express their sorrow for my sins against her and to implore her to forgive me  i myself i thought was upon my knees with a sword in my hand offering either to put it up in the scabbard or to thrust it into my heart as she should command the one or the other  at that moment her cousin morden i thought all of a sudden flashed in through a window with his drawn sword  die lovelace said he this instant die and be damned if in earnest thou repairest not by marriage my cousins wrongs  i was rising to resent this insult i thought when lord m run between us with his great black mantle and threw it over my face and instantly my charmer with that sweet voice which has so often played upon my ravished ears wrapped her arms round me muffled as i was in my lord ms mantle o spare spare my lovelace and spare o lovelace my beloved cousin morden let me not have my distresses augmented by the fall of either or both of those who are so dear to me  at this charmed with her sweet mediation i thought i would have clasped her in my arms when immediately the most angelic form i had ever beheld vested all in transparent white descended from a ceiling which opening discovered a ceiling above that stuck round with golden cherubs and glittering seraphs all exulting welcome welcome welcome and encircling my charmer ascended with her to the region of seraphims and instantly the opening ceiling closing i lost sight of her and of the bright form together and found wrapped in my arms her azure robe all stuck thick with stars of embossed silver which i had caught hold of in hopes of detaining her but was all that was left me of my beloved miss harlowe and then horrid to relate the floor sinking under me as the ceiling had opened for her i dropped into a hole more frightful than that of elden and tumbling over and over down it without view of a bottom i awaked in a panic and was as effectually disordered for half an hour as if my dream had been a reality  will thou forgive me troubling thee with such visionary stuff thou will see by it only that sleeping or waking my clarissa is always present with me  but here this moment is will come running hither to tell me that his lady actually returned to her lodgings last night between eleven and twelve and is now there though very ill  i hasten to her but that i may not add to her indisposition by any rough or boisterous behavior i will be as soft and gentle as the dove herself in my addresses to her  that i do love her o all ye host of heaven be witness  that she is dear to me dearer than day to one whom sight must leave dearer than life to one who fears to die the chair is come i fly to my beloved  letter cxx mr lovelace to john belford esquire curse upon my stars  disappointed again  it was about eight when i arrived at smiths  the woman was in the shop  so old acquaintance how do you now i know my love is above  let her be acquainted that i am here waiting for admission to her presence and can take no denial tell her that i will approach her with the most respectful duty and in whose company she pleases and i will not touch the hem of her garment without her leave  indeed sir youre mistaken the lady is not in this house nor near it  i will see that  will beckoning him to me and whispering see if thou can any way find out without losing sight of the door lest she should be belowstairs if she be in the neighborhood if not within  will bowed and went off up went i without further ceremony attended now only by the good woman  i went into each apartment except that which was locked before and was now also locked and i called to miss harlowe in the voice of love but by the still silence was convinced she was not there yet on the strength of my intelligence i doubted not but she was in the house  i then went up two pair of stairs and looked round the first room but no miss harlowe  and who pray is in this room stopping at the door of another  a widow gentlewoman sir  mrs lovick  o my dear mrs lovick said i i am intimately acquainted with her character from my cousin john belford i must see mrs lovick by all means good mrs lovick open the door  she did  your servant madam be so good as to excuse me  you have heard my story you are an admirer of the most excellent woman in the world dear mrs lovick tell me what is become of her  the poor lady sir went out yesterday on purpose to avoid you  how so she knew not that i would be here  she was afraid you would come when she heard you were recovered from your illness  ah sir what pity it is that so fine a gentleman should make such ill returns for gods goodness to him  you are an excellent woman mrs lovick i know that by my cousin john belfords account of you and miss harlowe is an angel  miss harlowe is indeed an angel replied she and soon will be company for angels  no jesting with such a woman as this jack  tell me of a truth good mrs lovick where i may see this dear lady upon my soul i will neither fright nor offend her i will only beg of her to hear me speak for one halfquarter of an hour and if she will have it so i will never trouble her more  sir said the widow it would be death for her to see you she was at home last night i will tell you truth but fitter to be in bed all day she came home she said to die and if she could not avoid your visit she was unable to fly from you and believed she should die in your presence  and yet go out again this morning early how can that be widow  why sir she rested not two hours for fear of you her fear gave her strength which she will suffer for when that fear is over and finding herself the more she thought of it the less able to stay to receive your visit she took chair and is gone nobody knows whither but i believe she intended to be carried to the waterside in order to take boat for she cannot bear a coach it extremely incommoded her yesterday  but before we talk any further said i if she be gone abroad you can have no objection to my looking into every apartment above and below because i am told she is actually in the house  indeed sir she is not you may satisfy yourself if you please but mrs smith and i waited on her to her chair we were forced to support her she was so weak she said where can i go mrs lovick whither can i go mrs smith  cruel cruel man tell him i called him so if he come again  god give him that peace which he denies me  sweet creature cried i and looked down and took out my handkerchief  the widow wept i wish said she i had never known so excellent a lady and so great a sufferer i love her as my own child  mrs smith wept  i then gave over the hope of seeing her for this time i was extremely chagrined at my disappointment and at the account they gave of her ill health  would to heaven said i she would put it in my power to repair her wrongs i have been an ungrateful wretch to her i need not tell you mrs lovick how much i have injured her nor how much she suffers by her relations implacableness it is the latter mrs lovick it is that mrs smith that cuts her to the heart her family is the most implacable family on earth and the dear creature in refusing to see me and to be reconciled to me shows her relation to them a little too plainly  o sir said the widow not one syllable of what you say belongs to this lady i never saw so sweet a creature so edifying a piety and one of so forgiving a temper she is always accusing herself and excusing her relations and as as to you sir she forgives you she wishes you well and happier than you will let her be why will you not sir why will you not let her die in peace it is all she wishes for you dont look like a hardhearted gentleman  how can you thus hunt and persecute a poor lady whom none of her relations will look upon it makes my heart bleed for her  and then she wept again mrs smith wept also my seat grew uneasy to me i shifted to another several times and what mrs lovick farther said and showed me made me still more uneasy  bad as the poor lady was last night said she she transcribed into her book a meditation on your persecuting her thus i have a copy of it if i thought it would have any effect i would read it to you  let me read it myself mrs lovick  she gave it to me it has a harlowespirited title and from a forgiving spirit intolerable i desired to take it with me she consented on condition that i showed it to squire belford so here mr squire belford thou may read it if thou will  on being hunted after by the enemy of my soul monday aug    deliver me o lord from the evil man preserve me from the violent man  who imagines mischief in his heart  he has sharpened his tongue like a serpent adders poison is under his lips  keep me o lord from the hands of the wicked preserve me from the violent man who has purposed to overthrow my goings  he has hid a snare for me he has spread a net by the wayside he has set gins for me in the way wherein i walked  keep me from the snares which he has laid for me and the gins of this worker of iniquity  the enemy has persecuted my soul he has smitten my life down to the ground he has made me dwell in darkness as those that have been long dead  therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me my heart within me is desolate  hide not thy face from me in the day when i am in trouble  for my days are consumed like smoke and my bones are burnt as the hearth  my heart is smitten and withered like grass so that i forget to eat my bread  by reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin  i am like a pelican of the wilderness i am like an owl of the desert  i watch and am as a sparrow alone upon the housetop  i have eaten ashes like bread and mingled my drink with weeping  because of thine indignation and thy wrath for thou have lifted me up and cast me down  my days are like a shadow that declineth and i am withered like grass  grant not o lord the desires of the wicked further not his devices lest he exalt himself  why now mrs lovick said i when i had read this meditation as she called it i think i am very severely treated by the lady if she mean me in all this for how is it that i am the enemy of her soul when i love her both soul and body  she says that i am a violent man and a wicked man  that i have been so i own but i repent and only wish to have it in my power to repair the injuries i have done her  the gin the snare the net mean matrimony i suppose  but is it a crime in me to wish to marry her would any other woman think it so and choose to become a pelican in the wilderness or a lonely sparrow on the housetop rather than to have a mate that would chirp about her all day and all night  she says she has eaten ashes like bread  a sad mistake to be sure  and mingled her drink with weeping  sweet maudlin soul should i say of anybody confessing this but miss harlowe  she concludes with praying that the desires of the wicked meaning poor me i doubt may not be granted that my devices may not be furthered lest i exalt myself  i should undoubtedly exalt myself and with reason could i have the honor and the blessing of such a wife and if my desires have so honorable an end i know not why i should be called wicked and why i should not be allowed to hope that my honest devices may be furthered that i may exalt myself  but here mrs lovick let me ask as something is undoubtedly meant by the lonely sparrow on the housetop is not the dear creature at this very instant tell me truly concealed in mrs smiths cockloft  what say you mrs lovick what say you mrs smith to this  they assured me to the contrary and that she was actually abroad and they knew not where  thou see jack that i would fain have diverted the chagrin given me by the womens talk and by this collection of scripturetexts drawn up in array against me and several other whimsical and light things i said all i had for it for this purpose but the widow would not let me come off so she stuck to me and gave me as i told thee a good deal of uneasiness by her sensible and serious expostulations mrs smith put in now and then and the two jackpudden fellows john and joseph not being present i had no provocation to turn the conversation into a farce and at last they both joined warmly to endeavor to prevail upon me to give up all thoughts of seeing the lady but i could not hear of that on the contrary i besought mrs smith to let me have one of her rooms but till i could see her and were it but for one two or three days i would pay a years rent for it and quit it the moment the interview was over but they desired to be excused and were sure the lady would not come to the house till i was gone were it for a month  this pleased me for i found they did not think her so very ill as they would have me believe her to be but i took no notice of the slip because i would not guard them against more of the like  in short i told them i must and would see her but that it should be with all the respect and veneration that heart could pay to excellence like hers and that i would go round to all the churches in london and westminster where there were prayers or service from sunrise to sunset and haunt their house like a ghost till i had the opportunity my soul panted after  this i bid them tell her and thus ended our serious conversation  i took leave of them and went down and stepping into my chair caused myself to be carried to lincolns end and walked in the gardens till chapel was opened and then i went in and staid prayers in hopes of seeing the dear creature enter but to no purpose and yet i prayed most devoutly that she might be conducted thither either by my good angel or her own and indeed i burn more than ever with impatience to be once more permitted to kneel at the feet of this adorable woman and had i met her or spied her in the chapel it is my firm belief that i should not have been able though it had been in the midst of the sacred office and in the presence of thousands to have forborne prostration to her and even clamorous supplication for her forgiveness a christian act the exercise of it therefore worthy of the place  after service was over i stepped into my chair again

me the favor i so earnestly covet and so i will leave my letter unsealed to tell thee the event of my next visit at smiths  thy servant just calling i send thee this and will soon follow it by another mean time i long to hear how poor belton is to whom my best wishes  end of vol vi
