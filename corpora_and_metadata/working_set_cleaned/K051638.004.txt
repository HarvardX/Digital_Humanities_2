clarissa or the history of a young lady comprehending the most important concerns of private life and particularly showing the distresses that may attend the misconduct both of parents and children in relation to marriage published by the editor of pamela vol iv  london printed for s richardson and sold by john osborn in paternoster row andrew millar over against catharinestreet in the strand j and ja rivington in st pauls churchyard and by j leake at bath mdccxlviii  the editor to the reader if it may be thought reasonable to criticize the public taste in what are generally supposed to be works of mere amusement or modest to direct its judgment in what is offered for its entertainment i would beg leave to introduce the following sheets with a few cursory remarks that may lead the common reader into some tolerable conception of the nature of this work and the design of its author  the close connection which every individual has with all that relates to man in general strongly inclines us to turn our observation upon human affairs preferably to other attentions and impatiently to wait the progress and issue of them but as the course of human actions is too slow to gratify our inquisitive curiosity observant men very easily contrived to satisfy its rapidity by the invention of history which by recording the principal circumstances of past facts and laying them close together in a continued narration kept the mind from languishing and gave constant exercise to its reflections  but as it commonly happens that in all indulgent refinements on our satisfactions the procurers to our pleasures run into excess so it happened here strict matters of fact how delicately soever dressed up soon grew too simple and insipid to a taste stimulated by the luxury of art they wanted something of more poignancy to quicken and enforce a jaded appetite hence the original of the first barbarous romances abounding with this false provocative of uncommon extraordinary and miraculous adventures  but satiety in things unnatural soon brings on disgust and the reader at length began to see that too eager a pursuit after adventures had drawn him from what first engaged his attention man and his ways into the fairy walks of monsters and chimeras and now those who had run farthest after these delusions were the first that recovered themselves for the next species of fiction which took its name from its novelty was of spanish invention these presented us with something of humanity but of humanity in a stiff unnatural state for as every thing before was conducted by enchantment so now all was managed by intrigue and though it had indeed a kind of life it had yet as in its infancy nothing of manners on which account those who could not penetrate into the ill constitution of its plan yet grew disgusted at the dryness of the conduct and want of ease in the catastrophe  the avoiding these defects gave rise to the heroical romances of the french in which some celebrated story of antiquity was so stained and polluted by modern fable and invention as was just enough to show that the contrivers of them neither knew how to lie nor speak truth in these voluminous extravagances love and honor supplied the place of life and manners but the overrefinement of platonic sentiments always sinks into the dross and feces of that passion for in attempting a more natural representation of it in the little amatory novels which succeeded these heavier volumes though the writers avoided the dryness of the spanish intrigue and the extravagance of the french heroism yet by too natural a representation of their subject they opened the door to a worse evil than a corruption of taste and that was a corruption of heart  at length this great people to whom it must be owned all science has been infinitely indebted hit upon the true secret by which alone a deviation from strict fact in the commerce of man could be really entertaining to an improved mind or useful to promote that improvement and this was by a faithful and chaste copy of real life and manners in which some of their late writers have greatly excelled  it was on this sensible plan that the author of the following sheets attempted to please in an essay which had the good fortune to meet with success that encouragement engaged him in the present design in which his sole object being human nature he thought himself at liberty to draw a picture of it in that light which would show it with most strength of expression though at the expense of what such as read merely for amusement may fancy can be illspared the more artificial composition of a story in one continued narrative  he has therefore told his tale in a series of letters supposed to be written by the parties concerned as the circumstances related passed for this juncture afforded him the only natural opportunity that could be had of representing with any grace those lively and delicate impressions which things present are known to make upon the minds of those affected by them and he apprehends that in the study of human nature the knowledge of those apprehensions leads us farther into the recesses of the human mind than the colder and more general reflections suited to a continued and more contracted narrative  this is the nature and purport of his attempt which perhaps may not be so well or generally understood for if the reader seeks here for strange tales love stories heroical adventures or in short for any thing but a faithful picture of nature in private life he had better be told before hand the likelihood of his being disappointed but if he can find use or entertainment either directions for his conduct or employment for his pity in a history of life and manners where as in the world itself we find vice for a time triumphant and virtue in distress an idle hour or two we hope may not be unprofitably lost  the history of miss clarissa harlowe letter i miss clarissa harlowe to miss how sunday night may   when you reflect upon my unhappy situation which is attended with so many indelicate and even shocking circumstances some of which my pride will not let me think of with patience all aggravated by the contents of my cousins affecting letter you will not wonder that the vapourishness which has laid hold of my heart should rise to my pen and yet it would be more kind more friendly in me to conceal from you who take such a generous interest in my concerns that worst part of my griefs which communication and complaint cannot relieve  but to whom can i unbosom myself but to you  when the man who ought to be my protector as he has brought upon me all my distresses adds to my apprehensions when i have not even a servant on whose fidelity i can rely or to whom i can break my griefs as they arise and when his bountiful temper and gay heart attach every one to him and i am but a cipher to give him significance and myself pain  these griefs therefore do what i can will sometimes burst into tears and these mingling with my ink will blot my paper  and i know you will not grudge me the temporary relief  but i shall go on in the strain i left off with in my last when i intended rather to apologize for my melancholy but let what i have above written once for all be my apology my misfortunes have given you a call to discharge the noblest offices of the friendship we have vowed to each other in advice and consolation and it would be an injury to it and to you to suppose it needed even that call  she then tells miss how that now her clothes are come mr lovelace is continually teazing her to go abroad with him in a coach attended by whom she pleases of her own sex either for the air or to the public diversions  she gives the particulars of a conversation that has passed between them on that subject and his several proposals but takes notice that he says not the least word of the solemnity which he so much pressed upon her before they came to town and which as she observes was necessary to give propriety to his proposals  now my dear says she i cannot bear the life i live i would be glad at my heart to be out of his reach if i were he should soon see the difference if i must be humbled it had better be by those to whom i owe duty than by him my aunt writes in er letter see vol iii p      that she dare not propose any thing in my favor you tell me that upon inquiry you find see vol iii p          that had i not been unhappily seduced away a change of measures was actually resolved upon and that my mamma particularly was determined to exert herself for the restoration of the family peace and in order to succeed the better had thoughts of trying to engage my uncle harlowe in her party  let me build on these foundations  i can but try my dear  it is my duty to try all probable methods to restore the poor outcast to favor  and who knows but that once indulgent uncle who has very great weight in the family may be induced to interpose in my behalf  i will give up all right and title to my grandfathers bequests with all my heart and soul to whom they shall think fit in order to make my proposal palatable to my brother and that my surrender may be effectual i will engage never to marry  what think you my dear of this expedient surely they cannot resolve to renounce me for ever if they look with impartial eyes upon what has happened they will have something to blame themselves for as well as me  i presume that you will be of opinion that this expedient is worth trying but here is my difficulty if i should write my hardhearted brother has so strongly confederated everybody against me that my letter would be handed about from one to another till he had hardened every one to refuse my request whereas could my uncle be engaged to espouse my cause as from himself i should have some hope as i presume to think he would soon have my mother and my aunt of his party  what therefore i am thinking of is this  suppose mr hickman whose good character has gained him everybodys respect should put himself in my uncle harlowes way and as if from your knowledge of the state of things between mr lovelace and me assure him not only of the above particulars but that i am under no obligations that shall hinder me from taking his directions  i submit the whole to your discretion whether to pursue it at all or in what manner but if it be pursued and if my uncle refuses to interest himself in my favor upon mr hickmans application as from you for so for obvious reasons it must be put i can then have no hope and my next step in the mind i am in shall be to throw myself into the protection of the ladies of his family  it were an impiety to adopt the following lines because it would be throwing upon the decrees of providence a fault too much my own but often do i revolve them for the sake of the general similitude which they bear to my unhappy yet undesigned error  to you great gods i make my last appeal or clear my virtues or my crimes reveal if wandering in the maze of life i run and backward tread the steps i sought to shun impute my errors to your own decree my feet are guilty but my heart is free miss harlowe dates again on monday to let miss how know that mr lovelace on observing her uneasiness had introduced to her mr mennell mrs fretchvilles kinsman who managed all her affairs a young officer of sense and politeness she calls him and who gave her an account of the house and furniture to the same effect that mr lovelace had done before as also of the melancholy way mrs fretchville is in  she tells miss how how extremely urgent mr lovelace was with the gentleman to get his spouse as he now always calls her before company a sight of the house and that mr mennell undertook that very afternoon to show her all of it except the apartment mrs fretchville should be in when she went but that she chose not to take another step till she knew how she approved of her scheme to have her uncle sounded and what success if tried it would be attended with  mr lovelace in his humourous way gives his friend an account of the ladys peevishness and dejection on receiving a letter with her clothes he regrets that he has lost her confidence which he attributes to bringing her into the company of his four companions yet he thinks he must excuse them and censure her for overniceness for that he never saw men behave better at least not them  mentioning his introducing mr mennell to her now jack says he was it not very kind of mr mennell captain mennell i sometimes called him for among the military men there is no such officer thou know as a lieutenant or an ensign was it not very kind in him to come along with me so readily as he did to satisfy my beloved about the vapourish lady and the house  but who is captain mennell methinks thou ask i never heard of such a man as captain mennell  very likely but know thou not young newcomb honest dolemans nephew  oho is it he  it is and i have changed his name by virtue of my own single authority know thou not that i am a great namefather preferments i bestow both military and civil i give estates and take them away at my pleasure quality too i create and by a still more valuable prerogative i degrade by virtue of my own imperial will without any other act of forfeiture than my own convenience what a poor thing is a monarch to me  but mennell now he has seen this angel of a woman has qualms that is the devil  i shall have enough to do to keep him right but it is the less wonder that he should stagger when a few hours conversation with the same lady could make four much more hardened varlets find hearts  only that i am confident that i shall at last reward her virtue if her virtue overcome me or i should find it impossible to persevere  for at times i have confounded qualms myself but say not a word of them to the confraternity nor laugh at me for them thyself  in another letter dated monday night he tells his friend that the lady keeps him at such distance that he is sure something is going on between her and miss how notwithstanding the prohibition from mrs how to both and as he has thought it some degree of merit in himself to punish others for their transgressions he thinks both these girls punishable for the breach of parental injunctions and as to their lettercarrier he has been inquiring into his way of living and finding him to be a common poacher a deerstealer and warrenrobber who under pretense of higgling deals with a set of customers who constantly take all he brings whether fish fowl or venison he holds himself justified since wilsons conveyance must at present be sacred to have him stripped and robbed and what money he has about him given to the poor since if he take not money as well as letters he shall be suspected  to serve ones self says he and punish a villain at the same time is serving public and private the law was not made for such a man as me and i must come at correspondencies so disobediently carried on  but on second thoughts if i could find out that the dear creature carried any of her letters in her pockets i can get her to a play or to a concert and she may have the misfortune to lose her pockets  but how shall i find this out since her dorcas knows no more of her dressing or undressing than her lovelace for she is dressed for the day before she appears even to her servant  vilely suspicious  upon my soul jack a suspicious temper is a punishable temper if a lady suspects a rogue in an honest man is it not enough to make the honest man who knows it a rogue  but as to her pockets i think my mind hankers after them as the less mischievous attempt  but they cannot hold all the letters that i should wish to see and yet a womans pockets are half as deep as she is high tied round them as ballastbags i presume lest the wind as they move with full sail from whaleribbd canvas should blow away the gypsies  he then in apprehension that something is meditating between the two ladies or that something may be set on foot to get miss harlowe out of his hands relates several of his contrivances and boasts of his instructions given in writing to dorcas and to his servant will summers and says that he has provided against every possible accident even to bring her back if she should escape or in case she should go abroad and then refuse to return and hopes so to manage as that should he make an attempt whether he succeed in it or not he may have a pretense to detain her  he orders dorcas to cultivate by all means her ladys favor to lament her incapacity as to writeing and reading to show her lady letters from pretended country relations and beg her advice how to answer them and to get them answered to be always aiming at scrawling with a pen lest inky fingers should give suspicions and says that he has given her an ivoryleaved pocketbook with a silver pencil that she may make memoranda on occasion  the lady has already he says at mrs sinclairs motion removed her clothes out of the trunks they came in into an ample mahogany repository where they will lie at fulllength and which has drawers in it for linen  a repository says he that used to hold the richest suits which some of the nymphs put on when they are to be dressed out to captivate or to ape quality for many a countess thou know has our mother equipped nay two or three duchesses who live upon qualityterms with their lords but this to such as will come up to her price and can make an appearance like quality themselves on the occasion for the reputation of persons of birth must not lie at the mercy of every underdegreed sinner  a masterkey which will open every lock in this chest is put into dorcass hands and she is to take care when she searches for papers before she removes any thing to observe how it lies that she may replace all to a hair sally and polly can occasionally help to transcribe slow and sure with such a lady must be all my movements  it is impossible that one so young and so inexperienced can have all her caution from herself the behavior of the women so unexceptionable no revellings no company ever admitted into this innerhouse all genteel quiet and easy in it the nymphs wellbred and wellread her first disgusts to the old one got over  it must be miss how therefore who once was in danger of being taken in by one of our class by honest sir george colmar as thou have heard that makes my progress difficult  thou see belford by the above precautionaries that i forget nothing as he song says it is not to be imagined on what slight strings depend those things on which men build their glory   so far so good i shall never let my goddess rest till i have first discovered where she puts her letters and next till i have got her to a play to a concert or to take an airing with me of a day or so  i gave thee just now some of my contrivances dorcas who is ever attentive to all her ladys motions has given me some instances of her mistresss precautions she wafers her letters it seems in two places pricks the wafers and then seals upon them no doubt but those brought hither are taken the same care of and she always examines the seals of the latter before she opens them i must i must come at them this difficulty augments my curiosity strange so much as she writes and at all hours that not one sleepy or forgetful moment has offered in our favor  a fair contention thou see do not thou therefore reproach me for endeavoring to take advantage of her tender years credulity she has none am not i a young fellow myself as to her fortune that is out of the question fortune never had any other attractions for me than to stimulate me on and this as i have elsewhere said for motives not ignoble as to beauty prythee jack do thou to spare my modesty make a comparison between my clarissa for a woman and thy lovelace for a man  the only point that can admit of debate as i conceive is who has most wit most circumspection and that is what remains to be tried  a sad life however for the poor lady to live as well as for me that is to say if she be not naturally jealous if she be her uneasiness is constitutional and she cannot help it nor will it in that case hurt her for a suspicious temper will make occasions for doubt if none were to offer to her hand and so my fair one is obliged to me for saving her the trouble of studying for these occasions  but after all the plain way in every affair of the human life is the best i believe but it is not given me to choose it nor am i singular in the pursuit of the more intricate paths since there are thousands and ten thousands besides me who had rather fish in troubled waters than in smooth  letter ii mr lovelace to john beleord esquire tuesday may   i am a very unhappy fellow this lady is said to to be one of the sweetest tempered creatures in the world and so i thought her but to me she is one of the most perverse i never was supposed to be an illnatured puppy neither how can it be i imagined for a long while that we were born to make each other happy but quite the contrary we really seem to be sent to plague one another  i will write a comedy i think i have a title ready and that is half the work the quarrelsome lovers twill do there is something new and striking in it yet more or less all lovers quarrel old terence has taken notice of that and observes upon it that lovers fallingout occasions lovers fallingin and a better understanding of course it is natural that it should be so but with us we fallout so often without fallingin once and a second quarrel so generally happens before a first is made up that it is hard to guess what event our loves will be attended with but shakespeare says  come what come may patience and time run through the roughest day and that shall be my comfort no man living bears crosses better than myself but then they must be of my own making and even this is a great merit and a great excellence think what thou will since most of the troubles which fall to the lot of mortals are brought upon themselves either by their too large desires or too little deserts but i shall make myself a common man byandby which is what no one yet ever thought me i will now lead to the occasion of this preamble  i had been out on my return meeting dorcas on the stairs  your lady in her chamber dorcas in the dining room sir and if ever you hope for an opportunity to come at a letter it must be now for at her feet i saw one lie which by its opened folds she has been reading with a little parcel of others she is now busied with all pulled out of her pocket as i believe so sir you will know where to find them another time  i was ready to leap for joy and instantly resolved to bring forward an expedient which i had held in petto and entering into the dining room with an air of transport i boldly clasped my arms about her as she sat she huddling up her papers in her handkerchief all the time the dropped paper unseen o my dearest life a lucky expedient have mr mennell and i hit upon just now in order to hasten mrs fretchville to quit the house i have agreed if you approve of it to entertain her cook her housemaid and two menservants about whom she was very solicitous till you are provided to your mind and that no accommodations may be wanted i have consented to take the household linen at an appraisement  i am to pay down  00 l and the remainder as soon as the bills can be looked up and the amount of them adjusted thus will you have a charming house entirely ready to receive you and any of my friends they will soon be with you they will not permit you long to suspend my happy day  and that nothing may be wanting to gratify your utmost punctilio i will till then consent to stay here at mrs sinclairs while you reside at your new house and leave the rest to your own generosity  o my beloved creature will not this be agreeable to you i am sure it will  it must  and clasping her closer to me i gave her a more fervent kiss than ever i had dared to give her before but still let not my ardor overcome my discretion for i took care to set my foot upon the letter and scraped it farther from her as it were behind her chair  she was in a passion at the liberty i took bowing low i begged her pardon and stooping still lower in the same motion took it up and whipped it in my bosom  pox on me for a puppy a fool a blockhead a clumsy varlet and a mere jack belford  i thought myself a much cleverer fellow than i am  why could i not have been followed in by dorcas who might have taken it up while i addressed her lady  for here the letter being unfolded i could not put it into my bosom without alarming her ears as my sudden motion did her eyes  up she flew in a moment traitor judas her eyes flashing lightning and a perturbation in her eager countenance so charming  what have you taken up  and then what for both my ears i durst not to have done to her she made no scruple to seize the stolen letter though in my bosom  begpardon apologies were all that now remained for me on so palpable a detection i clasped her hand which had hold of the ravished paper between mine o my beloved creature can you think i have not some curiosity is it possible you can be thus for ever employed and i loving narrative letterwriting above every other species of writing and admiring your talent that way should not thus upon the dawn of my happiness as i presume to hope burn with a desire to be admitted into so sweet a correspondence  let go my hand  stamping with her pretty foot how dare you sir  at this rate i see  too plainly i see  and more she could not say but gasping was ready to faint with passion and affright the devil a bit of her accustomed gentleness to be seen in her charming face or to be heard in her musical voice  having gone thus far loath very loath was i to lose my prize  once more i got hold of the rumpledup letter  impudent man were her words stamping again for gods sake then it was  i let go my prize lest she should faint away but had the pleasure first to find my hand within both hers she trying to open my reluctant fingers how near was my heart at that moment to my hand throbbing to my fingers ends to be thus familiarly although angrily treated by the charmer of my soul  when she had got it in her possession she flew to the door i threw myself in her way shut it and in the humblest manner besought her to forgive me and yet do you think the harlowehearted charmer would notwithstanding the agreeable annunciation i came in with  no truly but pushing me rudely from the door as if i had been nothing yet do i love to try so innocently to try her strength too she gaining that force through passion which i had lost through fear and out she shot to her own apartment thank my stars she could fly no further and as soon as she entered it in a passion still she doublelocked and doublebolted herself in  this my comfort on reflection that upon a greater offense it cannot be worse  i retreated to my own apartment with my heart full and my man will not being near me gave myself a plaguey knock on the forehead with my double fist  and now is my charmer shut up from me refusing to see me refusing her meals resolves not to see me that is more  never again if she can help it  in the mind she is in  i hope she has said the dear creatures whenever they quarrel with their humble servants should always remember this saving clause that they may not be forsworn  but think thou that i will not make it the subject of one of my first plots to inform myself of the reason why all this commotion was necessary on so slight an occasion as this would have been were not the letters that pass between these ladies of a treasonable nature   wednesday morning no admission to breakfast any more than to supper i wish this lady is not a simpleton after all  i have sent up in capt mennells name a message from capt mennell madam  it will not do  she is of a baby age she cannot be  a solomon i was going to say in every thing solomon jack was the wisest man  but did ever hear who was the wisest woman  i want a comparison for this lady cunning women and witches we read of without number but i fancy wisdom never entered into the character of a woman it is not a requisite of the sex women indeed make better sovereigns than men but why is that  because the women sovereigns are governed by men the men sovereigns by women  charming by my soul for hence we guess at the rudder by which both are governed yet sorry puppy as thou art thou make light of me for my attachment to this sex and even of my ardors to the most excellent one of it   but to put wisdom out of the question and to take cunning in that is to say to consider woman as a woman what shall we do if this lady has something extraordinary in her head  repeated charges has she given for wilson by a particular messenger to send any letter directed for her the moment it comes  i must keep a good lookout she is not now afraid of her brothers plot i shall not be at all surprised if singleton calls upon miss how as the only person who knows or is likely to know where miss harlowe is pretending to have affairs of importance and of particular service to her if he can but be admitted to her speech of compromise who knows from her brother  then will miss how warn her to keep close then will my protection be again necessary this will do i believe any thing from miss how must  joseph leman is a vile fellow with her and my implement joseph honest joseph as i call him may hang himself i have played him off enough and have very little further use for him no need to wear one plot to the stumps when i can find new ones every hour  nor blame me for the use i make of my talents who that had such would let em be idle  well then i will find a singleton that is all i have to do  instantly find one  will   sir   this moment call me hither thy cousin paul wheatly just come from sea whom thou were recommending to my service if i were to marry and keep a pleasureboat  presto  wills gone  paul will be here presently  presently will he be gone to mrs howes  if paul be singletons mate coming from his captain it will do as well as if it were singleton himself  sally a little devil often reproaches me with the slowness of my proceedings but in a play does not the principal entertainment lie in the first four acts is not all in a manner over when you come to the fifth and what a vultur of a man must he be who sowses upon his prey and in the same moment trusses and devours  but to own the truth i have overplotted myself to make my work secure as i thought i have frighted the dear creature with my four hottentots and i shall be a long time i doubt before i can recover my lost ground and then these cursed folks at harloweplace have made her out of humor with me with herself and with all the world but miss how who no doubt is continually adding difficulties to my other difficulties and then i am very unwilling to have recourse to measures which these demons below are continually urging me to take and the rather as i am sure that at last she must be legally mine one complete trial over and i think i will do her noble justice  well pauls gone  gone already  has all his lessons  a notable fellow  lord ws necessaryman was paul before he went to sea a more sensible rogue paul than joseph  not such a pretender to piety neither as the other at what a price have i bought that joseph  i had two to buy in him  his conscience as well as the man  i believe i must punish the rascal at last but must let him marry first then though that may be punishment enough as i bribed two at once in one man i shall punish two at once in the man and his wife  and how richly does betty deserve it for her behavior to my goddess  but now i hear the rusty hinges of my beloveds door give me creaking invitation my heart creaks and throbs with respondent trepidations whimsical enough though for what relation has a lovers heart to a rusty pair of hinges  but they are the hinges that open and shut the door of my beloveds bedchamber  relation enough in that  i hear not the door shut again i shall have her commands i hope anon  what signifies her keeping me thus at a distance  she must be mine let me do or offer what i will courage whenever i assume all is over for should she think of escaping from hence whither can she fly to avoid me her parents will not receive her her uncles will not entertain her her beloved norton is in their direction and cannot miss how dare not she has not one friend in town but me is entirely a stranger to the town and what then is the matter with me that i should be thus unaccountably overawed and tyrannized over by a dear creature who wants only to know how impossible it is that she should escape me in order to be as humble to me as she is to her persecuting relations  should i even make the grand attempt and fail and should she hate me for it her hatred can be but temporary she has already incurred the censure of the world she must therefore choose to be mine for the sake of soldering up her reputation in the eye of that impudent world for who that knows me and knows that she has been in my power though but for twentyfour hours will think her spotless as to fact let her inclination be what it will  and then human nature is such a wellknown rogue that every man and woman judges by what each knows of themselves that inclination is no more to be trusted where an opportunity is given than i am especially where a woman young and blooming loves a man well enough to go off with him for such will be the worlds construction in the present case  she calls her maid dorcas no doubt that i may hear her harmonious voice and to give me an opportunity to pour out my soul at her feet to renew all my vows and to receive her pardon for the past offense and then with what pleasure shall i begin upon a new score and afterward wipe out that and begin another and another till the last offense passes and there can be no other and once after that to be forgiven will be to be forgiven for ever  the door is again shut dorcas tells me that she denies to admit me to dine with her as i had ordered her to request for me next time she saw her not uncivilly however denies coming to by degrees nothing but the last offense the honest wench tells me in the language of her principals below will do with her the last offense is meditating yet this vile recreant heart of mine plays me booty  but here i conclude though the tyranness leaves me nothing to do but read write and fret  subscription is formal between us besides i am so totally hers that i cannot say how much i am thine or any other persons   letter iii miss clarissa harlowe to miss how tuesday may   if my dear you approve of the application to my uncle harlowe i wish it may be made as soon as possible we are quite out again i have shut myself up from him the offense indeed not very great  and yet it is too he had like to have got a letter one of yours but never will i write again or reperuse my papers in an apartment where he thinks himself entitled to come he did not read a line of it indeed he did not so dont be uneasy and depend upon future caution  thus it was the sun being upon my closet and mr lovelace abroad  she then gives miss how an account of his coming in by surprise upon her of his fluttering speech of his bold address of her struggle with him for the letter etc    and now my dear proceeds she i am more and more convinced that i am too much in his power to make it prudent to stay with him and if my friends will but give me hope  till i can know whether they will or not i must do what i never studied to do before in any case  that is try to keep this difference open and yet it will make me look little in my own eyes because i shall mean by it more than i can own but this is one of the consequences of a step which will be ever deplored by  your clarissa harlowe  letter iv miss how to miss clarissa harlowe wednesday may  0 i much approve of your resolution to leave this man if you can have any encouragement from your uncle and the rather as i have heard but within these two hours some wellattested stories of him that show him to be one of the worst of men as to our sex i do assure you my dear friend that had he a dozen lives if all i have heard be true he might have forfeited them all and been dead twenty crimes ago  if ever you condescend to talk familiarly with him again ask him after miss betterton and what became of her and if he shuffle and prevaricate question him about miss lockyer  o my dear the mans a villain  i will have your uncle sounded as you desire and that out of hand but yet i am afraid of the success and this for several reasons it is hard to say what the sacrifice of your estate would do with some people and yet i must not when it comes to the test permit you to make it  as your hannah continues ill i would advise you to try to attach dorcas to your interest have you not been impoliticly shy of her  i wish you could come at some of his letters surely a man of his negligent character cannot be always guarded if he were and if you cannot engage your servant i should suspect them both let him be called upon at a short warning when he is writing or when he has papers lying about and so surprise him into negligence  such inquiries i know are of the same nature with those we make at an inn in traveling when we look into every corner and closet for fear of a villain yet should be frighted out of our wits were we to find one but it is better to detect such a one when awake and up than to be attacked by him when in bed and asleep  i am glad you have your clothes but no money no books but a spira a drexelius and a practice of piety those who sent the latter ought to have kept it for themselves  but i must hurry myself from this subject  you have excceedingly alarmed me by what you hint of his attempt to get one of my letters i am assured by my new informant that he is the head of a gang of wretches those he brought you among no doubt were some of them who join together to betray innocent creatures and to support one another when they have done by violence and were he to come at the knowledge of the freedoms i take with him i should be afraid to stir out without a guard  i am sorry to tell you that i have reason to think that your brother has not laid aside his foolish plot a sunburned sailorlooking fellow was with me just now pretending great service to you from captain singleton could he be admitted to your speech i pleaded ignorance the fellow was too well instructed for me to get any thing out of him  i wept for two hours incessantly on reading yours which enclosed that from your cousin morden see vol iii letters lxxviiilxxix  my dearest creature do not desert yourself let your anna how obey the call of that friendship which has united us as one soul and endeavor to give you consolation  i wonder not at the melancholy reflections you so often cast upon yourself in your letters for the step you have been forced upon on one hand and tricked into on the other a strange fatality as if it were designed to show the vanity of all human prudence i wish my dear as you hint that both you and i have not too much prided ourselves in a perhaps too conscious superiority over others  but i will stop  how apt are weak minds to look out for judgments in any extraordinary event it is so far right that it is better and safer and juster to arraign ourselves or our dearest friends than providence which must always have wise ends to answer in its dispensations  but do not talk as in one of your former of being a warning only see vol iii p       you will be as excellent an example as ever you hoped to be as well as a warning and that will make your story to all that shall come to know it of double efficacy for were it that such a merit as yours could not ensure to herself noble and generous usage from a libertine heart who will expect any tolerable behavior from men of his character  if you think yourself inexcusable for taking a step that put you into the way of delusion without any intention to go off with him what must those giddy creatures think of themselves who without half your provocations and inducements and without any regard to decorum leap walls drop from windows and steal away from their parents house to the seducers bed in the same day  again if you are so ready to accuse yourself for dispensing with the prohibitions of the most unreasonable parents which yet were but halfprohibitions at first what ought those to do who wilfully shut their ears to the advice of the most reasonable and that perhaps where apparent ruin or undoubted inconvenience is the consequence of the predetermind rashness  and lastly to all who will know your story you will be an excellent example of watchfulness and of that caution and reserve by which a prudent person who has been supposed to be a little misled endeavors to mend her error and never once losing sight of her duty does all in her power to recover the path she has been rather driven out of than chosen to swerve from  come come my dearest friend consider but these things and steadily without desponding pursue your earnest purposes to amend what you think has been amiss and it may not be a misfortune in the end that you have erred especially as so little of your will was in your error  and indeed i must say that i use the words misled and error and suchlike only in compliment to your own too ready selfaccusations and to the opinion of one to whom i owe duty for i think in my conscience that every part of your conduct is defensible and that those only are blameable who have no other way to clear themselves than by condemning you  i expect however that such melancholy reflections as drop from your pen but too often will mingle with all your future pleasures were you to marry i ovelace and were he to make the best of husbands  you was immensely happy above the happiness of a mortal creature before you knew him everybody almost worshipped you envy itself which has of late reared up its venomous head against you was awed by your superior worthiness into silence and admiration you was the soul of every company where you visited your elders have i seen declining to offer their opinions upon a subject till you had delivered yours often to save themselves the mortification of retracting theirs when they heard yours yet in all this your sweetness of manners your humility and affability caused the subscription every one made to your sentiments and to your superiority to be equally unfeigned and unhesitating for they saw that their applause and the preference they gave you to themselves subjected not themselves to insults nor exalted you into any visible triumph over them for you had always something to say on every point you carried that raised the yielding heart and left everyone pleased and satisfied with themselves though they carried not off the palm  your works were shown or referred to wherever fine works were talked of nobody had any but an inferior and secondhand praise for diligence for economy for reading for writing for memory for facility in learning everything laudable and even for the more envied graces of person and dress and an allsurpassing elegance in both where you were known and those subjects talked of  the poor blessed you every step you trod the rich thought you their honor and took a pride that they were not obliged to descend from their own class for an example that did credit to it  though all men wished for you and sought you young as you was yet had not those who were brought to address you been encouraged out of sordid and spiteful views to attempt your presence not one of them would have dared to lift up his eyes to you  thus happy in all about you thus making happy all within your circle could you think that nothing would happen to you to convince you that you were not to be exempted from the common lot  to convince you that you were not absolutely perfect and that you must not expect to pass through life without trial temptation and misfortune  indeed it must be owned that no trial no temptation worthy of you could have well attacked you sooner or more effectually than those heavy ones have done for every common case you were superior to it must be some man or some worse spirit in the shape of one that formed on purpose was to be sent to invade you while as many other such spirits as there are persons in your family were permitted to take possession severally in one dark hour of the heart of every one of it there to sit perching perhaps and directing every motion to the motions of the seducer without in order to irritate to provoke to push you forward to meet him  so upon the whole there seems as i have often said a kind of fate in your error if an error and this perhaps admitted for the sake of a better example to be collected from your sufferings than could have been given had you never erred for my dear adversity is your shiningtime i see evidently that it must call forth graces and beauties that could not have been seen in a run of that prosperous fortune which attended you from your cradle till now admirably as you became and as we all thought greatly as you deserved that prosperity  all the matter is the trial must be grievous to you it is to me it is to all who love you and looked upon you as one set aloft to be admired and imitated and not as a mark as you have lately found for envy to shoot its shafts at  let what i have written above have its due weight ith you my dear and then as warm imaginations re not without a mixture of enthusiasm your anna owe who on reperusal of it imagines it to be in  style superior to her usual style will be ready to flater herself that she has been in a manner inspired with the hints that have comforted and raised the deected heart of her suffering friend who from such ard trials in a bloom so tender may find at times er spirits sunk too low to enable her to pervade the urrounding darkness which conceals from her the opeful dawning of the better day which awaits her  i will add no more at present than that i am  your everfaithful and affectionate anna how  letter v miss clarissa harlowe to miss how friday may    i must be silent my exalted friend under praises that oppress my heart with a consciousness of not deserving them at the same time that the generous design of those praises raises and comforts it for it is a charming thing to stand high in the opinion of those we love and to find that there are souls that can carry their friendships beyond accidents beyond body and ties of blood whatever my dearest creature is my shiningtime the adversity of a friend is yours and it would be almost a fault in me to regret those afflictions which give you an opportunity so gloriously to exert those qualities which not only ennoble our sex but dignify human nature  but let me proceed to subjects less agreeable  i am sorry you have reason to think singletons projects are not at an end but who knows what the sailor had to propose  yet had any good been intended me this method would hardly have been fallen upon  depend upon it my dear your letters shall be safe  i have made a handle of mr lovelaces bold attempt and freedom as i told you i would to keep him ever since at distance that i may have an opportunity to see the success of the application to my uncle and to be at liberty to embrace any favorable overtures that may arise from it yet he has been very importunate and twice brought mr mennell from mrs fretchville to talk about the house if i should be obliged to make up with him again i shall think i am always doing myself a spite  as to what you mention of his newlydetected crimes and your advice to attach dorcas and to come at some of his letters these things will require more or less of my attention as i may hope favor or not from my uncle harlowe  i am sorry for poor hannahs continued illness pray my dear inform yourself for me whether she wants any thing that befits her case  i will not close this letter till tomorrow is over for i am resolved to go to church and this as well for the sake of my duty as to see if i am at liberty to go out when i please without being attended or accompanied   sunday may    i have not been able to avoid a short debate with mr lovelace i had ordered a coach to the door when i had notice that it was come i went out of my chamber to go to it but met him dressed on the stairs head with a book in his hand but without his hat and sword  he asked with an air very solemn yet respectful if i were going abroad i told him was he desired leave to attend me if i were going to church i refused him and then he complained heavily of my treatment of him and declared that he would not live such another week as the past for the world  i owned to him very frankly that i had made an application to my friends and that i was resolved to keep myself to myself till i knew the issue of it  he colored and seemed surprised but checking himself in something he was going to say he pleaded my danger from singleton and again desired to attend me  and then he told me that mrs fretchville had desired to continue a fortnight longer in the house she found said he that i was unable to determine about entering upon it and now who knows when such a vapourish creature will come to a resolution this madam has been an unhappy week for had i not stood upon such bad terms with you you might have been now mistress of that house and probably had my cousin montague if not my aunt lawrance actually with you  and so sir taking all you say for granted your cousin montague cannot come to mrs sinclairs what pray is her objection to mrs sinclairs is this house fit for me to live in a month or two and not fit for any of your relations for a few days  and mrs fretchville has taken more time too  and so pushing by him i hurried down stairs  he called to dorcas to bring him his sword and hat and following me down into the passage placed himself between me and the door and again besought me to permit him to attend me  mrs sinclair came out at that instant and asked me if i did not choose a dish of chocolate  i wish mrs sinclair said i you would take this man in with you to your chocolate i dont know whether i am at liberty to stir out without his leave or not  then turning to him i asked if he kept me there his prisoner  dorcas just then bringing him his sword and hat he opened the streetdoor and taking my resisting hand led me in a very obsequious manner to the coach people passing by stopped stared and whispered  but he is so graceful in his person and dress that he generally takes every eye  i was uneasy to be so gazed at and he stepped in after me and the coachman drove to st pauls  he was very full of assiduities all the way while i was as reserved as possible and when i returned dined as i had done the greatest part of the week by myself  he told me upon my resolving to do so that although he would continue his passive observance till i knew the issue of my application yet i must expect that then i should never rest one moment till i had fixed his happy day for that his very soul was fretted with my slights resentments and delays  a wretch when i can say to my infinite regret on a double account that all he complains of is owing to himself  o that i may have good tidings from my uncle  adieu my dearest friend  this shall lie ready for an exchange as i hope for one tomorrow from you that will decide as i may say the destiny of  your clarissa harlowe   letter vi miss how to mrs judith norton good mrs norton thursday may    cannot you without naming me as an adviser who am hated by the family contrive a way to let mrs harlowe know that in an accidental conversation with me you had been assured that my beloved friend pines after a reconciliation with her relations that she has hitherto in hopes of it refused to enter into any obligations that shall be in the least an hindrance to it that she would fain avoid giving mr lovelace a right to make her family uneasy in relation to her grandfathers estate that all she wishes for still is to be indulged in her choice of a single life and on that condition would make her fathers pleasure hers with regard to that estate that mr lovelace is continually pressing her to marry him and all his friends likewise but that i am sure she has so little liking to the man because of his faulty morals and of her relations antipathy to him that if she had any hope given her of a reconciliation she would forego all thoughts of him and put herself into her fathers protection but that their resolution must be speedy for otherwise she would find herself obliged to give way to his pressing entreaties and it might then be out of her power to prevent disagreeable litigations  i do assure you mrs norton upon my honor that our dearest friend knows nothing of this procedure of mine and therefore it is proper to acquaint you in confidence with my grounds for it  these are they   she had desired me to let mr hickman drop hints to the above effect to her uncle harlowe but indirectly as from himself lest if the application should not be attended with success and mr lovelace who already takes it ill that he has so little of her favor come to know it she may be deprived of every protection and be perhaps subjected to great inconveniences from so haughty a spirit  having this authority from her and being very sollicitous about the success of the application i thought that if the weight of so good a wife mother and sister as mrs harlowe is known to be were thrown into the same scale with that of mr john harlowe supposing he could be engaged it could hardly fail of making a due impression  mr hickman will see mr harlowe tomorrow by that time you may see mrs harlowe if mr hickman finds the old gentleman favorable he will tell him that you will have seen mrs harlowe upon the same account and will advise him to join in consultation with her how best to proceed to melt the most obdurate hearts in the world  this is the fair state of the matter and my true motive for writing to you i leave all therefore to your discretion and most heartily wish success to it being of opinion that mr lovelace cannot possibly deserve our admirable friend nor indeed know i the man who can  pray acquaint me by a line of the result of your kind interposition if it prove not such as may be reasonably hoped for our dear friend shall know nothing of this step from me and pray let her not from you for in that case it would only give deeper grief to an heart already too much afflicted i am dear and worthy mrs norton  your true friend anna how  letter vii mrs norton to miss how saturday may    dear madam my heart is almost broken to be obliged to let you know that such is the situation of things in the family of my everdear miss harlowe that there can be at present no success expected from any application in her favor her poor mother is to be pitied i have a most affecting letter from her but must not communicate it to you and she forbids me to let it be known that she writes upon the subject although she is compelled as it were to do it for the ease of her own heart i mention it therefore in confidence  i hope in god that my beloved miss has preserved her honor inviolate i hope there is not a man breathing who could attempt a sacrilege so detestable i have no apprehension of a failure in a virtue so established god for ever keep so pure a heart out of the reach of surprises and violence ease dear madam i beseech you my overanxious heart by one line by the bearer although but by one line to acquaint me as surely you can that her honor is unsullied if it be not adieu to all the comforts this life can give since none will it be able to afford  to the poor judith norton  letter viii miss how to mrs judith norton saturday evening may    dear good woman your beloveds honor is inviolate  must be inviolate and will be so in spite of men and devils could i have had hope of a reconciliation all my view was that she should not have had this man  all that can be said now is she must run the risk of a bad husband she of whom no man living is worthy  you pity her mother  so dont i  i pity nobody that puts it out of their power to show maternal love and humanity in order to patch up for themselves a precarious and sorry quiet which every blast of wind shall disturb  i hate tyrants in every form and shape but paternal and maternal tyrants are the worst of all for they can have no bowels  i repeat that i pity none of them  my beloved and your beloved only deserves pity she had never been in the hands of this man but for them she is quite blameless you dont know all her story were i to tell you she had no intention to go off with this man it would avail her nothing it would only condemn those who drove her to extremities and him who now must be her refuge i am  your sincere friend and servant anna how  letter ix mrs harlowe to mrs norton not communicated till the history came to be compiled  saturday may    i return an answer in writing as i promised to your communication but take no notice that i do write either to my bellas betty who i understand sometimes visits you or to the poor wretch herself nor to anybody i charge you dont my heart is full writing may give some vent to my griefs and perhaps i may write what lies most upon my heart without confining myself strictly to the present subject  you know how dear this ungrateful creature ever was to us all you know how sincerely we joined with every one of those who ever had seen her or conversed with her to praise and admire her and exceeded in our praise even the bounds of that modesty which because she was our own should have restrained us being of opinion that to have been silent in the praise of so apparent a merit must rather have argued blindness or affectation in us than that we should incur the censure of vain partiality to our own  when therefore anybody congratulated us on such a daughter we received their congratulations without any diminution if it was said you are happy in this child we owned that no parents ever were happier in a child if more particularly they praised her dutiful behavior to us we said she knew not how to offend if it was said miss clarissa harlowe has a wit and penetration beyond her years we instead of disallowing it would add  and a judgment no less extraordinary than her wit if her prudence was praised and a forethought which every one saw supplied what only years and experience gave to others nobody need to scruple taking lessons from miss clarissa harlowe was our proud answer  forgive me o forgive me my dear norton  but i know you will  for yours when good was this child and your glory as well as mine  but have you not heard strangers as she passed to and from church stop to praise the angel of a creature as they called her when it was enough for those who knew who she was to cry why it is miss clarissa harlowe  as if everybody were obliged to know or to have heard of miss clarissa harlowe and of her excellencies while accustomed to praise it was too familiar to her to cause her to alter either her look or her pace  for my own part i could not stifle a pleasure that had perhaps a faulty vanity for its foundation whenever i was spoken of or addressed to as the mother of so sweet a child mr harlowe and i all the time loving each other the better for the share each had in such a daughter  still still indulge the fond the overflowing heart of a mother i could dwell for ever upon the remembrance of what she was would but that remembrance banish from my mind what she is  in her bosom young as she was could i repose all my griefs  sure of receiving from her prudence advice as well as comfort and both insinuated in so humble in so dutiful a manner that it was impossible to take those exceptions which the distance of years and character between a mother and a daughter would from any other daughter have made one apprehensive of she was our glory when abroad our delight when at home everybody was even covetous of her company and we grudged her to our brothers harlowe and to our sister and brother hervey  no other contention among us then but who should be favored by her next  no chiding ever knew she from us but the chiding of lovers when she was for shutting herself up too long together from us in pursuit of those charming amusements and useful employments which however the whole family was the better for  our other children had reason good children as they always were to think themselves neglected but they likewise were so sensible of their sisters superiority and of the honor she reflected upon the whole family that they confessed themselves eclipsed without envying the eclipser indeed there was not anybody so equal with her in their own opinions as to envy what all aspired but to emulate  the dear creature you know my norton gave an eminence to us all and now that she has left us so disgracefully left us we are stripped of our ornament and are but a common family  then her acquirements her skill in music her fine needleworks her elegance in dress for which she was so much admired that the neighboring ladies used to say that they need not fetch fashions from london since whatever miss clarissa harlowe wore was the best fashion because her choice of natural beauties set those of art far behind them her genteel ease and fine turn of person her deep reading and these joined to her open manners and her cheerful modesty  o my good norton what a sweet child was once my clary harlowe  this and more you knew her to be for many of her excellencies were owing to yourself and with the milk you gave her you gave her what no other nurse in the world could give her  and do you think my worthy woman do you think that the wilful lapse of such a child is to be forgiven can she herself think that she deserves not the severest punishment for the abuse of such talents as were entrusted to her  her fault was a fault of premeditation of cunning of contrivance she has deceived everybodys expectations her whole sex as well as the family she sprung from is disgraced by it  would anybody ever have believed that such a young creature as this who had by her advice saved even her overlively friend from marrying a fop and a libertine would herself have gone off with one of the vilest and most notorious of libertines a man whose character she knew and knew to be worse than his she saved her friend from whose vices she was warned of one who had had her brothers life in his hands and who constantly set our whole family at defiance  think for me my good norton think what my unhappiness must be both as a wife and a mother what restless days what sleepless nights yet my own rankling anguish endeavored to be smoothed over to soften the anguish of fiercer spirits and to keep them from blazing out to further mischief o this naughty naughty girl who knew so well what she did and who could look so far into consequences that we thought she would have died rather than have done as she has done  her known character for prudence leaves no plea for excuse how then can i offer to plead for her if through motherly indulgence i would forgive her myself  and have we not moreover suffered all the disgrace that can befall us has not she  if now she has so little liking to his morals had she not reason before to have as little or has she suffered by them in her own person  o my good woman i doubt  i doubt  will not the character of the man make one doubt an angel if once in his power the world will think the worst i am told it does so likewise her father fears her brother hears and what can i do  our antipathy to him she knew before as well as his character these therefore cannot be new motives without a new reason  o my dear mrs norton how shall i how can you support ourselves under the apprehensions that these thoughts lead to of my clary harlowe and your clary harlowe  he continually pressing her you say to marry him his friends likewise she has reason no doubt she has reason for this application to us and her crime is glossd over to bring her to us with new disgrace  whither whither does one guilty step lead the misguided heart  and now truly to save a stubborn spirit we are only to be sounded that the application may be retracted or denied  upon the whole were i inclined to plead for her it is now the most improper of all times now that my brother harlowe has discouraged as he last night came hither on purpose to tell us mr hickmans insinuated application and been applauded for it now that my brother antony is intending to carry his great fortune through her fault into another family  she expecting no doubt herself to be put into her grandfathers estate in consequence of a reconciliation and as a reward for her fault and insisting still upon terms that she offered before and were rejected  not through my fault i am sure rejected  from all these things you will return such an answer as the case requires  it might cost me the peace of my whole life at this time to move for her god forgive her  if i do nobody else will and let it be for your own sake as well as mine a secret that you and i have entered upon this subject and i desire you not to touch upon it again but by particular permission for o my dear good woman it sets my heart ableeding in as many streams as there are veins in it  yet think me not impenetrable by a proper contrition and remorse but what a torment is it to have a will without a power  adieu adieu god give us both comfort and to the once dear  the everdear creature for can a mother forget her child repentance deep repentance and as little suffering as may befit his blessed will and her grievous fault prays  your real friend charlotte harlowe  letter x miss how to miss clarissa harlowe sunday may    how it is now my dear between you and mr lovelace i cannot tell but wicked as the man is i am afraid he must be your lord and master  i called him by several very hard names in my last i had but just heard some of his vilenesses when i sat down to write so my indignation was raised but on inquiry and recollection i find that the facts laid to his charge were all of them committed some time ago not since he has had strong hopes of your favor this is saying something for him his generous behavior to the innkeepers daughter is a more recent instance to his credit to say nothing of the universal good character he has as a kind landlord and then i approve much of the motion he made to put you in possession of mrs fretchvilles house while he continues at the other widows till you agree that one house shall hold you i wish this was done be sure you embrace this offer if you do not soon meet at the altar and get one of his cousins with you  were you once married i should think you cannot be very unhappy though you n not be so happy with him as you deserve to be  stake he has in his country and his reversions the care he takes of his affairs his freedom from obligation nay his pride with your merit must be a tolerable security for you i should think though particulars of his wickedness as they come to my knowledge hurt and incense me yet after all when i give myself time to reflect all that i have heard of him to his disadvantage was comprehended in the general character given of him long ago by his uncles and his own dismissed bailiff vol i p     and which was confirmed to you by mrs greme vol iii p      you can have nothing therefore i think to be deeply concerned about but his future good and the bad example he may hereafter set to his own family these indeed are very just concerns but were you to leave him now either with or without his consent his fortune and alliances so considerable his person and address so engaging everyone excusing you now on those accounts and because of your relations follies it would have a very ill appearance for your reputation i cannot therefore on the most deliberate consideration advise you to think of that while you have no reason to doubt his honor may eternal vengeance pursue the villain if he gives room for an apprehension of this nature  yet his teazing ways are intolerable his acquiescence with your slight delays and his resignedness to the distance you now keep him at for a fault so much slighter as he must think than the punishment are unaccountable he doubts your love of him that is very probable but you have reason to be surprised at his want of ardour a blessing so great within his reach as i may say  by the time you have read to this place you will have no doubt of what has been the issue of the conference between the two gentlemen i am equally shocked and enraged against them all against them all i say for i have tried your good nortons weight with your mother to the same purpose as the gentleman sounded your uncle  never were there such determined brutes in the world why should i mince the matter yet would i fain methinks make an exception for your mother  your uncle will have it that you are ruined he can believe everything bad of a creature who could run away with a man  with such a one especially as lovelace they all expected applications from you when some heavy distress had fallen upon you  but they were all resolved not to stir an inch in your favor no not to save your life  my dearest soul resolve to assert your right claim your own and go and live upon it as you ought then if you marry not how will the wretches creep to you for your reversionary dispositions  you were accused as in your aunts letter of premeditation and contrivance in your escape instead of pitying you the mediating person was called upon to pity them who once he said doted upon you who took no joy but in your presence who devoured your words as you spoke them who trod over again your footsteps as you walked before them  and i know not what of this sort  upon the whole it is now evident to me and so it must be to you when you read this letter that you have but one choice and the sooner you make it the better  shall we suppose that it is not in your power to make it  i cannot have patience to suppose that  i am concerned methinks to know how you will do to condescend now you see you must be his after you have kept him at such a distance and for the revenge his pride may put him upon taking for it but let me tell you that if my going up and shareing fortunes with you will prevent such a noble creature from stooping too low much more were it likely to prevent your ruin i would not hesitate a moment about it what is the whole world to me weighed against such a friendship as ours  think you that any of the enjoyments of this life could be enjoyments to me were such a friend as you to be involved in calamities which i could either relieve her from or alleviate by giving them up and what in saying this and acting up to it do i offer you but the fruits of a friendship your worth has created  excuse my warmth of expression the warmth of my heart wants none i am enraged at your relations for bad as what i have mentioned is i have not told you all nor now perhaps ever will  i am angry at my own mothers narrowness of mind and adherence to old notions indiscriminately  and i am exasperated against your foolish your lowvanityd lovelace  but let us stoop to take the wretch as he is and make the best of him since you are destined to stoop to keep grovelers and worldlings in countenance he has not been guilty of direct indecency to you nor dare he not so much of a devil as that comes to neither  had he such villainous intentions so much in his power as you are they would have shown themselves before now to such a penetrating and vigilant eye and to such a pure heart as yours let us save the wretch then if we can though we soil our fingers in lifting him up from his dirt  there is yet to a person of your fortune and independence a good deal to do if you enter upon those terms which ought to be entered upon i dont find that he has once talked of settlements much less of the license it is hard but as your evil destiny has thrown you out of all other protection and medition you must be father mother uncle to yourself and enter upon the requisite points for yourself indeed you must your situation requires it what room for delicacy now or would you have me write to the wretch yet that would be the same thing as if you were to write yourself yet write you should i think if you cannot speak but speaking is certainly best for words leave no traces they pass as breath and mingle with air and may be explained with latitude but the pen is a witness on record  i know the gentleness of your spirit i know the laudable pride of your heart and the just notion you have of the dignity of our sex in these delicate points but once more all this is nothing now your honor is concerned that the dignity i speak of should not be stood upon  mr lovelace would i say yet hate the foolish fellow for his low his stupid pride in wishing to triumph over the dignity of his own wife  i am deprived by your means of every friend i have in the world in what light am i to look upon you i have well considered of every thing you have made some people much against my liking think me a wife others know i am not married nor do i desire any body should believe i am do you think your being here in the same house with me can be to my reputation you talk to me of mrs fretchvilles house   this will bring him to renew his last discourse on that subject if he does not revive it of himself if mrs fretchville knows not her own mind what is her house to me you talked of bringing up your cousin montague to bear me company if my brothers schemes be your pretense for not going yourself to fetch her you can write to her  i insist upon bringing these two points to an issue off or on ought to be indifferent to me if so to them  such a declaration must bring all forward there are twenty ways my dear that you would find out to advise another how to act in your circumstances he will disdain from his native insolence to have it thought he has anybody to consult well then will he not be obliged to declare himself and if he does no delays on your side i beseech you give him the day let it be a short one it would be derogating from your own merit and honor too let me tell you even although he should not be so explicit as he ought to be to seem but to doubt his meaning and to wait for that explanation which i should for ever despise him for if he makes necessary twice already have you my dear if not oftener modestyd away such opportunities as you ought not to have slipped  as to settlements if they come not in naturally even leave them to his own justice and to the justice of his family and there is an end of the matter  this is my advice mend it as circumstances offer and follow your own but indeed my dear this or something like it would i do as witness  your anna how enclosed in the above i must trouble you with my concerns though your own are so heavy upon you  a piece of news i have to tell you your uncle antony is disposed to marry  with whom think you  with my mamma true indeed your family know it all is laid with redoubled malice at your door and there the old soul himself lays it  take no notice of this intelligence not so much as in your letters to me for fear of accidents  i think it cannot do but were i to provoke my mother that might afford a pretense else i should have been with you before now i fancy  the first likelihood that appears to me of encouragement i dismiss hickman that is certain if my mother disoblige me in so important an article i shall not think of obliging her in such another it is impossible surely that the desire of popping me off to that honest man can be with such a view  i repeat that it cannot come to any thing but these widows  then such a love in us all both old and young of being courted and admired  and so irresistible to their elderships to be flattered that all power is not over with them but that they may still class and prank it with their daughters it vexed me heartily to have her tell me of this proposal with selfcomplaisant simperings and yet she affected to speak of it as if she had no intention to encourage it  these antiquated batchelors old before they think themselves so imagine that when they have once persuaded themselves they have nothing else to do but to make their minds known to the lady his overgrown fortune is indeed a bait  a tempting one a saucy daughter to be got rid of the memory of the father of that daughter not precious enough to weigh  but let him advance if he dare  let her encourage  but i hope she will not  excuse me my dear i am nettled they have fearfully rumpled my gorget you will think me faulty so i will not put my name to this separate paper other hands may resemble mine you did not see me write it    letter xi miss clarissa harlowe to miss how monday p m may    now indeed is it evident my best my only friend that i have but one choice to make and now do i find that i have carried my resentment against this man too far since now i am to appear as if under an obligation to his patience with me for a conduct that perhaps he will think if not humoursome and childish plainly demonstrative of my little esteem of him of but a secondary esteem at least where before his pride rather than his merit had made him expect a first o my dear  to be under obligation to and to be cast upon a man that is not a generous man  that is indeed a cruel man  that is capable of creating a distress to a young creature who by her evil destiny is thrown into his power and then of enjoying it as i may say i verily think i may say so of this savage  what a fate is mine  you give me my dear good advice as to the peremptory manner in which i ought to treat him but do you consider to whom it is that you give that advice  the occasion for it should never have been given by me of all creatures for i am unequal utterly unequal to it  what i to challenge a man for a husband  i to exert myself to quicken the delayer in his resolutions and having lost an opportunity to begin to try to recall it as from myself and for myself  to threaten him as i may say into the marriagestate  o my dear if this be right to be done how difficult is it where modesty and self or where pride if you please is concerned to do that right or to express myself in your words to be father mother uncle to myself  especially where one thinks a triumph over one is intended  do my dear advise me persuade me to renounce the man for ever and then i will for ever renounce him  you say you have tried mrs nortons weight with my mamma  bad as the returns are which my application by mr hickman has met with you tell me you have not acquainted me with all the bad nor now perhaps ever will but why so my dear what is the bad what can be the bad which now you will never tell me of  what worse than renounce me and for ever my uncle you say believes me ruined he declares that he can believe every thing bad of a creature who could run away with a man and they have all made a resolution not to stir an inch in my favor no not to save my life  have you worse than this my dear behind  surely my father has not renewed his dreadful malediction  surely if so my mamma has not joined in it have my uncles given it their sanction and made it a family act what my dear is the worst that you will leave for ever unrevealed  o lovelace why come thou not just now while these black prospects are before me for now could thou look into my heart would thou see a distress worthy of thy barbarous triumph  i was forced to quit my pen  and you say you have tried mrs nortons weight with my mamma  what is done cannot be helped but i wish you had not taken any step in a matter so very concerning to me without first consulting me  forgive me my dear  but that highsould and noble friendship which you avow with so obliging and so uncommon a warmth at the same time that it is the subject of my grateful admiration is no less because of its fervor the ground of my apprehension  well but now to look forward you are of opinion that i must be his and that i cannot leave him with reputation to myself whether with or without his consent i must if so make the best of the bad matter  he went out in the morning intending not to return to dinner unless as he sent me word i would admit him to dine with me  i excused myself the man whose anger is now to be of such high importance to me was it seems displeased  as he as well as i expected that i should receive a letter from you this day by collins i suppose he will not be long before he returns and then possibly he is to be mighty stately mighty mannis mighty coy if you please and then must i be very humble very submissive and try to whine myself into his good graces with downcast eye if not by speech beg his forgivenness for the distance i have so perversely kept him at  yes i warrant you  but i will see how this behavior will sit upon me  you have always raillyd me upon my meekness i think well then i will try if i can be still meeker shall i  o my dear   but let me sit with my hands before me all patience all resignation for i think i hear him coming up  or shall i roundly accost him in the words in the form you my dear have prescribed  he is come in  he has sent to me all impatience in his aspect dorcas says  but i cannot cannot see him   monday night the contents of your letter and my own heavy reflections rendered me incapable of seeing this expecting man  the first word he asked dorcas was if i had received a letter since he had been out  she told me this and her answer that i had and was fasting and had been in tears ever since  he sent to desire an interview with me  i answered by her that i was not very well in the morning if better i would see him as soon as he pleased  very humble was it not my dear  yet he was too royal to take it for humility for dorcas told me he rubbed one side of his face imptiently and said a rash word and was out of humor stalking about the room  half an hour after he sent again desiring very earnestly that i would admit him to supper with me he would enter upon no subjects of conversation but what i should lead to  so i should have been at liberty you see to court him  i again desired to be excused  indeed my dear my eyes were swelled i was very lowspirited and could not think of entering all at once after several days distance into the freedom of conversation which my friends utter rejection of me as well as your opinion have made necessary  he sent up to tell me that as he heard i was fasting if i would promise to eat some chicken which mrs sinclair had ordered for supper he would acquiesce  very kind in his anger  is he not  i promised him can i be more preparatively condescending  how happy i will warrant you if i may meet him in a kind and forgiving humor  i hate myself  but i will not be insulted indeed i will not for all this   letter xii miss clarissa harlowe to miss how tuesday may    i think once more we seem to be in a kind of train but through a storm i will give you the particulars  i heard him in the dining room at five in the morning i had rested very ill and was up too but opened not my door till six when dorcas brought me his request for my company  he approached me and taking my hand as i entered the dining room i went not to bed madam till two yet slept not a wink for gods sake torment me not as you have done for a week past  he paused i was silent  at first proceeded he i thought your resentment of a mere unavailing curiosity could not be deep and that it would go off of itself but when i found it was to be kept up till you knew the success of some new overtures which you had made and which complied with might have deprived me of you for ever how madam could i support myself under the thoughts of having with such an union of interests made so little impression upon your mind in my favor  he paused again i was still silent he went on  i acknowledge that i have a proud heart madam i cannot but hope for some instance of previous and preferable favor from the lady i am ambitious to call mine and that her choice of me should not appear not flagrantly appear directed by the perverseness of her selfish persecutors and my irreconcilable enemies  more to the same purpose he said you know my dear the room he had given me to recriminate upon him in twenty instances i did not spare him but i need not repeat those instances to you every one of these instances i told him convinced me of his pride indeed but not of his merit i confessed that i had as much pride as himself although i hoped it was of another kind than that he so readily avowed but that if he had the least mixture in his of the true pride a pride worthy of his birth of his family and of his fortune he should rather wish i would presume to say to promote mine than either to suppress or to regret that i had it that hence it was that i thought it beneath me to disown what had been my motives for declining for some days past any conversation with him or visit from mr mennell that might lead to points out of my power to determine upon until i heard from my uncle harlowe whom i confessed i had caused to be sounded whether might be favored with his interest to obtain for me a reconciliation with my friends upon terms which i had caused to be proposed to him  he knew not he said and supposed must not presume to ask what these terms were but he could but too well guess at them and that he was to have been the preliminary sacrifice but i must allow him to say that as much as he admired the nobleness of my sentiments in general and in particular that true pride in me which i had spoken of he wished that he could compliment me with such an uniformity in it as should have set me as much above all submission to minds implacable and unreasonable he hoped he might without offense say that my brothers and sisters were such as it had above all favor and condescension to him  duty and nature sir call upon me to make the submissions you speak of there is a father there is a mother there are uncles in the one case to justify and demand those submissions  what pray sir can be pleaded for the condescension as you call it  will you say your merits either with regard to them or to myself may  this to be said after the persecution of those relations after what you have suffered after what you have made me hope let me ask you madam we talked of pride just now what sort of pride must his be which could dispense with inclination and preference in his ladys part of it  what must be that love   love sir who talks of love  was not merit the thing we were talking of  have i ever professed have i ever required of you professions of a passion of that nature but there is no end of these debatings each so faultless each so full of self   i do not think myself faultless madam  but   but what sir  would you evermore argue with me as if you were a child  seeking palliations and making promises  promises of what sir of being in future the man it is a shame a gentleman is not  of being the man   good god interrupted he with eyes lifted up if thou were to be thus severe   well well sir impatiently  i need only to observe that all this vast difference in sentiments shows how unpaird our minds are  so let us   let us what madam  my soul is rising into tumults and he looked so wildly that it startled me a good deal  let us what madam   why sir let us resolve to quit every regard for each other  nay flame not out  i am a poor weakminded creature in some things but where what i should be or not deserve to live if i am not is in the question i have great and invincible spirit or my own conceit betrays me  let us resolve to quit every regard for each other that is more than civil this you may depend upon you may if it will fuel your pride gratify it with this assurance that i will never marry any other man i have seen enough of your sex at least of you  a single life shall ever be my choice  while i will leave you at liberty to pursue your own  indifference worse than indifference said he in a passion   interrupting him  indifference let it be  you have not in my opinion at least deserved it should be other if you have in your own you have cause at least your pride has to hate me for misjudging you   dearest dearest creature snatching my hand with wildness let me beseech you to be uniformly noble civil regards madam  civil regards  can you so expect to narrow and confine such a passion as mine   such a passion as yours mr lovelace deserves to be narrowd and confined  it is either the passion you do not think it or i do not  i question whether your mind is capable of being so narrowd and so widend as is necessary to make it be what i wish it to be lift up your hands and your eyes sir in that emphatical silent wonder as you please but what does it express what does it convince me of but that we are not born for one another  by his soul he said and grasped my hand with an eagerness that hurt it we were born for one another i must be his  i should be his and put his other arm round me although his damnation were to be the purchase   i was terrified  let me leave you  or begone from me sir  is the passion you boast to be thus shockingly declared  you must not go madam  you must not leave me in anger   i will return  i will return  when you can be less violent  less shocking  and he let me go  the man quite frighted me insomuch that when i got into my chamber i found a sudden flow of tears a great relief to me  in half an hour he sent a little billet expressing his concern for the vehemence of his behavior and praying to see me  i went  because i could not help myself i went  he was full of his excuses  o my dear what would you even you do with such a man as this and in my situation  it was very possible for him now he said to account for the workings of a frenzical disorder for his part he was near distraction all last week to suffer as he had suffered and now to talk of civil regards only when he had hoped from the nobleness of my mind   hope what you will interrupted i i must insist upon it that our minds are by no means suited to each other you have brought me into difficulties i am deserted of every friend but miss how my true sentiments i will not conceal it is against my will that i must submit to owe protection from a brothers projects which miss how thinks are not given over to you who have brought me into these streights not with my own concurrence brought me into them remember that   i do remember that madam so often reminded how can i forget it  yet i will owe to you this protection if it be necessary in the earnest hope that you will shun rather than seek mischief if any further inquiry after me be made but what hinders you from leaving me  cannot i send to you the widow fretchville it is plain knows not her own mind the people here indeed are civiller every day than other but i had rather have lodgings more agreeable to my circumstances i best know what will suit them and am resolved not to be obliged to any body if you leave me i will take a civil leave of these people and retire to some one of the neighboring villages and there secreting myself wait my cousin mordens arrival with patience  he presumed he told me from what i said that my application to my relations was unsuccessful that therefore he hoped i would give him leave now to mention the terms in the nature of settlements which he had long intended to propose to me and which having till now delayed to do through accidents not proceeding from himself he had thoughts of urging to me the moment i entered upon my new house and upon finding myself as independent in appearance as i was in fact permit me madam to propose these matters to you  not with an expectation of your immediate answer but for your consideration  were not hesitation a selffelt glow a downcast eye more than enough your advice was too much in my head i hesitated  he urged on upon my silence he would call god to witness to the justice nay to the generosity of his intentions to me if i would be so good as to hear what he had to propose to me as to settlements  could not the man have fallen into the subject without this parade many a point you know is refused and ought to be refused if leave be asked to introduce it and when once refused the refusal must in honor be adhered to  whereas had it been slid in upon one as i may say it might have merited further consideration if such a man as he knows not this who should  i thought myself obliged though not to depart from this subject entirely yet to give it a more diffuse turn in order on the one hand to save myself the mortification of appearing too ready in my compliance after such a distance as had been between us and on the other to avoid in pursuance of your advice the necessity of giving him such a repulse as might again throw us out of the course  a cruel alternative to be reduced to  you talk of generosity mr lovelace said i and you talk of justice perhaps without having considered the force of the words in the sense you use them on this occasion  let me tell you what generosity is in my sense of the word  true generosity is not confined to pecuniary instances it is more than politeness it is more than good faith it is more than honor it is more than justice since all these are but duties and what a worthy mind cannot dispense with but true generosity is greatness of soul it incites us to do more by a fellow creature than can be strictly required of us it obliges us to hasten to the relief of an object that wants relief anticipating even hope or expectation generosity sir will not surely permit a worthy mind to doubt of its honorable and beneficent intentions much less will it allow itself to shock to offend any one and least of all a person thrown by adversity mishap or accident into its protection  what an opportunity had he to clear his intentions had he been so disposed from the latter part of this home observation  but he run away with the first and kept to that  admirably defined he said  but who at this rate madam can be said to be generous to you  your generosity i implore while justice as it must be my sole merit shall be my aim never was there a woman of such nice and delicate sentiments  it is a reflection upon yourself sir and upon the company you have kept if you think these notions either nice or delicate thousands of my sex are more nice than i for they would have avoided the devious path i have been surprised into the consequences of which surprise have laid me under the sad necessity of telling a man who has not delicacy enough to enter into those parts of the female character which are its glory and distinction what true generosity is  his divine monitress he called me  he would endeavor to form his manners as he had often promised by my example but he hoped i would now permit him to mention briefly the justice he proposed to do me in the terms of the settlement a subject so proper before now to have been entered upon and which would have been entered upon long ago had not my frequent displeasure taken from him the opportunity he had often wished for but now having ventured to lay hold of this nothing should divert him from improving it  i have no spirits just now sir to attend to such weighty points what you have a mind to propose write to me and i shall know what answer to return only one thing let me remind you of that if you touch upon any subject in which my papa has a concern i shall judge by your treatment of the father what value you have for the daughter  he looked as if he would choose rather to speak than write but had he said so i had a severe return to have made upon him as possibly he might see by my looks  in this way are we now a sort of calm as i said succeeding a storm  what may happen next whether a storm or a calm with such a spirit as i have to deal with who can tell  but be that as it will i think my dear i am not meanly off and that is a great point with me and which i know you will be glad to hear if it were only that i can see this man without losing any of that dignity what other word can i use speaking of myself that betokens decency and not arrogance which is so necessary to enable me to look up or rather with the minds eye i may say to look down upon a man of this mans cast  although circumstances have so offered that i could not take your advice as to the manner of dealing with him yet you gave me so much courage by it as has enabled me to conduct things to this issue as well as determined me against leaving him which before i was thinking to do at all adventures whether when it came to the point i should have done so or not i cannot say because it would have depended upon his behavior at the time  but let his behavior be what it will i am afraid with you that should any thing offer at last to oblige me to leave him i shall not mend my situation in the worlds eye but the contrary and yet i will not be treated by him with indignity while i have any power to help myself  you my dear have accused me of having modestydaway as you phrase it several opportunities of being  being what my dear  why the wife of a libertine and what a libertine and his wife are my cousin mordens letter tells us  let me here once for all endeavor to account for the motives of my behavior to this man and for the principles i have proceeded upon as they appear to me upon a close selfexamination  be pleased then to allow me to think that my motives on this occasion arise not altogether from maidenly niceness nor yet from the apprehension of what my present tormentor and future husband may think of a precipitate compliance on such a disagreeable behavior as his but they arise principally from what offers to my own heart respecting as i may say its own rectitude its own judgment of the fit and the unfit as i would without study answer for myself to myself in the first place to him and to the world in the second only principles that are in my mind that i found there implanted no doubt by the first gracious planter which therefore impell me as i may say to act up to them that thereby i may to the best of my judgment be enabled to comport myself worthily in both states the single and the married let others act as they will by me  i hope my dear i do not deceive myself and instead of setting about rectifying what is amiss in my heart endeavor to find excuses for habits and peculiarities which i am unwilling to cast off or overcome the heart is very deceitful do you my dear friend lay mine open but surely it is always open before you and spare me not if you find or think it culpable  this observation once for all as i said i thought proper to make to convince you that to the best of my judgment my errors in matters as well of the lesser moment as the greater shall rather be the fault of my understanding than of my will  i am my dearest friend  your everobliged clarissa harlowe   letter xiii miss clarissa harlowe to miss how tuesday night may    mr lovelace has sent me by dorcas his proposals as follow  to spare a delicacy so extreme and to obey you i write and the rather that you may communicate this paper to miss how who may consult any of her friends you shall think proper to have entrusted on this occasion i say entrusted because as you know i have given it out to several persons that we are actually married  in the first place madam i offer to settle upon you by way of jointure your whole estate and moreover to vest in trustees such a part of mine in lancashire as shall produce a clear four hundred pounds a year to be paid to your sole and separate use quarterly  my own estate is a clear  000 l per annum lord m proposes to give me possession either of that which he has in lancashire to which by the way i think i have a better title than he has himself or that we call the lawn in hertfordshire upon my nuptials with a lady whom he so greatly admires and to make that i shall choose a clear  000 l per annum  my too great contempt of censure has subjected me to much traduction it may not therefore be improper to assure you on the word of a gentleman that no part of my estate was ever mortgaged and that although i lived very expensively abroad and made large draughts yet that midsummerday next will discharge all that i owe in the world my notions are not all bad ones i have been thought in pecuniary cases generous it would have deserved another name had i not first been just  if as your own estate is at present in your fathers hands you rather choose that i should make a jointure out of mine tantamount to yours be it what it will it shall be done i will engage lord m to write to you what he proposes to do on the happy occasion not as your desire or expectation but to demonstrate that no advantage is intended to be taken of the situation you are in with your own family  to show the beloved daughter the consideration i have for her i will consent that she shall prescribe the terms of agreement in relation to the large sums which must be in her fathers hands arising from her grandfathers estate i have no doubt but he will be put upon making large demands upon you all those it shall be in your power to comply with for the sake of your own peace and the remainder shall be paid into your hands and be entirely at your disposal as a fund to support those charitable donations which i have heard you so famed for out of your family and for which you have been so greatly reflected upon in it  as to clothes jewels and the like against the time you shall choose to make your appearance it will be my pride that you shall not be beholden for such of these as shall be answerable to the rank of both to those who have had the stupid folly to renounce a daughter they deserved not you must excuse me madam you would mistrust my sincerity in the rest could i speak of these people with less asperity though so nearly related to you  these madam are my proposals they are such as i always designed to make whenever you would permit me to enter into the delightful subject but you have been so determined to try every method for reconciling yourself to your relations even by giving me absolutely up for ever that yo have seemed to think it but justice to keep me at  distance till the event of that your predominant hope could be seen it is now seen  and although i have been and perhaps still am ready to regret the want of that preference i wished for from you as miss clarissa harlowe yet i am sure as the husband of mrs lovelace i shall be more ready to adore than to blame you for the pangs you have given to a heart the generosity or rather justice of which my implacable enemies have taught you to doubt and this still the readier as i am persuaded that those pangs never would have been given by a mind so noble had not the doubt been entertained perhaps with too great an appearance of reason and as i hope i shall have it to reflect that the moment the doubt shall be overcome the indifference will cease  i will only add that if i have omitted any thing that would have given you further satisfaction or if the above terms be short of what you would wish you will be pleased to supply them as you think fit and when i know your pleasure i will instantly order articles to be drawn up conformably that nothing in my power may be wanting to make you happy  you will now dearest madam judge how far all the rest depends upon yourself  you see my dear what he offers you see it is all my fault that he has not made these offers before  i am a strange creature to be to blame in everything and to everybody yet neither intend the ill at the time nor know it to be the ill till too late or so nearly too late that i must give up all the delicacy he talks of to compound for my fault  i shall now judge how far all the rest depends upon myself so coldly concludes he such warm and in the main unobjectible proposals would you not as you read have supposed that the paper would conclude with the most earnest demand of a day  i own i had that expectation so strong resulting naturally as i may say from the premises that without studying for dissatisfaction i could not help being dissatisfied when i came to the conclusion  but you say there is no help i must perhaps make further sacrifices all delicacy it seems is to be at an end with me but if so this man knows not what every wise man knows that prudence and virtue and delicacy of mind in a wife do the husband more real honor in the eye of the world than the same qualities were she destitute of them in himself as the want of them in her does him more dishonour for are not the wifes errors the husbands reproach how justly his reproach is another thing  i will consider this paper and write to it if i am able for it seems now all the rest depends upon myself  letter xiv miss clarissa harlowe to miss how wednesday morning may    mr lovelace would fain have engaged me last night but as i was not prepared to enter upon the subject of his proposals intending to consider them maturely and was not highly pleased with his conclusion and then there is hardly any getting from him in tolerable time overnight i desired to be excused seeing him till morning  about seven oclock we met in the dining room i find he was full of expectation that i should meet him with a very favorable who knows but with a thankful aspect  and i immediately found by his sullen countenance that he was under no small disappintment that i did not  my dearest love are you well  why look you so solemn upon me  will your indifference never be over  if i have proposed terms in any respect short of your expectation   i told him that he had very considerately mentioned my showing his proposals to miss how and consulting any of her friends upon them by her means and i should have an opportunity to send them to her by collins byandby and so insisted to suspend any talk upon that subject till i had her opinion upon them  good god  if there were but the least loophole the least room for delay  but he was writing a letter to his uncle to give him an account of his situation with me and could not finish it so satisfactorily either to my lord or to himself as if i would condescend to say whether the terms he had proposed were acceptable or not  thus far i told him i could say that my principal point was peace and reconciliation with my family as to other matters the genteelness of his own spirit would put him upon doing more for me than i should ask or expect wherefore if all he had to write about was to know what lord m would do on my account he might spare himself the trouble for that my utmost wishes as to myself were much more easily gratified than he perhaps imagined  he asked me then if i would so far permit him to touch upon the happy day as to request his uncles presence on the occasion and to be my father  father had a sweet and venerable sound with it i said i should be glad to have a father who would own me  was not this plain speaking think you my dear yet it rather i must own appears so to me on reflection than was designed freely at the time for i then with a sigh from the bottom of my heart thought of my own father bitterly regretting that i am an outcast from him and from my mother  mr lovelace i thought seemed a little affected at the manner of my speaking as well as at the sad reflection i suppose  i am but a very young creature mr lovelace said i and wiped my averted eye although you have kindly and in love to me introduced so much sorrow to me already so you must not wonder that the word father strikes so sensibly upon the heart of a child ever dutiful till she knew you and whose tender years still require the paternal wing  he turned toward the window rejoice with me my dear since i seem devoted to him that the man is not absolutely impenetrable  his emotion was visible yet he endeavored to suppress it  approaching me again again he was obliged to turn from me angelic something he said but then obtaining a heart more suitable to his wish he once more approached me  for his own part he said as lord m was so subject to the gout he was afraid that the compliment he had just proposed to make him might if made occasion a longer suspension than he could bear to think of and if it did it would vex him to the heart that he had made it  i could not say a single word to this you know my dear but you will guess at my thoughts of what h said  so much passionate love lipdeep so prudent and so dutifully patient at heart to a relation he had till now so undutifully despised  why why a i thrown upon such a man thought i   he hesitated as if contending with himself an after taking a turn or two about the room  he w at a great loss what to determine upon he said because he had not the honor of knowing when he w to be made the happiest of men  would to god might that very instant be resolved upon  he stopped a moment or two staring in my dow cast face did i not o my beloved friend thi you want a father or a mother just then but he could not so soon as he wished procure my consent to a day in that case he thought the compliment might as well be made to lord m as not  since the settlements might be drawn and engrossed in the intervenient time which would pacify his impatience as no time would be lost  you will suppose how i was affected by this speech by repeating the substance of what he said upon it as follows   but by his soul he knew not so much was i upon the reserve and so much latent meaning did my eye import whether when he most hoped to please me he was not farthest from doing so would i vouchsafe to say whether i approved of his compliment to lord m or not  miss how thought i at that moment says i must not run away from this man  to be sure mr lovelace if this matter is ever to be it must be agreeable to me to have the full approbation of one side since i cannot have that of the other  if this matter be ever to be good god what words were those at this time of day and full approbation of one side why that word approbation when the greatest pride of all his family was that of having the honor of so dear a creature for their relation would to heaven my dearest life added he that without complimenting anybody tomorrow might be the happiest day of my life  what say you my angel with a trembling impatience that seemed not affected  what say you for tomorrow  it was likely my dear i could say much to it or name another day had i been disposed to the latter with such an hinted delay from him  next day madam if not tomorrow  or the day after that  and taking my two hands stared me into a halfconfusion  no no you cannot think all of a sudden there should be reason for such a hurry it will be most agreeable to be sure for my lord to be present  i am all obedience and resignation returned the wretch with a selfpluming air as if he had acquiesced to a proposal made by me and had complimented me with a great piece of selfdenial  modesty i think required it of me that it should pass so did it not  i think it did would to heaven  but what signifies wishing  but when he would have rewarded himself as he had heretofore called it for this selfsupposed concession with a kiss i repulsed him with a just and very sincere disdain  he seemed both vexed and surpised as one who had made proposals that he had expected every thing from he plainly said that he thought our situation would entitle him to such an innocent freedom and he was both amazed and grieved to be thus scornfully repulsed  no reply could be made by me i abruptly broke from him i recollect as i passed by one of the pierglasses that i saw in it his clenched hand offered in wrath to his forehead the words indifference by his soul next to hatred i heard him speak and something of ice he mentioned i heard not what  whether he intends to write to my lord or to miss montague i cannot tell but as all delicacy ought to be over with me now perhaps i am to blame to expect it from a man who may not know what it is if he does not and yet thinks himself very delicate and intends not to be otherwise i am rather to be pitied than he to be censured and after all since i must take him as i find him i must that is to say as a man so vain and so accustomed to be admired that not being conscious of internal defect he has taken no pains to polish more than his outside and as his proposals are higher than my expectations and as in his own opinion he has a great deal to bear from me i will no new offense preventing sit down to answer them  and if possible in terms as unobjectible to him as his are to me  but after all see you not my dear more and more the mismatch that there is in our minds  however i am willing to compound for my fault by giving up if that may be all my punishment the expectation of what is deemed happiness in this life with such a husband as i fear he will make in short i will content myself to be a suffering person through the state to the end of my life a long one it cannot be   this may qualify him as it may prove from stings of conscience from misbehaviour to a first wife to be a more tolerable one to a second though not perhaps better deserving while my story to all who shall know it will afford these instructions that the eye is a traitor and ought ever to be mistrusted that form is deceitful in other words that a fine person is seldom paired by a fine mind and that sound principles and a good heart are the only bases on which the hopes of a happy future either with respect to the here or to the hereafter can be built  and so much at present for mr lovelaces proposals of which i desire your opinion  i am my dearest frind  your everobliged cl harlowe   four letters are written by mr lovelace from the date of his last giving the state of affairs between him and the lady pretty much the same as in hers in the same period allowing for the humor in his and for his resentments expressed with vehemence on her resolution to leave him if her friends could be prevailed upon  a few extracts from them will be only given  what says he might have become of me and my projects had not her father and the rest of the implacables stood my friends after violent threatenings and vows of revenge he says  tis plain she would have given me up for ever nor should i have been able to prevent her abandoning of me unless i had torn up the tree by the roots to come at the fruit which i hope still to bring down by a gentle shake or two if i can but have patience to stay the ripening season  thus triumphing in his unpolite cruelty he says  after her haughty treatment of me i am resolved she shall speak out there are a thousand beauties to be discovered in the face in the accent in the bushbeating hesitations of a woman that is earnest about a subject which she wants to introduce yet knows not how silly rogues calling themselves generous ones would value themselves for sparing a ladys confusion but they are silly rogues indeed and rob themselves of prodigious pleasure by the forwardness and at the same time deprive her o displaying a world of charms which only can be manifested on these occasions hardheartedness as it is called is an essential of the libertines character familiarized to the distresses he occasions he is seldom betrayed by tenderness into a complaisant weakness unworthy of himself how have i enjoyed a charming creatures confusion as i have sat over against her her eyes lost in admiration of my shoebuckles or meditating some uncouth figure in the carpet  mentioning the settlements he says  i am in earnest as to the terms if i marry her and i have no doubt but that i shall after my pride my ambition my revenge if thou will is gratified i will do her noble justice the more i do for such a prudent such an excellent oeconomist the more shall i do for myself  but by my soul belford her haughtiness shall be brought down to own both love and obligation to me  nor will this sketch of settlements bring us forwarder than i would have it modesty of sex will stand my friend at any time at the very altar our hands joined i would engage to make this proud beauty leave the parson and me and all my friends present though there were twenty of them to look like fools upon one another while she took wing and flew out of the churchdoor or window if that were open and the door shut and this only by a very word  he mentions his rash expression that she should be his although damnation were to be the purchase and owns that at that instant he was upon the point of making a violent attempt but that he was checked in the very moment and but just in time by the awe he was struck with on again casting his eye upon her terrified but lovely face and seeing as he thought her spotless heart in every line of it  o virtue virtue says he what is there in thee that can thus affect the heart of such a man as me against my will  whence these involuntary tremors and fear of giving mortal offense  what art thou that acting in the breast of a feeble woman can strike so much awe into a spirit so intrepid which never before no not in my first attempt young as i then was and frighted at my own boldness till i found myself forgiven had such an effect upon me  he paints in lively colors that part of the scene tween him and the lady where she says the word father has a sweet and venerable found with it  i was exceedingly affected says he upon the occasion but was ashamed to be surprised by her into such a fit of unmanly weakness  so ashamed that i was resolved to subdue it at the instant and guard against the like for the future yet at that moment i more than half regretted that i could not permit her to enjoy a triumph which she so well deserved to glory in  her youth her beauty her artless innocence and her manner equally beyond comparison or description but her indiffeence belford  that she could resolve to sacrifice me to the malice of my enemies and carry on the desig in so clandestine a manner  yet love her as i do to frenzy  revere her as i do to adoration  these were the recollections with which i fortified my recreant heart against her  yet after all if she persevere she must conquer  coward as she has made me that never was a coward before  he concludes his fourth letter in a vehement rage upon her repulsing him when he offered to salute her having supposed as he owns that she would have bee all condescension on his proposals to her  this says he i will for ever remember against her in order to steel my own heart that i may c through a rock of ice to hers and repay her for the disdain the scorn which glowed in her countenance and was apparent in her air at her abrup departure from me after such obliging behavior on my side and after i had so earnestly pressed h for an early day  the women below say she hates me she despises me  and it is true she does she must  and why cannot i take their advice  i will not long my fair one be despised by thee and laughed at by them  let me acquaint thee jack adds he by way of postscript that this effort of hers to leave me if she could have been received her sending for a coach on sunday no doubt resolving not to return if she had gone out without me for did she not declare that she had thought to retire to some of the villages about town where she could be safe and private have al together so much alarmed me that i have been adding to the written instructions for my servant and the people below how to act in case she should elope in my absence particularly letting my fellow know what he shall report to strangers in case she shall throw herself upon any such with a resolution to abandon me these instructions i shall further add to as circumstances offer  letter xv miss how to miss clarissa harlowe thursday may    i have neither time nor patience my dear friend to answer to every material article in your last leters just now received mr lovelaces proposals e all i like of him and yet as you do i think that he concludes them not with that warmth and arnestness which we might naturally have expected om him never in my life did i hear or read of so atient a man with such a blessing in his reach but retches of his cast between you and me my dear ave not i fancy the ardors that honest men have who knows as your bell once spitefully said but he may have half a dozen creatures to quit his hands of before he engages for life  yet i believe you must not expect him to be honest on this side of his grand macteric  he to suggest delay from a compliment to be made to lord m and to give time for settlements  he a part of whose character it is not to know what complaisance to his relations is  i have no patience with him  you did indeed want an interposing iend on the affecting occasion which you mention n yours of yesterday morning but upon my word were i to have been that moment in your ution and been so treated i would have torn his eyes out and left it to his own heart when i had done to furnish the reason for it  would to heaven tomorrow without complimenting anybody might be his happy day  villain after he had himself suggested the compliment  and i think he accuses you of delaying  fellow that he is  how my heart is wrung   but as matters now stand betwixt you i am very unseasonable in expressing my resentments against him  yet i dont know whether i am or not neither since it is the cruellest of fates for a woman to be forced to have a man whom her heart despises you must at least despise him at times however his clenched fist offered to his forehead on your leaving him in just displeasure i wish it had been a poleax and in the hand of his worst enemy  i will endeavor to think of some method of some scheme to get you from him and to fix you safel somewhere till your cousin morden arrives a scheme to lie by you and to be pursued as occasion may be given you are sure that you can go abroa when you please and that our correspondence is safe i cannot however for the reasons heretofore mentioned respecting your own reputation wish you  leave him while he gives you not cause to suspec his honor but your heart i know would be the easier if you were sure of some asylum in case of necessity  yet once more i say i can have no notion the he can or dare to mean you dishonor  but then the man is a fool my dear  that is all  however since you are thrown upon a fool man the fool at the first opportunity and though i do that this man will be the most ungovernable of foo as all witty and vain fools are take him as a punishment since you cannot as a reward in short as o given to convince you that there is nothing but i perfection in this life  i shall be impatient till i have your next i am my dearest friend  your everaffectionate and faithful anna how  letter xvi mr belford to robert lovelace esquire wednesday may    i would conceal nothing from you that relates to yourself so much as the enclosed you will see what the noble writer apprehends from you and wishes of you with regard to miss harlowe and how much at heart all your relations have it that you do honorably by her they compliment me with an influence over you which i wish with all my soul you would let me have in this article  let me once more entreat thee lovelace to reflect before it be too late before the mortal offense e given upon the graces and merits of this lady let thy frequent remorses at last end in one effectual one let not pride and wantonness of heart ruin thy fairer prospects by my faith lovelace there is nothing ut vanity conceit and nonsense in our wild schemes as we grow older we shall be wiser and looking back upon our foolish notions of the present hour shall certainly despise ourselves our youth dissipated when we think of the honorable engagements we might have made thou more especially if thou let such a matchless creature slide through thy fingers a creature pure from her cradle in all her actions and sentiments uniformly noble strict in the performance of all her even unrewarded duties to the most unreasonable of fathers what a wife will she make the man who shall have the honor to call her his  reflect likewise upon her sufferings for thee actually at the time thou art forming schemes to ruin her at least in her sense of the word is she not laboring under a fathers curse laid upon her by thy means and for thy sake and would thou give operation and completion to this curse  and what lovelace all the time is thy pride thou that vainly imaginest that the whole family of the harlowes and that of the howes too are but thy machines unknown to themselves to bring about thy purposes and thy revenge what art thou more or better than the instrument even of her implacable brother and envious sister to perpetrate the disgrace of the most excellent of sisters which they are moved to by vilely low and sordid motives  can thou bear lovelace to be thought the machine of thy inveterate enemy james harlowe  nay art thou not the cully of that still viler joseph leman who serves himself as much by thy money as he does thee by the double part he acts by thy direction  and the devils agent besides who only can and who certainly will suitably reward thee if thou proceedest and if thou effectest thy wicked purpose  could any man but you put together upon paper the following questions with so much unconcern as you seem to have written them  give them a reperusal o heart of adamant whither can she fly to avoid me her parents will not receive her her uncles will not entertain her her beloved norton is in their direction and cannot miss how dare not she has not one friend in town but me is entirely a stranger to the town see letter ii p      what must that heart be that can triumph in a distress so deep into which she has been plunged by thy elaborate arts and contrivances and what a sweet yet sad reflection was that which had almost had its due effect upon thee arising from thy naming lord m for her nuptial father her tender years inclining her to wish a father and to hope a friend  o my dear lovelace can thou resolve to be instead of the father thou have robbed her of a devil  thou know that i have no interest that i can have no view in wishing thee to do justice to this admirable creature for thy own sake once more i conjure thee for thy familys sake and for the sake of our common humanity let me beseech thee to be just to miss clarissa harlowe  no matter whether these expostulations are in character from me or not i have been and am bad enough if thou take my advice which is as the enclosed will show thee the advice of all thy family thou will perhaps have it to reproach me and but perhaps neither that thou art not a worse man than myself but if thou do not and if thou ruinest such a virtue all the complicated wickedness of ten devils let loose among the innocent with full power over them will not do so much vile and base mischief as thou will be guilty of  it is said that the prince on his throne is not safe if a mind so desperate can be found as values not its own life so may it be said that the most immaculate virtue is not safe if a man can be met with who has no regard to his own honor and makes a jest of the most solemn vows and protestations  thou may by trick chicane and false colors thou who art worse than a pickeroon in love overcome a poor lady so entangled as thou have entangled her so unprotected as thou have made her but consider how much more generous and just to her and noble to thyself it is to overcome thyself  once more it is no matter whether my past or future actions countenance my preachment as perhaps thou wilt call what i have written but this i promise thee that whenever i meet with a woman of but one half of miss harlowes perfections who will favor me with her acceptance i will take the advice i give and marry nor will i attempt to try her honor at the hazard of my own in other words i will not degrade an excellent creature in her own eyes by trials when i have no cause for suspicion and let me add with respect to thy eagleships manifestation of which thou boastest in thy attempts upon the innocent and uncorrupted rather than upon those whom thou humourously comparest to wrens philtits and wagtails vol iii p      that i hope i have it not once to reproach myself that i ruined the morals of any one creature who otherwise would have been uncorrupted guilt enough in contributing to the continued guilt of other poor wretches if i am one of those who take care she shall never rise again when she has once fallen  whatever the capital devil under whose banner thou have listed will let thee do with regard to this incomparable woman i hope thou will act with honor in relation to the enclosed between lord m and me who as thou will see desires that thou may not know he wrote on the subject for reasons i think very far from being creditable to thyself and that thou will take as meant the honest zeal for thy service of  thy real friend j belford  letter xvii lord m to john belford esquire inclosed in the preceding  m hall monday may    sir if any man in the world has power over my nephew it is you i therefore write this to beg you to interfere in the affair depending between him and the most accomplished of women as every one says and what every one says must be true  i dont know that he has any bad designs upon her but i know his temper too well not to be apprehensive upon such long delays and the ladies here have been for some time in fear for her my sister sadleir in particular who you know is a wise woman says that these delays in the present case must be from him rather than from the lady he had always indeed a strong antipathy to marriage and may think of playing his dogs tricks by her as he has by so many others if there is any danger of this it is best to prevent it in time for when a thing is done advice comes too late  he has always had the folly and impertinence to make a jest of me for using proverbs but as they are the wisdom of whole nations and ages collected into a small compass i am not to be shamed out of sentences that often contain more wisdom in them than the tedious harangues of most of our parsons and moralists let him laugh at them if he pleases you and i know better things mr belford  though you have kept company with a wolf you have not learnt to howl of him  but nevertheless you must not let him know that i have written to you on this subject i am ashamed to say it but he has ever treated me as if i were a man of very common understanding and would perhaps think never the better of the best advice in the world for coming from me  i am sure he has no reason to slight me as he does he may and will be the better for me if he outlives me though he once told me to my face that i might do as i would with my estate for that he for his part loved his liberty as much as he despised money he thought i suppose that i could not cover him with my wings without pecking at him with my bill though i never used to be pecking at him without very great occasion and god knows he might have my very heart if he would but endeavor to oblige me by studying his own good for that is all i desire of him indeed it was his poor mother that first spoiled him and i have been but too indulgent to him since  a fine grateful disposition you will say to return evil for good but that was always his way  this match however as the lady has such an extraordinary share of wisdom and goodness might set all to rights and if you can forward it i would enable him to make whatever settlements he could wish and should not be unwilling to put him in possession of another pretty estate besides for what do i live for as i have often said but to see him and my two nieces well married and settled may heaven settle him down to a better mind and turn his heart to more of goodness and consideration  if the delays are on his side i tremble for the lady and if on hers as he tells my niece charlotte i could wish the young lady were apprized that delays are dangerous excellent as she is i can tell her she ought not to depend on her merits with such a changeable fellow and such a professed marriagehater as he has been i know you are very good at giving kind hints a word to the wise is enough  i wish you would try what you can do with him for i have warned him so often of his wicked practices that i begin to despair of my words having any effect upon him but let him remember that vengeance though it comes with leaden feet strikes with iron hands if he behaves ill in this case he may find it so what a pity it is that a man of his talents and learning should be so vile a rake alas alas une poignee de bonne vie vaut mieux que plein muy de clerge a handful of good life is better than a whole bushel of learning  you may throw in too as his friend that should he provoke me it may not be too late for me to marry my old friend wycherly did so when he was older than i am on purpose to plague his nephew and inspite of this gout i might have a child or two still and have not been without some thoughts that way when he has angered me more than ordinary but these thoughts have gone off again hitherto upon my considering that the children of very young and very old men tho i am not so very old neither last not long and that old men when they marry young women are said to make much of death yet who knows but that matrimony might be good against the gouty humors i am troubled with  the sentences that i have purposely wove into my discourse may be of some service to you in talking to him but use them sparingly that he may not discover that you borrow your darts from my quiver  may your good counsels mr belford founded upon the hints i have given pierce his heart and incite him to do what will be so happy for himself and so necessary for the honor of that admirable lady whom i long to see his wife and if i may i will not think of one for myself  should he abuse the confidence she has placed in him i myself shall pray that vengeance may fll upon his head  raro  raro  i quite forget all my latin but i think it is  raro antecedentem scelestum deseruit pede poena claudo where vice goes before vengeance sooner or later will follow  i shall make no apologies to you for this trouble i know how well you love him and me and there is nothing in which you could serve us both more importantly than in forwarding this match to the utmost of your power when it is done how shall i rejoice to see you at m hall mean time i shall long to hear that you are likely to be successful and am  dear sir your most faithful friend and servant m   mr lovelace having not returned an answer to mr belfords expostulatory letter so soon as mr belford expected he wrote to him expressing his apprehension that he had disobliged him by his honest freedom among other things he says  i pass my time here at watford attending my dying uncle very heavily i cannot therefore by any means dispense with thy correspondence and why should thou punish me for having more conscience and remorse than thyself thou who never thoughtest either conscience or remorse an honor to thee and i have besides a melancholy story to tell thee in relation to belton and his thomasine and which may afford a lesson to all the keeping class  i have a letter from each of our three companions in the time they have all the wickedness that thou have but not the wit some new rogueries do two of them boast of which i think it completed deserve the gallows  i am far from hating intrigue upon principle but to have awkward fellows plot and commit their plots to paper destitute of the seasonings of the acumen which is thy talent how extremely shocking must their letters be  but do thou lovelace whether thou art or art not determined upon thy measures with regard to the fine lady in thy power enliven my heavy heart by thy communications and thou will oblige  thy melancholy friend j belford   letter xviii mr lovelace to john belford esquire friday night may    when i have opened my views to thee so amply as i have done in my former letters and have told thee that my principal design is but to bring virtue to a trial that if virtue it need not be afraid of and that the reward of it will be marriage that is to say if after i have carried my point i cannot prevail upon her to live with me the life of honor see vol iii p      for that thou know is the wish of my heart i am amazed at the repetition of thy wambling nonsense  i am of opinion with thee that some time hence when i am grown wiser i shall conclude that there is nothing but vanity conceit and nonsense in my present wild schemes but what is this saying but that i must be first wiser  i do not intend to let this matchless creature slide through my fingers  art thou able to say half the things in her praise that i have said and am continually saying or writing  her gloomy father cursed the sweet creature because she put it out of his wicked power to compel her to have the man she hated thou know how little merit she has with me on this score  and shall i not try the virtue i intend upon full proof to reward because her father is a tyrant  why art thou thus eternally reflecting upon so excellent a woman as if thou were assured she would fail in the trial  nay thou declarest every time thou writest on the subject that she will that she must yield entangled as she is and yet make her virtue the pretense of thy solicitude for her  an instrument of the vile james harlowe do thou call me  o jack how i could curse thee  i an instrument of that brother of that sister  but mark the end  and thou shall see what will become of that brother and of that sister  play not against me my own acknowleged sensibilities i desire thee sensibilities which at the same time that they contradict thy charge of an adamantine heart in thy friend thou had known nothing of had i not communicated them to thee  if i ruin such a virtue say thou  eternal monotonist  again the most immaculate virtue may be ruined by men who have no regard to their honor and who make a jest of the most solemn oaths etc what must be the virtue that will be ruined without oaths is not the world full of these deceptions and are not lovers oaths a jest of hundreds of years standing and are not cautions against the perfidy of our sex a necessary part of the female education  i do intend to endeavor to overcome myself but i must first try if i cannot overcome this lady have i not said that the honor of her sex is concerned that i should try  whenever thou meetest with a woman of but half her perfections thou will marry  do jack  can a girl be degraded by trials who is not overcome  i am glad that thou take crime to thyself for not endeavoring to convert the poor wretches whom others have ruined i will not recriminate upon thee belford as i might when thou flatterest thyself that thou never ruinedst the morals of any young creature who otherwise would not have been corrupted  the palliating consolation of an hottentot heart determined rather to gluttonize on the garbage of other soul feeders than to reform  but tell me jack would thou have spared such a girl as my rosebud had i not by my example engaged thy generosity nor was my rosebud the only girl i spared  when my power was acknowleged who more merciful than thy friend  it is resistance that inflames desire sharpens the darts of love and blows its fire love is disarmed that meets with too much ease he languishes and does not care to please the women know this as well as the men they love to be addressed with spirit and therefore it is their golden fruit they guard with so much care to make possession hard   whence for a byreflection the ardent the complaisant gallant is so often preferred to the cold husband and yet the sex do not consider that variety or novelty gives the ardour and the obsequiousness and that were the rake as much used to them as the husband is he would be and is to his own wife if married as indifferent to their favors and the husband in his turn would to another woman be the rake let the women upon the whole take this lesson from a lovelacealways to endeavor to make themselves as new to a husband and to appear as elegant and as obliging to him as they are desirous to appear to a lover and actually were to him as such and then the rake which all women love will last longer in the husband than it generally does  but to return  if i have not sufficiently cleared my conduct to thee in the above i refer thee once more to mine of the   th of last month see vol iii letter xvii p  0   and prythee jack lay me not under a necessity to repeat the same things so often i hope thou read what i write more than once  i am not displeased that thou art so apprehensive of my resentment that i cannot miss a day without making thee uneasy thy conscience it is plain tells thee that thou have deserved my displeasure and if it has convinced thee of that it will make thee afraid of repeating thy fault see that this be the consequence else now that thou have told me how i can punish thee it is very likely that i do punish thee by my silence although i have as much pleasure in writing on this charming subject as thou can have in reading what i write  when a boy if a dog ran away from me through fear i generally looked about for a stone a stick or a brickbat and if neither offered to my hand i skimmd my hat after him to make him afraid for something what signifies power if we do not exert it  let my lord know thou have scribbled to me but give him not the contents of thy epistle though a parcel of crude stuff he would think there was something in it poor arguments will do in favor of what we like but the stupid peer little thinks that this lady is a rebel to love on the contrary not only he but all the world believe her to be a volunteer in his service  so i shall incur blame and she will be pitied if any thing happen amiss  since my lords heart is so set upon this match i have written already to let him know that my unhappy character has given my beloved an ungenerous diffidence of me that she is so mothersick and fatherfond that she had rather return to harloweplace than marry that she is even apprehensive that the step she has taken of going off with me will make the ladies of a family of such name and rank as ours think slightly of her that therefore i desire his lordship though this hint i tell him must be very delicately touched to write me such a letter as i can show her let him treat me in it ever so freely i shall not take it amiss because i know his lordship takes pleasure in writing to me in a corrective style that he may make what offers he pleases on the marriage that i desire his presence at the ceremony that i may take from his hand the greatest blessing that mortal man can give me  i have not absolutely told the lady that i would write to his lordship to this effect yet have given her reason to think i will so that without the last necessity i shall not produce the answer i expect from him for i am very loath i own to make use of any of my familys names for the furthering of my designs and yet i must make all secure before i pull off the mask this was my motive for bringing her hither  thus thou see that the old peers letter came very seasonably i thank thee for it but as to his sentences they cannot possibly do me good i was early suffocated with his wisdom of nations when a boy i never asked any thing of him but out flew a proverb and if the tendency of that was to deny me i never could obtain the least favor this gave me so great an aversion to the very word that when a child i made it a condition with my tutor who was an honest parson that i would not read my bible at all if he would not excuse me one of the wisest books in it to which however i had no other objection than that it was called the proverbs and as for solomon he was then a hated character with me not because of his polygamy but because i had conceived him to be such another musty old fellow as my uncle  well but let us leave old saws to old men  what signifies thy tedious whining over thy departing relation is it not generally agreed that he cannot recover will it not be kind in thee to put him out of his misery i hear that he is pestered still with visits from doctors and apothecaries and surgeons that they cannot cut so deep as the mortification has gone and that in every visit in every scarification inevitable death is pronounced upon him why then do they keep tormenting him is it not to take away more of his living fleece than of his dead flesh  when a man is given over the fee should surely be refused are they not now robbing his heirs  what have thou to do if the will be as thou would have it  he sent for thee did he not to close his eyes he is but an uncle is he  let me see if i mistake not it is in the bible or some other good book can it be in herodotus  o i believe it is in josephus a halfsacred and halfprofane author he tells us of a king of syria put out of his pain by his prime minister or one who deserved to be so for his contrivance the story says if i am right that he spread a wet cloth over his face which killing him he reigned in his place a notable fellow perhaps this wet cloth in the original is what we now call laudanum a potion that overspreads the faculties as the wet cloth did the face of the royal patient and the translator knew not how to render it  but how like a forlorn varlet thou subscribest thy melancholy friend j belford  melancholy for what to stand by and see fair play between an old man and death i thought thou had been more of a man thou that art not afraid of an acute death a swords point to be so plaguily hypd at the consequences of a chronical one  what though the scarificators work upon him day by day it is only upon a caput mortuum and prythee go to to use the stylum veterum and learn of the royal butchers who for sport an hundred times worse men than thy lovelace widow ten thousand at a brush and make twice as many fatherless and are dubbed magnus or le grand for it learn of them i say how to support a single death  i wish my uncle had given me the opportunity of setting thee a better example thou should have seen what a brave fellow i had been and had i had occasion to write my conclusion would have been this i hope the old trojans happy in that hope i am so and  thy rejoicing friend r lovelace dwell not always jack upon one subject let me have poor beltons story the sooner the better if i can be of service to him tell him he may command me either in purse or person yet the former with a freer will than the latter for how can i leave my goddess but i will issue my commands to my other vassals to attend thy summons if ye want head let me know if not my quota on this occasion is money    letter xix mr belford to robert lovelace esquire saturday may  0 not one word will i reply to such an abandoned wretch as thou have shown thyself to be in thine of last night i will leave the lady to the protection of that power who only can work miracles and to her own merits still i have hopes that these will save her  i will proceed as thou desire to poor beltons case and the rather as it has thrown me into such a train of thinking upon our past lives our present courses and our future views as may be of service to both if i can give due weight to the reflections that arise from it  the poor man made me a visit on thursday in this my melancholy attendance he began with complaints of his ill health and spirits his hectic cough and his increased malady of spitting of blood and then led to his story  a confounded one it is and which highly aggravates his other maladies for it has come out that his thomasine who truly would be newchristend you know that her name might be nearer in sound to the christian name of the man whom she pretended to dote upon has for many years carried on an intrigue with a fellow who had been hostler to her father an innkeeper at darking of whom at the expense o poor tom she has made a gentleman and managed it so that having the art to make herself his cashier she has been unable to account for large sums which poor belton thought forthcoming at his demand and had trusted to her custody in order to pay off a mortgage upon his paternal estate in kent which his heart had run upon leaving clear but which cannot now be done and will soon be foreclosed and yet she has so long passed for his wife that he knows not what to resolve upon about her nor about the two boys he was so fond of supposing them to be his whereas now he begins to doubt his share in them  so keeping dont do lovelace it is not the eligible life a man my keep a woman said the poor fellow to me but not his estate  two interests  then my tottering fabric pointing to his emaciated carcass  we do well to value ourselves upon our liberty or to speak more properly upon the liberties we take we had need to run down matrimony as we do and to make that state the subject of our frothy jests when we frequently render ourselves for this of toms is not a singular case the dupes and fools of women who generally govern us by arts our wise heads penetrate not more absolutely than a wife would attempt to do  let us consider this point a little and that upon our own principles as libertines setting aside what the laws of our country and its customs oblige from us which nevertheless we cannot get over till we have got over almost all moral obligations as members of society  in the first place let us consider we who are in possession of estates by legal descent how we should have liked to have been such naked destitute varlets as we must have been had our fathers been as wise as ourselves and despised matrimony as we do  and then let us ask ourselves if we ought not to have the same regard for our posterity as we are glad our fathers had for theirs  but this perhaps is too moral a consideration  to proceed therefore to those which will be more striking to us how can we reasonably expect economy or frugality or any thing indeed but riot and waste from creatures who have an interest and must therefore have views different from our own  they know the uncertain tenure our fickle humours by which they hold and is it to be wondered at supposing them to be provident harlots that they should endeavor if they have the power to lay up against a rainy day or if they have not the power that they should squander all they can come at when they are sure of nothing but the present hour and when the life they live and the sacrifices they have made put conscience and honor out of the question  whereas a wife having the same familyinterest with her husband lies not under either the same apprehensions or temptations and has not broken through of necessity at least has not those restraints which education has fastened upon her and if she make a private purse which we are told by antimatrimonialists all wives love to do and has children it goes all into the same family at the longrun  then as to the great article of fidelity to your bed are not women of family who are welleducated under greater restraints than creatures who if they ever had reputation sacrifice it to sordid interest or to more sordid appetite the moment they give up to you does not the example you furnish of having succeeded with her give encouragement for others to attempt her likewise for with all her blandishments can any man be so credulous or so vain as to believe that the woman be could persuade another may not prevail upon  adultery is so capital a guilt that even rakes and libertines if not wholly abandoned and as i may say invited by a womans levity disavow and condemn it but here in a state of keeping a woman is in no danger of incurring legally at least that guilt and you yourself have broken through and overthrown in her all the fences and boundaries of moral honesty and the modesty and reserves of her sex and what tie shall hold her against inclination or interest and what shall deter an attempter  while a husband has this security from legal sanctions that if his wife be detected in a criminal conversation with a man of fortune the most likely by bribes to seduce her he may recover very great damages and procure a divorce besides which to say nothing of the ignominy is a consideration that must have some force upon both parties and a wife must be vicious indeed and a reflection upon a mans own choice who for the sake of change and where there are no qualities to seduce nor affluence to corrupt will run so many hazards to injure her husband in the tenderest of all points  but there are difficulties in procuring a divorce  and so there ought  and none says the rake in parting with a mistress whenever you suspect her or whenever weary of her you have a mind to change her for another  but must not the man be a brute indeed who can cast off a woman whom he has seduced if he take her from the town that is another thing without some flagrant reason something that will better justify him to himself as well as to her and to the world than mere power and novelty  but i dont see if we judge by fact and by the practice of all we have been acquainted with of the keeping class that we know how to part with them when we have them  that we know we can if we will is all we have for it and this leads us to bear many things from a mistress which we would not from a wife but if we are goodnatured and humane if the woman has art and what woman wants it who has fallen by art and to whose precarious situation art is so necessary if you have given her the credit of being called by your name if you have a settled place of abode and have received and paid visits in her company as your wife if she has brought you children you will allow that these are strong obligations upon you in the worlds eye as well as to your own heart against tearing yourself from such close connexions she will stick to you as your skin and it will be next to flaying yourself to cast her off  even if there be cause for it by infidelity she will have managed ill if she have not her defenders  nor did i ever know a cause or a person so bad as to want advocates either from ill will to the one or pity to the other and you will then be thought a hardhearted miscreant and even were she to go off without credit to herself she will leave you as little especially with all those whose good opinion a man would wish to cultivate  well then shall this poor privilege that we may part with a woman if we will be deemed a balance for the other inconveniences shall it be thought by us who are men of family and fortune an equivalent for giving up equality of degree and taking for the partner of our bed and very probably more than the partner in our estates to the breach of all familyrule and order a lowborn a loweducated creature who has not brought anything into the common stock and can possibly make no returns for the solid benefits she receives but those libidinous ones which a man cannot boast of but to his disgrace nor think of but to the shame of both  moreover as the man advances in years the fury of his libertinism will go off he will have different aims and pursuits which will diminish his appetite to ranging and make such a regular life as the matrimonial and familylife palatable to him and every day more palatable  if he has children and has reason to think them his and if his lewd courses have left him any estate he will have cause to regret the restraint his boasted liberty has laid him under and the valuable privilege it has deprived him of when he finds that it must descend to some relation for whom whether near or distant he cares not one farthing and who perhaps from his dissolute life if a man of virtue has held him in the utmost contempt  and were we to suppose his estate in his power to bequeath as he pleases why should a man resolve for the gratifying of his wicked humor only to bastardize his race why should he wish to expose them to the scorn and insults of the rest of the world  why should he whether they are men or women lay them under the necessity of complying with proposals of marriage either inferior as to fortune or unequal as to age  why should he deprive the children he loves and who are themselves guilty of no fault if they have regard to morals and to legal and social sanctions of the respect they would wish to have and to deserve  and of the opportunity of associating themselves with proper that is to say with reputable company  and why should he make them think themselves under obligation to every person of character who should vouchsafe to visit them what little reason in a word would such children have to bless their fathers obstinate defiance of the laws and customs of his country and for giving them a mother whom they could not think of with honor to whose crime it was that they owed their very beings and whose example it was their duty to shun  if the education and morals of these children are left to chance as too generally they are for the man who has humanity and a feeling heart and who is capable of fondness for his offspring i take it for granted will marry the case is still worse his crime is perpetuated as i may say by his children and the sea the army perhaps the highway for the boys the common for the girls too often point out the way to a worse catastrophe  what therefore upon the whole do we get by treading in these crooked paths but danger disgrace and a too late repentance  and after all do we not frequently become the cullies of our own libertinism sliding into the very state with those halfwornout doxies which perhaps we might have entered into with their ladies at least with their superiors both in degree and fortune and all the time lived handsomely like ourselves not sneaking into holes and corners and when we crept abroad with our women looking about us at every opening into the street or day as if we were confessedly accountable to the censures of all honest people  my cousin tony jenyns thou knew he had not the actively mischievous spirit that thou belton mowbray myself and tourville have but he imbibed the same notions we do and carried them into practice  how did he prate against wedlock how did he strut about as a wit and a smart and what a wit and a smart did all the boys and girls of our family myself among the rest then an urchin think him for the airs he gave himself  marry no not for the world what man of sense would bear the insolences the petulances the expensiveness of a wife he could not for the heart of him think it tolerable that a woman of equal rank and fortune and as it might happen superior talents to his own should look upon herself to have a right to share the benefit of that fortune which she brought him  so after he had fluttered about the town for two or three years in all which time he had a better opinion of himself than anybody else had what does he do but enter upon an affair with his fencingmasters daughter  he succeeds takes private lodgings for her at hackney visits her by stealth both of them tender of reputations that were extremely tender but which neither had quite given over for rakes of either sex are always the last to condemn or cry down themselves visited by nobody nor visiting the life of a thief or of a man beset by creditors afraid to look out of his own house or to be seen abroad with her and thus went he on for twelve years and though he had a good estate hardly making both ends meet for though no glare there was no economy and besides he had every year a child and very fond of them was he but none of them lived above three years and being now on the death of the dozenth grown as dully sober as if he had been a real husband his good mrs thomas for he had not permitted her to take his own name prevailed upon him to think the loss of their children a judgment upon the parents for their wicked way of life there is a time when calamities will beget reflection the royal cully of france thou know was maintenond into it by his ill successes in the field and so when more than halfworn out both of them the sorry fellow took it into his head to marry her and then had leisure to sit down and contemplate the many offers of persons of family and fortune which he had declined in the prime of his life his expenses equal at least his reputation not only less but lost his enjoyments stolen his partnership unequal and such as he had always been ashamed of but the women said that after twelve years cohabitation tony did an honest thing by her and that was all my poor cousin got by making his old mistress his new wife  not a drum not a trumpet not a fife not a tabret nor the expectation of a new joy to animate him on  what belton will do with his thomasine i know not nor care i to advise him for i see the poor fellow does not like that anybody should curse her but himself and that he does very heartily and so low is he reduced that he blubbers over the reflection upon his past fondness for her cubs and upon his present doubts of their being his what a d  nd thing is it belford if tom and hall should be the hostler dogs puppies and not mine very true and i think the strong health of the chubbyfaced muscular whelps confirms the too great probability but i say not so to him  you he says are such a gay lively mortal that this sad tale would make no impression upon you especially now that your whole heart is engaged as it is mowbray would be too violent upon it he has not he says a feeling heart tourville has no discretion and a pretty jest although he and his thomasine lived without reputation in the world people guessing that they were not married notwithstanding she went by his name yet he would not too much discredit the cursed ingrate neither  could a man act a weaker part had he been really married and were he sure he was going to separate from the mother of his own children  i leave this as a lesson upon thy heart without making any application only with this remark that after we libertines have indulged our licentious appetites reflecting in the conceit of our vain hearts both with our lips and by our lives upon our ancesrs and the good old ways we find out when we come to years of discretion if we live till then what all who knew us found out before that is to say we find out our own despicable folly that those good old ways would have been best for us as well as for the rest of the world and that in every step we have deviated from them we have only exposed our vanity and our ignorance at the same time  j belford  letter xx mr lovelace to john belford esquire saturday may  0 i am pleased with the sober reflection thou concludest thy last with and i thank thee for it poor belton  i did not think his thomasine would have proved so very a devil but this must everlastingly be the risque of a keeper who takes up with a lowbred girl this i never did nor had i occasion to do such a one as i jack needed only till now to shake the stateliest tree and the mellowd fruit dropped into my mouth always of montaigns taste thou know  thought it a glory to subdue a girl of family  more truly delightful to me the seductionprogress than the crowning act  for that is a vapor a bubble  and most cordially do i thank thee for thy indirect hint that i am right in my present pursuit  from such a lady as miss harlowe a man is secured from all the inconveniences thou expatiates upon  once more therefore do i thank thee belford for thy approbation  one need not as thou say sneak into holes and corners and shun the day in the company of such a lady as this how friendly in thee thus to abet the favorite purpose of my heart  nor can it be a disgrace to me to permit such a lady to be called by my name  nor shall i be at all concerned about the worlds censure if i live to the years of discretion which thou mentionest should i be taken in and prevailed upon to tread with her the good old path of my ancestors  a blessing on thy heart thou honest fellow i thought thou were but in jest or acting but by my uncles desire when thou were pleading for matrimony in behalf of this lady  it could not be principle i knew in thee it could not be compassion  a little envy indeed i suspected  but now i see thee once more thyself and once more say i a blessing on thy heart thou true friend and very honest fellow  now will i proceed with courage in all my schemes and oblige thee with the continued narrative of my progressions toward bringing them to effect  but i could not forbear to interrupt my story to show my gratitude  letter xxi mr lovelace to john belford esquire saturday may  0 and now will i favor thee with a brief account of our present situation  from the highest to the lowest we are all extremely happy  dorcas stands well in her ladys graces polly has asked her advice in relation to a courtship affair of her own no oracle ever gave better sally has had a quarrel with her woollendraper and made my beloved ladychancellor in it she blamed sally for behaving tyrannically to a man who loves her dear creature to stand against a glass and to shut her eyes because she will not see her face in it  mrs sinclair has paid her court to so unerring a judge by requesting her advice with regard to both nieces  this the way we have been in for several days with the people below yet sola generally at her meals and seldom at other times in their company they now used to her ways perseverance must conquer never press her so when they meet all is civility on both sides even married people i believe jack prevent abundance of quarrels by seeing one another but seldom  but how stands it between thyself and the lady methinks thou ask since her abrupt departure from thee and undutiful repulse of wednesday morning why pretty well in the main nay very well for why the dear saucyface knows not how to help herself can fly to no other protection and has besides overheard a conversation who would have thought she had been so near which passed between mrs sinclair miss martin and myself that very wednesday afternoon which has set her heart at ease with respect to several doubtful points  such as particularly mrs fretchvilles unhappy state of mind  most humanely pitied by miss martin who knows her very well the husband she has lost and herself lovers from their cradles pity from one begets pity from another and so many circumstances were given to poor mrs fretchvilles distress that it was impossible but my beloved must extremely pity her whom the less tenderhearted miss martin greatly pitied  my lord ms gout his only hindrance from visiting my spouse  lady betty and miss montague soon expected i town  my earnest desire signified to have my spouse receiv them in her own house if mrs fretchville would bu know her own mind  my intention to stay at their house notwithstanding as i said i had told them before in order to grati her utmost punctilio  my passion for my beloved which i told them is a high and fervent accent was the truest that m could have for woman i boasted of it was in short i said of the true platonic kind or i had no notion of what platonic love was  so it is jack and must end as platonic love generally does end  sally and mrs sinclair praised but not grossly my beloved sally particularly admired her purity called it exemplary yet to avoid suspicion expressed her thoughts that she was rather overnice if she might presume to say so before me but applauded me for the strict observation i made of my vow  i more freely blamed her reserves to me called her cruel inveighed against her relations doubted her love every favor i asked of her denied me yet my behavior to her as pure and delicate when alone as when before them hinted at something that had passed between us that very day that showed her indifference to me in so strong a light that i could not bear it but that i would ask her for her company to the play of venice preserved given out for saturday night as a benefit play the prime actors to be in it and this to see if i were to be denied every favor  yet for my own part i loved not tragedies though she did for the sake of the instruction the warning and the example generally given in them  i had too much feeling i said there was enough in the world to make our hearts sad without carrying grief into our diversions and making the distresses of others our own  true enough belford and i believe generally speaking that all the men of our cast are of my mind  they love not any tragedies but those in which they themselves act the parts of tyrants and executioners and afraid to trust themselves with serious and solemn reflections run to comedies to laugh away the distresses they have occasioned and to find examples of as immoral men as themselves for very few of our comic performances as thou know give us good ones  i answer however for myself  yet thou i think on recollection love to deal in the lamentable  sally answered for polly who was absent mrs sinclair for herself and for all her acquaintance even for miss partington in preferring the comic to the tragic scenes  and i believe they are right for the devils in it if a confidedin rake does not give a girl enough of tragedy in his comedy  i asked sally to oblige my fairone with her company  she was engaged that was right thou wilt suppose i asked mrs sinclairs leave for polly to be sure she answered polly would think it an honor to attend mrs lovelace but the poor thing was tenderhearted and as the tragedy was deep would weep herself blind  sally mean time objected singleton that i might answer the objection and save my beloved the trouble of making it or debating the point with me  i then from a letter just before received from one in her fathers family warned them of a person who had undertaken to find us out and whom i thus in writing calling for pen and ink described that they might arm all the family against him  a sunburned pockfretten sailor illlooking bigboned his stature about six foot an heavy eye an overhanging brow a decktreading stride in his walk a couteau generally by his side lips parched from his gums as if by staring at the sun in hot climates a brown coat a colored handkerchief about his neck an oaken plant in his hand near as long as himself and proportionably thick  no questions must be answered that he should ask they should call me to him but not let my beloved know a tittle of this so long as it could be helped and i added that if her brother or singleton came and if they behaved civilly i would for her sake be civil to them and in this case she had nothing to do but to own her marriage and there could be no pretense for violence on either side but most fervently i swore that if she was conveyed away either by persuasion or force i would directly on missing her but one day go to demand her at her fathers whether she were there or not and if i recovered not a sister i would have a brother and should find out a captain of a ship as well as he and now jack do thou think she will attempt to get from me do what i will  mrs sinclair began to be afraid of mischief in her house  i was apprehensive that she would overdo the matter and be out of character i therefore winked at her she primmd nodded to show she took me twangd out a highho lappd one horselip over the other and was silent  here is preparation belford  do think i will throw it all away for any thing thou can say or lord m write  no indeed  as my charmer says when she bridles  and what must necessarily be the consequence of all this with regard to my beloveds behavior to me  can thou doubt that it was all complaisance next time she admitted me into her presence  thursday we were very happy all the morning extremely happy i kissed her charming hand  i need not describe to thee her hand and arm when thou saw her i took notice that thy eyes dwelt upon them whenever thou could spare them from that beautyspot of wonders her face fifty times kissed her hand i believe  once her cheek intending her lip but so rapturously that she could not help seeming angry  had she not thus kept me at armslength had she not denied me those innocent liberties which our sex from degree to degree aspire to could i but have gained access to her in her hours of heedlessness and dishabille for full dress creates dignity augments consciousness and compels distance we had been familiarized to each other long ago but keep her up ever so late meet her ever so early by breakfasttime dressed for the day and at her earliest hour as nice as others dressed  all her forms thus kept up wonder not that i have made so little progress in the proposed trial  but how must all this distance stimulate  thursday morning i said we were extremely happy  about noon she numbered the hours she had been with me all of them to me but as one minute and desired to be left to herself i was loath to comply but observing the sunshine begin to shut in i yielded  i dined out returned talked of the house and of mrs fretchville had seen mennell  had pressed him to get the widow to quit  she pitied mrs fretchville  another good effect of the overheard conversation  had written to my uncle expected an answer soon from him i was admitted to sup with her urged for her approbation or correction of my written terms she promised an answer as soon as she had heard from miss how  then i pressed for her company to the play on saturday night she made objections as i had foreseen her brothers projects warmth of the weather etc but in such a manner as if halfafraid to disoblige me another happy effect of the overheard conversation got over these therefore and she consented to favor me  friday passed as the day before  here were two happy days to both  why cannot i make every day equally happy it looks as if it were in my power to do so  strange i should thus deligh in teazing a woman i so dearly love  i must doubt have something in my temper like miss how who loves to plague the man who puts himself in her power  but i could not do thus by such an angel as this did i not believe that after her probationtime is expired and if there is no bringing her to cohabitation my darling view i shall reward her as she wishes  saturday is halfover equally happy  preparing for the play  polly has offered and is accepted i have directed her where to weep  and this not only to show her humanity a weeping eye indicates a gentle heart but to have a pretense to hide her face with her fan or handkerchief yet polly is far from being every mans girl  and we shall sit in the gallery greenbox  the woes of others so well represented as those of belvidera particularly will be must i hope unlock and open my charmers heart whenever i have been able to prevail upon a girl to permit me to attend her to a play i have thought myself sure of her the female heart all gentleness and harmony when obliged expands and forgets its forms when attention is carried out of itself at an agreeable or affecting entertainment music and perhaps a collation afterward cooperating i have no hope of such an effect here but i have more than one end to answer by my earnestness in getting her to a play to name but one dorcas has a masterkey as i have told thee  and it were worth carrying her to venice preserved were it but to show her that there have been and may be much deeper distresses than she can possibly know  thus exceedingly happy are we at present i hope we shall not find any of not lees left handed gods at work to dash our bowl of joy with wormwood  the lady in her next letter dated friday may    acquaints her friend that her prospects are once more mended and that she has known fourandtwenty hours together since her last not unhappy ones her situation considered how willing am i says she to compound for tolerable appearances how desirous to turn the funny side of things toward me and to hope where reason for hope offers and this not only for my own sake but for yours who take such generous concern in all that befalls me  she then gives the particulars of the conversation which she had overheard between mr lovelace mrs sinclair and miss martin but accounts more minutely than he had done for the opportunity she had of overhearing it unknown to them  she gives the reason she has to be pleased with what she heard from each but is shocked at the measure he is resolved to take if he misses her but for one day yet is pleased that he proposes to avoid aggressive violence if her brother and he meet in town  she thought herself obliged she says from what passed between them on wednesday and from what she overheard him say to consent to go with him to the play especially as he had the discretion to propose one of the nieces to accompany her  she expresses herself pleased that he has actually written to lord m  she tells her that she has promised to give him an answer to his proposals as soon as she has heard from her on the subject and hopes that in her future letter she shall have reason to confirm these favorable appearances favourable says she i must think them in the wreck i have suffered  she thinks it not amiss however that she should perfect her scheme with mrs townsend he is certainly she says a deep and dangerous man and it is therefore but prudence to be watchful and to provide against the worst  she is certain she tells her that her letters are safe  he would never be out of her company by his good will otherwise she has no doubt that she is mistress of her goingsout and comingsin and did she think it needful and were she not afraid of her brother and capt singleton would oftener put it to trial  letter xxii miss how to miss clarissa harlowe saturday may  0 i did not know my dear that you deferred giving an answer to mr lovelaces proposals till you had my opinion of them a particular hand occasionally going to town will leave this at wilsons that no delay may be made on that account  i never had any doubt of the mans justice and generosity in matters of settlement and all his relations are as noble in their spirits as in their descent but now it may not be amiss for you to wait to see what returns my lord makes to his letter of invitation  the scheme i think of is this  there is a person i believe you have seen her with me one mrs townsend who is a great dealer in indian silks brussels and french laces cambricks linen and other valuable goods which she has a way of coming at dutyfree and has a great vead for them and for other curiosities which she imports in the private families of the gentry round us  she has her days of being in town and then is at a chamber she rents in an inn in southwark where she has patterns of all her silks and much of her portable goods for the convenience of her london customers but her place of residence and where she has her principal warehouse is at deptford for the opportunity of getting her goods on shore  she was first brought to me by my mother to whom she was recommended on the supposal of my speedy marriage that i might have an opportunity to be as fine as a princess was my mammas expression at a moderate expense  now my dear i must own that i do not love to encourage these contraband traders what is it but bidding defiance to the laws of our country when we do and hurting fair traders and at the same time robbing our prince of his legal due to the diminution of those duties which possibly must be made good by new levies upon the whole public  but however mrs townsend and i though we have not yet dealt are upon a very good foot of understanding she is a sensible woman she has been abroad and often goes abroad in the way of her business and gives very entertaining accounts of all she has seen and having applied to me to recommend her to you as it is her view to be known to young ladies who are likely to change their condition i am sure i can engage her to give you protection at her house at deptford which she says is a populous village and one of the last i should think that you would be sought for in she is not much there you will believe by the course of her dealings but no doubt must have somebody on the spot in whom she can confide and there perhaps you might be safe till your cousin comes and i should not think it amiss that you write to him out of hand i cannot suggest to you what you should write that must be left to your own discretion for you will be afraid no doubt of the consequence of a variance between the two men  i will think further of this scheme of mine in relation to mrs townsend if you find it necessary that i should but i hope there will be no occasion to do so since your prospects seem to be changed and that you have had twentyfournot unhappy hours together how my indignation rises for this poor consolation in the courtship  courtship must i call it of such a lady  mrs townsend as i have recollected has two brothers each a master of a vessel and who knows as she and they have great concerns together but that in case of need you may have a whole ships crew at your devotion if he give your cause to leave him take no thought for the people at harloweplace let them take care of one another it is a care they are used to the law will help to secure them the wretch is no assassin no nightmurderer he is an open because a fearless enemy and should he attempt any thing that should make him obnoxious to the laws of society you might have a fair riddance of him either by flight or the gallows no matter which  had you not been so minute in your account of the circumstances that attended the opportunity you had of overhearing the dialogue between mr lovelace and two of the women i should have thought the conference contrived on purpose for your ears  i showed mr lovelaces proposals to mr hickman who had chambers once at lincolns end being designed for the law had his elder brother lived he looked so wise so proud and so important upon the occasion and wanted to take so much consideration about them  would take them home if i pleased  and weigh them well  and soforth  and the like  and all that  that i had no patience with him and snatched them back with anger  o dear  to be so angry and please me for his zeal   yes zeal without knowledge i said  like most other zeals  if there were no objections that struck him at once there were none  so hasty dearest madam   and so slow undearest sir i could have said  but surely said i with a look which implied would you rebel sir   he begged my pardon  saw no objection indeed  but might he be allowed once more   no matter  no matter  i would have shown them to my mother i said who though of no inn of court knew more of these things than half the lounging lubbers of them and that at first sight  only that she would have been provoking upon the confession of our continued correspondence  but my dear let the articles be drawn up and engrossed and solemnize upon them and there is no more to be said  let me add that the sailor fellow has been tampering with my kitty and offered a bribe to find where to direct to you next time he comes i will have him drawn through one of our deepest fish ponds if i can get nothing out of him his attempt to corrupt a servant of mine will justify my orders  i send this away directly but will follow it by another which shall have for its subject only my mother myself and your uncle antony and as your prospects are more promising than they have been i will endeavor to make you smile upon this occasion for you will be pleased to know that my mamma has had a formal tender from that gray goose which may make her skill useful to herself were she to encourage it  may your prospects be still more and more happy prays  your own anna how  letter xxiii miss how to miss clarissa harlowe sat sunday may  0    now my dear for the promised subject you must not ask me how i came by the originals such they really are that i am going to present you with for my mamma would not read to me those parts of your uncles letter which bore hard upon myself and which leave him without any title to mercy from me nor would she let me hear but what she pleased of hers in answer for she has condescended to answer him with a denial however  but such a denial as noone but an old bachelor would take from a widow  anybody except myself who could have been acquainted with such a fallal courtship as this must have been had it proceeded would have been glad it had gone on and i dare say but for the saucy daughter it had my mamma in that case would have been ten years the younger for it perhaps and could i but have approved of it i should have been considered as if ten years older than i am since very likely it would then have been we widows my dear know not how to keep men at a distance  so as to give them pain in order to try their love  you must advise me child you must teach me to be cruel  yet not too cruel neither  so as to make a man heartless who has no time god wot to throw away then would my behavior to mr hickman have been better liked and my mother would have bridled like her daughter  o my dear how we might have been diverted by the practisings for recovery of the longforgottens could i have been sure that it would have been in my power to have put them asunder in the irish style before they had come together but there is no trusting to a widow whose goods and chattels are in her own hands addressed by an old bachelor who has fine things and offers to leave her ten thousand pounds better than he found her and sole mistress besides of all her notables for these as you will see byandby are his proposals  the old tritons address carries the writers marks upon the very superscription  to the equally amiable and worthily admired theres for you mrs annabella how widow the last word added i suppose as esquire to a man or for fear the bella to anna should not enough distinguish the person meant from the spinster vain hussy you will call me i know and then follows  these humbly present  put down as a memorandum i presume to make a leg and behave handsomely at presenting it he intending very probably to deliver it himself  and now stand by  to see  enter old neptune  his head adorned with seaweed and a crown of cockleshells as we see him decked out in mrs robinsons ridiculous grotto  monday may    madam i did make a sort of resolution ten years ago never to marry i saw in other families where they lived best you will be pleased to mark that queernesses i could not away with then liked well enough to live single for sake of my brothers family and for one child in it more than the rest but that girl has turned us all off of the hinges and why i should deny myself any comforts for them as will not thank me for so doing i dont know  so much for my motives as from self and family but the dear mrs how makes me go further  i have a very great fortune i bless god for it all of my own getting or most of it you will be pleased to mark that for i was the younger brother of three you have also god be thanked a great estate which you have improved by your own frugality and wise management frugality let me stop to say is one of the greatest virtues in this mortal life because it enables us to do justice to all and puts it in our power to benefit some by it as we see they deserve  you have but one child and i am a bachelor and have never a one  all batchelors cannot say so wherefore your daughter may be the better for me if she will keep up with my humor which was never thought bad especially to my equals servants indeed i dont matter being angry with when i please they are paid for bearing it and tootoo often deserve it as we have very frequently taken notice of to one another but this will not hurt neither you nor miss  i will make very advantageous settlements such as any common friend shall judge to be so but must have all in my own power while i live because you know madam it is as creditable to the wife as the husband that it should be so  i aim not at fine words we are not children though it is hoped we may have some for i am a very healthy sound man i bless god for it and never brought home from my voyages and travels a worser constitution than i took out with me i was none of those i will assure you but this i will undertake that if you are the survivress you shall be at the least ten thousand pounds the better for me what in the contrary case i shall be the better for you i leave to you as you shall think my kindness to you shall deserve  but one thing madam i should be glad of that miss how might not live with us then she need not know i write thus  but go home to mr hickman as she is upon the point of marriage i hear and if she behaves dutifully as she should do to us both she shall be the better for so i said before  you shall manage all things both mine and your own for i know little of landmatters all my opposition to you shall be out of love when i think you take too much upon you for your health  it will be very pretty for you i should think to have a man of experience in a long winters evening to sit down and tell you stories of foreign parts and the customs of the nations he has consorted with and i have fine curiosities of the indian growth such as ladies love and some that even my niece clary when she was good never saw these one by one as you are kind to me which i make no question of because i shall be kind to you shall all be yours  prettier entertainment by much than sitting with a too smartish daughter sometimes out of humor and thwarting and vexing as daughters will when womengrown especially as i have heard you often observe and thinking their parents old without paying them the reverence due to years when as in your case i make no sort of doubt they are young enough to wipe their noses you understand me madam  as for me myself it will be very happy and i am delighted with the thinking of it to have after a pleasant ride or so a lady of like experience with myself to come home to and but one interest betwixt us to reckon up our comingsin together and what this day and this week has produced  o how this will increase love  most mightily will it increase it  and i believe i should never love you enough or be able to show you all my love  i hope madam there need not be such maide niceties and hangingsoff as i may call them between us for hangingoff sake as that you will deny me line or two to this proposal written down although yo would not answer me so readily when i spoke to you your daughter being i suppose hard by for yo looked round you as if not willing to be overheard so i resolved to write that my writing may stand as upon record for my upright meaning being no of your lovelaces you will mark that madam but  downright true honest faithful englishman so hop you will not disdain to write a line or two to this my proposal and i shall look upon it as a great honor i will assure you and be proud thereof  what can say more  for you are your own mistress as i a my own master and you shall always be your ow mistress be pleased to mark that for so a lady of your prudence and experience ought to be  this is a long letter but the subject requires it because i would not write twice where once would do so would explain my sense and meaning at one time  i have had writing in my head two whole months very near but hardly knew how being unpractised in these matters to begin to write and now good lady be favorable to  your most humble lover and obedient servant ant harlowe   here is a letter of courtship my dear  and let me subjoin to it that if now or hereafter i should treat this hideous lover who is so free with me to my mother with asperity and you should be disgusted at it i shall think you dont give me that preference in your love which you have in mine  and now which shall i first give you the answer of my mamma or the dialogue that passed between the widowmother and the pert daughter upon her letting the latter know that she had a letter  i think you shall have the dialogue but let me premise one thing that if you think me too free you must not let it run in your head that i am writing of your uncle or of my mother but of a couple of old lovers no matter whom reverence is too apt to be forgotten by second persons where the reverends forget first  well then suppose my mamma after twice comeing into my closet to me and as often going out with very meaning features and lips ready to burst open but still closed as it were by compulsion a speech going off in a slight cough that never went near the lungs grown more resolute the third time of entrance and sitting down by me thus begin  mother i have a very serious matter to talk with you upon nancy when you are disposed to attend to matters within ourselves and not let matters without ourselves wholly engross you  a good selvesish speech  but i thought that friendship and gratitude and humanity were matters that ought to be deemed of the most intimate concern to us but not to dwell upon her words   daughter i am now disposed to attend to every thing my mamma is disposed to say to me   m why then child  why then my dear  and the good ladys face looked so plump so smooth and so shining  i see you are all attention nancy  but dont be surprised  dont be uneasy  but i have  i have  where is it  and yet it lay next her heart never another near it  so no difficulty to have found it  i have a letter my dear  and out from her bosom it came but she still held it in her hand  i have a letter child  it is  it is  it is from  from a gentleman i assure you  lifting up her head and smiling  there is no delight to a daughter thought i in such surprises as seem to be collecting i will deprive my mamma of the satisfaction of making a gradual discovery   d from mr antony harlowe i suppose madam   m lips drawn closer eye raised why my dear  but how i wonder could you think of mr antony harlowe   d how madam could i think of anybody else   m how could you think of anybody else  angrily and drawing back her face but do you know the subject nancy   d you have told it madam by your manner of breaking it to me but indeed i questioned not that he had two motives in his visits here  both equally agreeable to me for all that family love me dearly   m no love lost if so between you and them but this  rising is what i get  so like your papa  i never could open my heart to him   d dear madam excuse me be so good as to open your heart to me  i dont love the harlowes but pray excuse me   m you have put me quite out with your forward temper  angrily sitting down again   d i will be all patience and attention may i be allowed to read his letter   m i wanted to advise with you upon it  but you are such a strange creature  you are always for answering one before one speaks   d you will be so good as to forgive me madam  but i thought everybody he among the rest knew that you had always declared against a second marriage   m and so i have but then it was in the mind i was in things may offer   i stared   m nay dont be surprised  i dont intend  i dont intend    d not perhaps in the mind you are in madam   m pert creature  rising again  we shall quarrel i see  there is no    d once more dear madam i beg your excuse i will attend in silence  pray madam sit down again  pray do  she sat down  may i see the letter  no there are some things in it you will not like  your temper is known i find to be unhappy  but nothing bad against you intimations on the contrary that you shall be the better for him if you oblige him  not a living soul but the harlowes i said thought me illtemperd and i was contented that they should who could do as they had done by the most universally acknowleged sweetness in the world  here we broke out a little but at last she read me some of the passages in it  but not the most mightily ridiculous yet i could hardly keep my countenance neither and when she had done   m well now nancy tell me what you think of it   d nay pray madam tell me what you think of it   m i expect to be answered by an answer not by a question  you dont use to be shy to speak your mind   d not when my mamma commands me to do so   m then speak it now   d without hearing it all   m speak to what you have heard   d why then madam  you will not be my mamma how if you give way to it   m i am surprised at your assurance nancy   d i mean madam you will then be my mamma harlowe   m oh dear heart  but i am not a fool and her color went and came  d dear madam  but indeed i dont love a harlowe  that is what i meant i am your child and must be your child do what you will   m a very pert one i am sure as ever mother bore and you must be my child do what i will  as much as to say you would not if you could help it if i    d how could i have such a thought  it would be forward indeed if i had  when i dont kno what your mind is as to the proposal  when the proposal is so very advantageous a one too   m looking a little less discomposed why indeed ten thousand pounds    d and to be sure of outliving him madam this staggered her a little    m sure nobody can be sure  but it is very likely that    d not at all madam you was going to read something but stopped about his constitution his sobriety is well known  why madam these gentlemen who have been at sea and in different climates and come home to relax from cares in a temperate one and are sober  are the likeliest to live long of any men in the world  dont you see that his very skin is a fortification of buff   m strange creature   d god forbid that anybody i love and honor should marry a man in hopes to bury him  but suppose madam at your time of life    m my time of life  dear heart  what is my time of life pray   m not old madam and that may be your danger  as i hope to live my dear my mamma smiled and looked not displeased with me   m why indeed child  why indeed i must needs say  and then i should choose to do nothing froward as you are sometimes to hurt you   d why as to that madam  i cannot expect you should deprive yourself of any satisfaction    m satisfaction my dear  i dont say it would be a satisfaction  but could i do any thing that would benefit you it would perhaps be an inducement to hold one conference upon the subject   d my fortune already will be more considerable than my match if i am to have mr hickman   m why so  mr hickmans fortune is enough to entitle him to yours   d if you think so that is enough   m not but i should think the worse of myself if i desired any bodys death but i think as you say mr antony harlowe is a healthy man and bids fair for a long life  bless me thought i how shall i do to know whether this be an objection or a recommendation   d will you forgive me madam   m what would the girl say  looking as if she was half afraid to hear what   d only that if you marry a man of his time of life you stand two chances instead of one to be a nurse at your time of life   m saucebox   d dear madam  what i mean is only that these healthy old men sometimes fall into lingering disorders all at once and i humbly conceive that the infirmities of age are too uneasily borne with where the remembrance of the pleasanter season comes not in to relieve the healthier of the two   m a strange girl  i always told you that you know either too much to be argued with or too little for me to have patience with you   d i cannot but say i would be glad of your commands madam how to behave myself to mr harlowe next time he comes   m how to behave yourself  why if you retire with contempt of him when he next comes it will be but as you have been used to do of late   d then he is to come again madam   m and suppose he be   d i cannot help it if it be your pleasure madam  he desires a line in answer to his fine letter if he comes it will be in pursuance of that line i presume   m none of your arch and pert leers girl  you know i will not bear them i had a mind to hear wht you would say to this matter i have not wrote but i shall presently   d it is mighty good of you madam i hope the man will think so to answer his first application by letter  pity he should write twice if once will do   m that fetch will not let you into my intention as to what i shall write it is too saucily put   d perhaps i can guess at your intention madam were it to become me so to do   m perhaps i would not make a mr hickman of any gentleman using him the worse for respecting me   d nor perhaps would i madam if i liked his respects   m i understand you but perhaps it is in your power to make me hearken or not to mr harlowe   d young gentlemen who have probably a great deal of time before them need not be in haste for a wife mr hickman poor man must stay his time or take his remedy   m he bears more from you than a man ought   d then i doubt he gives a reason for the treatment he meets with   m provoking creature   d i have but one request to make you madam   m a dutiful one i suppose what is it pray   d that if you marry i may be permitted to live single   m perverse creature  i am sure   d how can i expect madam that you should refuse such terms ten thousand pounds  at the least ten thousand pounds  a very handsome proposal  so many fine things too to give you one by one dearest madam forgive me  i hope it is not yet so far gone that raillying this man will be thought want of duty to you   m your raillying of him and your reverence to me it is plain have one source   d i hope not madam but ten thousand pounds    m is no unhandsome proposal   d indeed i think so i hope madam you will not be behindhand with him in generosity   m he will not be ten thousand pounds the better for me if he survive me   d no madam he cannot expect that as you have a daughter and as he is a bachelor and has not a child  poor old soul   m old soul nancy  and thus to call him for being a bachelor and not having a child  does this become you   d not old soul for that madam  but half the sum five thousand pounds you cannot engage for less madam   m that sum has your approbation then  looking as if she would be even with me   d as he leaves it to your generosity madam and as the reward of his kindness to you it cannot be less  do dear madam permit me without incurring your displeasure to call him poor old soul again   m never was such a whimsical creature  turning away for i believe i looked very archly a least i intended to do so to hide her involuntary smiling  i hate that wicked sly look you give yourself very free airs  dont you   d i snatched her hand and kissed it  my dear mamma be not angry with your girl  you have told me that you was very lively formerly   m formerly good lack  but were i to encourage his proposals you may be sure that for mr hickmans sake as well as yours i should make  wise agreement   d you have both lived to years of prudence madam   m yes i suppose i am an old soul too   d he also is for making a wise agreement o hinting at one at least   m well the short and the long i suppose is this i have not your consent to marry   d indeed madam you have not my wishes to marry   m let me tell you that if prudence consists in wishing well to ones self i see not but the young flirts are as prudent as the old souls   d dear madam would you blame me if to wish you not to marry mr antony harlowe is wishing well to myself   m you are mighty witty i wish you were as dutiful   d i am more dutiful i hope than witty or i should be a fool as well as a saucebox   m let me judge of both  parents are only to live for their children let them deserve it or not that is their dutiful notion   d heaven forbid that i should wish if there be two interests between my mamma and me that my mamma postpone her own for mine or give up any thing that would add to the real comforts of her life to oblige me  tell me my dear mamma if you think this proposal will   m i say that ten thousand pounds is such an acuisition to ones family that the offer of it deserves  civil return   d not the offer madam the chance only   you have a view to an increase of family the moey may provide    m you cannot keep within tolerable bounds  that saucy fleer i cannot away with    d dearest dearest madam forgive me but old ul ran in my head again  nay indeed and upon y word i will not be robbed of that charming smile and again i kissed her hand   m away bold creature nothing can be so prooking as to be made to smile when one would hoose and ought to be angry   d but dear madam if it be to be i presume ou will not think of it before next winter   m what now would the pert one be at   d because he only proposes to entertain you with pretty stories of foreign nations in a winters evening dearest dearest madam let me have the reading of his letter through i will forgive him all he says about me   m it may be a very difficult thing perhaps for a man of the best sense to write a loveletter that may not be cavilled at   d that is because lovers in their letters hit not the medium  they either write too much nonsense or too little but do you call this odd souls letter no more will i call him old soul if i can help it a loveletter   m well well i see you are averse to this matter i am not to be your mamma you will live single if i marry i had a mind to see if generosity governed you in your views i shall pursue my own inclinations and if they should happen to be suitable to yours pray let me for the future be better rewarded by you than hitherto i have been  and away she flung without staying for a reply  vexed i dare say that i did not better approve of the proposal  were it only that the merit of denying might have been all her own and to lay the stronger obligation upon her saucy daughter  she wrote such a widowlike refusal when she went from me as might not exclude hope in any other wooer whatever it may do in mr tony harlowe  it will be my part to take care to beat her off of the visit she halfpromises to make him upon condition of withdrawing his suit as you will observe in hers for who knows what effect the old batchelors exotics  farfetched and dearbought you know is  proverb might otherwise have upon a womans mind wanting nothing but unnecessaries gewgaw an fineries and offered such as are not easily to be me with or purchased  well but now i give you leave to read here in this place the copy of my mothers answer to you uncles letter not one comment will i make upon it i know my duty better and here therefore taking the liberty to hope that i may in your present less disagreeable if not wholly agreeable situation provoke a smile from you i conclude myself   your everaffectionate and faithful anna how   mrs annabella how to antony harlowe esquire friday may    mr antony harlowe sir it is not usual i believe for our sex to answer by pen and ink the first letter on these occasions the first letter  how odd is that  as if i expected another which i do not  but then i think as i do not judge proper to encourage your proposal there is no reason why i should not answer in civility where so great a civility is intended indeed i was always of opinion that a person was entitled to that and not to illusage because he had a respect for me and so i have often and often told my daughter  a woman i think makes but a poor figure in a mans eye afterward and does no reputation to her sex neither when she behaves like a tyrant to him beforehand  to be sure sir if i were to change my condition i know not a gentleman whose proposal could be more agreeable your nephew and nieces have enough without you my daughter is a fine fortune without me and i should take care to double it living or dyng were i to do such a thing so nobody need to be the worse for it but nancy would not think so  all the comfort i know of in children is that when young they do with us what they will and all s pretty in them to their very faults and when they are grown up they think their parents must live for them only and deny themselves every thing for their sakes i know nancy could not bear a fatherinlaw she would fly at the very thought of my being in earnest to give her one not that i stand in fear of my daughter neither it is not fit i should but she has her poor papas spirit a very violent one that was  and one would not choose you know sir to enter into any affair that one knows one must renounce a daughter for or she a mother  except indeed ones heart were much in it  which i bless god mine is not  i have now been a widow these ten years nobody to control me  and i am said not to bear control so sir you and i are best as we are i believe  nay i am sure of it  for we want not what either has  having both more than we know what to do with and i know i could not be in the least accountable for any of my ways  my daughter indeed though she is a fine girl as girls go she has too much sense indeed for her sex and knows she has it is more a check to me than one would wish a daughter to be  for one would not be always snapping at each other but she will soon be married and then not living together we shall only come together when we are pleased and stay away when we are not and so like other lovers never see any thing but the best sides of each other  i own for all this that i love her dearly and she me i dare say so would not wish to provoke her to do otherwise besides the girl is so much regarded everywhere that having lived so much of my prime a widow i would not lay myself open to her censures or even to her indifference you know  your generous proposal requires all this explicitness i thank you for your good opinion of me when i know you acquiesce with this my civil refusal and indeed sir i am as much in earnest in it as if i had spoke broader i dont know but nancy and i may with your permission come to see your fine things for i am a great admirer of rarities that come from abroad  so sir let us only converse occasionally as we meet as we used to do without any other view to each other than good wishes which i hope may not be lessened for this declining and then i shall always think myself  your obliged servant annabella how i sent word by mrs lorimer that i would write an answer but would take time for consideration so hope sir you will not think it a slight i did not write sooner     letter xxiv mr lovelace to john belford esquire sunday may    i am too much disturbed in my mind to think of any think but revenge or i had intended to give thee an account of miss harlowes curious observations on the play miss harlowes i say thou know that i hate the name of harlowe and i am exceedingly out of humor with her and with her saucy friend  what is the matter now thou wilt ask  matter enough for while we were at the play dorcas who had her orders and a key to her ladys chamber as well as a masterkey to her drawers and mahogany chest closetkey and all found means to come at some of miss howes lastwritten letters the vigilant wench was directed to them by seeing her lady take a letter out of her stays and put it to the others before she went out with me  afraid as the women upbraidingly tell me that i should find it there  dorcas no sooner found them than she assembled three ready writers of the nonapparents and sally and she and they employed themselves with the utmost diligence in making extracts according to former directions from these cursed letters for my use cursed i may well call them  such abuses such virulence o this little fury miss how  well might her saucy friend who has been equally free with me or the occasion could not have been given be so violent as she lately was at my endeavoring to come at one of these letters  i was sure that this fairone at so early an age with a constitution so firm health so blooming eyes so sparkling could not be absolutely and from her own vigilance so guarded and so apprehensive as i have found her to be  sparkling eyes jack when the poetical tribe have said all they can for them are an infallible sign of a rogue or room for a rogue in the heart  thou may go on with thy preachments and lord m with his wisdom of nations i am now more assured of her than ever and now my revenge is up and joined with my love all resistance must fall before it and most solemnly do i swear that miss how shall come in for her snack  and here just now is another letter brought from the same little virulent devil  i hope to procure transcripts from that too very speedily if it be put to the rest for the saucy lady is resolved to go to church this morning not so much from a spirit of devotion i have reason to think as to try whether she can go out without check or control or my attendance  i have been denied breakfasting with her indeed she was a little displeased with me last night because on our return from the play i obliged her to pass the rest of the night with the women and me in their parlour and to stay till near one she told me at parting that she expected to have the whole next day to herself  i had not read the extracts then so was all affectionate respect awe and distance for i had resolved to begin a new course and if possible to banish all jealousy and suspicion from her heart and yet i had no reason to be much troubled at her past suspicions since if a woman will continue with a man whom she suspects when she can get from him or thinks she can i am sure it is a very hopeful sign  she is gone slipped down before i was aware she had ordered a chair on purpose to exclude my personal attendance but i had taken proper precautions will attended her by consent peter the houseservant was within wills call  i had by dorcas represented her danger from singleton in order to dissuade her from going at all unless she allowed me to attend her but i was answered that if there was no cause of fear at the playhouse when there were but two playhouses surely there was less at church when there were so many churches the chairmen were ordered to carry her to st jamess church  but she would not be so careless of obliging me if she knew what i have already come at and how the women urge me on for they are continually complaining of the restraint they lie under in their behavior in their attendance neglecting all their concerns in the fronthouse and keeping this elegant back one entirely free from company that she may have no suspicion of them they doubt not my generosity they say but why for my own sake in lord ms style should i make so long a harvest of so little corn  women ye reason well i think i will begin my operations the moment she comes in  i have come at the letter brought her from miss how today  plot conjuration sorcery witchcraft all going forward  i shall not be able to see this miss harlowe with patience as the nymphs below say why is night necessary  and sally and polly upbraidingly remind me of my first attempts upon themselves  yet force answers not my end  and yet it may if there be truth in that part of the libertines creed that once subdued is always subdued and what woman answers affirmatively to the question  she is returned  but refuses to admit me desires to have the day to herself dorcas tells me that she believes her denial is from motives of piety  oons jack is there impiety in seeing me  would it not be the highest act of piety to reclaim me and is this to be done by her refusing to see me when she is in a devouter frame than usual but i hate her hate her heartily  she is old ugly and deformed  but o the blasphemy  yet she is an harlowe  and i hate her for that  but since i must not see her she will be mistress of her own will and of her time truly let me fill up mine by telling thee what i have come at  the first letter the women met with is dated april    see vol iii letter lxii p      where can she have put the preceding ones it mentions mr hickman as a busy fellow between them hickman had best take care of himself she says in it i hope you have no cause to repent returning my norris  it is forthcoming on demand now what the devil can this mean  her norris forthcoming on demand  the devil take me if i am outnorrisd  if such innocents can allow themselves to plot to norris well may i  she is sorry that her hannah cannot be with her  and what if she could  what could hannah do for her in such a house as this  the women in the house are to be found out in one breakfasting the women are enraged at both the correspondents for this and more than ever make a point of conquering her i had a good mind to give them miss how in full property say but the word jack and it shall be done  she is glad that miss harlowe had thoughts of taking me at my word she wondered i did not offer again advises her if i dont soon not to stay with me cautions her to keep me at distance not to permit the least familiarity  see jack  see belford  exactly as i thought  her vigilance all owing to a cool friend who can sit down quietly and give that advice which in her own case she could not take  she tells her it is my interest to be honest  interest fools  i thought these girls knew that my interest was ever subservient to my pleasure  what would i give to come at the copies of the letters to which those of miss how are answers  the next letter is dated may   see vol iii letter lxix p      in this the little termagant expresses her astonishment that her mother should write to miss harlowe to forbid her to correspond with her daughter mr hickman she says is of opinion that she ought not to obey her mother how the creeping fellow trims between both i am afraid that i must punish him as well as this virago and i have a scheme rumbling in my head that wants but half an hours musing to bring into form that will do my business upon both i cannot bear that the parental authority should be thus despised thus trampled underfoot  but observe the vixen it is well he is of her opinion for her mother having set her up she must have somebody to quarrel with  could a lovelace have allowed himself a greater license this girls a devilish rake in her heart had she been a man and one of us she would have outdone us all in enterprise and spirit  she wants but very little farther provocation she says to fly privately to london and if she does she will not leave her till she sees her either honorably married or quit of the wretch here jack the transcriber sally has added a prayer  for the lords sake dear mr lovelace get this fury to london  her fate i can tell thee jack if we had her among us should not be so long deciding as her friends what a gantlope would she run when i had done with her among a dozen of her own pityless sex whom my charmer shall never see  but more of this anon  i find by this letter that my saucy captive had been drawing the characters of every varlet of ye nor am i spared in it more than you the mans a fool to be sure my dear let me die if they either of them find me one a silly fellow at least cursed contemptible  i see not but they are a set of infernals  there is for thee belford  and he the beelzebub there is for thee lovelace  and yet she would have her friend marry a beelzebub  and what have any of us done to the knowledge of miss harlowe that she should give such an account of us as should warrant so much abuse from miss how  but that is to come  she blames her for not admitting miss partington to her bed  watchful as you are what could have happened  if violence were intended he would not stay for the night sally writes upon this hint  see sir what is expected from you an hundred and an hundred times have we told you of this  and so they have but to be sure the advice from them was not of half the efficacy as it will be from miss how  you might have sat up after her or not gone to bed but can there be such apprehensions between them yet the one advise her to stay and the other resolve to wait my imperial motion for marriage i am glad i know that  she approves of my proposal about mrs fretchvilles house she puts her upon expecting settlements upon naming a day and concludes with insisting upon her writing notwithstanding her mothers prohibition or bids her take the consequence undutiful wretches  thou will say to thyself by this time and can this proud and insolent girl be the same miss how who sighed for honest sir george colmar and who but for this her beloved friend would have followed him in all his broken fortunes when he was obliged to quit the kingdom  yes she is the very same and i always found in others as well as in myself that a first passion thoroughly subdued made the conqueror of it a rover the conqueress a tyrant  well but now comes mincing in a letter from one who has the honor of dear miss howes commands see vol iii letter lxxi p      to acquaint miss harlowe that miss how is excessively concerned for the concern she has given her  i have great temptations on this occasion says the prim gothamite to express my own resentments upon your present state  my own resentments  and why did he not fall into this temptation  why truly because he knew not what that state was which gave him so tempting a subject  only by conjecture and so forth  he then dances in his style as he does in his gaite to be sure to be sure he must have made the grand tour and come home by the way of tipperary  and being moreover forbid says the prancer to enter into the cruel subject  this prohibition was a mercy to thee friend hickman  but why cruel subject if thou know not what it is but conjecturest only from the disturbance it gives to a girl that is her mothers disturbance will be thy disturbance and the disturbance in turn of everybody with whom she is intimately acquainted unless i have the humbling of her  in another letter letter iv p    of this vol  she approves of her design to leave me if she can be received by her friends  has heard some strange stories of me that show me to be the worst of men had i a dozen lives i might have forfeited them all twenty crimes ago  an odd way of reckoning jack  miss betterton miss lockyer are named  the man so she irreverently calls me she says is a villain let me perish if i am called a villain for nothing  she will have her uncle as miss harlowe desires sounded about receiving her dorcas is to be attached to her interest my letters are to be come at by surprise or trick  see jack  she is alarmed at my attempt to come at a letter of hers  were i to come at the knowledge of her freedoms with my character she says she should be afraid to stir out without a guard  i would advise the vixen to get her guard ready  i am at the head of a gang of wretches thee jack and thy brother varlets she owns she means who join together to betray innocent creatures and to support one another in their villainies  what say thou to this belford  she wonders not at her melancholy reflections for meeting me for being forced upon me and tricked by me  i hope jack thou wilt have done preaching after this  but she comforts her that she will be both a warning and example to all her sex  i hope the sex will thank me for this  the nymphs had not time they say to transcribe all that was worthy of my resentment in this letter  so i must find an opportunity to come at it myself noble rant they say it contains  but i am a seducer and a hundred vile fellows in it  and the devil it seems took possession of my heart and of the hearts of all her friends in the same dark hour in order to provoke her to meet me again there is a fate in her error she says  why then should she grieve  adversity is her shiningtime and i cannot tell what  yet never to thank the man to whom she owes the shine  in the next letter x p     wicked as i am she fears i must be her lord and master  i hope so  she retracts what she said against me in her last  my behavior to my rosebud miss harlowe to take possession of mrs fretchvilles house i to stay at mrs sinclairs the stake i have in my country my reversions my economy my person my address all are brought in my favor to induce her now not to leave me how do i love to puzzle these longsighted girls  yet my teazing ways it seems are intolerable  are women only to teaze i trow  the sex may thank themselves for learning me to outteaze them so the headstrong charles xii of sweden learned the czar peter to beat him by continuing a war with the muscovites against the ancient maxims of his kingdom  may eternal vengeance pursue the villain thank heaven she does not say overtake if he give room to doubt his honor  women cannot swear jack  sweet souls they can only curse  i am said to doubt her love  have i not reason and she to doubt my ardor  ardor jack  why it is very right  women as miss how says and as every rake knows love ardors  she apprizes her of the ill success of the application made to her uncle  by hickman no doubt  i must have this fellows ears in my pocket very quickly believe  she says she is equally shocked and enraged against all her family mrs nortons weight has been tried upon mrs harlowe as well as mr hickmans upon the uncle but never were there says the vixen such determined brutes in the world her uncle concludes her ruined already  is not that a call upon me as well as a reproach  they all expected applications from her when in distress  but were resolved not to stir an inch to save her life she was accused of premeditation and contrivance miss how is concerned she tells her for the revenge my pride may put me upon taking for the distance she has kept me at  and well she may  she has now but one choice for her cousin morden it seems is set against her too and that is to be mine  an act of necessity of convenience  thy friend jack to be already made a womans convenience  is this to be borne by a lovelace  i shall make great use of this letter from miss howes hints of what passed between her uncle harlowe and hickman it must be hickman i can give room for my invention to play for she tells her that she will not reveal all i must endeavor to come at this letter myself i must have the very words extracts will not do this letter when i have it must be my compass to steer by  the fire of friendship then blazes out and crackles i never before imagined that so fervent a friendship could subsist between two sisterbeauties both toasts but even here it may be inflamed by opposition and by that contradiction which gives spirit to female spirits of a warm and romantic turn  she raves about coming up if by so doing she could prevent so noble a creature from stooping too low or save her from ruin  one reed to support another these girls are frenzical in their friendship they know not what a steady fire is  how comes it to pass that i cannot help being pleased with this viragos spirit though i suffer by it had i her but here i would engage in a weeks time to teach her submission without reserve what pleasure should i have in breaking such a spirit i should wish for her but for one month in all i think she would be too tame and spiritless for me after that how sweetly pretty to see the two lovely friends when humbled and tame both sitting in the darkest corner of a room arm in arm weeping and sobbing for each other  and i their emperor their then acknowleged emperor reclined on a sophee in the same room grand signor like uncertain to which i should first throw out my handkerchief  mind the girl she is enraged at the harlowes she is angry at her own mother she is exasperated against her foolish and lowvanityd lovelace  foolish a little toad god forgive me for calling a virtuous girl a toad let us stoop to lift the wretch out of his dirt though we soil our fingers in doing it he has not been guilty of direct indecency to you  it seems extraordinary to miss how that i have not  nor dare he  she should be sure of that if women have such things in their heads why should not i in my heart  not so much of a devil as that comes to neither such villainous intentions would have shown themselves before now if i had them  lord help them   she then puts her friend upon urging for settlements license and so forth  no room for delicacy now she says  and tells her what she shall say to bring all forward from me  do think jack that i should not have carried my point long ago but for this vixen  she reproaches her for having modestyd away as she calls it more than one opportunity that she ought not to have slipped  thus thou see that the noblest of the sex mean nothing in the world by their shyness and distance but to pound a poor fellow whom they dislike not when he comes into their purieus  annexed to this letter is a paper the most saucy that ever was wrote of a mother by a daughter there are in it such free reflections upon widows and batchelors that i cannot but wonder how miss how came by her learning sir george colmar i can tell thee was a greater fool than thy friend if she had it all for nothing  the contents of this paper acquaints miss harlowe that her uncle antony has been making proposals of marriage to her mother the old fellows heart ought to be a tough one if he succeed or she who broke that of a much worthier man the late mr how will soon get rid of him but be this as it may the stupid family is more irreconcilable than ever to their goddessdaughter for old antonys thoughts of marrying so i am more secure of her than ever since as miss how says she can have but one choice now though this disgusts my pride yet i believe at last my tender heart will be moved in her favor for i did not wish that she should have nothing but persecution and distress  but why loves she the brutes as miss how justly calls them so much me so little  but i have still more unpardonable transcripts from other letters  letter xxv mr lovelace to john belford esquire the next letter is of such a nature that i dare say these proud varletesses would not have had it fall into my hands for the world letter xv p      i see by it to what her displeasure with me in relation to my proposals was owing they were not summed up it seems with the warmth with the ardor which she had expected this whole letter was transcribed by dorcas to whose lot it fell thou shall have copies of them all at full length shortly  men of our cast this little devil says she fancies cannot have the ardors that honest men have miss how has very pretty fancies jack charming girl would to heaven i knew whether my fairone answers her as freely as she writes twould vex a mans heart that this virago should have come honestly by her fancies  who knows but i may have half a dozen creatures to get off my hands before i engage for life  yet lest this should mean me a compliment as if i would reform she adds her belief that she must not expect me to be honest on this side my grand climacteric she has an high opinion of her sex to think they can charm so long with a man so well acquainted with their identicalness  he to suggest delays she says from a compliment to be made to lord m  yes i my dear  because a man has not been accustomed to be dutiful must he never be dutiful  in so important a case as this too the hearts of his whole family engaged in it you did indeed says she want an interposing friend  but were i to have been in your situation i would have tore his eyes out and left it to his own heart to furnish the reason for it see see what say thou to this jack  villain  fellow that he is follow and for what only for wishing that the next day were to be my happy one and for being dutiful to my nearest relation  it is the crullest of fates she says for a woman to be forced to have a man whom her heart despises  that is what i wanted to be sure of  i was afraid that my beloved was too conscious of her talents of her superiority  i was afraid that she indeed despised me and i cannot bear it but belford i do not intend that this lady shall be bound down by so cruel a fate let me perish if i marry a woman who has given her most intimate friend reason to say she despises me  a lovelace to be despised jack  his clenchd fist to his forehead on your leaving him in just displeasure  that is when she was not satisfied with my ardors and please ye  i remember the motion but her back was toward me at the time are these watchful ladies all eye  but observe her wish i wish it had been a pollax and in the hands of his worst enemy  i will have patience jack i will have patience my day is at hand  then will i steel my heart with these remembrances  but here is a scheme to be thought of in order to get my fair prize out of my hands in case i give her reason to suspect me  this indeed alarms me now the contention becomes arduous now will thou not wonder if i let loose my plotting genius upon them both i will not be outnorrisd belford  but once more she has no notion she says that i can or dare to mean her dishonor but then the man is a fool  that is all  i should indeed be a fool to proceed as i do and mean matrimony however since you are thrown upon a fool says she marry the fool at the first opportunity and though i doubt that this man will be the most unmanageable of fools as all witty and vain fools are take him as a punishment since you cannot as a reward  is there any bearing this belford  but in the letter i came at today while she was at church her scheme is further opened and a cursed one it is  mr lovelace then transcribes from his shorthand notes that part of miss howes letter which relates to the design of engaging mrs townsend in case of necessity to give her protection till colonel morden comes letter xxii p  0   and repeats his vows of revenge especially for those words that should he attempt any thing that would make him obnoxious to the laws of society she might have a fair riddance of him either by flight or the gallows no matter which  he then adds  it is my pride to subdue girls who know too much to doubt their knowledge and to convince them that they know too little to defend themselves from the inconveniences of knowing too much  how passion drives a man on i have written as thou wilt see a prodigious quantity in a very few hours now my resentments are warm i will see and perhaps will punish this proud this doublearmd beauty i have sent to tell her that i must be admitted to sup with her we have neither of us dined she refused to drink tea in the afternoon  and i believe neither of us will have much stomach to our supper  letter xxvi miss clarissa harlowe to miss how sunday morning   may    i was at the play last night with mr lovelace and miss horton it is you know a deep and most affecting tragedy in the reading you have my remarks upon it in the little book you made me write upon the principal acting plays you will not wonder that miss horton as well as i was greatly moved at the representation when i tell you and have some pleasure in telling you that mr lovelace himself was very sensibly touched with some of the most affecting scenes i mention this in praise of the authors performance for i take mr lovelace to be one of the most hardhearted men in the world upon my word my dear i do  his behavior however on this occasion and on our return was unexceptionable only that he would oblige me to stay to supper with the women beow when we came back and to sit up with him and them till near one oclock this morning i was resolved to be even with him and indeed i am not very sorry to have the pretense for i love to pass the sundays by myself  to have the better excuse to avoid his teazing i am ready dressed to go to church this morning i will go only to st jamess church and in a chair that i may be sure i can go out and come in when i please without being obtruded upon by him as i was twice before   near nine oclock i have your kind letter of yesterday he knows i have and i shall expect that he will be inquisitive next time i see him after your opinion of his proposals i doubted not your approbation of them and had written an answer on that presumption which is ready for him he must study for occasions of procrastination and to disoblige me if now any thing happens to set us at variance again  he is very importunate to see me he has desired to attend me to church he is angry that i have declined to breakfast with him i was sure that i should not be at my own liberty if i had  i bid dorcas tell him that i desired to have this day to myself i would see him in the morning as early as he pleased she says she knows not what ails him but that he is out of humor with everybody  he has sent again in a peremptory manner he warns me of singleton but surely i sent him word if he was not afraid of singleton at the playhouse last night i need not at church to day so many churches to one playhouse  i have accepted of his servants proposed attendance  but he is quite displeased it seems i dont care i will not be perpetually at his insolent beck  adieu my dear til i return the chair waits he will not stop me sure as i go down to it  i did not see him as i went down he is i seems excessively out of humor dorcas says n with me neither she believes but something has vexed him this is put on perhaps to make me dine with him but i will not if i can help it i shall not get rid of him for the rest of the day if i do  he was very earnest to dine with me but i was resolved to carry this one small point and so denied to dine myself and indeed i was endeavoring to write to my cousin morden and had begun three different letters without being able to please myself so uncertain and so unpleasing is my situation  he was very busy in writing dorcas says and pursued it without dining because i denied him my company  he afterward demanded as i may say to be admitted to afternoon tea with me and appealed by dorcas to his behavior to me last night as if as i sent him word by her he thought he had a merit in being unexceptionable however i repeated my promise to meet him as early as he pleased in the morning or to breakfast with him  dorcas says he raved i heard him loud and i heard his servant fly from him as i thought you my dearest friend say in one of yours vol iii letter lxix p      that you must have somebody to be angry at when your mother sets you up  i should be very loath to draw comparisons  but the workings of passion when indulged are but too much alike whether in man or woman  he has just sent me word that he insists upon supping with me as we had been in a good train for several days past i thought it not prudent to break with him for little matters yet to be in a manner threatened into his will i know not how to bear that  while i was considering he came up and tapping at my door told me in a very angry tone he must see me this night he could not rest till he had been told what he had done to deserve this treatment  i must go to him yet perhaps he has nothing new to say to me  i shall be very angry with him  as the lady could not know what mr lovelaces designs were nor the cause of his ill humor it will not be improper to pursue the subject from his letter  having described his angry manner of demanding in person her company at supper he proceeds as follows    it is hard answered the fair perverse that i am to be so little my own mistress i will meet you in the dining room half an hour hence  i went down to wait that halfhour all the women set me hard to give her cause for this tyranny they demonstrated as well from the nature of the sex as of the case that i had nothing to hope for from my tameness and could meet with no worse treatment were i to be guilty of the last offense they urged me vehemently to try at least what effect some greater familiarities than i had ever used with her would have and their arguments being strengthened by my just resentments on the discoveries i had made i was resolved to take some liberties and as they were received to take still greater and lay all the fault upon her tyranny in this humor i went up and never had paralytic so little command of his joints as i had as i walked about the dining room attending her motions  with an erect mien she entered her face averted her lovely bosom swelling and the more charmingly protuberant for the erectness of her mien o jack that sullenness and reserve should give this haughty maid new charms but in every attitude in every humor in every gesture is beauty beautiful  by her averted face and indignant aspect i saw the dear insolent was disposed to be angry  but by the fierceness of mine as my trembling hands seized hers i soon made fear her predominant passion and yet the moment i beheld her my heart was dastardizd damped and reverencedover surely this is an angel jack  and yet had she not been known to be a female they would not from babyhood have dressed her as such nor would she but upon that conviction have continued the dress  let me ask you madam i beseech you tell me what i have done to deserve this distant treatment  and let me ask you mr lovelace why are my retirements to be thus invaded  what can you have to say to me since last night that i went with you so much against my will to the play and after sitting up with you equally against my will till a very late hour   this i have to say madam that i cannot bear to be kept at this distance from you under the same roof i have a thousand things to say to talk of relating to our present and future prospects but when i want o open my whole soul to you you are always conriving to keep me at a distance you make me inconsistent with myself your heart is set upon delays you must have views that you will not own tell me madam i conjure you to tell me this moment without subterfuge or reserve in what light am i to appear to you in future i cannot bear this distance he suspense you hold me in i cannot bear  in what light mr lovelace in no bad light i hope  pray mr lovelace do not grasp my hands o hard endeavouring to withdraw her hands pray et me go   you hate me madam   i hate nobody sir   you hate me madam repeated i  instigated and resolved as i came up i wanted ome new provocation the devil indeed as soon as my angel made her appearance crept out of my heart but he had left the door open and was no farther off than my elbow  you come up in no good temper i see mr lovelace  but pray be not violent  i have done you no hurt  pray be not violent   sweet creature and i clasped one arm about her holding one hand in my other  you have done me no hurt  you have done me the greatest hurt  in what have i deserved the distance you keep me at  i knew not what to say  she struggled to disengage herself  pray mr lovelace let me withdraw i know not why this is  i know not what i have done to offend you i see you are come with a design to quarrel with me if you would not terrify me by the illhumour you are in permit me to withdraw i will hear all you have to say another time  tomorrow morning as i sent you word but indeed you frighten me  i beseech you if you have any value for me permit me to withdraw  night midnight is necessary belford surprise terror must be necessary to the ultimate trial of this charming creature say the women below what they will  i could not hold my purposes  this was no the first time that i had intended to try if she could forgive  i kissed her hand with a fervor as if i would have left my lips upon it  withdraw then dearest an everdear creature  indeed i entered in a very  humor i cannot bear the distance you so causle keep me at  withdraw however madam since  is your will to withdraw and judge me generously judge me but as i deserve to be judged and let m hope to meet you tomorrow morning early in suc a temper as becomes our present situation and m future hopes and so saying i conducted her to the door and left her there but instead of going dow to the women went into my own chamber and locked myself in ashamed of being awed by her maestic loveliness and apprehensive virtue into so great a change of purpose notwithstanding i had such just provocations from the letters of her saucy friend founded on her own representations of facts and situations between herself and me  the lady thus describes her terrors and mr lovelaces behavior on this occasion    on my entering the dining room he took my hands in his in such a humor as i saw plainly he was resolved to quarrel with me  and for what   never in my life beheld in anybody such a wild such an angry such an impatient spirit i was terified and instead of being as angry as i intended to e i was forced to be all mildness i can hardly remember what were his first words i was so frighted but you hate me madam you hate me madam were some of them  with such a fierceness  i wished myself a thousand miles distant from him i hate noody said i i thank god i hate nobody  you terify me mr lovelace  let me leave you  the man my dear looked quite ugly  i never saw a man ook so ugly as passion made him look  and for what  and he so grasped my hands  fierce creature he so grasped my hands in short he eemed by his looks and by his words once putting is arms about me to wish me to provoke him  so that i had nothing to do but to beg of him which  did repeatedly to permit me to withdraw and to promise to meet him at his own time in the morning  it was with a very ill grace that he complied on that condition and at parting he kissed my hand with uch a savageness that a redness remains upon it till  perfect for me my dearest miss how perfect for me i beseech you your kind scheme with mrs townsend  and i will then leave this man see you not how from step to step he grows upon me  i tremble to look back upon his encroachments and now to give me cause to apprehend more evil from him than indignation will permit me to express  o my dear perfect your scheme and let me fly from so strange a wretch he must certainly have views in quarrelling with me thus which he dare not own yet what can they be  i was so disgusted with him as well as frighted by him that on my return to my chamber in a fit of passionate despair i tore almost in two the answer i had written to his proposals  i will see him in the morning because i promised i would but i will go out and that without him or any attendant if he account not tolerably for his sudden change of behavior and a proper opportunity offer of a private lodging in some creditable house i will not any more return to this  at present i think so  and there will i either attend the perfecting of your scheme or by your epistolary mediation make my own terms with the wretch since it is your opinion that i must be his and cannot help myself or perhaps take a resolution to throw myself at once into lady bettys protection and this will hinder him from making his insolentlythreatned visit to harloweplace  the lady writes again on monday evening and gives her friend an account of all that has passed between herself and mr lovelace that day and of her being terrified out of her purpose of going abroad but mr lovelaces next letters giving a more ample account of all hers are omitted  it is proper however to mention that she reurges miss how from the dissatisfaction she has reason for from what passed between mr lovelace and herself to perfect her scheme in relation to mrs townsend  she concludes this letter in these words  i should say something of your last favor but a few hours ago received and of your dialogue with your mother  are you not very whimsical my dear  i have but two things to wish for on this occasion the one that your charming pleasantry had a better subject than that you find for it in this dialogue the other that my situation were not such as must too often damp that pleasantry and will not permit me to enjoy it as i used to do be however happy in yourself though you cannot in   your clarissa harlowe   letter xxvii mr lovelace to john belford esquire monday morn may    no generosity in this lady none at all would thou not have thought that after i had permitted her to withdraw primed for mischief as i was that she would meet me next morning early and that with a smile making me one of her best courtesies  i was in the dining room before six expecting her she opened not her door i went upstairs and down and hemmed and called will called dorcas threw the doors hard to but still she opened not her door thus till half an hour after eight fooled i away my time and then breakfast ready i sent dorcas to request her company  but i was astonished when following the wench at the first invitation i saw her enter dressed all but her gloves and those and her fan in her hand in the same moment bidding dorcas direct will to get her a chair to the door  cruel creature thought i to expose me thus to the derision of the women below  going abroad madam  i am sir  i looked cursed silly i am sure  you will breakfast first i hope madam in a very humble strain yet with an hundred tenterhooks in my heart  had she given me more notice of her intention i had perhaps wrought myself up to the frame i was in the day before and begun my vengeance and immediately came into my head all the virulence that had been transcribed for me from miss howes letters and in that i had transcribed myself  yes she would drink one dish and then laid her gloves and fan in the window just by  i was perfectly disconcerted i hemmed and hawd and was going to speak several times but knew not in what key who is modest now thought i who is insolent now  how a tyrant of a woman confounds a bashful man  she was my miss how i thought and i the spiritless hickman  at last i will begin thought i  she a dish  i a dish  sip her eyes her own she like an haughty and imperious sovereign conscious of dignity every look a favor  sip like her vassal i lips and hands trembling and not knowing that i sippd or tasted  i was  i was  iffpd  drawing in my breath and the liquor together though i scalded my mouth with it  i was in hopes madam   dorcas came in just then  dorcas said she is a chair gone for  damned impertinence thought i putting me out of my speech and i was forced to wait for the servants answer to the insolent mistresss question  william is gone for one madam  this cost me a minutes silence before i could begin again  and then it was with my hopes and my hopes and my hopes that i should have been early admitted to   what weather is it dorcas said she as regardless of me as if i had not been present  a little lowering madam  the sun is gone in  it was very fine half an hour ago  i had no patience  up i rose down went the teacup saucer and all  confound the weather the sunshine and the wench  begone for a devil when i am speaking to your lady and have so little opportunity given me  up rose the lady half frighted and snatched from the window her gloves and fan  you must not go madam  by my soul you must not  taking her hand  must not sir  but i must  you can curse your maid in my absence as well as if i were present  except  except  you intend for me what you direct to her  dearest creature you must not go  you must not leave me  such determined scorn such contempts  questions asked your servant of no meaning but to break in upon me who couldbear it  detain me not struggling  i will not be withhld  i like you not nor your ways  you sought to quarrel with me yesterday for no reason in the world that i can think of but because i was too obliging you are an ungrateful man and i hate you with my whole heart mr lovelace  do not make me desperate madam  permit me to say that you shall not leave me in this humor wherever you go i will attend you  had miss how been my friend i had not been thus treated  it is but too plain to whom my difficulties are owing i have long observed that every letter you receive from her makes an alteration in your behavior to me she would have you treat me as she treats mr hickman i suppose but neither does that treatment become your admirable temper to offer nor me to receive  this startled her she did not care to have me think hardly of miss how  but recollecting herself miss how said she is a friend to virtue and to good men  if she like not you it is because you are not one of those  yes madam and therefore to speak of mr hickman and myself as you both i suppose think of each she treats him as she would not treat a lovelace  i challenge you madam to show me but one of the many letters you have received from her where i am mentioned  whither will this lead us replied she miss how is just miss how is good  she writes she speaks of everybody as they deserve if you point me out but any one occasion upon which you have reason to build a merit to yourself as either just or good or even generous i will look out for her letter on that occasion if it be one i have acquainted her with and will engage it shall be in your favor  devilish severe and as indelicate as severe to put a modest man upon hunting backward after his own merits  she would have flung from me i will go out mr lovelace i will not be detained  indeed you must not madam in this humor and i placed myself between her and the door  and then she threw herself into a chair fanning herself her sweet face all crimsoned over with passion  i cast myself at her feet  begone mr lovelace said she with a rejecting motion her fan in her hand for your own sake leave me  my soul is above thee man with both her hands pushing me from her  urge me not to tell thee how sincerely i think my soul above thee  thou have a proud a too proud heart to contend with  leave me and leave me for ever  thou have a proud heart to contend with  her air her manner her voice were bewitchingly noble though her words were so severe  let me worship an angel said i no woman forgive me dearest creature  creature if you be forgive me  forgive my inadvertencies forgive my inequalities  pity my infirmity  who is equal to my clarissa  i trembled between admiration and love and wrapped my arms about her knees as she sat she tried to rise at the moment but my clasping round her thus ardently drew her down again and never was woman more affrighted but free as my clasping emotion might appear to her apprehensive heart i had not at the instant any thought but what reverence inspired and till she had actually withdrawn which i permitted under promise of a speedy return and on her consent to dismiss the chair all the motions of my heart were as pure as her own  she kept not her word an hour i waited before i sent to claim her promise she could not possibly see me yet was the answer as soon as she could she would  dorcas says she still excessively trembled and ordered her to give her water and hartshorn  a strange apprehensive creature  her terror is too great for the occasion  evils in apprehension are often greater than evils in reality have thou never observed that the terrors of a bird caught and actually in the hand bear no comparison to what we might have supposed those terrors would be were we to have formed a judgment of the same bird by its shyness before taken  dear creature  did she never romp did she never from girlhood to now hoyden the innocent kinds of freedom taken and all owed on these occasions would have familiarized her to greater sacrilege but to touch the hem of her garment  excess of delicacy  o the consecrated beauty  how can she think to be a wife  but how do i know till i try whether she may not by a less alarming treatment be prevailed upon or whether day i have done with thee she may not yield to nightly surprises this is still the burden of my song i can marry her when i will and if i do after prevailing whether by surprise or reluctant consent whom but myself shall i have injured  it is now eleven oclock she will see me as soon as she can she tells polly horton who made her a tender visit and to whom she is less reserved than to anybody else her emotion she assures her was not owing to perverseness to nicety to illhumour but to weakness of heart she has not strength of mind sufficient she says to enable her to support her condition and her apprehensions under the weight of a fathers curse which she fears is more than beginning to operate  yet what a contradiction  weakness of heart says she with such a strength of will  o belford she is a lionhearted lady in every case where her honor her punctilio rather calls for spirit but i have had reason more than once in her case to conclude that the passions of the gentlest slower to be moved than those of the quick are the most flaming the most irresistible when raised  yet her charming body is not equally organized the unequal partners pull two ways and the divinity within her tears her silken frame but had the same soul informed a masculine body never would there have been a truer hero   monday two oclock my beloved not yet visible she is not well what expectations had she from my ardent admiration of her  more rudeness than revenge apprehended yet how my soul thirsts for revenge upon both these ladies  i must have recourse to my masterstrokes this cursed project of miss how and her mrs townsend if i cannot contrive to render it abortive will be always a sword hanging over my head upon every little disobligation my beloved will be for taking wing and the pains i have taken to deprive her of every other refuge or protection in order to make her absolutely dependent upon me will be all thrown away but perhaps i shall find out a smuggler to counteract miss how  thou remembrest the contention between the sun and the north wind in the fable which should first make an honest traveller throw off his cloak  boreas began first he puffed away most vehemently and often made the poor fellow curve and stagger but with no other effect than to cause him to wrap his surtout the closer about him  but when it came to phoebuss turn he so played upon the traveller with his beams that he made him first unbutton and then throw it quite off  nor left he till he obliged him to take to the friendly shade of a spreading beech where prostrating himself on the thrownoff cloak he took a comfortable nap  the victorgod then laughed outright both at boreas and the traveller and pursued his radiant course shining upon and warming and cherishing a thousand new objects as he danced along and at night when he put up his fiery coursers he diverted his thetis with the relation of his pranks in the passed day  i in like manner will discard all my boistrous inventions and if i can oblige my sweet traveller to throw aside but for one moment the cloak of her rigid virtue i shall have nothing to do but like the sun to bless new objects with my rays  but my chosen hours of conversation and repose after all my peregrinations will be devoted to my goddess  and now belford according to my new system i think this house of mrs fretchville an embarass upon me i will get rid of it for some time at least mennell when i am out shall come to her inquiring for me what for thou wilt ask what for  have thou not heard what has befallen poor mrs fretchville  then i will tell thee  one of her maids about a week ago was taken with the smallpox the restkept their mistress ignorant of it till friday and then she came to know it by accident  the greater half of the plagues poor mortals of condition are tormented with proceed from the servants they take partly for show partly for use and with a view to lessen their cares  this has so terrified the widow that she is taken with all the symptoms which threaten an attack from that dreadful enemy of fair faces  so must not think of removing yet cannot expect that we should be further delayed on her account  she now wishes with all her heart that she had known her own mind and gone into the country at first when i treated about the house this evil then had not happened  a cursed cross accident for us too  highho nothing else i think in this mortal life  people need not study to bring crosses upon themselves by their petulancies  so this affair of the house will be over at least for one while but then i can fall upon an expedient which will make amends for this disappointment since i must move slow in order to be sure i have a charming contrivance or two in my head  even supposing she should get away to bring her back again  but what is become of lord m i trow that he writes not to me in answer to my invitation if he would send me such a letter as i could show it might go a great way toward a perfect reconciliation i have written to charlotte about it he shall soon hear from me and that in a way he will not like if he writes not quickly he has sometimes threatened to disinherit me but if i should renounce him it would be but justice and would vex him ten times more than any thing he can do will vex me then the settlements unavoidably delayed by his neglect  how shall i bear such a life of procrastination i who as to my will and impatience and so forth am of the true ladymake and can as little bear control and disappointment as the best of them  another letter from miss how i suppose it is that which she promises in her last to send her relateing to the courtship between old tony the uncle and annabella the mother i should be extremely rejoiced to see it no more of the smugglerplot in it i hope this it seems she has put in her pocket but i hope i shall soon find it deposited with the rest   monday evening at my repeated request she condescended to meet me in the dining room to afternoon tea and not before  she entered with bashfulness as i thought in a pretty confusion for having carried her apprehensions too far sullen and slow moved she toward the teatable  dorcas present busy in tea cup preparations i took her reluctant hand and pressed it to my lips  dearest loveliest of creatures why this distance why this displeasure  how can you thus torture the faithfullest heart in the world  she disengaged her hand again i would have snatched it  be quiet peevishly withdrawing it and down she sat a gentle palpitation in the beauty of beauties indicating mingled sullenness and resentment her snowy handkerchief rising and falling and a sweet flush overspreading her charming cheeks  for gods sake madam  and a third time i would have taken her repulsing hand  and for the same sake sir no more teazing  dorcas retired i drew my chair nearer hers and with the most respectful tenderness took her hand and told her that i could not without the utmost concern forbear to express my apprehensions from the distance she was so desirous to keep me at that if any man in the world was more indifferent to her to use no harsher a word than another it was the unhappy wretch before her  she looked steadily upon me for a moment and with her other hand not withdrawing that i held pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket and by a twinkling motion tried to dissipate a tear or two which stood ready in each eye to meander themselves a passage down her glowing cheeks but answered me only with a sigh and an averted face  i urged her to speak to look up at me to bless me with an eye more favorable  i had reason she told me for my complaint of her indifference she saw nothing in my mind that was generous i was not a man to be obliged or favored my strange behavior to her since saturday night for no cause at all that she knew of convinced her of this whatever hopes she had conceived of me were utterly dissipated all my ways were disgustful to her  this cut me to the heart the guilty i believe in every case less patiently bear the detecting truth than the innocent do the degrading falsehood  i bespoke her patience while i took the liberty to account for this change on my part  i reacknowleged the pride of my heart which could not bear the thought of that want of preference in the heart of a lady whom i hoped to call mine which she had always manifested marriage i said was a state that was not to be entered upon with indifference on either side  it is insolence interrupted she it is presumption sir to expect tokens of value without resolving to deserve them you have no whining creature before you mr lovelace overcome by weak motives to love where there is no merit miss how can tell you sir that i never loved the faults of my friend nor ever wished her to love me for mine it was a rule with us not to spare each other and would a man who has nothing but faults for pray sir what are your virtues expect that i should show a value for him indeed if i did i should not deserve even his value but ought to be despised by him  well have you madam kept up to this noble manner of thinking you are in no danger of being despised for any marks of tenderness or favor shown to the man before you you have been perhaps you will think laudably studious of making and taking occasions to declare that it was far from being owing to your choice that you had any thoughts of me my whole soul madam in all its errors in all its wishes in all its views had been laid open and naked before you had i been encouraged by such a share in your confidence and esteem as would have secured me against your apprehended worst constructions of what i should from time to time have revealed to you and consulted you upon for never was there a franker heart nor a man so ready to accuse himself this belford is true but you know madam how much otherwise it has been between us  doubt distance reserve on your part begat doubt fear awe on mine  how little confidence as if we apprehended each other to be a plotter rather than a lover how have i dreaded every letter that has been brought you from wilsons  and with reason since the last from which i expected so much on account of the proposals i had made you in writing has if i may judge by the effects and by your denial of seeing me yesterday though you could go abroad and in a chai too to avoid my attendance on you set you against me more than ever  i was guilty it seems of going to church said the indignant charmer and without the company of a man whose choice it would not have been to go had i not gone i was guilty of desiring to have the whole sunday to myself after i had obliged you against my will at a play and after you had detained me equally to my dislike to a very late hour over night  these were my faults for these i was to be punished i was to be compelled to see you and to be terrified when i did see you by the most shocking illhumour that was ever shown to a creature in my circumstances and not bound to bear it you have pretended to find free fault with my fathers temper mr lovelace but the worst that he ever showed after marriage was not in the least to be compared to what you have shown twenty times beforehand  and what are my prospects with you at the very best  my indignation rises against you mr lovelace while i speak to you when i recollect the many instances equally ungenerous and unpolite of your behavior to one whom you have brought into distress  and i can hardly bear you in my sight  she turned from me standing up and lifting up her folded hands and charming eyes swimming in tears  o my dear papa said the inimitable creature you might have spared your heavy curse had you known how i have been punished ever since my swerving feet led me out of your gardendoors to meet this man then sinking into her chair a burst of passionate tears forced their way down her glowing cheeks  my dearest life taking her still folded hands in mine who can bear an invocation so affecting though so passionate and as i hope to live my nose tingled as i once when a boy remember it did and indeed once more very lately just before some tears came into my eyes and i durst hardly trust my face in view of hers what have i done to deserve this impatient exclamation  have i at any time by word by deeds by looks given you cause to doubt my honor my reverence my adoration i may call it of your virtues  all is owing to misapprehension i hope on both sides  condescend to clear up but your part as i will mine and all must speedily be happy  would to heaven i loved that heaven as i love you and yet if i doubted a return in love let me perish if i should know how to wish you mine  give me hope dearest creature give me but hope that i am your preferable choice  give me but hope that you hate me not that you do not despise me  o mr lovelace we have been long enough together to be tired of each others humors and ways ways and humors so different that perhaps you ought to dislike me as much as i do you  i think i think that i cannot make an answerable return to the value you profess for me my temper is utterly ruined you have given me an ill opinion of all mankind of yourself in particular and withal so bad a one of myself that i shall never be able to look up having utterly and for ever lost all that selfcomplacency and conscious pride which are so necessary to carry a woman through this life with tolerable satisfaction to herself  she paused i was silent by my soul thought i this sweet creature will at last undo me  she proceeded  what now remains but that you pronounce me free of all obligation to you and that you will not hinder me from pursuing the destiny that shall be allotted me  again she paused i was still silent meditating whether to renounce all further designs upon her whether i had not received sufficient evidence of a virtue and of a greatness of soul that could not be questioned or impeached  she went on propitious to me be your silence mr lovelace  tell me that i am free of all obligation to you you know i never made you promises  you know that you are not under any to me  my broken fortunes i matter not   she was proceeding  my dearest life said i i have been all this time though you fill me with doubts of your favor busy in the nuptial preparations  i am actually in treaty for equipage  equipage sir  trappings tinsel  what is equipage what is life what is anything to a creature sunk so low as i am in my own opinion  laboring under a fathers curse  unable to look backward without reproach or forward without terror  these reflections strengthened by every cross accident  and what but cross accidents befall me  all my darling schemes dashed in pieces all my hopes at an end deny me not the liberty to refuge myself in some obscure corner where neither the enemies you have made me nor the few friends you have left me may ever hear of the supposed rash one till those happy moments are at hand which shall expiate for all  i had not a word to say for myself such a war in my mind had i never known gratitude and admiration of the excellent creature before me combating with villainous habit with resolutions so premeditately made and with views so much gloried in  an hundred new contrivances in my head and in my heart that to be honest as it is called must all be given up by a heart delighting in intrigue and difficulty  miss howes virulences endeavored to be recollected  yet recollection refusing to bring them forward with the requisite efficacy  i had certainly been a lost man had not dorcas come seasonably in with a letter  on the superscription written  be pleased sir to open it now  i returned to the window  opened it  it was from herself  these the contents  be pleased to detain my lady a paper of importance to transcribe  i will cough when i have done  i put the paper in my pocket and turned to my charmer less disconcerted as she by that time had also a little recovered herself  one favor dearest creature  let me but know whether miss how approves or disapproves of my proposals  i know her to be my enemy i was intending to account to you for the change of behavior you accused me of at the beginning of this conversation but was diverted from it by your vehemence  indeed my beloved creature you was very vehement  do you think it must not be matter of high regret to me to find my wishes so often delayed and postponed in favor of your predominant view to a reconciliation with relations who will not be reconciled to you  to this was owing your declining to celebrate before we came to town though you were so atrociously treated by your sister and your whole family and though so ardently pressed to celebrate by me to this was owing the ready offense you took at my four friends and at the unavailing attempt i made to see a dropped letter little imagining that there could be room for mortal displeasure on that account from what two such ladies could write to each other  to this was owing the weeks distance you held me at till you knew the issue of another application  but when they had rejected that when you had sent my coldlyreceived proposals to miss how for her approbation or advice as indeed i advised and had honored me with your company at the play on saturday night my whole behavior unobjectible to the last hour must not madam the sudden change in your conduct the very next morning astonish and distress me  and this persisted in with still stronger declarations after you had received the impatientlyexpected letter from miss how must i not conclude that all was owing to her influence and that some other application or project was meditating that made it necessary to keep me again at distance till the result were known and which was to deprive me of you for ever for was not that your constantly proposed preliminary  well madam might i be wrought up to a halffrenzy by this apprehension and well might i charge you with hating me  and now dearest creature let me know i once more ask you what is miss howes opinion of my proposals  were i disposed to debate with you mr lovelace i could very easily answer your fine harangue but at present i shall only say that your ways have been very unaccountable you seem to me if your meanings were always just to have taken great pains to embarass them whether owing in you to the want of a clear head or a sound heart i cannot determine but it is to the want of one of them i verily think that i am to ascribe the greatest part of your strange conduct  curse upon the heart of the little devil said i who instigates you to think so hardly of the faithfullest heart in the world  how dare you sir  and there she stopped having almost overshot herself as i designed she should  how dare i what madam and i looked with meaning how dare i what  vile man  and do you  and there again she stopped  do i what madam  and why vile man  how dare you to curse anybody in my presence  o the sweet receder  but that was not to go off so with a lovelace  why then dearest creature is there anybody that instigates you  if there be again i curse them be they who they will  she was in a charming pretty passion  and this was the first time that i had the odds in my favor  well madam it is just as i thought and now i know how to account for a temper that i hope is not natural to you  artful wretch and is it thus you would entrap me  but know sir that i receive letters from nobody but miss how miss how likes some of your ways as little as i do for i have set everything before her  yet she is thus far your enemy as she is mine  she thinks i should not refuse your offers but endeavor to make the best of my lot and now you have the truth would to heaven you were capable of dealing with equal sincerity  i am madam and here on my knee i renew my vows and my supplication that you will make me yours  yours for ever  and let me have cause to bless you and miss how in the same breath  to say the truth belford i had before begun to think that that vixen of a girl who certainly likes not hickman was in love with me  rise sir from your tooready knees and mock me not  tooready knees thought i  though this humble posture so little affects this proud beauty she knows not how much i have obtained of others of her sex nor how often i have been forgiven the last attempts by kneeling  mock you madam  and i arose and reurged her for the day i blamed myself at the same time for my invitation to lord m as it might subject me to delay from his infirmities but told her that i would write to him to excuse me if she had no objection or to give him the day she would give me and not wait for him if he could not come in time  my day sir said she is never be not surprised a person of politeness judging between us would not be surprised that i say so but indeed mr lovelace and wept through impatience you either know not how to treat with a mind of the least degree of delicacy notwithstanding your birth and education or you are an ungrateful man and after a pause a worse than ungrateful one but i will retire i will see you again tomorrow i cannot before i think i hate you  you may look  indeed i think i hate you and if upon a reexamination of my own heart i find i do i would not for the world that matters should go on farther between us  i was too much vexed disconcerted mortified to hinder her retiring  and yet she had not gone if dorcas had not coughd  the wench came in as soon as her lady had retired and gave me the copy she had taken and what should it be of but the answer the truly admirable creature had intended to give to my written proposals in relation to settlements  i have but just dipped into this affecting paper were i to read it attentively not a wink should i sleep this night tomorrow it shall obtain my serious consideration   letter xxviii mr lovelace to john belford esquire tuesday morning may    the dear creature desires to be excused seeing me till evening she is not very well dorcas tells me  read here if thou will the paper transcribed by dorcas it is impossible that i should proceed with my projects against this admirable woman were it not that i am resolved after a few trials more as nobly sustained as those she has already passed through to make her if she really hate me not legally mine  to mr lovelace when a woman is married that supreme earthly obligation requires her in all instances of natural justice and where her husbands honor may be concerned to yield her own will to his  but beforehand i could be glad conformably to what i have always signified to have the most explicit assurances that every possible way should be tried to avoid litigation with my father time and patience will subdue all things my prospects of happiness are extremely contracted a husbands right will be always the same in my lifetime i could wish nothing to be done of this sort your circumstances sir will not oblige you to extort violently from him what is in his hands all that depends upon me either with regard to my person to my diversions or to the economy that no married woman of whatever rank or quality should be above inspecting shall be done to prevent a necessity for such measures being taken and if there will be no necessity for them it is to be hoped that motives less excusable will not have force  motives which must be founded in a littleness of mind which a woman who has not that littleness of mind will be under such temptations as her duty will hardly be able at all times to check to despise her husband for having especially in cases where her own family so much a part of herself and which will have obligations upon her though then but secondary ones from which she never can be freed are intimately concerned  this article then i urge to your most serious consideration as what lies next my heart i enter not here minutely into the fatal misunderstanding between them and you the fault may be in both but sir yours was the foundationfault at least you gave a too plausible pretense for my brothers antipathy to work upon condescension was no part of your study you chose to bear the imputations laid to your charge rather than to make it your endeavor to obviate them  but this may lead into hateful recrimination  let it be remembered i will only say in this place that in their eye you have robbed them of a daughter they doted upon and that their resentments on this occasion rise but in proportion to their love and their disappointment if they were faulty in some of the measures they took while they themselves did not think so who shall judge for them you sir who will judge everybody as you please and will let nobody judge you in your own particular must not be their judge  it may therefore be expected that they will stand out  as for myself sir i must leave it so seems it to be destined to your justice to treat me as you shall think i deserve but if your future behavior to them is not governed by that harshsounding implacableness which you charge upon some of their tempers the splendour of your family and the excellent character of some of them of all indeed except your own conscience furnishes you with one only exception will on better consideration do every thing with them for they may be overcome perhaps however with the more difficulty as the greatly prosperous less bear control and disappointment than others for i will own to you that i have often in secret lamented that their great acquirements have been a snare to them perhaps as great a snare as some other accidentals have been to you which being less immediately your own gifts you have still less reason than they to value yourself upon them  let me only on this subject further observe that condescension is not meanness there is a glory in yielding that hardly any violent spirit can judge of my brother perhaps is no more sensible of this than you but as you have talents he has not who however has as i hope that regard for morals the want of which makes one of his objections to you i could wish it may not be owing to you that your mutual dislikes to each other do not subside for it is my earnest hope that in time you may see each other without exciting the fears of a wife and a sister for the consequence not that i should wish you to yield in points that truly concerned your honor no sir i would be as delicate in such as you yourself more delicate i will venture to say because more uniformly so how vain how contemptible is that pride which shows itself in standing upon diminutive observances and gives up and makes a jest of the most important  this article being considered as i wish all the rest will be easy were i to accept of the handsome separate provision you seem to intend me added to the considerable sums arisen from my grandfathers estate since his death more considerable than perhaps you may suppose from your offer i should think it my duty to lay up for the family good and for unforeseen events out of it for as to my donations i would generally confine myself in them to the tenth of my income be it what it would i aim at no glare in what i do of that sort all i wish for is the power of relieving the lame the blind the sick and the industrious poor whom accident has made so or sudden distress reduced the common or bred beggars i leave to others and to the public provision they cannot be lower perhaps they wish not to be higher and not able to do for every one i aim not at works of supererogation two hundred pounds a year would do all i wish to do of the separate sort for all above i would content myself to ask you except mistrusting your own economy you would give up to my management and keeping in order to provide for future contingencies a larger portion for which as your steward i would regularly account  as to clothes i have particularly two suits which having been only in a manner tried on would answer for any present occasion jewels i have of my grandmothers which want only newsetting another set i have which on particular days i used to wear although these are not sent me i have no doubt being merely personals that they will when i send for them in another name till when i should not choose to wear any  as to your complaints of my diffidences and the like i appeal to your own heart if it be possible for you to make my case your own for one moment and to retrospect some parts of your behavior words and actions whether i am not rathe to be justified than censured  and whether of al men in the world avowing what you avow you ought not to think so if you do not let me admonish you sir that there must be too great mismatch as i may call it in our minds ever to make you wish to bring about a more intimate union of interests between yourself and  clarissa harlowe may  0  the original of this charming paper as dorca tells me was torn almost in two  in one of her pet i suppose  what business have the sex whose principal glory is meekness and patience and resignation to be in a passion i trow  will not she who allow herself such liberties as a maiden lady take greate when a married one  and a wife to be in a passion  let me tell the ladies it is a d  nd impudent thing begging the pardon and as imprudent as impudent for a wife  be in a passion if she mean not eternal separation  wicked defiance by it for is it not rejecting at once all that expostulatory meekness and gentle reasoning mingled with sighs as gentle and graced with bent knees supplicating hands and eyes lifted up to your imperial countenance just running over that should make a reconciliation speedy and as lasting as speedy even suppose the husband is wrong will not his being so give the greater force to her expostulation  now i think of it a man should be wrong nowandthen to make his wife shine miss how tells my charmer that adversity is her shiningtime it is a generous thing in a man to make his wife shine at his own expense to give her leave to triumph over him by patient reasoning for were he to be too imperial to acknowledge his fault on the spot she will find the benefit of her duty and submission in future and in the high opinion he will conceive of her prudence and obligingness  and so by degrees she will be her masters master  but for a wife to come up with a kemboed arm the other hand thrown out perhaps with a pointing finger  look ye here sir  take notice  if you are wrong i will be wrong  if you are in a passion i will be in a passion  rebuff for rebuff sir  if you ly i will tear  if you swear i will curse  and the same room and the samebed shall not hold us sir  for remember i am married sir  i am a wife sir  you cannot help yourself sir  your honor as well as your peace is in my keeping  and f you like not this treatment you may have worse sir  ah jack jack what man who has observed hese things either implied or expressed in other families would wish to be an husband  dorcas found this paper in one of the drawers of her adys dressingtable she was reperusing it as she upposes when the honest wench carried my message o desire her to favor me at the teatable for she saw her pop a paper into the drawer as she came in and there on her mistresss going to meet me in the dining room she found it and to be this  but i had better not to have had a copy of it as far as i know for determined as i was before upon my operations it instantly turned all my resolutions in her favor yet i would give something to be convinced that she did not pop it into her drawer before the wench in order for me to see it and perhaps if i were to take notice of it to discover whether dorcas according to miss howes advice were most my friend or hers  the very suspicion of this will do her no good for i cannot bear to be artfully treated people love to enjoy their own peculiar talents in monopoly as i may say i am aware that it will strengthen thy arguments against me in her behalf but i know every tittle thou can say upon it so spare thy wambling nonsense i desire thee and leave this sweet excellence and me to our fate that will determine for us as it shall please itself for as cowley says an unseen hand makes all our moves and some are great and some are small some climb to good some from good fortune fall some wise men and some fools we call figures alas of speech  for destiny plays us all   but after all i am sorry almost sorry for how shall i do to be quite sorry when it is not given to me to be so that i cannot without making any further trials resolve upon wedlock  i have just read over again this intended answer to my proposals and how i adore her for it  but yet another yet  she has not given it o sent it to me  so it is not her answer it is not written for me though to me  nay she has not intended to send it to me she has even torn it perhaps with indignation as thinking it too good for me by this action she absolutely retracts it why then does my foolish fondness seek to establish for her the same merit in my heart as if she avowed it prithee dear belford once more leave us to our fate and do not thou interpose with thy nonsense to weaken a spirit already too squeamish and strengthen a conscience that has declared itself of her party  then again remember thy recent discoveries lovelace  remember her indifference attended with all the appearance of contempt and hatred view her even now wrapped up in reserve and mystery meditating plots as far as thou know against the sovereignty thou have by right of conquest obtained over her remember in short all thou have threatened to remember against this insolent beauty who is a rebel to the power she has listed under  but yet how do thou propose to subdue thy sweet enemy  abhorred be force be the necessity of force if that can be avoided there is no triumph in force no conquest over the will  no prevailing by gentle degrees over the gentle passions force is the devil  my cursed character as i have often said was against me at setting out  yet is she not a woman cannot i find one but halfyielding moment if she do not absolutely hate me  but with what can i tempt her  riches she was born to and despises knowing what they are jewels and ornaments to a mind so much a jewel and so richly set her worthy consciousness will not let her value love if she be susceptible of love it seems to be so much under the direction of prudence that one unguarded moment i fear cannot be reasonably hoped for and so much vigilance so much apprehensiveness that her fears are ever aforehand with her dangers then her love of virtue seems to be principle native or if not native so deeply rooted that its fibers have struck into her heart and as she grew up so blended and twisted themselves with the strings of life that i doubt there is no separating of the one without cutting the others asunder  what then can be done to make such a matchless creature as this get over the first tests in order to put her to the grand proof whether once overcome she will not be always overcome  by my faith jack as i sit gazing upon her my whole soul in my eyes contemplating her perfections and thinking when i have seen her easy and serene what would be her thoughts did she know my heart as well as i know it when i behold her disturbed and jealous how just her apprehensions and that she cannot fear so much as there is room for her to fear my heart often misgives me  and must think i o creature so divinely excellent and so beloved of my soul those arms those incircling arms that would make a monarch happy be used to repel brutal force all their strength unavailingly perhaps exerted to repel it and to defend a person so delicately framed can violence enter into the heart of a wretch who might entitle himself to all thy willing yet virtuous love and make the blessings thou aspirest after her duty to confer  begone villainpurposes  sink ye all to the hell that could only inspire ye  and i am ready to throw myself at her feet confess my villainous designs avow my repentance and put it out of my power to act unworthily by such a peerless excellence  how then comes it that all these compassionate and as some would call them honest sensibilities go off  why miss how will tell thee she says i am the devil  by my conscience i think he has at present a great share in me  there is ingenuity  how i lay myself open to thee  but see thou not that the more i say against myself the less room there is for thee to take me to task  o belford belford i cannot cannot at least at present i cannot marry  then her family my bitter enemies  to supple to them or if i do not to make her as unhappy as she can be from my attempts   then must she love them too much me too little  she now seems to despise me miss how declares that she really does despise me to be despised by a wife  what a thought is that  to be excelled by a wife too in every part of praiseworthy knowledge  to take lessons to take instructions from a wife  more than despise me she herself has taken time to consider whether she does not hate me  i hate you lovelace with my whole heart said she to me but yesterday  my soul is above thee man  urge me not to tell thee how sincerely i think my soul above thee  how poor indeed was i then even in my own heart  so visible a superiority to so proud a spirit as mine  and here from below from below indeed i am so goaded on   yet it is poor too to think myself a machine  i am no machine  lovelace thou art base to thyself but to suppose thyself a machine  but having gone thus far i should be unhappy if after marriage in the petulance of ill humor i had it to reproach myself that i did not try her to the utmost and yet i dont know how it is but this lady the moment i come into her presence half assimilates me to her own virtue  once or twice to say nothing of her triumph over me on sunday night i was prevailed upon to fluster myself with an intention to make some advances which if obliged to recede i might lay upon raised spirits but the instant i beheld her i was soberized into awe and reverence and the majesty of her even visible purity first damped and then extinguished my double flame  what a surprisingly powerful effect so much and so long in my power she so instigated by some of her own sex and so stimulated by passion i  how can this be accounted for in a lovelace  but what a heap of stuff have i written  how have i been run away with  by what  can thou say by what  o thou lurking varletess conscience  is it thou that have thus made me of party against myself  how came thou in  in what disguise thou egregious haunter of my more agreeable hours  stand thou with fate but neuter in this controversy and if i cannot do credit to human nature and to the female sex by bringing down such an angel as this to class with and adorn it for adorn it she does in her very foibles then i am all yours and never will resist you more  here i arose i shook myself the window was open away the troublesome bosomvisiter the intruder is flown  i see it yet  i see it yet  and now it lessens to my aching eye  and now the cleft air has closed after it and it is out of sight  and once more i am  robert lovelace  letter xxix mr lovelace to john belford esquire tuesday may    well did i and but just in time conclude to have done with mrs fretchville and the house for here mennell has declared that he cannot in conscience and honor go any farther  he would not for the world be accessory to the deceiving of such a lady  i was a fool to let either you or him see her for ever since ye have both had scruples which neither would have had were a woman to have been in the question  well i cannot help it  he has however though with some reluctance consented to write me a letter provided i will allow it to he the last step he shall take in this affair  i presumed i told him that if i could make mrs fretchvilles woman supply his place he would have no objection to that  none he says  but is it not pity   a pitiful fellow such a ridiculous kind of pity his as those silly souls have who would not kill an innocent chicken for the world but when killed to their hands are always the most greedy devourers of it  now this letter gives the servant the smallpox and she has given it to her unhappy vapourish lady vapourish people are perpetual subjects for diseases to work upon name but the malady and it is theirs in a moment ever fitted for inoculation  the physical tribes milchcows  a vapourish or splenetic patient is a fiddle for the doctors and they are eternally playing upon it sweet music does it make them all their difficulty except a case extraordinary happens as poor mrs fretchvilles who has realized her apprehensions is but to hold their countenance while their patient is drawing up a bill of indictment against himself  and when they have heard it proceed to punish  the right word for prescribe why should they not when the criminal has confessed his guilt  and punish they generally do with a vengeance  yet silly toads too now i think of it for why when they know they cannot do good may they not as well endeavor to gratify as to nauseate the patients palate  were i a physician i would get all the trade to myself for malmsey and cyprus and the generous products of the cape a little disguised should be my principal doses as these would create new spirits how would the revived patient covet the physic and adore the doctor  give all the paraders of the faculty whom thou know this hint  there could but one inconvenience arise from it the apothecaries would find their medicines cost them something but the demand for quantities would answer that since the honest nurse would be the patients taster perpetually requiring repetitions of the last cordial julap  well but to the letter  yet what need of further explanation after the hints in my former the widow cannot be removed and that is enough and mennells work is over and his conscience left to plague him for his own sins and not another mans and very possibly plague enough will it give him for those  this letter is directed to robert lovelace esquire or in his absence to his lady she had refused dining with me or seeing me and i was out when it came she opened it so is my lady by her own consent proud and saucy as she is  i am glad at my heart that it came before we entirely make up she would else perhaps have concluded it to be contrived for a delay and now moreover we can accommodate our old and new quarrels together and that is contrivance you know but how is her dear haughty heart humbled to what it was when i knew her first that she can apprehend any delays from me and have nothing to do but to vex at them  i came in to dinner she sent me down the letter desiring my excuse for opening it did it before she was aware ladypride belford  recollection then retrogradation  i requested to see her upon it that moment but she desires to suspend our interview till morning i will bring her to own before i have done with her that she cannot see me too often  my impatience was so great on an occasion so unexpected that i could not help writing to tell her how much vexed i was at the accident but that it need not delay my happy day as that did not depend upon the house she knew that before she will think and so did i and as mrs fretchville by mr mennell so handsomely expressed her concern upon it and her wishes that it could suit us to bear with the unavoidable delay i hoped that going down to the lawn for two or three of the summermonths when i was made the happiest of men would be favorable to all round  the dear creature takes this incident to heart i believe and sends word to my repeated request to see her notwithstanding her denial that she cannot till the morning it shall be then at six oclock if i please  to be sure i do please  can see her but once a day now jack  did i tell thee that i wrote a letter to my cousin montague wondering that i heard not from lord m as the subject was so very interesting in it i acquainted her with the house i was about taking and with mrs fretchvilles vapourish delays  i was very loath to engage my own family either man or woman in this affair but i must take my measures securely and already they all think as bad of me as they well can you observe by my lord ms to yourself that the wellmannerd peer is afraid i should play this admirable creature one of my usual dogs tricks  i have received just now an answer from charlotte  charlotte int well a stomachdisorder  no wonder a girls stomach should plague her a single lady that is it when she has a man to plague it will have something besides itself to prey upon know thou not moreover that man is the womans sun woman is the mans earth  how dreary how desolate the earth that is deprived of the allsalubriating sunshine  poor charlotte but i heard she was not well that encouraged me to write to her and to express myself a little concerned that she had not of her own accord thought of a visit in town to my charmer  here follows a copy of her letter thou will see by it that every little monkey is to catechize me they all depend upon my goodnature  m hall may    dear cousin we have been in daily hope for a long time i must call it of hearing that the happy knot was tied my lord has been very much out of order and yet nothing would serve him but he would himself write an answer to your letter it was the only opportunity he should ever have perhaps to throw in a little good advice to you with the hope of its being of any signification and he has been several hours in a day as his gout would let him busied in it it wants now only his last revisal he hopes it will have the greater weight with you if it appear all in his own handwriting  indeed mr lovelace his worthy heart is wrapped up in you i wish you loved yourself but half as well but i believe too that if all the family loved you less you would love yourself more  his lordship has been very busy at the times he could not write in consulting pritchard about those estates which he proposes to transfer to you on the happy occasion that he may answer your letter in the most acceptable manner and show by effects how kindly he takes your invitation i assure you he is mighty proud of it  as for myself i am not at all well and have not been for some weeks past with my old stomachdisorder i had certainly else before now have done myself the honor you wonder i have not done myself my aunt lawrance who would have accompanied me for we had laid it all out has been exceedingly busy in her lawaffair her antagonist who is actually on the spot having been making proposals for an accommodation but you may assure yourself that when our dear relationelect shall be entered upon the new habitation you tell me of we will do ourselves the honor of visiting her and if any delay arises from the dear ladys want of courage which considering her man let me tell you may very well be we will endeavor to inspire her with it and be sponsors for you  for cousin i believe you have need to be christened over again before you are entitled to so great a blessing what think you  just now my lord tells me he will dispatch a man on purpose with his letter tomorrow so i need not have written but now i have let it go and by empson who sets out directly on his return to town  my best compliments and sisters to the most deserving lady in the world you will need no other direction to the person meant conclude me  your affectionate cousin and servant charl montague   thou see how seasonably this letter comes i hope my lord will write nothing but what i may show my beloved i have actually sent her up this letter of charlottes and hope for happy effects from it  the lady in her next letter gives miss how an account of what has passed between mr lovelace and herself she resents his behavior with her usual dignity but when she comes to mention mr mennells letter she reurges miss how to perfect her scheme for her deliverance being resolved to leave him but dating again on his sending up to her miss montagues letter she alters her mind and desires her to suspend for the present her application to mrs townsend  i had begun says she to suspect all he had said of mrs fretchville and her house and even mr mennell himself though so well appearing a man but now that i find mr lovelace had apprized his relations of his intention to take it and had engaged some of the ladies to visit me there i could hardly forbear blaming myself for censuring him as capable of so vile an imposture but may he not thank himself for acting so very unaccountably and taking such needleslywry steps as he has done embarassing as i told him his own meanings if they were good  letter xxx mr lovelace to john belford esquire wednesd may    he gives his friend an account of their interview that morning and of the happy effects of his cousin montagues letter in his favor her reserves however he tells him are not absolutely banished but this he imputes to form    it is not in the power of woman says he to be altogether sincere on these occasions but why  do they think it so great a disgrace to be found out to be really what they are  i regretted the illness of mrs fretchville as the intention i had to fix her dear self in the house before the happy knot was tied would have set her in that independence in appearance as well as fact which was necessary to show to all the world that her choice was free and as the ladies of my family would have been proud to make their court to her there while the settlements and our equipages were preparing but on any other account there was no great matter in it since when my happy day was over we could with so much convenience go down to the lawn or to my lord ms or to either of my aunts in town which would give full time to provide ourselves with servants and other accommodations  how sweetly the charmer listened  i asked her if she had had the smallpox  twas always a doubtful point with her mother and mrs norton she owned but although she was not afraid of it she chose not unnecessarily to rush into places where it was  right thought i  else i said it would not have been amiss for her to see the house before she went into the country for if she liked it not i was not obliged to have it  she asked if she might take a copy of miss montagues letter  i said she might keep the letter itself and send it to miss how if she pleased for that i supposed was her intention she bowed her head to me there jack  i shall have her courtesy to me byandby i question not what adevil had i to do to terrify the sweet creature by my termagant projects  yet it was not amiss i believe to make her afraid of me she says i am an unpolite man  and every polite instance from such a one is deemed a favor  talking of the settlements i told her that i had rather pritchard mentioned by my cousin charlotte had not been consulted on this occasion pritchard indeed was a very honest man and had been for a generation in the family and knew the estates and the condition of them better than either my lord or myself but pritchard like other old men was diffident and slow and valued himself upon his skill as a draughtsman and for the sake of that paltry reputation must have all his forms preserved were an imperial crown to depend upon his dispatch  i kissed her unrepulsing hand no less than five times during this conversation lord jack how my generous heart run over  she was quite obliging at parting  she in a manner asked me leave to retire to reperuse charlottes letter  i think she bent her knees to me but i will not be sure  how happy might we have both been long ago had the dear creature been always as complaisant to me for i do love respect and whether i deserved it or not always had it till i knew this proud beauty  and now belford are we in a train or the duce is in it every fortified town has its strong and its weak place i had carried on my attacks against the impregnable parts i have no doubt but i shall either shine or smuggle her out of her cloak since she and miss how have intended to employ a smuggler against me  all we wait for now is my lords letter  but i had like to have forgot to tell thee that we have been not a little alarmed by some inquiries that have been made after me and my beloved by a man of good appearance who yesterday procured a tradesman in the neighborhood to send for dorcas of whom he asked several questions relating to us and particularly as we boarded and lodged in one house whether we were married  this has given my beloved great uneasiness and i could not help observing upon it to her how right a thing it was that we had given out below that we were married the inquiry most probably i said was from her brothers quarter and now perhaps that our marriage was owned we should hear no more of his machinations the person it seems was curious to know the day that the ceremony was performed but dorcas refused to give him any other particulars than that we were married and was the more reserved as he declined to tell her the motives of his inquiry  letter xxxi mr lovelace to john belford esquire may    the devil take this uncle of mine he has at last sent me a letter which i cannot show without exposing the head of our family for a fool a confounded parcel of popguns has he let off upon me i was in hopes he had exhausted his whole stock of this sort in his letter to you  to keep it back to delay sending it till he had recollected all this farrago of nonsense  confound his wisdom of nations if so much of it is to be scraped together in disgrace of itself to make one egregious simpleton  but i am glad i am fortified with this piece of flagrant folly however since in all human affairs the convenient and inconvenient the good and the bad are so mingled that there is no having the one without the other  i have already offered the bill enclosed in it to my beloved and read to her part of the letter but she refused the bill and i being in cash shall return it she seemed very desirous to peruse the whole letter and when i told her that were it not for exposing the writer i would oblige her she said it would not be exposing his lordship to show it to her and that she always preferred the heart to the head i knew her meaning  but did not thank her for it  all that makes for me in it i will transcribe for her  yet hang it she shall have the letter and my soul with it for one consenting kiss  she has got the letter from me without the reward duce take me if i had the courage to propose the condition a new character this of bashfulness in thy friend  i see that a truly modest woman may make even a confident man keep his distance by my soul belford i believe that nine women in ten who fall fall either from their own vanity or levity or for want of circumspection and proper reserves  i did intend to take my reward on her returning a letter so favorable to us both but she sent it to me sealed up by dorcas  i might have thought that there were two or three hints in it that she would be too nice immediately to appear to i send it to thee and here will stop to give thee time to read it return it as soon as thou have perused it  letter xxxii lord m to robert lovelace esquire tuesday may    it is a long lane that has no turning  do not despise me for my proverbs  you know i was always fond of them and if you had been so too it would have been the better for you let me tell you i dare swear the fine lady you are so likely to be soon happy with will be far from despising them for i am told that she writes well and that all her letters are full of sentences god convert you for nobody but he and this lady can  i have no manner of doubt now but that you will marry as your father and all your ancestors did before you else you would have had no title to be my heir nor can your descendents have any title to be yours unless they are legitimate that is worth your remembrance sir  no man is always a fool every man sometimes  but your follies i hope are now at an end  i know you have vowed revenge against this fine ladys family but no more of that now you must look upon them all as your relations and forgive and forget and when they see you make a good husband and a good father which god send for all our sakes they will wonder at their nonsensical antipathy and beg your pardon but while they think you a vile fellow and a rake how can they either love you or excuse their daughter  and methinks i could wish to give a word of comfort to the lady who doubtless must be under great fears how she shall be able to holdin such a wild creature as you have hitherto been i would hint to her that by strong arguments and gentle words she may do any thing with you for though you are too apt to be hot gentle words will cool you and bring you into the temper that is necessary for your cure  would to god my poor lady your aunt who is dead and gone had been a proper patient for the same remedy god rest her soul no reflections upon her memory worth is best known by want i know hers now and if i had went first she would by this time have known mine  there is great wisdom in that saying god send me a friend that may tell me of my faults if not an enemy and he will not that i am your enemy and that you know well the more noble any one is the more humble so bear with me if you would be thought noble  am i not your uncle and do i not design to be better to you than your father could be nay i will be your father too when the happy day comes since you desire it and pray make my compliments to my dear niece and tell her i wonder much that she has so long deferred your happiness  pray let her know i will present her not you either my lancashire seat or the lawn in hertfordshire and settle upon her a thousand pounds a year penyrents to show her that we are not a family to take base advantages and you may have writings drawn and settle as you will  honest pritchard has the rentroll of both these estates at his fingers end and has been a good old servant i recommend him to your ladys favor i have already consulted him he will tell you what is best for you and most pleasing to me  i am still very bad with my gout but will come in a litter as soon as the day is fixed it would be the joy of my heart to join your hands and let me tell you if you do not make the best of husbands to so good a young lady and one who has had so much courage for your sake i will renounce you and settle all i can upon her and hers by you and leave you out of the question  if any thing be wanting for your further security i am ready to give it though you know that my word has always been looked upon as my bond and when the harlowes know all this let us see whether they are able to blush and take shame upon themselves  your two aunts want only to know the day to make all the country round them blaze and all their tenants mad and if any one of mine be sober upon the occasion pritchard shall eject him and on the birth of the first child if a son i will do something more for you and repeat all our rejoicings  i ought indeed to have written sooner but i knew that if you thought me long and were in haste as to your nuptials you would write and tell me so but my gout was very troublesome and i am but a slow writer you know at best for composing is a thing that though formerly i was very ready at it as my lord lexington used to say yet having left it off a great while i am not so now and i chose on this occasion to write all out of my own head and memory and to give you my best advice for i may never have such an opportunity again you have had god mend you a strange way of turning your back upon all i have said this once i hope you will be more attentive to the advice i give you for your own good  i had still another end nay two other ends  the one was that now you are upon the borders of wedlock as i may say and all your wild cats will e sown i would give you some instructions as to your public as well as private behavior in life which intending you so much good as ido you ought to hear and perhaps would never have listened to on any less extraordinary occasion  the second is that your dear ladyelect who is it seems herself so fine and so sententious a writer will see by this that it is not our faults nor for want of the best advice that you was not a better man than you have hitherto been  and now in few words for the conduct i would wish you to follow in public as well as in private if you would think me worthy of advising it shall be short so be not uneasy  as to the private life love your lady as she deserves let your actions praise you be a good husband and so give the lie to all your enemies and make them ashamed of their scandals and let us have pride in saying that miss harlowe has not done either herself or family any discredit by coming among us do this and i and your aunts will love you for ever  as to your public conduct  this is what i could wish but i reckon your ladys wisdom will put us both right  no disparagement sir since with all your wit you have not hitherto shown much wisdom you know  get into parliament as soon as you can for you have talents to make a great figure there who so proper to assist in making new holding laws as those whom no law in being could hold  then for so long as you will give attendance in st stephens chapel  its being called a chapel i hope will not disgust you i am sure i have known many a riot there  a speaker has a hard time of it but we peers have more decorum  but what was i going to say  i must go back  for so long as you will give your attendance in parliament for so long will you be out of mischief out of private mischief at least and may st stephens fate be yours if you wilfully do public mischief  when a new election comes you will have two or three boroughs you know to choose out of  but if you stay till then i had rather you were for the shire  you will have interest enough i am sure and being so handsome a man the women will make their husbands vote for you  i shall long to read your speeches i expect you will speak if occasion offers the very first day you want no courage and think highly enough of yourself and lowly enough of everybody else to speak on all occasions  as to the methods of the house you have spirit enough i fear to be too much above them take care of that  i dont so much fear your want of goodmanners to men you want no decency if they dont provoke you as to that i wish you would only learn to be as patient of contradiction from others as you would have other people be to you  although i would not have you to be a courtier neither would i have you be a malecontent i remember for i have it down what my old friend archibald hutcheson said and it was a very good saying  to mr secretary craggs i think it was  i look upon an administration as entitled to every vote i can with good conscience give it for a house of commons should not needlessly put drags upon the wheels of government and when i have not given it my vote it was with regret and for my countrys sake i wished with all my heart the measure had been such as i could have approved  and another saying he had which was this neither can an opposition neither can a ministry be always wrong to be a plumb man therefore with either is an infallible mark that that man must mean more and worse than he will own he does mean  are these sayings bad sir are they to be despised  well then why should i be despised for remembering them and quoting them as i love to do let me tell you if you loved my company more than you do you would not be the worse for it i may say so without any vanity since it is other mens wisdom and not my own that i am so fond of but to add a word or two more on this occasion and i may never have such another for you must read this through  love honest men and herd with them in the house and out of the house by whatever names they be dignified or distinguished keep good men company and you shall be of the number but did i or did i not write this before  writing at so many different times and such a quantity one may forget  you may come in for the title when i am dead and gone  god help me  so i would have you keep an equilibrium if once you get the name of being a fine speaker you may have any thing and to be sure you have naturally a great deal of elocution a tongue that would delude an angel as the women say to their sorrow some of them poor creatures  a leading man in the house of commons is a very important character because that house has the giving of money and money makes the mare to go ay and queens and kings too sometimes to go in a manner very different from what they might otherwise choose to go let me tell you  however methinks i would not have you take a place neither  it will double your value and your interest if it be believed that you will not for you will then stand in no mans way you will ha no envy but pure sterling respect and both sides w court you  for your part you will not want a plac as some others do to piece up their broken fortune if you can now live reputably upon two thousa pounds a year it will be hard if you cannot hereaft upon seven or eight  less you will not have if yo oblige me as now by marrying so fine a lady e much you will  and all this beside lady betty and lady sarahs favors  what in the name  wonder could possibly possess the proud harlowes that son that son of theirs  but for his dear sister sake i will say no more of him  i never was offered a place myself and the on one i would have taken had i been offered it wa master of the buckhounds for i loved hunting when i was young and it carries a good sound with it for us who live in the country often have i though of that excellent old adage he that eats the king goose shall be choked with his feathers i wish t the lord this was thoroughly considered by place hunters it would be better for them and for their poor families  i could say a great deal more and a equally to the purpose but really i am tired and s i doubt are you and besides i would reserve some thing for conversation  my cousins montague and my two sisters join i compliments to my niece that is to be if she would choose to have the knot tied among us pray tell her that we shall see it securely done and we will make all the country ring and blaze for a week together but so i believe i said before  if any thing farther may be needful toward promoting your reciprocal felicity let me know it and how you order about the day and all that the enclosed bill is very much at your service it is payable t sight as whatever else you may have occasion or shall be  so god bless you both and make things as convenient to my gout as you can though be it whenever it will i will hobble to you for i long to see you and my niece full as much as you and am in expection of that happy time  your most affectionate uncle m  letter xxxiii mr lovelace to john belford esquire thursday may    thou see belford how we now drive before the wind  the dear creature now comes almost at the first word whenever i desire the honor of her company i told her last night that apprehending delay from pritchards slowness i was determined to eave it to my lord to make his compliments in his wn way and had actually that afternoon put my writings into the hands of a very eminent lawyer counselor williams with directions for him to draw p settlements from my own estate and conformable o those of my own mother which i put into his hands at the same time it had been i said no small part of my concern that her frequent displeasure and our mutual misapprehensions had hindered me from advising with her before on this subject indeed ndeed my dearest life said i you have hitherto afforded me but a very thorny courtship  she was silent kindly silent for well know i that she could have recriminated upon me with a vengeance  but i was willing to see if she were not oth to disoblige me now  i comforted myself i said with the hopes that all my difficulties were over and that every past disobligation would now be uried in oblivion  now belford i have actually deposited these writings with counselor williams and i expect the draughts in a week at furthest so shall be doubly armed for if i attempt and fail these will be ready to throw in to make her have patience with me till i can try again  i have more contrivances still in embryo i could tell thee of an hundred and still hold another hundred in petto to pop in as i go along to excite thy surprise and to keep up thy attention nor rave thou at me but if thou art my friend think of miss howes letters and of her smuggling scheme all owing to my fair captives informations and incitements  am i not a villain a fool a beelzebub with them already  yet no harm done by me nor so much as attempted  every thing of this nature the dear creature answered with a downcast eye and a blushing cheek she left to me  i proposed my lords chapel for the celebration where we might have the presence of lady betty lady sarah and my two cousins montague  she seemed not to favor a public celebration and waved this subject for the present i did suppose that she would not choose to be married in public any more than me so i pressed not this matter further just then  but patterns i actually produced and a jeweller was to bring as this day several sets of jewels for her choice but the patterns she would not open she sighed at the mention of them the second patterns she said that had been offered to her see vol i p      and very peremptorily forbid the jewellers coming as well as declined my offer of getting my own mothers to be newset at least for the present  i do assure thee belford i was in earnest in all this my whole estate is nothing to me put in competition with her hopedfor favor  she then told me that she had written her opinion of my general proposals and there had expressed her mind as to clothes and jewels  but on my behavior to her for no cause that she knew of on sunday night she had torn the paper in two i earnestly pressed her to let me be favored with a sight of this paper torn as it was and after some hesitation she withdrew and sent it to me by dorcas  i perused it again it was in a manner new to me though i had read it so lately and by my soul i could hardly stand it an hundred admirable creatures i called her to myself  but i charge thee write not a word to me in her favor if thou meanest her well for if i spare her it must be all ex mero motu  you may easily suppose when i was readmitted to her presence that i ran over in her praises and in vows of gratitude and everlasting love but here is the devil she still receives all i say with reserve or if it be not with reserve she receives it so much as her due that she is not at all raised by it some women are undone by praise by flattery i myself am proud of praise  perhaps thou will say that those are most proud of it who least deserve it  as those are of riches and grandeur who are not born to either i own that it requires a soul to be superior to these foibles have i not then a soul  surely i have  let me then be considered as an exception to the rule  now have i a foundation to go upon in my terms my lord in the exuberance of his generosity mentions a thousand pounds a year penyrents this i know that were i to marry this lady he would rather settle upon her all he has a mind to settle than upon me and has even threatened that if i prove not a good husband to her he will leave all he can at his death from me to her  yet considers not that a woman so perfect can never be displeased with her husband but to his disgrace for who will blame her another reason why a lovelace should not wish to marry a clarissa  but what a pretty fellow of an uncle mine to think of making a wife independent of her emperor and a rebel of course  yet smarted himself for an error of this kind  my beloved in her torn paper mentions but two hundred pounds a year for her separate use i insisted upon her naming a larger sum she said it might then be three and i for fear she should suspect very large offers named five and the entire disposal of all arrears in her fathers hands for the benefit of mrs norton or whom she pleased  she said that the good woman would be uneasy if any thing more than a competency were done for her she was for suiting all her dispositions of this kind she said to the usual way of life of the person to go beyond it was but to put the benefited upon projects or to make them awkward in a new state when they might shine in that they were accustomed to and to put it into so good a mothers power to give her son a beginning in his business at a proper time yet to leave her something for herself to set her above want or the necessity of taking back from her child what she had been enabled to bestow upon him would be the height of such a worthy parents ambition  here is prudence here is judgment in so young a creature how do i hate the harlowes for producing such an angel  o why why did she refuse my sincere address to tie the knot before we came to this house  but yet what mortifies my pride is that this exalted creature if i were to marry her would not be governed in her behavior to me by love but by generosity merely or by blind duty and had rather live single than be mine  i cannot bear this i would have the woman whom i honor with my name if ever i confer this honor upon any forego even her superior duties for me i would have her look after me when i go out as far as she can see me as my rosebud after her johnny and meet me at my return with rapture i would be the subject of her dreams as well as of her waking thoughts i would have her look upon every moment lost that is not passed with me sing to me read to me play to me when i pleased no joy so great as in obeying me when i should be inclined to love overwhelm me with it when to be serious or solitary if intrusive awfully so retiring at a nod approaching me only if i smiled encouragement steal into my presence with silence out of it if not noticed on tiptoe be a lady easy to all my pleasures and valuing those most who most contributed to them only sighing in private that it was not herself at the time  thus of old did the contending wives of the honest patriarchs each recommending her handmaid to her lord as she thought it would oblige him and looking upon the genial product as her own  the gentle waller says women are born to be controlled gentle as he was he knew that a tyranthusband makes a dutiful wife and why do the sex love rakes but because they know how to direct their uncertain wills and manage them  another agreeable conversation the day of days the subject as to fixing a particular one that need not be done till the settlements are completed as to marrying at my lords chapel the ladies of my family present that would be making a public affair of it and my charmer observed with regret that it seemed to be my lords intention to make it so  it could not be imagined i said but that his lordships setting out in a litter and coming to town as well as his taste for glare and the joy he would take to see me married at last would give it as much the air of a public marriage as if the ceremony were performed at his own chapel all the ladies present  she could not bear the thoughts of a public day it would carry with it an air of insult upon her whole family and for her part if my lord would not take it amiss and perhaps he would not as the motion came not from himself but from me she would very willingly dispense with his lordships presence the rather as dress and appearance would then be unnecessary for she could not bear to think of decking her person while her parents were in tears  how excellent this did not her parents richly deserve to be in tears  see belford with so charming a niceness we might have been a long time ago upon the vege of the state and yet found a great deal to do before we entered into it  all obedience all resignation  no will but hers i withdrew and wrote directly to my lord and she not disapproving of it sent it away the purport as follows for i took no copy  that i was much obliged to his lordship for his intended goodness to me on an occasion that was the most solemn and awful of my life that the admirable lady whom he so justly praised thought his lordships proposals in her favor too high that she chose not to make a public appearance if without disobliging my friends she could avoid it till a reconciliation with her own could be effected that although she expressed a grateful sense of his lordships consent to give her to me with his own hand yet presuming that the motive to his kind intention was rather to do her honor than that it otherwise would have been his own choice especially as traveling would be at this time so inconvenient to him she thought it advisable to save his lordship trouble on this occasion and hoped he would take as meant her declining the favor  the lawn i tell him will be most acceptable to retire to and still the more as it is so to his lordship  but if he pleases the jointure may be made from my own estate leaving to his lordships goodness the alternative  that i had offered to present to the lady his lordships bill but on her declining to accept of it having myself no present occasion for it i returned it enclosed with my thanks etc  and is not this going a plaguey length what a figure should i make in rakish annals if at last i should be caught in my own gin  the sex may say what they will but a poor innocent fellow had need to take great care of himself when he dances upon the edge of the matrimonial precipice many a fainthearted man when he began in jest or only designed to ape gallantry has been forced into earnest by being overprompt and taken at his word not knowing how to own that he meant less than the lady supposed he meant i am the better enabled to judge that this must have been the case of many a sneaking varlet because i who know the female world as well as any man in it of my standing am so frequently in doubt of myself and know not what to make of the matter  then these little sly rogues how they lie couchant ready to spring upon us harmless fellows the moment we are in their reach  when the ice is once broken for them how swiftly can they make to port  meantime the subject they can least speak to they most think of nor can you talk of the ceremony before they have laid out in their minds how it is all to be  little saucyface designers how first they draw themselves in then us  but be all these things as they will lord m never in his life received so handsome a letter as this from his nephew  the lady after having given to miss how the particulars which are contained in mr lovelaces last letter thus expresses herself  a principal consolation arising from these favorable appearances is that i who have now but one only friend shall most probably and if it be not my own fault have as many new ones as there are persons in mr lovelaces family and this whether mr lovelace treat me kindly or not and who knows but that by degrees those new friends by their rank and merit may have weight enough to get me restored to the favor of my relations till which can be effected i shall not be tolerably easy happy i never expect to be mr lovelaces mind sand mine are vastly different different in essentials  but as matters are at present circumstanced i pray you my dear friend to keep to yourself every thing that revealed might bring discredit to him  better anybody expose a husband than a wife if i am to be so and what is said by you will be thought to come from me  it shall be my constant prayer that all the felicities which this world can afford may be yours and that the almighty will never suffer you nor yours to the remotest posterity to want such a friend as my anna how has been to  her clarissa harlowe   mr lovelace to show the wantonness of his invention in his next gives his friend an account of a scheme he had framed to be revenged on miss how when she set out for the isle of wight which he heard she was to do accompanied by her mother and mr hickman in order to visit a rich aunt there who desired to see her and her future consort before she changed her name but as he does not intend to carry it into execution it is omitted  letter xxxiv mr lovelace to john belford esquire if belford thou likest not my plot upon miss how i have three or four more as good in my own opinion better perhaps they will be in thine and so it is but getting loose from thy present engagement and thou shall pick and choose but as for thy three brethren they must do as i would have them and so indeed must thou  else why am i your general  but i will refer this subject to its proper season thou know that i never absolutely conclude upon a project till it is time for execution and then lightning strikes not quicker than i  and now to the subject next my heart  will thou believe me when i tell thee that i have so many contrivances rising up and crouding upon me for preference with regard to my gloriana that i hardly know which to choose  i could tell thee of no less than six princely ones any of which must do but as the dear creature has not grudged giving me trouble i think i ought not in gratitude to spare combustibles for her but on the contrary to make her stare and stand aghast by springing three or four mines at once  thou remembrest what shakespeare in his troilus and cressida makes hector who however is not used to boast say to achilles in an interview between them and which applied to this watchful lady and to the vexation she has given me and to the certainty i now think i have of subduing her will run thus  supposing the charmer before me and i meditating her sweet person from head to foot henceforth o watchful fair one guard thee well for i will not kill thee there nor there nor there but by the zone that circles venus waist i will kill thee evrywhere yea over and over thou wisest belford pardon me this brag her watchfulness draws folly from my lips but i will endeavor deeds to match the words or may i never  then i imagine thee interposing to qualify my impatience as ajax did to achilles  do not chafe thee cousin  and let these threats alone till accident or purpose bring thee to it   and now jack what do think  that thou art a cursed fellow if   if no ifs  but i shall be very sick tomorrow i shall faith  sick  why sick  what a devil should thou be sick for  for more good reasons than one belford  i should be glad to hear but one  sick quotha of all thy roguish inventions i should not have thought of this  perhaps thou think my view to be to draw the lady to my bedside that is a trick of three or four thousand years old and i should find it much more to my purpose if i could get to here is however i will condescend to make thee as wise as myself  i am excessively disturbed about this smuggling scheme of miss how i have no doubt that my fair one will fly from me if she can were i to make an attempt and miscarry i once believed she loved me but now i doubt whether she does or not at least that it is with such an ardor as miss how calls it as will make her overlook a premeditated fault should i be guilty of one  and what will being sick do for thee  have patience i dont intend to be so very bad as dorcas shall represent me to be but yet i know i shall reach confoundedly and bring up some clotted blood to be sure i shall break a vessel there is no doubt of that and a bottle of eatons styptic shall be sent for but no doctor if she has humanity she will be concerned but if she has love let it have been pushed ever so far back it will on this occasion come forward and show itself not only in her eye but in every line of her sweet face  i will be very intrepid i will not fear death or any thing else i will be sure of being well in an hour or two having formerly found great benefit by this balsamic medicine on occasion of an inward bruise by a fall from my horse in hunting of which perhaps this malady may be the remains and this will show her that though those about me may make the most of it i dont and so can have no design in it  well methinks thou say i begin to think tolerably of this device  i knew thou would when i explained myself another time prepare to wonder and banish doubt  now belford if she be not much concerned at the broken vessel which in one so fiery in his temper as i have the reputation to be thought may be very dangerous a malady that i shall calmly attribute to the harasses and doubts that i have labored under for some time past which will be a further proof of my love and will demand a grateful return   what then thou egregious contriver  why then i shall have the less remorse if i am to use a little violence for can she deserve compassion who shows none  and what if she show a great deal of concern  then shall i be in hope of building on a good foundation love hides a multitude of faults and diminishes those it cannot hide love when found out or acknowleged authorizes freedom and freedom begets freedom and i shall then see how far i can go  well but lovelace how the duce will thou with that full health and vigor of constitution and with that bloom in thy face make anybody believe thou art sick  how  why take a few grains of ipecacuanha enough to make me reach like a fury  good  but how will thou manage to bring up blood and not hurt thyself  foolish fellow are there not pigeons and chickens in every poulterers shop  cry thy mercy  but then i will be persuaded by mrs sinclair that i have of late confined myself too much and so will have a chair called and be carried to the park where i will try to walk half the length of the mall or so and in my return amuse myself at whites or the cocoa  and what will this do  questioning again  i am afraid you are an infidel belford  why then shall i not know if my beloved offers to go out in my absence  and shall i not se whether she receives me with tenderness at my return but this is not all i have a foreboding that something affecting will happen while i am out but of this more in its place  and now belford will thou or will thou not allow that it is a right thing to be sick  lord jack so much delight do i take in my contrivances that i shall be halfsorry when the occasion for them is over for never never shall i again have such charming exercise for my invention  mean time these plaguey women are so impertinent so full of reproaches that i know not how to do any thing but curse them and then truly they are for helping me out with some of their trite and vulgar artifices  sally particularly who pretends to be a mighty contriver has just now in an insolent manner told me on my rejecting her proffered aids that i had no mind to conquer and that i was so wicked as to intend to marry though i would not own it to her  because this little devil made her first sacrifice at my altar she thinks she may take any liberty with me and what makes her outrageous at times is that i have for a long time studiously as she says slighted her too readily offered favors but is it not very impudent in her to think that i will be any mans successor it is not come to that neither this thou know was always my rule  once any other mans and i know it and never more mine it is for such as thou and thy brethren to take up with harlots i have been always aiming at the merit of a first discoverer  the more devil i perhaps thou wilt say to endeavor to corrupt the uncorrupted  but i say not since hence i have but very few adulteries to answer for  one affair indeed at paris with a married lady i believe i never told thee of it touched my conscience a little yet brought on by the spirit of intrigue more than by sheer wickedness i will give it thee in brief  a french marquis somewhat in years employed by his court in a public function at that of madrid had put his charming young newmarried wife under the control and wardship as i may say of his insolent sister an old prude  i saw the lady at the opera i liked her at first sight and better at second when i knew the situation she was in so pretending to make my addresses to the prude got admittance to both  the first thing i had to do was to compliment my prude into shyness by complaints of shyness next to take advantage of the marquises situation between her husbands jealousy and his sisters arrogance to inspire her with resentment and as i hoped with a regard to my person the frenc ladies have no dislike to intrigue  the sister began to suspect me the lady had no mind to part with the company of the only man who had been permitted to visit there and told me of her sisters suspicions  i put her upon concealing the prude as if unknown to me in a closet in one of her own apartments locking her in and putting the key in her own pocket and she was to question me on the sincerity of my professions to her sister in her sisters hearing  she complied my mistress was locked up the lady and i took our seats i owned fervent love and made high professions for the marquise put it home to me the prude was delighted with what she heard  and how do think it ended  i took my advantage of the lady herself who durst not for her life cry out drew her after me to the next apartment on pretense of going to seek her sister who all the time was locked up in the closet  no woman ever gave me a private meeting for nothing my dearest miss harlowe excepted  my ingenuity obtained my pardon the lady being unable to forbear laughing through the whole affair to find both so uncommonly tricked her gaoleress her prisoner safe locked up and as much pleased as either of us  the english jack do not often outwit the french  we had contrivances afterward equally ingenious in which the lady the ice once broken  once subdued always subdued cooperated  but a more tender telltale revealed the secret  revealed it before the marquis could come to cover the disgrace the sister was inveterate the husband irreconcilable in every respect unfit for a husband even for a french one  made perhaps more delicate to these particulars by the customs of a people among whom he was then resident so contrary to those of his own countrymen she was obliged to throw herself into my protection  nor thought herself unhappy in it till childbed pangs seized her then penitence and death overtook her in the same hour  excuse a tear belford  she deserved a better fate what has such a vile inexorable husband to answer for  the sister was punished effectually that pleases me on reflection the sister was punished effectually  but perhaps i have told thee this story before  letter xxxv mr lovelace to john belford esquire friday evening just returned from an airing with my charmer complied with after great importunity she wa attended by the two nymphs they both toppd their parts kept their eyes within bounds made moral reflections nowandthen o jack what devils are women when all tests are got over and we have completely ruined them  the coach carried us to hamstead to highgate to muzzlehill back to hamstead to the upperflask there in compliment to the nymphs my beloved consented to alight and take a little refection then home early by kentish town  delightfully easy she and so respectful and obliging i all the way and as we walked out upon the heath to view the variegated prospects which that agreeable elevation affords that she promised to take nowandthen a little excursion with me i think miss how  i think said i to myself every nowandthen as we walked that thy wicked devices are superseded  we have both been writing ever since we cam home i am to be favored with her company  an hour before she retires to rest  all that obsequious love can suggest in order to engage her tenderest sentiments for me against tomorrows sickness will i aim at when we meet but at parting will complain of a disorder in my stomach  we have met all was love and unexceptionable respect on my part ease and complaisance on hers she was concerned for my disorder so sudden  just as we parted but it was nothing i should be quite well by morning  faith jack i think i am sick already  is it possible for such a giddy fellow as me to persuade myself to be ill i am a better mimic at this rate than i wish to be but every nerve and fiber of me is always ready to contribute its aid whether by health or by ailment to carry a resolved on roguery into execution  dorcas has transcribed for me the whole letter of miss how dated sunday may    letter x of this vol p     of which before i had only extracts but she found no other letter added to that parcel but this and that which i copied myself in character last sunday while she was at church relating to the smuggling scheme letter xxii p  0  are enough for me  dorcas tells me that her lady has been removing her papers from the mahoganychest into a wainscotox which held her linen and which she put into her dark closet we have no key of that at present no doubt but all her letters previous to those i have come at are in that box dorcas is uneasy upon it yet hopes that her lady does not suspect her for she is sure that she laid in every thing as she found it  letter xxxvi mr lovelace to john belford esquire cocoatree saturday may    this ipecacuanha is a most disagreeable medicine that these cursed physical folks can find out nothing to do us good but what would poison the devil in the other world were they only to take physic it would be punishment enough of itself for a misspent life a doctor at one elbow and an apothecary at the other and the poor soul laboring under their prescribed operations he need no worse tormentors  but now this was to take down my countenance it has done it for with violent reachings having taken enough to make me sick and not enough water to carry it off i presently looked as if i had kept my bed a fortnight illjesting as i thought in the midst of the exercise with edgetools and worse with physical ones  two hours it held me i had forbid dorcas to let my beloved know any thing of the matter out of tenderness to her being willing when she knew my prohibition to let her see that i expected her to be concerned for me  what a worthless fellow must he be whose own heart gives him up as deserving of no ones regard  well but dorcas nevertheless is a woman and she can whisper to her lady the secret she is enjoined to keep  come hither you toad sick as a devil at the instant let me see what a mixture of grief and surprise may be beat up together in thy puddenface  that will not do that dropped jaw and mouth dstended into the long oval is more upon the horrible than the grievous  nor that pinking and winking with thy odious eyes as my charmer once called them  a little better that yet not quite right but keep your mouth closer you have a muscle or two which you have no command of between your cheekbone and your lips that should carry one corner of your mouth up toward your crowsfoot and that down to meet it  there begone be in a plaguey hurry running up stairs and down to fetch from the dining room what you carry up on purpose to fetch till motion extraordinary put you out of breath and give you the sighnatural  what is the matter dorcas  nothing madam  my beloved wonders she has not seen me this morning no doubt but is too shy to say she wonders repeated what is the matters however as dorcas runs up and down stairs by her door bring on oh madam my master  my master  what how when  and all the monosyllables of surprise  within parenthesis let me tell thee that i have often thought that the little words in the republic of letters like the little folks in a nation are the most significant the trisyllables and the rumblers of syllables more than three are but the good for little magnates  i must not tell you madam  my master ordered me not to tell you  but he is in a worse way than he thinks for  but he would not have you frighted  high concern took possession of every sweet feature she pitied me  by my soul she pitied me  where is he  too much in a hurry for good manners another parenthesis jack good manners are so little natural that we ought to be composed to observe them politeness will not live in a storm i cannot stay to answer questions cries the wench  though desirous to answer a third parenthesis  like the people crying proclamations running away from the customers they want to sell to this hurry puts the lady in a hurry to ask a fourth by way of embellishing the third as the other does the people in a hurry to buy and i have in my eye now a whole street raised and running after a proclamation or express crier as if the first was a thief the other his pursuers  at last o lord let mrs lovelace know  there is danger to be sure whispered from one nymph to another in her hearing but at the door and so loud that my listening fair one might hear  out she darts  as how as how dorcas  o madam  a vomiting of blood a vessel broke to be sure  down she hastens finds every one as busy over my blood in the entry as if it were that of the neapolitan saint  in steps my charmer with a face of sweet concern  how do you mr lovelace  o my best love  very well  very well  nothing at all nothing of consequence  i shall be well in an instant  straining again for i was indeed plaguey sick though no more blood came  in short belford i have gained my end i see the dear soul loves me i see she forgives me all that is past i see i have credit for a new score  miss how i defy thee my dear  mrs townsend  who the devil are you  troop away with your contrabands no smuggling nor smuggler but myself nor will the choicest of my fair ones favors be long prohibited goods to me  every one now is sure that she loves me tears were in her eyes more than once for me she suffered me to take her hand and kiss it as often as i pleased on mrs sinclairs mentioning that i too much confined myself she pressed me to take an airing but obligingly desired me to be careful of myself wished i would advise with a physician god made physicians she said  i did not think that jack god indeed made us all but i fansy she meant physic instead of physicians and then the phrase might mean what the vulgar phrase means  god sends meat the devil cooks  i was well already on taking the styptic from her dear hands  on her requiring me to take the air i asked if i might have the honor of her company in a coach and this that i might observe if she had an intention of going out in my absence  if she thought a chair were not a more proper vehicle for my case she would with all her heart  there is a precious  i kissed her hand again she was all goodness  would to heaven i better deserved it i said  but all were golden days before us  her presence and generous concern had done every thing i was well nothing ailed me but since my beloved will have it so i will take a little airing  let a chair be called  o my charmer  were i to have owed this indisposition to my late harasses and to the uneasiness i have had for disobliging you all is infinitely compensated by your goodness  all the art of healing is in your smiles  your late displeasure was the only malady  while mrs sinclair and dorcas and polly and even poor silly mabell for sally went out as my angel came in with uplifted hands and eyes stood thanking heaven that i was better in audible whispers see the power of love cried one  what a charming husband another  happy couple all  o how the dear creatures cheek mantled  how her eyes sparkled  how sweetly acceptable is praise to conscious merit while it but reproaches when applied to the undeserving  what a new what a gay creation it makes at once in a diffident or dispirited heart   and now belford was it not worth while to be sick and yet i must tell thee that too many pleasanter expedients offer themselves to make trial any more of this confounded ipecacuanha  letter xxxvii miss clarissa harlowe to miss how saturday may    mr lovelace my dear has been very ill suddenly taken with a vomiting of blood in great quantities some vessel broken he complained of a disorder in his stomach overnight i was the more affected with it as i am afraid it was occasioned by the violent contentions between us  but was i in fault  how lately did i think i hated him  but hatred and anger i see are but temporary passions with me one cannot my dear hate people in danger of death or who are in distress or affliction my heart i find is not proof against kindness and acknowlegement of errors committed  he took great care to have his illness concealed from me as long as it could so tender in the violence of his disorder  so desirous to make the best of it  i wish he had not been ill in my sight i was too much affected  everybody alarming me with his danger  the poor man from such high health so suddenly taken  and so unprepared   he is gone out in a chair i advised him to do so i fear that my advice was wrong since quiet in such a disorder must needs be best we are apt to be so ready in cases of emergency to give our advice without judgment or waiting for it  i proposed a physician indeed but he would not hear of one i have great honor for the faculty and the greater as i have always observed that those who treat the professors of the art of healing contemptuously too generally treat higher institutions in the same manner  i am really very uneasy for i have i doubt exposed myself to him and to the women below they indeed will excuse me as they think us married but if he be not generous i shall have cause to regret this surprise which has taught me more than i knew of myself as i had reason to think myself unaccountably treated by him  nevertheless let me tell you what i hope i may justly tell you that if again he give me cause to resume distance and reserve i hope my reason will gather strength enough from his imperfections for mr lovelace my dear is not a wise man in all his ways to enable me to keep my passions under  what can we do more than govern ourselves by the temporary lights lent us  you will not wonder that i am grave on this detection  detection must i call it what can i call it  i have not had heartsease enough to inspect that heart as i ought  dissatisfied with myself i am afraid to look back upon what i have written and yet know not how to have done writing i never was in such an odd frame of mind  i know not how to describe it  was you ever so  afraid of the censure of her i love  yet not conscious that i deserve it  of this however i am convinced that i should indeed deserve censure if i kept any secret of my heart from you  but i will not add another word after i have assured you that i will look still more narrowly into myself and that i am  your equally sincere and affectionate clarissa harlowe  letter xxxviii mr lovelace to john belford esquire sat evening i had a charming airing no return of my malady my heart perfectly easy how could my stomach be otherwise  but when i came home i found that my sweet soul had been alarmed by a new incident the inquiry after us both in a very suspicious manner and that by description of our persons and not by names by a servant in a blue livery turned up and trimmed with yellow  dorcas was called to him as the upper servant and she refusing to answer any of his questions unless he told his business and from whom he came the fellow as short as she said that if she would not answer him perhaps she might answer somebody else and went away out of humor  dorcas hurried up to her lady and alarmed her not only with the fact but with her own conjectures adding that he was an illlooking fellow and she was sure could come for no good  the livery and the features of the servant were particularly inquired after and as particularly described  lord bless her no end of her alarms she thought and then was she aforehand with every evil that could happen  she wished mr lovelace would come in  mr lovelace came in soon after all lively grateful full of hopes of duty of love to thank his charmer and to congratulate with her upon the cure she had performed and then she told the story with all its circumstances and dorcas to point her ladys fears told us that the servant was a sunburned fellow and look as if he had been at sea  he was then no doubt captain singletons servant and the next news she should hear was the the house was surrounded by a whole ships crew the vessel lying no farther off as she understood than rotherhith  impossible i said such an attempt would not be ushered in by such a manner of inquiry and why may it not rather be a servant of your cousin mordens with notice of his arrival and of his design to attend you  this surmize delighted her her apprehensions went off and she was at leisure to congratulate me upon my sudden recovery which she did in the most obliging manner  but we had not sat long together when dorcas again came fluttering up to tell us that the footman the very footman was again at the door and inquired whether mr lovelace and his lady by name had no lodgings in this house he asked he told dorcas for no harm but this was a demonstration with my apprehensive fairone that harm was intended and as the sellow had not been answered by dorcas i proposed to go down to the streetparlour and hear what he had to say  i see your causeless terror my dearest life said i and your impatience  will you be pleased to walk down  and without being observed as he shall come no farther than the parlourdoor you may hear all that passes  she consented we went down dorcas bid the man come forward  well friend what is your business with mr or mrs lovelace  bowing scraping i am sure you are the gentleman sir why sir my business is only to know if your honor be here and to be spoke with or it you shall be here for any time  who came you from  from a gentleman who ordered me to say if i was made to tell but not else it was from a friend of mr john harlowes mrs lovelaces eldest uncle  the dear creature was ready to sink upon this it was but of late that she had provided herself with salts she pulled them out  do you know any thing of colonel morden friend said i  no i never heard of his name  of captain singleton  no sir but the gentleman my master is a captain too  what is his name  i dont know if i should tell  there can be no harm in telling the gentlemans name if you come upon a good account  that i do for my master told me so and there is not an honester gentleman on the face of gods earth  his name is captain tomlinson sir  i dont know such a one  i believe not sir he was pleased to say he dont know your honor sir but i heard him say as how he should not be an unwelcome visitor to you for all that  do you know such a man as captain tomlinson my dearest life aside your uncles friend  no but my uncle may have acquaintance no doubt that i dont know  but i hope trembling this is not a trick  well friend if your master has any thing to say to mr lovelace you may tell him that mr lovelace is here and will give him a meeting whenever he pleases  the dear creature looked as if afraid that my engagement was too prompt for my own safety and away went the fellow  i wondering that she might not wonder that this captain tomlinson whoever he was came not himself or sent not a letter the second time when he had reason to suppose that i might be here  mean time for fear that this should be a contriveance of james harlowes who i said loved plotting though he had not a head turned for it i gave some precautionary directions to the servants and the women whom for the greater parade i assembled before us and my beloved was resolved not to stir abroad till she saw the issue of this odd affair  and here must i close though in so great a puzzle  only let me add that poor belton wants thee for i dare not stir for my life  mowbray and tourville skulk about like vagabonds without heads without hands without souls having neither thee nor me to conduct them they tell me they shall rust beyond the power of oil or action to brighten them up or give them motion  how goes it with thy uncle  letter xxxix mr lovelace to john belford esquire sunday may    this story of captain tomlinson employed us not only for the time we were together last night but all the while we sat at breakfast this morning she would still have it that it was the prelude to some mischief from singleton i insisted that it might much more probably be a method taken by colonel morden to alarm her previous to a personal visit traveled gentlemen affected to surprise in this manner and why dearest creature said i must every thing that happens which we cannot immediately account for be what we least wish  she had had so many disagreeable things befall her of late that her fears were too often stronger than her hopes  and this madam makes me apprehensive that you will get into so lowspirited a way that you will not be able to enjoy the happiness that seems to await us  her duty and her gratitude she gravely said to the dispenser of all good would secure her she hoped against unthankfulness and a thankful spirit was the same as a joyful one  so belford for all her future joys she depends entirely upon the invisible good she is certainly right since those who fix least upon second causes are the least likely to be disappointed  and is not this gravity for her gravity  she had hardly done speaking when dorcas came running up in a hurry  she set even my heart into a palpitation  thump thump thump like a precipitated pendulum in a clockcase  flutter flutter flutter my charmers as by her sweet bosom rising to her chin i saw  this lower class of people my beloved herself observed were for ever aiming at the stupid wonderful and for making even common incidents matter of surprise  why the devil said i to the wench this alarming hurry  and with your spread fingers and your o madams and o sirs  and be cursed to you would there have been a second of time difference had you come up slowly  captain tomlinson sir  captain devilson what care i  do you see how you have disordered your lady  good mr lovelace said my charmer trembling see jack when she has an end to serve i am good mr lovelace if  if my brother  if captain singleon should appear  pray now  i beseech you  let me beg of you  to govern your temper  my brother is my brother  captain singleton is but an gent  my dearest life folding my arms about her when she asks favors thought i the devils in it if she will not allow of such innocent freedoms as this from good mr lovelace too you shall be witness of all that passes between us dorcas desire the gentleman to walk up  let me retire to my chamber first let me not be known to be in the house  charming dear  thou see belford she is afraid of leaving me  o the little witchcrafts were it not for surprise nowandthen how would an honest man know where to have them  she withdrew to listen  and though this incident has not turned out to answer all i wished from it yet is it necessary if i would acquaint thee with my whole circulation to be very particular in what passed between captain tomlinson and me  enter captain tomlinson in a ridingdress whip in hand  your servant sir  mr lovelace i presume  my name is lovelace sir  excuse the day sir  be pleased to excuse my garb i am obliged to go out of town directly that i may return at night  the day is a good day your garb needs no apology  when i sent my servant i did not know that i should find time to do myself this honor all that i thought i could do to oblige my friend this journey was only to assure myself of your abode and whether there was a probability of being admitted to your speech or to your ladys  sir you know best your own motives what your time will permit you to do you also best know and here i am attending your pleasure  my charmer owned afterward her concern on my being so short whatever i shall mingle of her emtions thou will easily guess i had afterward  sir i hope no offense i intend none  none  none at all sir  sir i have no interest in the affair i come about i may appear officious and if i thought i should i would decline any concern in it after i have just hinted what it is  and what pray sir is it  may i ask you sir without offense whether you wish to be reconciled and to cooperate upon honorable terms with one gentleman of the name of harlowe preparative as it may be hoped to a general reconciliation  o how my heart fluttered cried my charmer  i cannot tell sir  and then it fluttered still more no doubt the whole family have used me extremely ill they have taken greater liberties with my character than are justifiable and with my family too which i can less forgive  sir sir i have done i beg pardon for this intrusion  my beloved then was ready to sink and thought very hardly of me  but pray sir to the immediate purpose of your present commission since a commission it seems to be  it is a commission sir andsuch a one as i thought would be agreeable to all parties or i should not have given myself concern about it  perhaps it may sir when known but let me ask you one previous question do you know colonel morden sir  no sir if you mean personally i do not but i have heard my good friend mr john harlowe talk of him with great respect and as a cotrustee with him in a certain trust  i thought it probable sir said i that the colonel might be arrived that you might be a gentleman of his acquaintance and that something of an agreeable surprise might be intended  had colonel morden been in england mr john harlowe would have known it and then i should not have been a stranger to it  well but sir have you then any commission to me from mr john harlowe  sir i will tell you as briefly as i can the whole of what i have to say but you will excuse me also a previous question for which curiosity is not my motive but it is necessary to be answered before i can proceed as you will judge when you hear it  what pray sir is your question  briefly whether you are actually and bona fide married to miss clarissa harlowe  i started and in a haughty tone is this sir a question that must be answered before you can proceed in the business you have undertaken  i mean no offense mr lovelace mr harlowe sought to me to undertake this office i have daughters and nieces of my own i thought it a good office or i who have many considerable affairs upon my hands had not accepted of it i know the world and will take the liberty to say that if that young lady   captain tomlinson i think you are called  my name is tomlinson  why then captain tomlinson no liberty as you call it will be taken well that is not extremely delicate when that lady is mentioned  when you had heard me out mr lovelace and had found i had so behaved as to make the caution necessary it would have been just to have given it  allow me to say i know what is due to the character of a woman of virtue as well as any man alive  why sir why captain tomlinson you seem warm if you intend anything by this  o how i trembled said the lady when she took notice of this part of our conversation afterward i will only say that this is a privileged place it is at present my home and an asylum for any gentleman who thinks it worth his while to inquire after me be the manner or end of his inquiry what it will  i know not sir that i have given occasion for this i make no scruple to attend you elsewhere if i am troublesome here i was told i had a warm young gentleman to deal with but as i knew my intention and that my commission was an amicable one i was the less concerned about that i am twice your age mr lovelace i dare say but i do assure you that if either my message or my manner give you offense i can suspend the one or the other for a day or for ever as you like and so sir any time before eight tomorrow morning you will let me know your further commands  and was going to tell me where he might be found  captain tomlinson said i you answer well i love a man of spirit have you not been in the army  i have sir but have turned my sword into a ploughshare as the scripture has it  there was a clever fellow jack  he was a good man with somebody i warrant  and all my delight added he for some years past has been in cultivating my paternal estate i love a brave man mr lovelace as well as ever i did in my life but let me tell you sir that when you come to my time of life you will be of opinion that there is not so much true bravery in youthful choler as you may now think there is  a clever fellow again belford  ear and heart both at once he took in my charmer  it is well she says there are some men who have wisdom in their anger  well captain that is reproof for reproof so we are upon a foot and now give me the pleasure of hearing your commission  sir you must first allow me to repeat my question are you really and bona fide married to miss clarissa harlowe or are you not yet married  bluntly put captain but if i answer that i am what then  why then sir i shall say that you are a man of honor  that i hope i am whether you say it or not captain tomlinson  sir i will be very frank in all i have to say on this subject  mr john harlowe has lately found out that you and his niece are both in the same lodgings that you have been long so and that the lady was at the play with you yesterday was seennight and he hopes that you are actually married he has indeed heard that you are but as he knows your enterprizing temper and that you have declared that you disdain a relation to their family he is willing by me to have your marriage confirmed from your own mouth before he takes the steps he is inclined to take in his nieces favor you will allow me to say mr lovelace that he will not be satisfied with an answer that admits of the least doubt  let me tell you captain tomlinson that it is a damned degree of vileness for any man to suppose   sir  mr lovelace  dont put yourself into a passion the ladys relations are jealous of the honor of their family they have prejudices to overcome as well as you  advantage may have been taken  and the lady at the time not to blame  this lady sir could give no such advantages and if she had what must the man be captain tomlinson who could have taken them  do you know the lady sir  i never had the honor to see her but once and that was at church and should not know her again  not know her again sir  i thought that there was not a man living who had once seen her and would not know her among a thousand  i remember sir that i thought i never saw a finer woman in my life but mr lovelace i believe you will allow that it is better that her relations should have wronged you than you the lady i hope sir you will permit me to repeat my question  enter dorcas in a hurry  a gentleman this minute sir desires to speak with your honor  my lady sir  aside  could the dear creature put dorcas upon telling this fib yet want to save me one   desire the gentleman to walk into one of the parlours i will wait on him presently   exit dorcas  the dear creature i doubted not wanted to instruct me how to answer the captains homeput i knew how i intended to answer it  plumb thou may be sure  but dorcass message staggered me and yet i was upon one of my masterstrokes  which was to take advantage of the captains inquiries and to make her own her marriage before him as she had done to the people below and if she had been brought to that to induce her for her uncles satisfaction to write him a letter of gratitude which of course must have been signed clarissa lovelace i was loath therefore thou may believe to attend her sudden commands and yet afraid of pushing matters beyond recovery with her i thought proper to lead him from the question to account for himself for mr harlowes coming at the knowledge of where we are and for other particulars which i knew would engage her attention and which might possibly convince her of the necessity there was for her to acquiesce in the affirmative i was disposed to give and this for her own sake for what as i asked her afterward is it to me whether i am ever reconciled to a family i must for ever despise  you think captain that i have answered doubtfully to the question you have put you may think so and you must know that i have a good deal of pride and only that you are a gentleman and seem in this affair to be governed by generous principles or i should ill brook being interrogated as to my honor to a lady so dear to me  but before i answer more directly to the point pray satisfy me in a question or two that i shall put to you  with all my heart sir ask me what questions you please i will answer them with sincerity and candor  you say that mr harlowe has found out that we were at a play together and that we are both in the same lodgings  how pray came he at his knowledge  for let me tell you that i have for certain considerations not respecting myself condescended that our abode should be kept secret and this has been so strictly observed that even miss how though she and my beloved correspond knows not directly whither to send to us  why sir the person who saw you at the play was a tenant of mr john harlowe he watched all your motions when the play was done he followed your coach to your lodgings and early the next day sunday he took horse and acquainted his landlord with what he had observed  how oddly things come about captain tomlinson  but does any other of the harlowes know where we are  it is an absolute secret to every other person of the family and so it is intended to be kept as also that mr john harlowe is willing to enter into treaty with you by me if his niece be actually married for perhaps he is aware that he shall have difficulty enough with some people to bring about the desirable reconciliation although he could give them this assurance  i doubt it not captain  to james harlowe is all the family folly owing  fine fools  heroically stalking about to be governed by one to whom malice and not genius gives the busy liveliness that distinguishes him from a natural  but how long pray sir has mr john harlowe been in this pacific disposition  i will tell you mr lovelace and the occasion and be very explicit upon it and upon all that concerns you to know of me and of the commission i have undertaken and this the rather as when you have heard me out you will be satisfied that i am not an officious man in this my present address to you  i am all attention captain tomlinson  and so i doubt not was my beloved  you must know sir said the captain that i have not been many months in mr john harlowes neighborhood i removed from northamptonshire partly for the sake of better managing one of two executorships which i could not avoid engaging in the affairs of which frequently call me to town and are part of my present business and partly for the sake of occupying a neglected farm which has lately fallen into my hands but though an acquaintance of no longer standing and that commencing on the bowlinggreen uncle john is a great bowler belford upon my decision of a point to every ones satisfaction which was appealed to me by all the gentlemen and which might have been attended with bad consequences no two brothers have a more cordial esteem for each other you know mr lovelace that there is a consent as i may call it in some minds which will unite them stronger in a few hours than years will do with others whom yet we see not with disgust  very true captain  it was on the foot of this avowed friendship on both sides that on monday the   th as i very well remember mr harlowe invited himself home with me and when there he acquainted me with the whole of the unhappy affair that had made them all so uneasy till then i knew it only by report for intimate as we were i forbore to speak of what was so near his heart till he began first and then he told me that he had had an application made to him two or three days before by a gentleman whom he named see miss howes letters numb iv p    and numb x p    of this volume  to induce him not only to be reconciled to his niece himself but to forward for her a general reconciliation  a like application he told me had been made to his sister harlowe by a good woman whom everybody respected who had intimated that his niece if encouraged would again put herself into the protection of her friends and leave you but if not that she must unavoidably be yours  i hope mr lovelace i make no mischief  you look concerned  you sigh sir  proceed captain tomlinson pray proceed  and i sighed still more profoundly  they all thought it extremely particular that a lady should decline marriage with a man she had so lately gone away with  pray captain  pray mr tomlinson  no more of this subject my beloved is an angel in every thing unblameable whatever faults there have been have been theirs and mine what you would further say is that the unforgiving family rejected her application they did she and i had had a misunderstanding the falling out of lovers  you know captain  we have been happier ever since  well sir but mr john harlowe could not but better consider the matter afterward and he desired my advice how to act in it he told me that no father ever loved a daughter as he loved this niece of his whom indeed he used to call his daughterniece he said she had really been unkindly treated by her brother and sister and as your alliance sir was far from being a discredit to their family he would do his endeavor to reconcile all parties if he could be sure that ye were actually man and wife  and what pray captain was your advice  i gave it as my opinion that if his niece were unworthily treated and in distress as he apprehended from the application to him he would soon hear of her again but that it was likely that this application was made without expecting it would succeed and as a salvo only to herself for marrying without their consent and the rather as he had told me that it came from a young lady her friend and not in a direct way from herself which young lady was no favorite of the family and therefore would hardly have been employed had success been expeced  very well captain tomlinson  pray proceed  here the matter rested till last sunday evening when mr john harlowe came to me with the man who had seen you and your lady as i hope she is at the play and who had assured him that you both lodged in the same house  and then the application having been so lately made which implied that you were not then married he was so uneasy for his nieces honor that i advised him to dispatch to town some one in whom he could confide to make proper inquiries  very well captain  and was such a person employed on such an errand by her uncle  a trusty and discreet person was accordingly sent and last tuesday i think it was for he returned to us on the wednesday he made the inquiries among the neighbors first  the very inquiry jack that gave us all so much uneasiness see p   0 of this vol  but finding that none of them could give any satisfactory account the ladys woman was come at who declared that you were actually married but the inquirist keeping himself on the reserve as to his employers the girl refused to tell the day or to give him other particulars  you give a very clear account of everything captain tomlinson pray go on  the gentleman returned and on his report mr harlowe having still doubts and being willing to proceed on some grounds in so important a point besought me as my affairs called me frequently to town to undertake this matter you mr tomlinson he was pleased to say have children of your own you know the world you know what i drive at you will proceed i know with understanding and spirit and whatever you are satisfied with shall satisfy me  enter dorcas again in a hurry  sir the gentleman is impatient  i will attend him presently  the captain then accounted for his not calling in person when he had reason to think us here  he said he had business of consequence a few miles out of town whither he thought he must have gone yesterday and having been obliged to put off his little journey till this day and understanding that we were within not knowing whether he should have such another opportunity he was willing to try his good fortune before he set out and this made him come booted and spurred as i saw him  he dropped a hint in commendation of the people of the house but it was in such away as to give no room for suspicion that he thought it necessary to make any inquiries after the character of persons who make so genteel an appearance as he observed they do  and here let me remark to the same purpose that my beloved might collect another circumstance in their favor had she doubted them from the silence of her uncles inquirist on tuesday among the neighbors  and now sir said he that i believe i have satisfied you in every thing relating to my commission i hope you will permit me to repeat my question  which is   enter dorcas again out of breath  sir the gentleman will step up to you  my lady is impatient she wonders at your honors delay aside  excuse me captain for one moment  i have staid my full time mr lovelace  what may result from my question and your answer whatever it shall be may take us up time  and you are engaged  will you permit me to attend you in the morning before i set out on my return  you will then breakfast with me captain  it must be early if i do i must reach my own house tomorrow night or i shall make the best of wives unhappy and i have two or three places to call at in my way  it shall be by seven oclock if you please captain we are early folks and this i will tell you that if ever i am reconciled to a family so implacable as i have always found the harlowes to be it must be by the mediation of so cool and so moderate a gentleman as yourself  and so with the highest civilities on both sides we parted but for the private satisfaction of so good a man i left him out of doubt that we were man and wife though i did not directly aver it  letter xl mr lovelace to john belford esquire sunday night this captain tomlinson is one of the happiest as well as one of the best men in the world what would i give to stand as high in my beloveds opinion as he does but yet i am as good a man as he were i to tell my own story and have equal credit given to it but the devil should have had him before i had seen him on the account he came upon had i thought i should not have answered my principal end in it  i hinted to thee in my last what that was  but to the particulars of the conference between my fair one and me on her hasty messages which i was loath to come to because she has had a half triumph over me in it  after i had attended the captain down to the very passage i returned to the dining room and put on a joyful air on my beloveds entrance into it  o my dearest creature let me congratulate you on a prospect so agreeable to your wishes  and i snatched her hand and smothered it with my kisses  i was going on when interrupting me  you see mr lovelace said she how you have embarassed yourself by your own obliquities  you see that you have not been able to return a direct answer to a plain and honest question though upon it depends all the happiness you congratulate me upon the prospect of  you know my best love what my prudent and i will say my kind motives were for giving out that we were married you see that i have taken no advantage of it and that no inconvenience has followed it  you see that your uncle wants only to be assured from ourselves that it is so   not another word to this purpose mr lovelace i will not only risk but i will forfeit the reconciliation so near my heart rather than i will go on to countenance a story so untrue  my dearest soul  would you have me appear   i would have you appear sir as you are i am resolved that i will appear to my uncles friend and to my uncle as i am  for one week my dearest life cannot you for one week only till the settlements   not for one hour with my own consent  you dont know sir how much i have been afflicted that i have appeared to the people below what i am not but my uncle sir shall never have it to upbraid me nor will i to upbraid myself that i have wilfully passed myself upon him in false lights  what my dear would you have me to say to the captain tomorrow morning  i have given him room to think   then put him right mr lovelace tell the truth tell him what you please of your relations favor to me tell him what you will about the settlements and if when drawn you will submit them to his perusal and approbation it will show him how much you are in earnest  my dearest life  do you think that he would disapprove of the terms i have offered  no  then may i be accursed if i willingly submit to be trampled under foot by my enemies  and may i mr lovelace never be happy in this life if i submit to the passing upon my uncle harlowe a wilful and premeditated falsehood for truth  i have too long labored under the affliction which the rejection of all my friends has given me to purchase their reconciliation now at so dear a price as at that of my veracity  the women below my dear   what are they to me  i want not to establish myself with them need they know all that passes between my relations and you and me  neither are they any thing to me madam only that when for the sake of preventing the fatal mischiefs which might have attended your brothers projects i have made them think us married i would not appear to them in a light which you yourself think so shocking by my soul madam i had rather die than contradict myself so flagrantly after i have related to them so many circumstances of our marriage  well sir the women may believe what they please that i have given countenance to what you told them is my error the many circumstances which you own one untruth has drawn you in to relate is a justification of my refusal in the present case  dont you see madam that your uncle wishes to find us married may not the ceremony be privately over before his mediation can take place  urge this point no farther mr lovelace if you will not tell the truth i will tomorrow morning if i see captain tomlinson tell it myself indeed i will  will you madam consent that things pass as before with the people below this mediation of tomlinson may come to nothing your brothers schemes may be pursued the rather that now he will know perhaps from your uncle that you are not under a legal protection  you will at least consent that things pass here as before  to permit this is to go on in an error mr lovelace but as the occasion for so doing if there can be an occasion in your opinion that will warrant an untruth will as i presume soon be over i shall the less dispute that point with you but a new error i will not be guilty of if i can avoid it  can i do you think madam have any dishonorable view in the step i supposed you would not scruple to take toward a reconciliation with your own family  not for my own sake you know did i hope you to take it  for what is it to me if i am never reconciled to your family i want no favors from them  i hope mr lovelace there is no occasion in our present not disagreeable situation to answer such a question and let me say that i shall think my prospects still more agreeable if tomorrow morning you will not only own the very truth but give my uncles friend such an account of the steps you have taken and are taking as may keep up my uncles favorable intentions toward me this you may do under what restrictions of secrecy you please captain tomlinson is a prudent man a promoter of familypeace you find and i dare say may be made a friend  i saw there was no help i saw that the inflexible harlowe spirit was all up in her  a little witch  a little  forgive me love for calling her names and so i said with an air we have had too many misunderstandings madam for me to wish for new ones i will obey you without reserve had i not thought i should have obliged you by the other method especially as the ceremony might have been over before any thing could have operated from your uncles intentions and of consequence no untruth persisted in i would not have proposed it  but think not my beloved creature that you shall enjoy without condition this triumph over my judgment  and then clasping my arms about her i gave her struggledaway cheek her charming lip designed a servent kiss  and your forgiveness of this sweet freedom bowing is that condition  she was not mortally offended  and now must i make out the rest as well as i can but this i will tell thee that although her triumph has not diminished my love for her yet has it stimulated me more than ever to revenge as thou will be apt to call it but victory or conquest is the more proper name  there is a pleasure it is true in subduing one of these watchful beauties but by my soul belford men of our cast take twenty times the pains to be rogues that it would cost them to be honest and dearly with the sweat of our brows and to the puzzling of our brains to say nothing of the hazards we run do we earn our purchase and ought not therefore to be grudged our success when we meet with it  especially as when we have obtained our end satiety soon follows and leaves us little or nothing to show for it but this indeed may be said of all worldly delights  and is not that a grave reflection from me  i was willing to write up to the time although i have not carried my principal point i shall make something turn out in my favor from captain tomlinsons errand  but let me give thee this caution that thou do not pretend to judge of my devices by parts but have patience till thou see the whole but once more i swear that i will not be outnorrisd by a pair of novices and yet i am very apprehensive at times of the consequences of miss howes smuggling scheme  it is late or rather early for the day begins to dawn upon me i am plaguey heavy perhaps i need not to have told thee that but will only indulge a doze in my chair for an hour then shake myself wash and refresh at my time of life with my constitution that is all that is wanted  good night to me  it cannot be broad day till i am awake  awwwwhaugh  pox of this yawning  is not thy uncle dead yet  what is come to mine that he writes not to my last  hunting after more wisdom of nations i suppose  yaw  yaw  yawning again  pen begone  letter xli mr lovelace to john belford esquire monday may    now have i established myself for ever in my charmers heart  the captain came at seven as promised and ready equipped for his journey my beloved chose not to give us her company till our first conversation was over  ashamed i suppose but to my shame if she was to be present at that part of it which was to restore her to her virgin state by my confession after her wifehood had been reported to her uncle but she took her cue nevertheless and listened to all that passed  the modestest women jack must think and think deeply sometimes  i wonder whether they ever blush at those things by themselves at which they have so charming a knack of blushing in company  if not and if blushing be a sign of grace or modesty have not the sex as great a command over their blushes as they are said to have over their tears this reflection would lead me a great way into female minds were i disposed to pursue it  i told the captain that i would prevent his question and accordingly after i had injoined the strictest secrecy that no advantage might be given to james harlowe and which he answered for as well on mr harlowes part as his own i acknowleged nakedly and fairly the whole truth  to wit that we were not yet married  i gave him hints of the causes of procrastination  some of them owing to unhappy misunderstanding but chiefly to the ladys desire of previous reconciliation with her friend and to a delicacy that had no example  less nice ladies than this jack love to have delays wilful and studied delays imputed to them in these cases  yet are indelicate in their affected delicacy for do they not thereby tacitly confess that they expect to be the greatest gainers in wedlock and that there is selfdenial in the pride they take in delaying  i told him the reason of our passing to the people below as married  yet as under a vow of restriction as to consummation which had kept us both to the height one of sorbearing the other of vigilant punctilio even to the denial of those innocent freedoms which betrothed lovers never scruple to allow and to take  i then communicated to him a copy of my proposals of settlement the substance of her written answer the contents of my letter of invitation to lord m to be her nuptial father and of my lords generous reply but said that having apprehensions of delay from his infirmities and my beloved choosing by all means and that from principles of unrequited duty a private solemnization i had written to excuse his lordships presence and expected an answer every hour  the settlements i told him were actually drawing by counselor williams of whose eminence he must have heard he had and of the truth of this he might satisfy himself before he went out of town  when these were drawn approved and engrossed nothing i said but signing and the nomination of my happy day would be wanting i had a pride i declared in doing the highest justice to so beloved a creature of my own voluntary motion and without the intervention of a family from whom i had received the greatest insults and this being our present situation i was contented that mr john harlowe should suspend his reconciliatory purposes till our marriage were actually solemnized  the captain was highly delighted with all i had said yet owned that as his dear friend mr harlowe had xpressed himself greatly pleased to hear that we were ctually married he could have wished it had been so but nevertheless he doubted not that all would be ell  he saw my reasons he said and approved of them or making the gentlewomen below whom again he nderstood to be good sort of people believe that the eremony had passed which so well accounted for that the ladys maid had told mr harlowes friend mr james harlowe he said had certainly ends to nswer in keeping open the breach and as certainly ad formed a design to get his sister out of my hands wherefore it as much imported his worthy friend to eep this treaty a secret as it did me at least till he ad formed his party and taken his measures illill and passion were dreadful misrepresenters it was amazing to him that animosity could be carried as high against a man capable of views so pacific and  honorable and who had shown such a command of s temper in this whole transaction generosity deed in every case where love of stratagem and trigue i would excuse him were not concerned as a part of my character   he was proceeding when breakfast being ready  came the empress of my heart irradiating all around er as with a glory  a benignity and graciousness in er aspect that though natural to it had been long baished from it  next to prostration lowly bowed the captain o ow the sweet creature smiled her approbation of him everence from one begets reverence from another en are more of monkeys in imitation than they hink themselves  involuntarily in a manner i bent my knee  my dearest life  and made a very fine speech on presenting the captain to her no title myself to her lip or cheek it is well he attempted not either  he was indeed ready to worship her  could only touch her charming hand   i have told the captain my dear creature  and then i briefly repeated as if i had supposed she had not heard it all i had told him  he was astonished that anybody could be displeased one moment with such an angel he undertook her cause as the highest degree of merit to himself  never i must needs say did the angel so much look the angel all placid serene smiling selfassured a more lovely flush than usual heightening her natural graces and adding charms even to radiance to her charming complexion  after we had seated ourselves the agreeable subject was renewed as we took our chocolate how happy should she be in her uncles restored favor  the captain engaged for it  no more delays he hoped of her part let the happy day be but once over all would then be right  but was it improper to ask for copies of my proposals and of her answer in order to show them to his dear friend her uncle  as mr lovelace pleased  o that the dear creature would always say so  it must be in strict confidence then i said  but would it not be better to show her uncle the draught of the settlements when drawn  and will you be so good as to allow of this mr lovelace  there belford we were once the quarrelsome but now we are the polite lovers   indeed my dearest creature i will if you desire it and if captain tomlinson will engage that mr harlowe shall keep them absolutely a secret that i may not be subjected to the cavil and control of any other of a family that have used me so very ill  now indeed sir you are very obliging  do think jack that my face did not now also hine  i held out my hand first consecrating it with a kiss for hers she condescended to give it me i pressed it to my lips you know not captain tomlinson with an air all storms overblown what a happy man   charming couple his hands lifted up  how will my good friend rejoice  o that he were present  you know not madam how dear you still are to your uncle harlowe   i am unhappy ever to have disobliged him  not too much of that however fairest thought i  he repeated his resolutions of service and that in so acceptable a manner that the dear creature wished that neither he nor any of his might ever want a friend of equal benevolence  none of his she said for the captain brought it in that he had five children living by one of the best of wives and mothers whose excellent management made him as happy as if his eight hundred pounds a year which was all he had to boast of were two thousand  without economy the oraculous lady said no estate was large enough with it the least was not too small  lie still teazing villain lie still  i was only speaking to my conscience jack  and let me ask you mr lovelace said the captain yet not so much from doubt as that i may proceed upon sure grounds  you are willing to cooperate with my dear friend in a general reconciliation  let me tell you mr tomlinson that if it can be distinguished that my readiness to make up with a family of whose generosity i have not had reason to think highly is entirely owing to the value i have for this angel of a woman i will not only cooperate with mr john harlowe as you ask but i will meet mr james harlowe senior and his lady all the way and furthermore to make the son james and arabella quite easy i will absolutely disclaim any furthe interest whether living or dying in any of the thre brothers estates contenting myself with what my beloveds grandfather has bequeathed to her for i have reason to be abundantly satisfied with my own circumstances and prospects  enough rewarded were she not to bring a shilling in dowry in a lady who ha a merit superior to all the goods of fortune true a the gospel belford why had not this scene a rea foundation  the dear creature by her eyes expressed her gratitude before her lips could utter it o mr lovelace said she  you have infinitely  and there she stopped   the captain run over in my praise he was reall affected  o that i had not such a mixture of revenge an pride in my love thought i  but my old plea cannot i make her amends at any time  and is no her virtue now in the height of its probation  would she lay aside like the friends of my uncontending rosebud all thought of defiance  would she throw herself upon my mercy and try me but on fortnight in the life of honor  what then  cannot say what then  do not despise me jack for my inconsistency  in no two letters perhaps agreeing with myself  who expects consistency in men of our character  but i am mad with love  fired by revenge  puzzle with my own devices  my inventions are my curse  my pride my punishment  drawn five or six wa at once  can she possibly be so unhappy as i  why why was this woman so divinely excellent  yet how know i that she is  what have been h trials have i had the courage to make a single o upon her person though fifty upon her temper  enough i hope to make her afraid of ever disobligeing me more   i must banish reflection or i am a lost man for hese two hours past have i hated myself for my own contrivances and this not only from what i have related to thee but from what i have further to reate but i have now once more steeled my heart my vengeance is uppermost for i have been reperusing some of miss howes virulence the contempt they have both held me in i cannot bear   the happiest breakfasttime my beloved owned that she had ever known since she had left her fathers house she might have let this alone the captain renewed all his protestations of service he would write me word how his dear friend received the account he should give him of the happy situation of our affairs and what he thought of the settlements as soon as i should send him the kindlypromised draughts and we parted with great professions of mutual esteem my beloved putting up vows for the success of his generous mediation  when i returned from attending the captain down stairs which i did to the outward door my beloved met me as i entered the dining room complacency reigning in every lovely feature  you see me already said she another creature you know not mr lovelace how near my heart this hopedfor reconciliation is i am now willing to banish every disagreeable remembrance you know not sir how much you have obliged me and oh mr lovelace how happy shall i be when my heart s lightened from the allsinking weight of a fathers curse when my dear mamma you dont know sir half the excellencies of my dear mamma and what a kind heart she has when it is left to follow its own impulses  when this blessed mamma shall once more fold me to her indulgent bosom when i shall again have uncles and aunts and a brother and sister all striving who shall show most kindness and favor to the poor outcast then no more an outcast  and you mr lovelace to behold all this and to be received into a family so dear to me with welcome  what though a little cold at first when they come to know you better and to see you oftener no fresh causes of disgust occurring and you as i hope having entered upon a new course all will be warmer and warmer love on both sides till every one perhaps will wonder how they came to set themselves against you  then drying her eyes with her handkerchief after a few moments pausing on a sudden as if recollecting that she had been led by her joy to an expression of it which she had not intended i should see she retired to her chamber with precipitation  leaving me almost as unable to stand it as herself  in short i was  i want words to say how i was  my nose had been made to tingle before my eyes have before been made to glisten by this soulmoving beauty but so very much affected i never was  for trying to check my sensibility it was too strong for me and i even sobbed  yes by my soul i audibly sobbed and was forced to turn from her before she had well finished her affecting speech  i want methinks now i have owned the odd sensation to describe it to thee  the thing was so strange to me  something choking as it were in my throat  i know not how  yet i must needs say though i am out of countenance upon the recollection that there was something very pretty in it and i wish i could know it again that i might have a more perfect idea of it and be better able to describe it to thee  but this effect of her joy on such an occasion gives me a high notion of what that virtue must be what other name can i call it which in a mind so capabl of delicate transport should be able to make so charming a creature in her very bloom all frost and snow to every advance of love from the man she hates not this must be all from education too  must it not belford can education have stronger force in a womans heart than nature  sure it cannot but if it can how entirely right are parents to cultivate their daughters minds and to inspire them with notions of reserve and distance to our sex and indeed to make them think highly of their own for pride is an excellent substitute let me tell thee where virtue shines not out as the sun in its own unborrowed luster  letter xlii mr lovelace to john belford esquire and now it is time to confess and yet i know that thy conjectures are aforehand with my exposition that this captain tomlinson who is so great a favorite with my charmer and who takes so much delight in healing breaches and reconciling differences is neither a greater man nor a less than honest patrick mcdonald attended by a discarded footman of his own finding out  thou know what a variouslifed rascal he is and to what better hopes born and educated but that ingenious knack of forgery for which he was expelled the dublinuniversity and a detection since in evidenceship have been his ruin for these have thrown him from one country to another and at last into the way of life which would make him a fit husband for miss howes townsend with her contrabands he is thou know admirably qualified for any enterprise that requires adroitness and solemnity and can there after all be a higher piece of justice aimed at than to keep one smuggler in readiness to play against another  well but lovelace methinks thou questionest how came thou to venture upon such a contriveance as this when as thou have told me the lady used to be a month at a time at this uncles and must therefore in all probability know that there was not a captain tomlinson in all his neighborhood at least no one of the name so intimate with him as this man pretends to be   this objection jack is so natural a one that i could not help observing to my charmer that she must surely have heard her uncle speak of this gentleman no she said she never had besides she had not been at her uncle harlowes for near ten months  this i had heard her say before and there were several gentlemen who used the same green whom she knew not  we are all very ready thou know to believe what we like  and what was the reason think thou that she had not been of so long time at this uncles  why this old sinner who imagines himself entitled to call me to account for my freedoms with the sex has lately fallen into familiarities as it is suspected with his housekeeper who assumes airs upon it  a cursed deluding sex  in youth middle age or dotage they take us all in  do thou not see however that this housekeeper knows nothing nor is to know any thing of the treaty of reconciliation designed to be set on foot and therefore the uncle always comes to the captain the captain goes not to the uncle and this i surmised to the lady and then it was a natural suggestion that the captain was the rather applied to as he is a stranger to the rest of the family need i tell thee the meaning of all this  but this intrigue of the ancient is a piece of private history the truth of which my beloved cares not to own and indeed affects to disbelieve as she does also some puisny gallantries of her foolish brother which by way of recrimination i have hinted at without naming my informant in their family  well but methinks thou questionest again is it not probable that miss how will make inquiry after such a man as tomlinson  and when she cannot   i know what thou would say  but i have no doubt that wilson will be so good if i desire it as to give into my own hands any letter that may be brought by collins to his house for a week to come and now i hope you are satisfied  i will conclude with a short story  two neighboring sovereigns were at war together about some pitiful chuckfarthing thing or other no matter what for the least trifles will set princes and children at loggerheads their armies had been drawn up in battalia some days and the news of a decisive action expected every hour to arrive at each court at last issue was joined a bloody battle was fought and a fellow who had been a spectator of it arriving with the news of a complete victory at the capital of one of the princes some time before the appointed couriers the bells were set a ringing bonfires and illuminations were made and the people went to bed intoxicated with joy and good liquor but the next day all was reversed the victorious enemy pursuing his advantage was expected every hour at the gates of the almost defenseless capital the first reporter was hereupon sought for and found and being questioned pleaded a great deal of merit in that he had in so dismal a situation taken such a space of time from the distress of his fellowcitizens and given it to festivity as were the hours between the false good news and the real bad  do thou belford make the application this i know that i have given greater joy to my beloved than she had thought would so soon fall to her share and as the human life is properly said to be chequerwork no doubt but a person of her prudence will make the best of it and set off so much good against so much bad in order to strike as just a balance as possible  the lady in three several letters acquaints her friend with the most material passages and conversations contained in those of mr lovelaces preceding these are her words on relating what the commission of the pretended tomlinson was after the apprehensions that his distant inquiry had given her  at last my dear all these doubts and fears were cleared up and banished and in their place a delightful prospect was opened to me for it comes happily out but at present it must be an absolute secret for reasons which i shall mention in the sequel that the gentleman was sent by my uncle harlowe i thought he could not be angry with me for ever all owing to the conversation that passed between your good mr hickman and him for although mr hickmans application was too harshly rejected at the time my uncle could not but think better of it afterward and of the arguments that worthy gentleman used in my favor  who upon a passionate repulse would despair of having a reasonable request granted  who would not by gentleness and condescension endeavor to leave favorable impressions upon an angry mind which when it comes coolly to reflect may induce it to work itself into a condescending temper to request a favor as i have often said is one thing to challenge it as our due is another and what right has a petitioner to be angry at a repulse if he has not a right to demand what he sues for as a debt  she describes captain tomlinson on his breakfast visit to be a grave good sort of man and in another place a genteel man of great gravity and a good aspect she believes upwards of fifty years of age i liked him says she as soon as i saw him  as her prospects are now more favorable than heretofore she wishes that her hopes of mr lovelaces so often promised reformation were better grounded than she is afraid they can be  we have both been extremely puzzled my dear says she to reconcile some parts of mr lovelaces character with other parts of it his good with his bad such of the former in particular as his generosity to his tenants his bounty to the innkeepers daughter his readiness to put me upon doing kind things by my good norton and others  a strange mixture in his mind as i have told him for he is certainly as i have reason to say looking back upon his past behavior to me in twenty instances a hardhearted man  indeed my dear i have thought more than once that he had rather see me in tears than give me reason to be pleased with him  my cousin morden says that free livers are remorseless vol iii p     see also mr lovelaces own confession of the delight he takes in a ladys tears in different parts of his letters particularly in p    of this volume  and so they must be in the very nature of things  mr lovelace is a proud man that we have long observed and i am truly afraid that his very generosity is more owing to his pride and his vanity than to that philanthropy which distinguishes a beneficent mind  money he values not but as a means to support his pride and his independence and it is easy as i have often thought for a person to part with a secondary appetite when by so doing he can promote or gratify a first  i am afraid my dear that there must have been some fault in his education his natural byas was not i fancy sufficiently attended to he was instructed perhaps as his power was likely to be large to do good and beneficent actions but not from proper motives i doubt  if he had his generosity would not have stopped at pride but would have struck into humanity and then would he not have contented himself with doing praiseworthy things by fits and starts or as if relying on the doctrine of merits he hoped by a good action to atone for a bad one that the lady judges rightly of him in this place see vol i p     where giving the motive for his generosity to his rosebud he says  as i make it my rule whenever i have committed a very capital enormity to do some good by way of atonement and as i believe i am a pretty deal indebted on that score i intend to join an hundred pounds to johnnys aunts hundred pounds to make one innocent couple happy  besides which motive he had a further view to answer in that instance of his generosity as may be seen vol ii letters xxiii xxiv xxv xxvi  to show the consistence of his actions as they now appear with his views and principles as he lays them down in his first letters it may not be amiss to refer the reader to his letters vol i numb xxxiv p     and numb xxxv p     to      see also vol i p   0         and   0         for clarissas early opinion of mr lovelace  whence the coldness and indifference to him which he so repeatedly accuses her of will be accounted for more to her glory than to his honor    but he would have been uniformly noble and done the good for its own sake  o my dear what a lot have i drawn pride his virtue and revenge his other predominating quality  this one consolation however remains he is not an infidel an unbeliever had he been an infidel there would have been no room at all for hope of him but priding himself as he does in his fertile invention he would have been utterly abandoned irreclaimable and a savage  when she comes to relate those occasions which mr lovelace in his narrative acknowleges himself to be affected by she thus expresses herself  he endeavored as once before to conceal his emotion but why my dear should these men for mr lovelace is not singular in this think themselves above giving these beautiful proofs of a feeling heart were it in my power again to choose or refuse i would reject the man with contempt who sought to suppress or offered to deny the power of being affected upon proper occasions as either a savagehearted creature or as one who was so ignorant of the principal glory of the human nature as to place his pride in a barbarous insensibility  these lines translated from juvenal by mr tate i have been often pleased with compassion proper to mankind appears which nature witnessed when she lent us tears of tender sentiments we only give these proofs to weep is our prerogative to show by pitying looks and melting eyes how with a suffering friend we sympathize who can all sense of others ills escape is but a brute at best in human shape this natural piety did first refine our wit and raised our thoughts to things divine this proves our spirit of the gods descent while that of beasts is prone and downward bent to them but earthborn life they did dispense to us for mutual aid celestial sense   she takes notice to the advantage of the people of the house that such a good man as captain tomlinson had spoken well of them upon inquiry  letter xliii mr lovelace to john belford esquire tuesday may  0 i have a letter from lord m such a one as i would wish for if i intended matrimony but as matters are circumstanced i cannot think of showing it to my beloved  my lord regrets that he is not to be the ladys nuptial father he seems apprehensive that i have still specious as my reasons are some mischief in my head  he graciously consents that i may marry when i please and offers one or both of my cousins to assist my bride and to support her spirits on the occasion since as he understands she is so much afraid to venture with me  pritchard he tells me has his final orders to draw up deeds to assign over to me in perpetuity  000 l per annum which he will execute the same hour that the lady in person owns her marriage  he consents that the jointure be made from my own estate  he wishes that the lady would have accepted of his draught and commends me for tendering it to her but reproaches me for pride in not keeping it myself what the rightside gives up the left he says may be the better for  the girls he means  with all my heart if i can have miss clarissa harlowe the devil take every thing else  a good deal of other stuff writes this stupid peer scribbling in several places half a dozen lines apparently for no other reason but to bring in as many musty words in an old saw  if thou ask how i can manage since my beloved will wonder that i have not an answer from my lord to such a letter as i wrote to him and if i own i have one will expect that i should show it to her as i did my letter  this i answer  that i can be informed by pritchard that my lord has the gout in his right hand and has ordered him to attend me in form for my particular orders about the transfer and i can see pritchard thou know at the kings arms or where i please in town and he by word of mouth can acquaint me with everything in my lords letter that is necessary for her to know  whenever it suits me i can restore the old peer to his right hand and then can make him write a much more sensible letter than this he has how sent me  thou know that an adroitness in the art of manual imitation was one of my earliest seize it has been said on this occasion that had i been a bad man in meum and tuum matters i should not have been fit to live as to the girls we hold it no sin to cheat them and are we not told that in being well deceived consists the whole of human happiness   wednesday may    all still happier and happier a very high honor done me a chariot instead of a coach permitted purposely to indulge me in the subject of subjects  our discourse in this sweet airing turned upon our future manner of life the day is bashfully promised me soon was the answer to my repeated urgency our equipage our servants our liveries were parts of the delightful subject a desire that the wretch who had given me intelligence out of the family honest joseph leman might not be one of our menials and her resolution to have her faithful hannah whether recovered or not were signified and both as readily assented to  the reconciliation prospect was enlarged upon if her uncle harlowe will but pave the way to it and if it can be brought about she shall be happy  happy with a sigh as it is now possible she can be  she will not forbear jack  i told her that i had heard from pritchard just before we set out and expected him in town tomorrow from lord m to take my directions i spoke with gratitude of my lords kindness to me and with pleasure of my aunts and cousins veneration for her as also of his lordships concern that his gout hindered him from writing a reply with his own hand to my last  she pitied my lord she pitied poor mrs fretcliville too for she had the goodness to inquire after her the dear creature pitied everybody that seemed to want pity happy in her own prospects she has leisure to look abroad and wishes everybody equally happy  it is likely to go very hard with mrs fretchville her face which she had valued herself upon will be utterly ruined this good however she may reap from so great an evil  as the greater malady generally swallows up the less she may have a grief on this occasion that may diminish the other grief and make it tolerable  i had a gentle reprimand for this light turn on so heavy an evil  for what was the loss of beauty to the loss of a good husband  excellent creature  her hopes and her pleasure upon those hopes that miss howes mother would be reconciled to her were also mentioned good mrs how was her word for a woman so covetous and so remorseless in her covetousness that no one else would call her good but this dear creature has such an extension in her love as to be capable of valuing the most insignificant animal related to those whom she respects love me and love my dog i have heard lord m say  who knows but that i may in time in compliment to myself bring her to think well of thee jack  but what am i about  am i not all this time arraigning my own heart  i know i am by the remorse i feel in it while my pen bears testimony to her excellence but yet i must add for no selfish consideration shall hinder me from doing justice to this admirable creature that in this conversation she demonstrated so much prudent knowledge in every thing that relates to that part of the domestic management which falls under the care of a mistress of a family that i believe she has no equal of her years in the world  i break off to reperuse some of miss howes virulence  cursed letters these of miss how jack  do thou turn back to those of mine where i take notice of them  i proceed   upon the whole my charmer was all gentleness all ease all serenity throughout this sweet excursion nor had she reason to be otherwise for it being the first time that i had the honor of her company sola i was resolved to encourage her by my respectfulness to repeat the favor  on our return i found the counsellors clerk waiting for me with a draught of the marriagesettlements  they are drawn with only the necessary variations from those made for my mother the original of which now returned by the counselor as well as the new draughts i have put into my beloveds hands  this made the lawyers work easy nor can she have a better precedent the great lord s having settled them at the request of my mothers relations all the difference my charmers are  00 l per annum more than my mothers  i offered to read to her the old deed while she looked over the draught for she had refused her presence at the examination with the clerk but this she also declined  i suppose she did not care to hear of so many children first second third fourth fifth sixth and seventh sons and as many daughters to be begotten upon the body of the said clarissa harlowe  charming matrimonial recitativoes  though it is always said lawfully begotten too  as if a man could beget children unlawfully upon the body of his own wife  but think thou not that these arch rogues the lawyers hereby intimate that a man may have children by his wife before marriage  this must be what they mean why will these sly fellows put an honest man in mind of such rogueries  but hence as in numberless other instances we see that law and gospel are two very different things  dorcas in our absence tried to get at the wainscot box in the dark closet but it cannot be done without violence and to run a risque of consequence now for mere curiositysake would be inexcusable  mrs sinclair and the nymphs are all of opinion that i am now so much of a favorite and have such a visible share in her confidence and even in her affections that i may do what i will and plead violence of passion which they will have it makes violence of action pardonable with their sex as well as an allowed extenuation with the unconcerned of both sexes and they all offer their helping hands why not they say has she not passed for my wife before them all  and is she not in a fine way of being reconciled to her friends which was the pretense for postponing consummation  they again urge me since it is so difficult to make night my friend to an attempt in the day they remind me that the situation of their house is such that no noises can be heard out of it and ridicule me for making it necessary for a lady to be undressed it was not always so with me poor old man sally told me saucily flinging her handkerchief in my face   letter xliv mr lovelace to john belford esquire friday june   notwithstanding my studied for politeness and complaisance for some days past and though i have wanted courage to throw the mask quite aside yet i have made the dear creature more than once look about her by the warm though decent expressions of my passion i have brought her to own that i am more than indifferent to her but as to love which i pressed her to acknowledge what need of acknowlegements of that sort when a woman consents to marry  and once repulsing me with displeasure the proof of the true love i was vowing for her was respect not freedom and offering to defend myself she told me that all the conception she had been able to form of a faulty passion was that it must demonstrate itself as mine sought to do  i endeavored to justify my passion by laying overdelicacy at her door that was not she said my fault if it were hers she must plainly tell me that i appeared to her incapable of distinguishing what were the requisites of a pure mind perhaps had the libertine presumption to imagine that there was no difference in heart nor any but what proceeded from education and custom between the pure and the impure  and yet custom alone as she observed would make a second nature as well in good as in bad habits  i have just now been called to account for some innocent liberties which i thought myself entitled to take before the women as they suppose us married and now within view of consummation  i took the lecture very hardly and with impatience wished for the happy day and hour when i might call her all my own and meet with no check from a niceness that had no example  she looked at me with a bashful kind of contempt i thought it contempt and required the reason for it not being conscious of offense as i told her  this is not the first time mr lovelace said she that i have had cause to be displeased with you when you perhaps have not thought yourself exceptionable  but sir let me tell you that the married state in my eye is a state of purity and i think she told me not of licentiousness so at least i understood her  marriagepurity jack  very comical faith  yet sweet dears half the female world ready to run away with a rake because he is a rake and for no other reason nay every other reason against their choice  but have not you and i belford seen young wives who would be thought modest and when maids were fantastically shy permit freedoms in public from their lambent husbands which have shown that they have forgot what belongs either to prudence or decency while every modest eye has sunk under the shameless effrontery and every modest face been covered with blushes for those who could not blush  i once upon such an occasion proposed to a circle of a dozen thus scandalized to withdraw since they must needs see that as well the lady as the gentleman wanted to be in private this motion had its effect upon the amorous pair and i was applauded for the check given to their licentiousness  but upon another occasion of this sort i acted a little more in character  for i ventured to make an attempt upon a bride which i should not have had the courage to make had not the unblushing passiveness with which she received her fond husbands public toyings looking round her with triumph rather than with shame upon every lady present incited my curiosity to know if the same complacency might not be shown to a private friend it is true i was in honor obliged to keep the secret but i never saw the turtles bill afterward but i thought of number two to the same female and in my heart thanked the fond husband for the lesson he had taught his wife  from what i have said thou will see that i approve of my beloveds exception to public loves that i hope is all the charming isicle means by marriagepurity  from the whole of the above thou will gather that i have not been a mere dangler a hickman in the passed days though not absolutely active and a lovelace  the dear creature now considers herself as my wifeelect the unsaddend heart no longer prudish will not now i hope give the fable turn to every action of the man she dislikes not and yet she must keep up so much reserve as will justify past inflexibilities many and many a pretty soul would yield were she not afraid that the man she favored would think the worse of her for it this is also a part of the rakes creed but should she resent ever so strongly she cannot now break with me since if she does there will be an end of the family reconciliation and that in a way highly discreditable to herself   sat june   just returned from doctorscommons i have been endeavoring to get a license very true jack i have the mortification to find a difficulty in obtaining this allfettering instrument as the lady is of rank and fortune and as there is no consent of father or next friend  i made report of this difficulty it is very right she says that such difficulties should be made but not to a man of my known fortune surely jack though the woman were the daughter of a duke  i asked if she approved of the settlements she said she had compared them with my mothers and had no objection she had written to miss how upon the subject she owned and to inform her of our present situation as this letter of the lady contains no new matter but what may be collected from those of mr lovelace it is omitted   just now in high good humor my beloved returned me the draughts of the settlements a copy of which i had sent to captain tomlinson she complimented me that she never had any doubt of my honor in cases of this nature  in matters between man and man nobody ever had thou know i had need thou wilt say to have some good qualities  great faults and great virtues are often found in the same person in nothing very bad but as to women and did not one of them begin with me see vol i letter xxxi p       we have held that women have no souls i am a very jew in this point and willing to believe they have not and if so to whom shall i be accountable for what i do to them nay if souls they have as there is no sex in ethereals nor need of any what plea can a lady hold of injuries done her in her lady state when there is an end of her lady ship   letter xlv mr lovelace to john belford esquire monday june   i am now almost in despair of succeeding with this charming frostpiece by love or gentleness  a copy of the draughts as i told thee has been sent to captain tomlinson and that by a special messenger ingrossments are proceeding with i have been again at the commons should in all probability have procured a license by malorys means had not malorys friend the proctor been suddenly sent for to cheshunt to make an old ladys will pritchard has told me by word of mouth though my charmer saw him not all that was necessary for her to know in the letter my lord wrote which i could not show her and taken my directions about the estates to be made over to me on my nuptials  yet with all these favorable appearances no conceding moment to be sound no improveable tenderness to be raised  twice indeed with rapture which once she called rude did i salute her and each time resenting the freedom did she retire though to do her justice she favored me again with her presence at my first entreaty and took no notice of the cause of her withdrawing  is it policy to show so open a resentment for innocent liberties which in her situation she must so soon forgive  yet the woman who resents not initiatory freedoms must be lost for love is an incroacher love never goes backward love is always aspiring always must aspire nothing but the highest act of love can satisfy an indulged love and what advantages has a lover who values not breaking the peace over his mistress who is solicitous to keep it  i have now at this instant wrought myself up for the dozenth time to a halfresolution a thousand agreeable things i have to say to her she is in the dining room just gone up she always expects me when there  high displeasure  followed by an abrupt departure  i sat down by her i took both her hands in mine i would have it so all gentle my voice  her father mentioned with respect her mother with reverence even her brother amicably spoken of i never thought i could have wished so ardently as i told her i did wish for a reconciliation with her family  a sweet and grateful flush then overspread her fair face a gentle sigh nowandthen heaved her handkerchief  i perfectly longed to hear from captain tomlinson it was impossible for her uncle to find fault with the draught of the settlements i would not however be understood by sending them down that i intended to put it in her uncles power to delay my happy day when when was it to be  i would hasten again to the commons and would not return without the license  the lawn i proposed to retire to as soon as the happy ceremony was over this day and that day i proposed  it was time enough to name the day when the settlements were completed and the license obtained happy should she be could the kind captain tomlinson obtain her uncles presence privately  a good hint  it may perhaps be improved upon  either for a delay or a pacifier  no new delays for heavens sake i besought her reproaching her gently for the past name but the day  an early day i hoped in the following week  that i might hail its approach and number the tardy hours  my cheek reclined on her shoulder  kissing her hands by turns rather bashfully than angrily reluctant her hands sought to be withdrawn her shoulder avoiding my reclined cheek  apparently loath and more loath to quarrel with me her downcast eye confessing more than her lips could utter  now surely thought i it is my time to try if she can forgive a still bolder freedom than i had ever yet taken  i then gave her struggling hands liberty i put one arm round her waist i imprinted a kiss on her sweet lips with a be quiet only and an averted face as if she feared another  encouraged by so gentle a repulse the tenderest things i said and then with my other hand drew aside the handkerchief that concealed the beauty of beauties and pressed with my burning lips the charmingest breast that ever my ravished eyes beheld  a very contrary passion to that which gave her bosom so delightful a swell immediately took place she struggled out of my incircling arms with indignation i detained her reluctant hand let me go said she i see there is no keeping terms with you base incroacher is this the design of your flattering speeches  far as matters have gone i will for ever renounce you you have an odious heart let me go i tell you   i was forced to obey and she flung from me repeating base and adding flattering incroacher  in vain have i urged by dorcas for the promised favor of dining with her she would not dine at all she could not  but why makes she every inch of her person thus sacred  so near the time too that she must suppose that all will be my own by deed of purchase and

equipages do not prepare the eyes of the wondering beholders by degrees to bear the blaze of canopyd majesty what though but an ugly old man perhaps himself yet glittering in the collected riches of

was sure would make a great handle of it against any motion that might be made toward a reconciliation and with the greater success as there was not a family in the kingdom more jealous of their honor than theirs  this is true of the harlowes jack they have been called the proud harlowes and i have ever found that all young honor is supercilious and touchy  but see thou not how right i was in my endeavor to persuade my fair one to allow her uncles friend to think us married especially as he came prepared to believe it and as her uncle hoped it was so  but nothing on earth is so perverse as a woman when she is set upon carrying a point and has a meek man or one who loves his peace to deal with  my beloved was vexed she pulled out her handkerchief but was more inclined to blame me than herself  had you kept your word mr lovelace and left me when we came to town  and there she stopped for she knew that it was her own fault that we were not married before we left the country and how could i leave her afterward while her brother was plotting to carry her off by violence  nor has he yet given over his machinations  for as the captain proceeds mr john harlowe owned to him but in confidence that his nephew is at this time busied in endeavoring to find out where we are being assured as i am not to be heard of at any of my relations or at my usual lodgings that we are together and that we are not married is plain as he will have it from mr hickmans application so lately made to her uncle and which was seconded by mrs norton to her mother and he cannot bear that i should enjoy such a triumph unmolested  a profound sigh and the handkerchief again lifted to the eye but did not the sweet soul deserve this turn upon her for her felonious intention to rob me of herself  i read on to the following effect  why mr harlowe asked was it said to his other inquiring friend that we were married and that by his nieces woman who ought to know who could give convincing reasons no doubt   here again she wept took a turn cross the room then returned  read on said she   will you my dearest life read it yourself  i will take the letter with me byandby  i cannot see to read it just now wiping her eyes  read on  let me hear it all  that i may know your sentiments upon this letter as well as give my own  the captain then told uncle john the reasons that induced me to give out that we were married and the conditions on which my beloved was brought to countenance it which had kept us at the most punctilious distance  but still my character was insisted upon and mr harlowe went away dissatisfied and the captain was also so much concerned that he cared not to write what the result of this first conference was  but in the next which was held on receipt of the draughts at his the captains house as the former was for the greater secrecy when the old gentleman had read them and had the captains opinion he was much better pleased and yet he declared that it would not be easy to persuade any other person of his family to believe so favorably of the matter as he was now willing to believe were they to know that we had lived so long together unmarried  and then the captain says his dear friend made a proposal  it was this  that we should marry  of hand but as privately as possible as indeed h found we intended for he could have no objection to the draughts  but yet he expected to have prsent one trusty friend of his own for his better satisfaction   here i stopped with a design to be angry  but she desiring me to read on i obeyed     but that it should pass to every one living except to that trusty person to himself and to the captain that we were married from the time that we had lived together in one house and that this time should be made to agree with that of mr hickmans application to him from miss how  this my dearest life said i is a very considerate proposal we have nothing to do but to caution the people below properly on this head i did not think your uncle harlowe capable of such an expedient but you see how much his heart is in the reconciliation  this was the return i met with  you have always as a mark of your politeness let me know how meanly you think of every one of my family  yet thou will think belford that i could forgive her for the reproach  the captain does not know he says how this proposal will be relished by us but for his part he thinks it an expedient that will obviate many difficulties and may possibly put an end to mr james harlowes further designs and on this account he has by the uncles advice already declared to two several persons by whose means it may come to that young gentlemans ears that he captain tomlinson has very great reason to believe that we were married soon after mr hickmans application was rejected  and this mr lovelace says the captain will enable you to pay a compliment to the family that will not be unsuitable to the generosity of some of the declarations you was pleased to make to the lady before me and which mr john harlowe may make some advantage of in favor of a reconciliation in that you have not demanded your ladys estate so soon as you were entitled to make the demand an excellent contriver surely she must think this worthy mr tomlinson to be  but the captain adds that if either the lady or i disapprove of his report of our marriage he will retract it nevertheless he must tell me that mr john harlowe is very much set upon this way of proceeding as the only one in his opinion capable of being improved into a general reconciliation but if we do acquiesce in it he beseeches my fair one not to suspend my day that he may be authorized in what he says as to the truth of the main fact how conscientious this good man nor must it be expected he says that her uncle will take one step toward the wishedfor reconciliation till the solemnity is actually over  he adds that he shall be very soon in town on other affairs and then proposes to attend us and give us a more particular account of all that passed or shall further pass between mr harlowe and him  well my dearest life what say you to your uncles expedient shall i write to the captain and acquaint him that we have no objection to it  she was silent for a few minutes at last with a sigh  see mr lovelace said she what you have brought me to by treading after you in such crooked paths  see what disgrace i have incurred  indeed you have not acted like a wise man  my beloved creature do you not remember how earnestly i besought the honor of your hand before we came to town  had i been then favored   well well sir  there has been much amiss somewhere that is all i will say at present and since what is past cannot be recalled my uncle must be obeyed i think  charmingly dutiful  i had nothing then to do that i might not be behindhand with the worthy captain and her uncle but to press for the day this  fervently did but as i might have expected her former answer was repeated that when the settlements were completed when the license was actually obtained it would be time enough to name the day and o mr lovelace said she turning from me with a grace inimitably tender her handkerchief at her eyes what a happiness if my dear uncle could be prevailed upon to be personally a father on this occasion to the poor fatherless girl   what is the matter with me  whence this dewdrop  a tear  as i hope to be saved it is a tear jack  very ready methinks  only on reciting  but her lively image was before me in the very attitude she spoke the words  and indeed at the time she spoke them these lines of shakespeare came into my head  thy heart is big get thee apart and weep passion i see is catching  for my eyes seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine begin to water  i withdrew and wrote to the captain to the following effect  that he would be so good as to acquaint his dear friend that we entirely acquiesced with what he had proposed and had already properly cautioned the gentlewomen of the house and their servants as well as our own that if he would in person give me the blessing of his dear nieces hand it would crown the wishes of both that his own day in this case as i presumed it would be a short one should be ours that by this means the secret would be in fewer hands that i myself thought the ceremony could not be too privately performed and this not only for the sake of the wise end he had intended to be answered by it but because i would not have lord m think himself slighted as he had once intended as i had told him to be our nuptial father had we not declined his offer in order to avoid a public wedding which his beloved niece would not come into while she was in disgrace with her friends  but that if he chose not to do us this honor i wished that captain tomlinson might be the trusty person whom he would have to be present on the happy occasion  i showed this letter to my fair one she was not displeased with it so jack we cannot now move too fast as to settlements and license the day is her uncles day or captain tomlinsons perhaps as shall best suit the occasion miss howes smuggling scheme is now surely provided against in all events  but i will not by anticipation make thee a judge of all the benefits that may flow from this my elaborate contrivance why will these girls put me upon my masterstrokes  and now for a little mine which i am getting ready to spring the first and at the rate i go on now a resolution and now a remorse perhaps the last  a little mine i call it but it may be attended with great effects i shall not however absolutely depend upon the success of it having much more effectual ones in reserve and yet great engines are often moved by little springs a small spark falling by accident into a powdermagazine has sometimes done more execution than an hundred cannon  come the worst to the worst the hymeneal torch and a white sheet must be my amend honorable as the french have it  letter xlvii mr belford to robert lovelace esquire tuesday june   unsuccessful as hitherto my application to thee has been i cannot for the heart of me forbear writing once more in behalf of this admirable woman and yet am unable to account for the zeal which impels me to take her part with an earnestness so sincere  but all her merit thou acknowlegest all thy own vileness thou confessest and even gloriest in it what hope then of moving so hardened a man  yet as it is not too late and thou art nevertheless upon the crisis i am resolved to try what another letter will do it is but my writing in vain if it do no good and if thou will let me prevail i know thou will hereafter think me richly entitled to thy thanks  to argue with thee would be folly the case cannot require it i will only entreat thee therefore that thou will not let such an excellence lose the reward of her vigilant virtue  i believe there never were libertines so vile but purposed at some future period of their lives to set about reforming and let me beg of thee that thou will in this great article make thy future repentance as easy as some time hence thou will wish thou had made it if thou proceedest i have no doubt that this affair will end tragically one way or other it must such a woman must interest both gods and men in her cause but what i most apprehend is that with her own hand in resentment of the perpetrated outrage she like another lucretia will assert the purity of her heart or if her piety preserve her from this violence that wasting grief will soon put a period to her days and in either case will not the remembrance of thy everduring guilt and transitory triumph be a torment of torments to thee  it is a seriously sad thing after all that so fine a creature should have fallen into such vile and remorseless hands for from thy cradle as i have heard thee own thou ever delightedst to sport with and torment the animal whether bird or beast that thou lovedst and had a power over  how different is the case of this fine woman from that of any other whom thou have seduced i need not mention to thee nor insist upon the striking difference justice gratitude thy interest thy vows all engaging thee and thou certainly loving her as far as thou art capable of love above all her sex she not to be drawn aside by art or to be made to suffer from credulity nor for want of wit and discernment that will be another cutting reflection to so fine a mind as hers the contention between you only unequal as it is between naked innocence and armed guilt in every thing else as thou ownest her talents greatly superior to thine  what a fate will hers be if thou art not at last overcome by thy reiterated remorses  at first indeed when i was admitted into her presence see vol iii p     and till i observed her meaning air and heard her speak i supposed that she had no very uncommon judgment to boast of for i made as i thought but just allowances for her blossoming youth and for that loveliness of person and easiness of dress which i imagined must have taken up half her time and study to cultivate and yet i had been prepared by thee to entertain a very high opinion of her sense and her reading her choice of this gay fellow upon such hazardous terms thought i is a confirmation that her wit wants that maturity which only years and experience can give it her knowledge argued i to myself must be all theory and the complaisance ever consorting with an age so green and so gay will make so inexperienced a lady at least forbear to show herself disgusted at freedoms of discourse in which those present of her own sex and some of ours so learned so well read and so traveled allow themselves  in this presumption i run on and having the advantage as i conceited of all the company but thee and being desirous to appear in her eyes a mighty clever fellow i thought i showed away when i said any foolish things that had more sound than sense  them and when i made silly jests which attracted the smiles of thy sinclair and the specious partington and that miss harlowe did not smile too i thought was owing to her youth or affectation or to a mixture of both perhaps to a greater command of her features  little dreamt i that i was incurring her contempt all the time  but when as i said i heard her speak which she did not till she had fathomed us all when i heard her sentiments on two or three subjects and took notice of that searching eye darting into the very inmost cells of our frothy brains by my faith it made me look about me and i began to recollect and be ashamed of all i had said before in short was resolved to sit silent till every one had talked round to keep my folly in countenance and then i raised the subjects that she could join in and which she did join in so much to the confusion and surprise of everyone of us  for even thou lovelace so noted for smart wit repartee and a vein of raillery that delights all who come near thee sattest in palpable darkness and lookedst about thee as well as we  one instance only of this shall i remind thee of  we talked of wit and of wit and aimed at it bandying it like a ball from one to another of us and resting it chiefly with thee who were always proud enough and vain enough of the attribute and then more especially as thou had assembled us as far as i know principally to show the lady thy superiority over us and us thy triumph over her and then tourville who is always satisfied with wit at secondhand wit upon memory other mens with repeated some verses as applicable to the subject which two of us applauded though full of double entendre thou seeing the ladys serious air on one of those repetitions appliedst thyself to her desiring her notions of wit a quality thou said which every one prized whether flowing from himself or found in another  then it was she took all our attention  it was a quality much talked of she said but she believed very little understood  at least if she might be so free as to give her judgment of it from what had passed in the present conversation she must say that wit with gentlemen was one thing with ladies another  this startled us all  how the women looked  how they pursed in their mouths a broad smile the moment before upon each from the verses they had heard repeated so well understood as we saw by their looks  while i besought her to let us know for our instruction what wit was with ladies for such i was sure it ought to be with gentlemen  cowley she said had defined it prettily by negatives  thou desiredst her to repeat his definition  she did and with so much graceful ease and beauty and propriety of accent as would have made bad poetry delightful  a thousand different shapes it bears comely in thousand shapes appears it is not a tale it is not a jest admired with laughter at a feast nor florid talk which must this title gain the proofs of wit for ever must remain much less can that have any place at which a virgin hides her face such dross the fire must purge away  it is just the author blush there where the reader must here she stopped looking round her upon us all with conscious superiority as i thought lord how we stard thou attemptedst to give us thy definition of wit that thou might have something to say and not seem to be surprised into silent modesty  but as if she cared not to trust thee with the subject referring to the same author as for his more positive decision she thus with the same harmony of voice and accent emphatically decided upon it  wit like a luxuriant vine unless to virtues prop it join firm and erect towered heaven bound though it with beauteous leaves and pleasant fruit be crowned it lies deformed and rotting on the ground if thou recollectest this part of the conversation and how like fools we looked at one another how much it put us out of conceit with ourselves and made us fear her when we found our conversation thus excluded from the very character which our vanity had made us think unquestionably ours and if thou profitest properly by the recollection thou will be of my mind that there is not so much wit in wickedness as we had flattered ourselves there was  and after all i have been of opinion ever since that conversation that the wit of all the rakes and libertines i ever conversed with from the brilliant bob lovelace down to little johnny hartop the punster consists mostly in saying bold and shocking things with such courage as shall make modest people blush the impudent laugh and the ignorant stare  and why do thou think i mention these things so malapropos as it may seem  only let me tell thee as an instance among many that might be given from the same evenings conversation of this fine ldys superiority in those talents which ennoble nature and dignify her sex evidenced not only to each of us as we offended but to the flippant partington and the grosser but egregiously hypocritical sinclair in the correcting eye the discouraging blush in which was mixed as much displeasure as modesty and sometimes as the occasion called for it for we were some of us hardened above the sense of feeling delicate reproof by the sovereign contempt mingled with a disdainful kind of pity that showed at once her own conscious worthy and our despicable worthlesness  o lovelace what then was the triumph even in my eye and what is it still upon reflection of true modesty of true wit and true politeness over frothy jest laughing impertinence and an obscenity so shameful even to the guilty that they cannot hint at it but under a double meaning  then as thou have somewhere observed all her correctives avowed by her eye not poorly like the generality of her sex affecting ignorance of meanings too obvious to be concealed but so resenting as to show each impudent laugher the offense given to and taken by a purity that had mistaken its way when it fell into such company  such is the woman such is the angel whom thou have betrayed into thy power and would deceive and ruin  sweet creature did she but know how she is surrounded as i then thought as well as now think and what is intended how much sooner would death be her choice than so dreadful a situation  and how effectually would her story were it generally known warn all the sex against throwing themselves into the power of ours let our vows oaths and protestations be what they will  but let me beg of thee once more my dear lovelace if thou have any regard for thy honor for the honor of thy family for thy future peace or for my opinion of thee who yet pretend not to be so much moved by principle as by that dazzling merit which ought still more to attract thee to be prevailed upon  to be  to be humane that is all  only that thou would not disgrace our common humanity  hardened as thou art i know that they are the abandoned people in the house who keep thee up to a resolution against her o that the sagacious fair one with so much innocent charity in her own heart had not so resolutely held those women at distance  that as she boarded there she had oftener tabled with them specious as they are in a weeks time she would have seen through them they could not have been always so guarded as they were when they saw her but seldom and when they prepared themselves to see her and she would have fled their house as a place infected and yet perhaps with so determined an enterprizer this discovery might have accelerated her ruin  i know that thou art nice in thy loves but are there not hundreds of women who though not utterly abandoned would be taken with thee for mere personal regards make a toy if thou will of principle with regard to such of the sex as regard it as a toy but rob not an angel of those purities which in her own opinion constitute the difference between angelic and brutal qualities  with regard to the passion itself the less of soul in either man or woman the more sensual are they thou lovelace have a soul though a corrupted one and art more intent as thou even gloriest upon the preparative stratagem than upon the end of conquering  see we not the natural bent of idiots and the crazed  the very appetite is body and when we ourselves are most fools and crazed then are we most eager in these pursuits see what fools this passion makes the wisest men what snivellers what dotards when they suffer themselves to be run away with by it  an unpermanent passion  since if ashamed of its more proper name we must call it love love gratified is love satisfied  and love satisfied is indifference begun and this is the case where consent on one side adds to the obligation on the other what then but remorse can follow a forcible attempt  do not even chaste lovers choose to be alone in their courtship preparations ashamed to have even a child to witness to their foolish actions and more foolish expressions  is this deified passion in its greatest altitudes fitted to stand the day  do not the lovers when mutual consent awaits their wills retire to coverts and to darkness to complete their wishes and shall such a sneaking passion as this which can be so easily gratified by viler objects be permitted to debase the noblest  were not the delays of thy vile purposes owing more to the awe which her majestic virtue has inspired thee with than to thy want of adroitness in villainy i must write my free sentiments in this case for have i not seen the angel i should be ready to censure some of thy contrivances and pretenses to suspend the expected day as trite stale and to me who know thy intention poor and too often resorted to as nothing comes of them to be gloried in particularly that of mennell the vapourish lady and the readyfurnished house  she must have thought so too at times and in her heart despised thee for them or love thee ungrateful as thou art to her misfortune as well as entertain hope against probability but this would afford another warning to the sex were they to know her story as it would show them what poor pretenses they must seem to be satisfied with if once they put themselves into the power of a designing man  if trial only was thy end as once was thy pretense see vol iii letter xvii  enough surely have thou tried this paragon of virtue and vigilance but i knew thee too well to expect at the time that thou would stop there men of our cast whenever they form a design upon any of the sex put no other bound to their views than what want of power gives them i knew that from one advantage gained thou would proceed to attempt another thy habitual aversion to wedlock too well i knew and indeed thou avowest thy hope to bring her to cohabitation in that very letter in which thou pretendest trial to be thy principal view vol iii p           but do not even thy own frequent and involuntary remorses when thou have time place company and every other circumstance to favor thee in thy wicked design convince thee that there can be no room for a hope so presumptuous  why then since thou would choose to marry her rather than lose her will thou make her hate thee for ever  but if thou dare to meditate personal trial and art sincere in thy resolution to reward her as she behaves in it let me beseech thee to remove her from this vile house that will be to give her and thy conscience fair play so entirely now does the sweet deluded excellence depend upon her supposed happier prospects that thou need not to fear that she will fly from thee or that she will wish to have recourse to that scheme of miss how which has put thee upon what thou call thy masterstrokes  but whatever be thy determination on this head and if i write not in time but that thou have actually pulled off the mask let it not be one of thy devices if thou would avoid the curses of every heart and hereafter of thy own to give her no not for one hour be her resentment ever so great into the power of that villainous woman who has if possible less remorse than thyself and whose trade it is to break the resisting spirit and utterly to ruin the heart unpractised in evil  o lovelace lovelace how many dreadful stories could this horrid woman tell the sex and shall that of miss clarissa harlowe swell the guilty list  but this i might have spared of this devil as thou art thou can not be capable thou could not enjoy a triumph so disgraceful to thy wicked pride as well as to humanity  should thou think that the melancholy spectacle hourly before me has made me more serious than usual perhaps thou will not be mistaken but nothing more is to be inferred from hence were i even to return to my former courses but that whenever the time of cool reflection comes whether brought on by our own disasters or by those of others we shall undoubtedly if capable of thought and if we have time for it think in the same manner  we neither of us are such fools as to disbelieve a futurity or to think whatever be our practice that we came hither by chance and for no end but to do all the mischief that we have in our power to do  nor am i ashamed to own that in the prayers which my poor uncle makes me read to him in the absence of a very good clergyman who regularly attends him i do not forget to put in a word or two for myself  if lovelace thou laughest at me thy ridicule will be more conformable to thy actions than to thy belief  devils believe and tremble can thou be more abandoned than they  and here let me add with regard to my poor old man that i often wish thee present but for one half hour in a day to see the dregs of a gay life running off in the most excruciating tortures that the colic the stone and the gangrene can unitedly inflict and to hear him bewail the dissoluteness of his past life in the bitterest anguish of a spirit every hour expecting to be called to its last account  yet by all his confessions he has not to accuse himself in sixtyseven years of life of half the very vile enormities which you and i have committed in the last seven only  i conclude with recommending to thy serious consideration all i have written as proceeding from the heart and soul of  thy assured friend john belford  letter xlviii mr lovelace to john belford esquire tuesday p m june   difficulties still to be got over in procuring this plaguey license i ever hated and ever shall hate these spiritual lawyers and their court  and now jack if i have not secured victory i have a retreat  but hold  thy servant with a letter   a confounded long one though not a narrative one  once more in behalf of the lady  lie thee down oddity what can thou write that can have force upon me at this crisis  and have i not as i went along made thee to say all that was necessary for thee to say  yet once more i will take thee up  trite stale poor say thou are some of my contrivances that of the widows particularly  i have no patience with thee  had not that contrivance its effect at the time for a procrastination  and had i not then reason to fear that she would find enough to make her dislike this house and was it not right intending what i intended to lead her on from time o time with a notion that a house of her own would be ready for her soon in order to induce her to continue here till it was  trite stale and poor  thou art a silly fellow and no judge when thou say this had i not like a blockhead revealed to thee as i went along the secret purposes of my heart but had kept all in till the event had explained my mysteries i would have defied thee to have been able any more than the lady to have guessed at what was to befall her till it had actually come to pass nor doubt i in this case that instead of presuming to reflect upon her for credulity as loving me to her misfortune and for hoping against probability thou would have been readier by far to censure her for nicety and overscrupulousness and let me tell thee that had she loved me as i wished her to love me she could not possibly have been so very apprehensive of my designs nor so ready to be influenced by miss howes precautions as she has always been although my general character made not for me with her  but in thy opinion i suffer for that simplicity in my contrivances which is their principal excellence no machinery make i necessary no unnatural flights aim i at all pure nature taking advantage of nature as nature tends and so simple my devices that when they are known thou even thou imaginest thou could have thought of the same and indeed thou seem to own that the slight thou put upon them is owing to my letting thee into them beforehand undistinguishing as well as ungrateful as thou art  yet after all i would not have thee think that i do not know my weak places i have formerly told thee that it is difficult for the ablest general to say what he will do or what he can do when he is obliged to regulate his motions by those of a watchful enemy vol iii p      if thou give due weight to this consideration thou will not wonder that i should make many marches and countermarches some of which may appear to a slight observer unnecessary  but let me cursorily enter into this debate with thee on this subject now i am within sight of my journeys end  abundance of impertinent things thou tellest me in this letter some of which thou had from myself others that i knew before  all that thou say in this charming creatures praise is short of what i have said and written on this inexhaustible subject  her virtue her resistance which are her merits are my stimulatives have i not told thee so twenty times over  devil as these girls between them call me what of devil am i but in my contrivances i am not more a devil than others in the end i aim at for when i have carried my point it is still but one seduction and i have perhaps been spared the guilt of many seductions in the time  what of uncommon would there be in this case but for her watchfulness  as well as i love intrigue and stratagem do think that i had not rather have gained my end with less trouble and less guilt  the man let me tell thee who is as wicked as he can be is a worse man than i am let me ask any rake in england if resolving to carry his point he would have been so long about it or have had so much compunction as i have had  were every rake nay were every man to sit down as i do and write all that enters into his head or into his heart and to accuse himself with equal freedom and truth what an army of miscreants should i have to keep me in countenance  it is a maxim with some that if they are left alone with a woman and make not an attempt upon her she will think herself affronted  are not such men as these worse than i am  what an opinion must they have of the whole sex  let me defend the sex i so dearly love  if these elder brethren of ours thirsk they have general reason for their assertion they must have kept very bad company or must judge of womens hearts by their own she must be an abandoned woman who will not shrink as a snail into its shell at a gross and sudden attempt a modest woman must be naturally cold reserved and shy she cannot be so much and so soon affected as libertines are apt to imagine and must at least have some confidence in the honor and silence of a man before desire can possibly put forth in her to encourage and meet his flame for my own part i have been always decent in the company of women till i was sure of them nor have i ever offered a great offense till i have found little ones passed over and that they shunned me not when they knew my character  my divine clarissa has puzzled me and beat me out of my play at one time i hoped to overcome by intimidating her at another by love by the amorous seesaw as i have called it vol iii p     and i have only now to join surprise to the other two and see what can be done by all three  and whose property i pray thee shall i invade if i pursue my schemes of love and vengeance  have not those who have a right in her renounced that right  have they not wilfully exposed her to dangers  yet must know that such a woman would be considered as lawful prize by as many as could have the opportunity to attempt her  and had they not thus cruelly exposed her is she not a single woman  and need i tell thee jack that men of our cast the best of them the worst stick at nothing think it a great grace and favor done to the married men if they leave them their wives to themselves and compound for their sisters daughters wards and nieces  shocking as these principles must be to a reflecting mind yet such thou know are the principles of thousands who would not act by the sex as i have acted by them when in my power and as often carried into practice as their opportunities or courage will permit  such therefore have no right to blame me  thou repeatedly pleadest her sufferings from her family but i have too often answered this plea to need to say any more now than that she has not suffered for my sake for has she not been made the victim of the malice of her rapacious brother and envious sister who only waited for an occasion to ruin her with her other relations and took this as the first to drive her out of the house and as it happened into my arms  thou know how much against her inclination  as for her own sins how many has the dear creature to answer for to love and to me  twenty and twenty times twenty has she not told me that she refused not the odious solmes in favor to me and as often has she not offered to renounce me for the single life if the implacables would have received her on that condition  what repetitions does thy weak pity make me guilty of  to look a little farther back can thou forget what my sufferings were from this haughty beauty in the whole time of my attendance upon her proud motions in the purlieus of harloweplace and at the little white heart at neale as we called it  did i not threaten vengeance upon her then and had i not reason for disappointing me i will give but this one instance of a promised interview  o jack what a night had i of it in the bleak coppice adjoining to her fathers paddock  my linen and wig frozen my limbs absolutely numbed my fingers only sensible of so much warmth as enabled me to hold a pen and that obtained by rubbing the skin off and beating with my hands my shivering sides  kneeling on the hoar moss on one knee writing on the other if the stiff scrawl could be called writing  my feet by the time i had done seeming to have taken root and actually unable to support me for some minutes  love and rage kept then my heart in motion and only love and rage could do it or how much more than i did suffer must i have suffered  i told thee at my melancholy return what were the contents of the letter i wrote vol ii p      and i showed thee afterward her tyrannical answer to it vol iii p   0  thou then jack lovedst thy friend and pitiedst thy poor suffering lovelace even the affronted god of love approved then of my threatened vengeance against the fair promiser though now with thee in the day of my power forgetful of the night of my sufferings he is become an advocate for her  nay was it not he himself that brought to me my adorable nemesis and both together put me upon this very vow that i would never rest till i had drawn in this goddessdaughter of the harlowes to cohabit with me and that in the face of all their proud family  nor can thou forget this vow  at this instant i have thee before me as then thou sorrowfully lookedst  thy strong features glowing with compassion for me thy lips twisted thy forehead furrowed thy whole face drawn out from the stupid round into the ghastly oval every muscle contributing its power to complete the aspect grievous and not one word could thou utter but amen to my vow  and what of distinguishing love or favor or confidence have i had from her since to make me forego this vow  i renewed it not indeed afterward and actually for a long season was willing to forget it till repetitions of the same faults revived the remembrance of the former  and now adding to those the contents of some of miss howes virulent letters so lately come at what can thou say for the rebel consistent with thy loyalty to thy friend  every man to his genius and constitution hannibal was called the father of warlike stratagems had hannibal been a private man and turned his plotting head against the other sex or had i been a general and turned mine against such of my fellow creatures of my own as i thought myself entitled to consider as my enemies because they were born and lved in a different climate  hannibal would have done less mischief  lovelace more  that would have been the difference  not a sovereign on earth if he be not a good man and if he be of a warlike temper but must do a thousand times more mischief than me and why because he has it in his power to do more  an honest man perhaps thou wilt say will not wish to have it in his power to do hurt he ought not let me tell him for if he have it a thousand to one but it makes him both wanton and wicked  in what then am i so singularly vile  in my contrivances thou wilt say for thou art my echo if not in my proposed end of them  how difficult does every man find it as well as me to forego a predominant passion i have three passions that sway me by turns all imperial ones love revenge ambition or a desire of conquest  as to this particular contrivance of tomlinson and the uncle which thou wilt think a black one perhaps that had been spared had not these innocent ladies put me upon finding a husband for their mrs townsend that device therefore is but a preventive one think thou that i could bear to be outwitted and may not this very contrivance save a world of mischief for do thou think i would have tamely given up the lady to townsends tars  what meanest thou except to overthrow thy own plea when thou say that men of our cast know no other bound to their wickedness but want of power yet know this lady to be in mine  enough say thou have i tried this paragon of virtue not so for i have not tried her at all  all i have been doing is but preparation to a trial  but thou art concerned for the means that i may have recourse to in the trial and for my veracity  silly fellow  did ever any man think thou deceive a girl but at the expense of his veracity how otherwise can he be said to deceive  as to the means thou do not imagine that i expect a direct consent  my main hope is but in a yielding reluctance without which i will be sworn whatever rapes have been attempted none ever were committed one person to one person and good queen bess of england had she been living and appealed to would have declared herself of my mind  it would not be amiss for the sex to know what our opinions are upon this subject  i love to warn them  i wish no man to succeed with them but myself i told thee once that though a rake i am not a rakes friend vol iii p       thou say that i ever hated wedlock and true thou say and yet as true when thou tellest me that i would rather marry than lose this lady and will she detest me for ever think thou if i try her and succeed not  take care  take care jack  see thou not that thou warnest me that i do not try without resolving to conquer  i must add that i have for some time been convinced that i have done wrong to scribble to thee so freely as i have done and the more so if i make the lady legally mine for has not every letter i have written to thee been a bill of indictment against myself i may partly curse my vanity for it and i think i will refrain for the future for thou art really very impertinent  a good man i own might urge many of the things thou urgest but by my soul they come very aukwardly from thee and thou must be sensible that i can answer every tittle of what thou writest upon the foot of the maxims we have long held and pursued  by the specimen above thou will see that i can  and prythee tell me jack what but this that follows would have been the epitome of mine and my beloveds story after ten years cohabitation had i never written to thee upon the subject and had i not been my own accuser  robert lovelace a notorious womaneater makes his addresses in an honorable way to miss clarissa harlowe a young lady of the highest merit  fortunes on both sides out of the question  after encouragement given he is insulted by her violent brother who thinks it his interest to discountenance the match and who at last challenging him is obliged to take his worthless life at his hands  the family as much enraged as if he had taken the life he gave insult him personally and find out an odious lover for the young lady  to avoid a forced marriage she is prevailed upon to throw herself into mr lovelaces protection  yet disclaiming any passion for him she repeatedly offers to renounce him for ever if on that condition her relations will receive her and free her from the address of the hated lover  mr lovelace a man of strong passions and as some say of great pride thinks himself under very little obligation to her on this account and not being naturally fond of marriage and having so much reason to hate her relations endeavors to prevail upon her to live with him what he calls the life of honor and at last by stratagem art and contrivance prevails  he resolves never to marry any other woman takes a pride to have her called by his name a churchrite all the difference between them treats her with deserved tenderness nobody questions their marriage but these proud relations of hers whom he wishes to question it every year a charming boy fortunes to support the increasing family with splendour  a tender father always a warm friend a generous landlord and a punctual paymaster  nowandthen however perhaps indulging with a new object in order to bring him back with greater delight to his charming clarissa  his only fault love of the sex  which nevertheless the women say will cure itself  defensible thus far that he breaks no contracts by his roveings   and what is there so very greatly amiss as the world goes in all this   let me aver that there are thousands and ten thousands who have worse stories to tell than this would appear to be had i not interested thee in the progress to my great end and besides thou know that the character i gave myself to joseph leman as to my treatment of my mistresses is pretty near the truth vol iii p       were i to be as much in earnest in my defense as thou art warm in my arraignment i could convince thee by other arguments observations and comparisons  is not all human good and evil comparative that though from my ingenuous temper writing only to thee who art master of every secret of my heart i am so ready to accuse myself in my narrations yet i have something to say for myself to myself as i go along though no one else perhaps that was not a rake would allow any weight to it  and this caution might i give to thousands who would stoop for a stone to throw at me see that your own predominant passions whatever they be hurry you not into as much wickedness as mine do me  see if ye happen to be better than me in some things that ye are not worse in others and in points too that may be of more extensive bad consequence than that of seducing a girl and taking care of her afterward who from her cradle is armed with cautions against the delusions of men and yet i am not so partial to my own faults as to think lightly of that when i allow myself to think  another grave thing will i add now my hands in so dearly do i love the sex that had i found that a character for virtue had been generally necessary to recommend me to them i should have had a much greater regard to my morals as to the sex than i have had  to sum up all  i am sufficiently apprized that men of worthy and honest hearts who never allowed themselves in premeditated evil and who take into the account the excellencies of this fine creature will and must not only condemn but abhor me were they to know as much of me as thou do  but methinks i would be glad to escape the censure of those men and of those women too who have never known what capital trials and temptations are who have no genius for enterprise and most particularly of those who have only kept their secret better than i have kept or wished to keep mine  i threatened above to refrain writing to thee but take it not to heart jack  i must write on and cannot help it  letter xlix mr lovelace to john belford esquire wednesday night    oclock faith jack thou had half undone me with thy nonsense though i would not own it in my yesterdays letter my conscience of thy party before but i think i am my own man again  so near to execution my plot so near springing my mine all agreed upon between the women and me or i believe thou had overthrown me  i have time for a few lines preparative to what is to happen in an hour or two and i love to write to the moment   we have been extremely happy how many agreeable days have we known together what may the next two hours produce   when i parted with my charmer which i did with infinite reluctance half an hour ago it was upon her promise that she would not sit up to write or read for so engaging was the conversation to me and indeed my behavior throughout the whole of it was confessedly agreeable to her that i insisted if she did not directly retire to rest that she should add another happy hour to the former  to have sat up writing or reading half the night as she sometimes does would have frustrated my view as thou will observe when my little plot unravels  what  what  what now  bounding villain would thou choke me   i was speaking to my heart jack  it was then at my throat  and what is all this for  these shy ladies how when a man thinks himself near the mark do they tempest him   is all ready dorcas has my beloved kept her word with me  whether are these billowy heavings owing more to love or to fear i cannot tell for the soul of me which i have most of if i can but take her before her apprehension before her eloquence i awake   limbs why thus convulsed  knees till now so firmly knit why thus relaxed why beat ye thus together will not these trembling fingers which twice have refused to direct the pen and thus curvedly deform the paper failmein the arduous moment  once again why and for what all these convulsions this project is not to end in matrimony surely  but the consequences must be greater than i had thought of till this moment  my beloveds destiny or my own may depend upon the issue of the two next hours   i will recede i think   soft o virgin saint and safe as soft be thy slumbers   i will now once more turn to my friend belfords letter thou shall have fair play my charmer i will reperuse what thy advocate has to say for thee weak arguments will do in the frame i am in   but what is the matter  what is the matter  what a double  but the uproar abates  what a double coward am i  or is it that i am taken in a cowardly minute for heroes have their fits of fear cowards their brave moments and virtuous ladies all but my clarissa their moment critical   but thus coolly enjoying thy reflections in a hurricane  again the confusions renewed   what where  how came it   is my beloved safe   o wake not too roughly my beloved   letter l mr lovelace to john belford esquire thursday morning five oclock june   now is my reformation secured for i never shall love any other woman  o she is all variety she must be ever new to me  imagination cannot form much less can the pencil paint nor can the soul of painting poetry describe an angel so exquisitely so elegantly lovely  but i will not by anticipation pacify thy impatience although the subject is too hallowed for profane contemplation yet shall thou have the whole before thee as it passed and this not from a spirit wantoning in description upon so rich a subject but with a design to put a bound to thy roving thoughts  it will be iniquity greater than a lovelace ever was guilty of to carry them farther than i shall acknowledge  thus then connecting my last with the present i lead to it  did thou not by the conclusion of my former perceive the consternation i was in just as i was about to reperuse thy letter in order to prevail upon myself to recede from my purpose of awaking in terrors my slumbering charmer and what do thou think was the matter  i will tell thee   at a little after two when the whole house was still or seemed to be so and as it proved my clarissa abed and fast asleep i also in a manner undressed for an hour before and in my gown and slippers though to oblige thee writing on  i was alarmed by a trampling noise over head and a confused buz of mixed voices some louder than others like scolding and little short of screaming all raised to vocatives as in a fright and while i was wondering what could be the matter down stairs ran dorcas and at my door in an accent rather frightedly and hoarsly inward than shrilly clamorous cried out fire fire and this the more alarmed me as she seemed to endeavor to cry out louder but could not  my pen its last scrawl a benediction on my beloved dropped from my fingers and up started i and making but three steps to the door opened it and cried where where almost as much terrified as the wench while she more than halfundrest her perticoats in her hand unable to speak distinctly pointed up stairs  i was there in a moment and found all owing to the carelessness of mrs sinclairs cookmaid who having sat up to read the simple history of dorastus and fauia when she should have been in bed had set fire to an old pair of callicoe windowcurtains  she had had the presence of mind in her fright to tear down the halfburnt vallens as well as curtains and had got them though blazing into the chimney by the time i came up so that i had the satisfaction to find the danger happily over  mean time dorcas after she had directed me up stairs not knowing the worst was over and expecting every minute the house would be in a blaze out of tender regard for her lady i shall for ever love the wench for it ran to her door and rapping loudly at it in a recovered voice cried out with a shrilness equal to her love fire fire  the house is on fire  rise madam  this instant rise  if you would not be burnt in your bed  no sooner had she made this dreadful outcry but i heard her ladys door with hasty violence unbar unbolt unlock and open and my charmers voice sounding like that of one going into a fit  you may believe how much i was affected i trembled with concern for her and hastened down faster than the alarm of fire had made me run up in order to satisfy her that all the danger was over  when i had flown down to her chamber door there i beheld the charmingest creature in the world supporting herself on the arm of the gasping dorcas sighing trembling and ready to faint with nothing on but an underpetticoat her lovely bosom halfopen and her feet just slipped into her shoes as soon as she saw me she panted and struggled to speak but could only say oh mr lovelace and down was ready to sink  i clasped her in my arms with an ardor she never felt before my dearest life fear nothing i have been up  the danger is over  the fire is got under  and how foolish devil to dorcas could you thus by your hideous yell alarm and frighten my angel  oh jack how her sweet bosom as i clasped her to mine heaved and panted i could even distinguish her dear heart flutter flutter flutter against mine and for a few minutes i feared she would go into fits  lest the halflifeless charmer should catch cold in this undress i lifted her to her bed and sat down by her upon the side of it endeavoring with the utmost tenderness as well of action as expression to dissipate her terrors  but what did i get by this my generous care of her and by my successful endeavor to bring her to herself  nothing ungrateful as she was but the most passionate exclamations for we had both already forgot the occasion dreadful as it was which had thrown her into my arms i from the joy of incircling the almost disrobed body of the loveliest of her sex she from the greater terrors that arose from finding herself in my arms and both seated on the bed from which she had been so lately frighted  and now belford reflect upon the distance the watchful charmer had hitherto kept me at reflect upon my love and upon my sufferings for her reflect upon her vigilance and how long i had lain in wait to elude it the awe i had stood in because of her frozen virtue and overniceness and that i never before was so happy with her and then think how ngovernable must be my transports in those happy moments  and yet in my own account i was both decent and generous the following lines altered to the first person come nearest of any i can recollect to the rapturous occasion bowing i kneeled and her forced hand i pressed with sweet compulsion to my beating breast over it in ecstasy my lips bent low and tides of sighs twixt her grasped fingers flow high beat my hurried pulse at each fierce kiss and every burning sinew akd with bliss   but far from being affected by an address so fervent although from a man she had so lately owned a regard for and with whom but an hour or two before she had parted with so much satisfaction that  never saw a bitterer or more moving grief when she came fully to herself  she appealed to heaven against my treachery as she called it while i by the most solemn vows pleaded my own equal fright and the reality of the danger that had alarmed us both  she conjured me in the most solemn and affecting manner by turns threatening and soothing to quit her apartment and permit her to hide herself from the light and from every human eye  i besought her pardon yet could not avoid offending and repeatedly vowed that the next mornings sun should witness our espousals but taking i suppose all my protestations of this kind as an indication that i intended to proceed to the last extremity she would hear nothing that i said but redoubling her struggles to get from me in broken accents and exclamations the most vehement she protested that she would not survive what she called a treatment so disgraceful and villainous and looking all wildly round her as if for some instrument of mischief she espied a pair of sharppointed scissars on a chair by the bedside and endeavored to catch them up with design to make her words good on the spot  seeing her desperation i begged her to be pacified that she would hear me speak but one word declaring that i intended no dishonor to her and having seized the scissars i threw them into the chimney and she still insisting vehemently upon my distance i permitted her to take the chair  but o the sweet discomposure  her bared shoulders and arms so inimitably fair and lovely her spread hands crossed over her charming neck yet not half concealing its glossy beauties the scanty coat as she rose from me giving the whole of her admirable shape and fineturnd limbs her eyes runningover yet seeming to threaten future vengeance and at last her lips uttering what every indignant look and glowing feature portended exclaiming as if i had done the worst i could do and vowing never to forgive me will thou wonder that i could avoid resuming the incensed the already toomuchprovoked fair one  i did and clasped her once more to my bosom but considering the delicacy of her frame her force was amazing and showed how much in earnest she was in her resentment for it was with the utmost difficulty that i was able to hold her nor could i prevent her sliding through my arms to fall upon her knees which she did at my feet and there in the anguish of her soul her streaming eyes lifted up to my face with supplicating softness hands folded dishevelled hair for her night headdress having fallen off in her struggling her charming tresses fell down in naturally shining ringlets as if officious to conceal the dazzling beauties of her neck and shoulders her lovely bosom too heaving with sighs and broken sobs as if to aid her quivering lips in pleading for her  in this manner but when her grief gave way to her speech in words pronounced with that emphatical propriety which distinguishes this admirable creature in her elocution from all the women i ever heard speak did she implore my compassion and my honor  consider me dear lovelace were her charming words on my knees i beg you to consider me as a poor creature who has no protector but you who has no defense but your honor by that honor by your humanity by all you have vowed i conjure you not to make me abhor myself not to make me vile in my own eyes  i mentioned the morrow as the happiest day of my life  tell me not of tomorrow if indeed you mean me honorably now this very instant now you must show it and begone you can never in a whole long life repair the evils you may now make me suffer  wicked wretch  insolent villain  yes she called me insolent villain although so much in my power and for what  only for kissing with passion indeed her inimitable neck her lips her cheeks her forehead and her streaming eyes as this assemblage of beauties offered itself at once to my ravished sight she continuing kneeling at my feet as i sat  if i am a villain madam  and then my grasping but trembling hand  i hope i did not hurt the tenderest and loveliest of all her beauties  if i am a villain madam   she tore my ruffle shrunk from my happy hand with amazing force and agility as with my other arm i would have incircled her waist  indeed you are  the worst of villains  help dear blessed people and screamd  no help for a poor creature   am i then a villain madam  am i then a villain say you  and clasped both my arms about her offering to raise her to my bounding heart   o no  and yet you are  and again i was her dear lovelace  her hands again clasped over her charming bosom  kill me kill me  if i am odious enough in your eyes to deserve this treatment and i will thank you  too long much too long has my life been a burden to me  o wildly looking all around her give me but the means and i will instantly convince you that my honor is dearer to me than my life  then with still folded hands and freshstreaming eyes i was her blessed lovelace and she would thank me with her latest breath if i would permit her to make that preference or free her from farther indignities  i sat suspended for a moment by my soul thought i thou art upon full proof an angel and no woman still however close clasping her to my bosom as i had raised her from her knees she again slid through my arms and dropped upon them  see mr lovelace  good god that i should live to see this hour and to bear this treatment  see at your feet a poor creature imploring your pity who for your sake is abandoned of all the world let not my fathers curse thus dreadfully operate be not you the inflicter who have been the cause of it but spare me i beseech you spare me  for how have i deserved this treatment from you  for your own sake if not for my sake and as you would that god almighty in your last hour should have mercy upon you spare me   what heart but must have been penetrated  i would again have raised the dear suppliant from her knees but she would not be raised till my softened mind she said had yielded to her prayer and bid her rise to be innocent  rise then my angel rise and be what you are and all you wish to be only pronounce me pardoned for what has passed and tell me you will continue to look upon me with that eye of favor and serenity which i have been blessed with for some days past and i will submit to my beloved conquerss whose power never was at so great an height with me as now and retire to my apartment  god almighty said she hear your prayers in your most arduous moments as you have heard mine and now leave me this moment leave me to my own recollection in that you will leave me to misery enough and more than you ought to wish to your bitterest enemy  impute not every thing my best beloved to design for design it was not   o mr lovelace   upon my soul madam the fire was real  and so it was jack  the house might have been consumed by it as you will be convinced in the morning by ocular demonstration  o mr lovelace   let my passion for you madam and the unexpected meeting of you at your chamber door in an attitude so charming   leave me leave me this moment  i beseech you leave me looking wildly and in confusion now about her and now upon herself  excuse me dearest creature for those liberties which innocent as they were your too great delicacy may make you take amiss  no more no more  leave me i beseech you again looking upon herself and around her in a sweet confusion  begone begone  then weeping she struggled vehemently to withdraw her hands which all the while i held between mine  her struggles o what additional charms as i now reflect did her struggles give to every feature every limb of a person so sweetly elegant and lovely  impossible my dearest life till you pronounce my pardon  say but you forgive me  say you do  i beseech you begone leave me to myself that i may think what i can do and what i ought to do  that my dearest creature is not enough you must tell me that i am forgiven that you will see me tomorrow as if nothing had happened  and then clasping her again in my arms hoping she would not forgive me   i will  i do forgive you  wretch that you are  nay my clarissa and is it such a reluctant pardon mingled with a word so upbraiding that i am to be put off with when you are thus clasping her close to me in my power  i do i do forgive you  heartily  yes heartily  and freely  freely  and will you look upon me tomorrow as if nothing had passed  yes yes  i cannot take these peevish affirmatives so much like intentional negatives  say you will upon your honor  upon my honor then  o now begone begone and never   what never my angel  is this forgiveness  never said she let what has passed be remembered more  i insisted upon one kiss to seal my pardon  and retired like a fool a womans fool as i was  i sneakingly retired  could thou have believed it  but i had no sooner entered my own apartment than reflecting upon the opportunity i had lost and that all i had gained was but an increase of my own difficulties and upon the ridicule i should meet with below upon a weakness so much out of my usual character i repented and hastened back in hope that through the distress of mind which i left her in she had not so soon fastened her door and i was sully resolved to execute all my purposes be the consequence what it would for thought i i have already sinned beyond cordial forgiveness i doubt and if fits and desperation ensue i can but marry at last and then i shall make her amends  but i was justly punished  for her door was fast and hearing her sigh and sob as if her heart would burst my beloved creature said i rapping gently and her sobbings ceasing i want but to say three words to you which must be the most acceptable you ever heard from me let me see you but for one moment  i thought i heard her coming to open the door and my heart leapt in that hope but it was only to draw another bolt to make it still the faster and she either could not or would not answer me but retired to the further end of her apartment to her closet probably and more like a fool than before again i sneaked away  this was my mine my plot  and this was all i made of it  i love her more than ever  and well i may  never saw i such polished ivory as her arms and shoulders seemed to be never touched i velvet so soft as her skin then such an elegance o belford she is all perfection her pretty foot in her struggling losing her shoe but just slipped on as i told thee equally white and delicate as the hand of any other lady or even as her own hand  but see thou not that i have a claim of merit for a grace that everybody hitherto had denied me and that is for a capacity of being moved by prayers and tears where where on this occasion was the callus where the flint that my heart was said to be surrounded by  this indeed is the first instance in the like case that ever i was wrought upon but why because i never before encountered a resistance so much in ear nest a resistance in short so irresistible  what a triumph has her sex obtained in my thoughts by this trial and this resistance  but if she can now forgive me  can  she must has she not upon her honor already done it  but how will the dear creature keep that part of her promise which engages her to see me in the morning as if nothing had happened  she would give the world i fancy to have the first interview over  she had not best reproach me  yet not to reproach me  what a charming puzzle let her break her word with me at her peril fly me she cannot no appeals lie from my tribunal  what friend has she in the world if my compassion exert not itself in her favor  and then the worthy captain tomlinson and her uncle harlowe will be able to make all up for me be my next offense what it will  as to thy apprehensions of her committing any rashness upon herself whatever she might have done in her passion if she could have seized upon her scissars or found any other weapon i dare say there is no fear of that from her deliberate mind a man has trouble enough with these truly pious and truly virtuous girls now i believe there are such he had need to have some benefit from some security in the rectitude of their minds  in short i fear nothing in this lady but grief yet that is a slow worker you know and gives time to pop in a little joy between its sullen fits  letter li mr lovelace to john belford esquire thursday morning eight oclock her chamber door has not yet been opened i must not expect she will breakfast with me nor dine with me i doubt a little silly soul what troubles does she make to herself by her overniceness  all i have done to her would have been looked upon as a frolic only a rompingbout and laughed off by nine parts in ten of the sex accordingly the more she makes of it the more painful to herself as well as to me  why now jack were it not better upon her own notions that she seemed not so sensible as she will make herself to be if she is very angry  but perhaps i am more afraid than i need i believe i am from her overniceness arises my fear more than from any extraordinary reason for resentment next time she may count herself very happy if she come off no worse  the dear creature was so frightened and so fatigued last night no wonder she lies it out this morning  i hope she has had more rest than i have had soft and balmy i hope have been her slumbers that she may meet me in tolerable temper all sweetly blushing and confounded  i know how she will look  but why should she the sufferer be ashamed when i the trespasser am not  but custom is a prodigious thing the ladies are told how much their blushes heighten their graces they practice for them therefore blushes come as readily when they call them as their tears ay that is it while we men taking blushes for a sign of guilt or sheepishness are equally studious to suppress them  by my troth jack i am half as much ashamed to see the women below as my fair one can be to see me i have not yet opened my door that i may not be obtruded upon by them  after all what devils may one make of the sex to what a height of  what shall i call it  must those of it be arrived who once loved a man with so much distinction as both polly and slly loved me and yet can have got so much above the pangs of jealousy so much above the mortifying reflections that arise from dividing and sharing with new objects the affections of him they prefer to all others as to wish for an promote a competitorship in his love and make their supreme delight consist in reducing others to their level  for thou can not imagine how even sally martin rejoiced last night in the thought that the ladys hour was approaching   past ten oclock i never longed in my life for any thing with so much impatience as to see my charmer she has been stirring it seems these two hours  dorcas just now tappd at her door to take her morning commands  she had none for her was the answer  she desired to know if she would not breakfast  a sullen and lowvoiced negative she received  i will go myself  three different times tappd i at the door but had no answer  permit me dearest creature to inquire after your health as you have not been seen today i am impatient to know how you do  not a word of answer but a deep sigh even to sobbing  let me beg of you madam to accompany me up another pair of stairs  you will rejoice to see what a happy escape we have all had  a happy escape indeed jack  for the fire had scorched the windowboard findged the hangings and burnt through the slitdeal lining of the windowjambs  no answer madam  am i not worthy of one word  is it thus you keep your promise with me  shall i not have the favor of your company for two minutes only for two minutes in the dining room  hem  and a deep sigh  was all the answer  answer me but how you do answer me but that you are well  is this the forgiveness that was the condition of my obedience  then in a faintish but angry voice begone from my door  wretch inhuman barbarous and all that is base and treacherous  begone from my door nor teaze thus a poor creature entitled to protection not outrage  well madam i see how you keep your word with me  if a sudden impulse the effects of an unthoughtof accident cannot be forgiven   o the dreadful weight of a fathers curse thus in the letter of it so likely to be fulfilled  and then her voice dying away into inarticulate murmurs i looked through the keyhole and saw her on her knees her face though not toward me lifted up as well as hands and these folded deprecating i uppose that gloomy tyrants curse  i could not help being moved  my dearest life admit me to your presence but for two minutes and confirm your promised pardon and may lightning blast me on the spot if i offer any thing but my penitence at a shrine so sacred  i will afterward leave you for the whole day and till tomorrow morning then to attend with writings all ready to sign a license obtained or if it cannot a minister without one this once believe me when you see the reality of the danger that gave occasion for this your unhappy resentment you will think less hardly of me and let me beseech you to perform a promise on which i made a reliance not altogether ungenerous  i cannot see you would to heaven i never had if i write that is all i can do  let your writing then my dearest life confirm your promise and i will withdraw in expectation of it   past eleven oclock just now she rung her bell for dorcas and with her door in her hand only halfopend gave her a billet for me  how did the dear creature look dorcas  she was dressed turned her face quite from me sighed as if her heart would break  sweet creature  i kissed the wet wafer and drew it from the paper with my breath  these are the contents  no inscriptive sir no mr lovelace  i cannot see you nor will i if i can help it words cannot express the anguish of my soul on your baseness and ingratitude  if the circumstances of things are such that i can have no way for reconciliation with those who would have been my natural protectors from such outrages but through you the only inducement i can have to stay a moment longer in your knowledge pen and ink must be at present the only means of communication between us  vilest of men and most detestable of plotters how have i deserved from you the shocking indignities  but no more  only for your own sake wish not at least for a week to come to see  the undeservedly injured and insulted clarissa harlowe so thou see nothing could have stood me in stead but this plot of tomlinson and her uncle to what a pretty pass nevertheless have i brought myself  had caesar been such a fool he had never passed the rubicon but after he had passed it had he retreated re infecta intimidated by a senatorial edict what a pretty figure would he have made in history  i might have known that to attempt a robbery and put a person in bodily fear is as punishable as if the robbery had been actually committed  but not to see her for a week  dear pretty soul how she anticipates me in every thing the counselor will have finished the writings ready to sign today or tomorrow at furthest the license with the parson or the parson without the license must be also procured within the next fourandtwenty hours pritchard is as good as ready with his indentures tripartite tomlinson is at hand with a favorable answer from her uncle  yet not to see her for a week  dear sweet soul  her good angel is gone a journey is truanting at least but nevertheless in thy weeks time and much less my charmer i doubt not to have completed my triumph  but what vexes me of all things is that such an excellent creature should break her word  fie fie upon her  but nobody is absolutely perfect it is human to err but not to persevere  i hope my charmer cannot be inhuman     letter lii mr lovelace to john belford esquire kingsarms pallmall thursday two oclock several billets passed between us before i went out by the internuncioship of dorcas for which reason mine are superscribed by her married name  she would not open her door to receive them lest i should be near it i suppose so dorcas was forced to put them under the door after copying them for thee and thence to take the answer read them if thou will at this place  to mrs lovelace indeed my dearest life you carry this matter too far what will the people below who suppose us one as to the ceremony think of so great a niceness liberties so innocent the occasion so accidental  you will expose yourself as well as me  hitherto they know nothing of what has passed and what indeed has passed to occasion all this resentment  i am sure you will not by a breach of your word of honor give me reason to conclude that had i not obeyed you i could have fared no worse  most sincerely do i repent the offense given to your delicacy  but must i for so accidental an occurrence be branded by such shocking names vilest of men and most detestable of plotters are hard words  from such a ladys pen too  if you step up another pair of stairs you will be convinced that however detestable to you i am no plotter in this affair  i must insist upon seeing you in order to take your directions upon some of the subjects that we talked of yesterday in the evening  all that is more than necessary is too much i claim your promised pardon and wish to plead it on my knees  i beg your presence in the dining room for one quarter of an hour and i will then leave you for the day i am my dearest life  your everadoring and truly penitent lovelace   to mr lovelace i will not see you i cannot see you i have no directions to give you let providence decide for me as it pleases  the more i reflect upon your vileness your ingraful your barbarous vileness the more i am exasperated against you  you are the last person whose judgment i would take upon what is or is not carried too far in matters of decency  it is grievous to me to write or even to think of you at present urge me no more then once more i will not see you nor care i now you have made me vile to myself what other people think of me   to mrs lovelace again madam i remind you of your promise and beg leave to say i insist upon the performance of it  remember dearest creature that the fault of a blameable person cannot warrant a fault in one more perfect over niceness may be underniceness  i cannot reproach myself with any thing that deserves this high resentment  i own that the violence of my passion for you might have carried me beyond fit bounds  but that your commands and adjurations had such a power over me at such a moment i humbly presume to say deserves some consideration  you injoin me not to see you for a week if i have not your pardon before captain tomlinson comes to town what shall i say to him  i beg once more your presence in the dining room by my soul madam i must see you  i want to consult you about the license and other particulars of great importance the people below think us married and i cannot talk to you the door between us upon such subjects  for heavens sake favor me with your presence for a few minutes and i will leave you for the day  if i am to be forgiven according to your promise the earliest forgiveness must be the least painful to yourself as well as to  your truly contrite and afflicted lovelace   to mr lovelace the more you teaze me the worse will it be for you  time is wanted to consider whether i ever should think of you at all at present it is my sincere wish that i may never more see your face  all that can afford you the least shadow of favor from me arises from the hopedfor reconciliation with my real not my judasprotector  i am careless at present of consequences i hate myself and who is it i have reason to value  not the man who could form a plot to disgrace his own hopes as well as a poor friendless creature made friendless by himself by outrages not to be thought of with patience   to mrs lovelace madam i will go to the commons and proceed in every particular as if i had not the misfortune to be under your displeasure  i must insist upon it that however faulty my passion on so unexpected an incident made me appear to a lady of your delicacy yet my compliance with your entreaties at such a moment as it gave you an instance of your power over me which few men could have shown ought duly considered to entitle me to the effects of that solemn promise which was the condition of my obedience  i hope to find you in a kinder and i will say juster disposition on my return whether i get the license or not let me beg of you to make the soon you have been pleased to bid me hope for tomorrow morning this will reconcile every thing and make me the happiest of men  the settlements are ready to sign or will be by night  for heavens sake madam do not carry your resentment into a displeasure so disproportionate to the offense for that would be to expose us both to the people below and what is of infinite more consequence to us to captain tomlinson let us be able i beseech you madam to assure him on his next visit that we are one  as i have no hope to be permitted to dine with you i shall not return till evening and then i presume to say i expect your promise authorizes me to use the word to find you disposed to bless by your consent for tomorrow  your adoring lovelace   what pleasure did i propose to take how to enjoy the sweet confusion i expected to find her in while all was so recent  but she must she shall see me on my return it were better for herself as well as for me that she had not made so much ado about nothing i must keep my anger alive lest it sink into compassion love and compassion be the provocation ever so great are hard to be separated while anger converts what would be pity without it into resentment nothing can be lovely in a mans eye with which he is thoroughly displeased  i ordered dorcas on putting the last billet under the door and finding it taken up to tell her that i hoped an answer to it before i went out  her reply was verbal tell him that i care not whither he goes nor what he does  and this reurged by dorcas was all she had to say to me  i looked through her keyhole at my going by her door and saw her on her knees at her beds feet her head and bosom on the bed her arms extended sweet creature and in an agony she seemed to be sobbing as i heard at that distance as if her heart would break  by my soul jack i am a pity full fellow recollection is my enemy  divine excellence  happy for so many days together  now so unhappy  and for what  but she is purity itself  and why after all should i thus torment  but i must not trust myself with myself in the humor i am in  waiting here for mowbray and mallory by whose aid i am to get the license i took papers out o my pocket to divert myself and thy last popt itself officiously the first into my hand i gave it the honor of a reperusal and this revived the subject with me which i had resolved not to trust myself with  i remember that the dear creature in her torn answer to my proposals says that condescension is not meanness she better knows how to make this out than any mortal breathing condescension indeed implies dignity and dignity ever was there in her condescension yet such a dignity as gave grace to the condescension for there was no pride no insult no apparent superiority indicated by it  this miss how confirms to be a part of her general character page    of this volume   i can tell her how she might behave to make me her own for ever she knows she cannot fly me she knows she must see me sooner or later the sooner the more gracious  i would allow her to resent not because the liberties i took with her require resentment were she not a clarissa but as it becomes her particular niceness to resent but would she show more love than abhorrence of me in her resentment would she seem if it were but to seem to believe the fire no device and all that followed merely accidental and descend upon it to tender expostulation and upbraiding for the advantage i would have taken of her surprise and would she at last be satisfied as well she may that it was attended with no further consequence and place some generous confidence in my honor power loves to be trusted jack i think i would put an end to all her trials and pay her my vows at the altar  yet to have taken such bold steps as with tomlinson and her uncle  to have made such a progress  o belford belford how have i puzzled myself as well as her  this cursed aversion to wedlock how has it entangled me  what contradictions has it not made me guilty of  how pleasing to myself to look back upon the happy days i gave her though mine would doubtless have been more unmixedly so could i have determined to lay aside my contrivances and to be as sincere all the time as she deserved that i should be  i  find this humor hold but till tomorrow moring and it has now lasted two full hours and i s  nks to have pleasure in encouraging it  th make thee a visit i think or get thee to come to me and then will i consult thee upon it  but she will not trust me she will not confide in my honor doubt in this case is defiance she loves me not well enough to forgive me generously she is so greatly above me how can i forgive her for a merit so mortifying to my pride she thinks she knows she has told me that she is above me these words are still in my ears begone lovelace  my soul is above thee man  thou have a proud heart to contend with  my soul is above thee man see page     of this volume  miss how thinks her above me too thou even thou my friend my intimate friend and companion art of the same opinion i fear her as much as i love her  how shall my pride bear these reflections  my wife as i have so often said because it so often recurs to my thoughts to be so much my superior  myself to be considered but as the second person in my own family  can thou teach me to bear such a reflection as this  to tell me of my acquisition in her and that she with all her excellencies will be mine in full property is a mistake  it cannot be so  for shall i not be hers and not my own  will not every act of her duty as i cannot deserve it be a condescension and a triumph over me  and must i owe it merely to her goodness that she does not despise me  to have her condescend to bear with my follies  to wound me with an eye of pity  a daughter of the harlowes thus to excel the last and as i have heretofore said not the meanest of the lovelaces  forbid it   yet forbid it not  for do i not now  do i not every moment  see her before me all over charms and elegance and purity as in the struggles of the past midnight and in these struggles heart voice eyes hands and sentiments so greatly so gloriously consistent with the character she has sustained from her cradle to the present hour  but what advantages do i give thee  yet have i not always done her justice why then thy teazing impertinence  however i forgive thee jack  since so much generous love am i capable of i had rather all the world should condemn me than that her character should suffer the least impeachment  the dear creature herself once told me that there was a strange mixture in my mind vol iii p       i have been called devil and beelzebub between the two proud beauties i must indeed be a beelzebub if i had not some tolerable qualities  but as miss how says her sufferingtime is her shiningtime vol iv p     hitherto she has done nothing but shine  she called me villain belford within these few hours and what is the sum of the present argument but that had i not been a villain in her sense of the word she had not been so much an angel  o jack jack this midnight attempt has made me mad has utterly undone me how can the dear creature say i have made her vile in her own eyes when her behavior under such a surprise and her resentment under such circumstances have so greatly exalted her in mine  whence however this strange rhapsody  is it owing to my being here that i am not at sinclairs but if there be infection in that house how has my beloved escaped it  but no more in this strain  i will see what her behavior will be on my return  yet already do i begin to apprehend some little sinkings some little retrogradations for i have just now a doubt arisen whether for her own sake i should wish her to forgive me lightly or with difficulty  i am in away to come at the wished for license  i have now given everything between my beloved and me a full consideration and my puzzle is over what has brought me to a speedier determination is that i think i have found out what she means by the weeks distance she intends to hold me at it is that she may have time to write to miss how to put in motion that cursed scheme of hers and to take measures upon it which shall enable her to abandon and renounce me for ever  now jack if i obtain not admission to her presence on my return but am refused with haughtiness if her week be insisted upon such prospects before her i shall be confirmed in my conjecture and it will be plain to me that weak at best was that love which could give place to punctilio at a time that the allreconciling ceremony so she must think waits her command  then will i recollect all her perversenesses then will i reperuse miss howes letters and the transcripts from others of them and give way to my aversion to the life of shackles and then shall she be mine in my own way  but after all i am in hopes that she will have better considered of everything by the evening that her threat of a weeks distance was thrown out in the heat of passion and that she will allow that i have as much cause to quarrel with her for breach of her word as she has with me for breach of the peace  these lines of row have got into my head and i shall repeat them very devoutly all the way the chairmen shall poppet me toward her byandby  teach me some power the happy art of speech to dress my purpose up in gracious words such as may softly steal upon her soul and never waken the tempestuous passions letter liii mr lovelace to john belford esquire thursday evening june   o for a curse to kill with  ruined undone outwitted tricked  zounds man the lady is gone off  absolutely gone off  escaped   thou know not nor can conceive the pangs that wring my heart  what can i do  o lord o lord o lord  and thou too who have endeavored to weaken my hands wilt but clap thy dragons wings at the tidings   yet i must write or i shall go distracted little less have i been these two hours dispatching messengers to every stage to every inn to every wagon or coach whether flying or creeping and to every house with a bill up for five miles round  the little hypocrite who knows not a soul in this town  i thought i was sure of her at any time such an unexperienced traitress giving me hope too in her first billet that her expectation of the familyreconciliation would withold her from taking such a step as this  curse upon her contrivances  i thought that it was owing to her bashfulness to her modesty that after a few innocent freedoms she could not look me in the face when all the while she was impudently yes i say impudently though she be clarissa harlowe contriving to rob me of the dearest property i had ever purchased  purchased by a painful servitude of many months fighting through the wild beasts of her family for her and combating with a windmill virtue that has cost me millions of perjuries only to attempt and which now with its damned airfans has tossed me a mile and a half beyond hope  and this just as i had arrived within view of the consummation of all my wishes  o devil of love god of love no more  how have i deserved this of thee  never before the friend of frozen virtue  powerless demon for powerless thou must be if thou meanedst not to play me booty who shall henceforth kneel at thy altars  may every enterprizing heart abhor despise execrate renounce thee as i do  but what signifies cursing now  how she could effect this her wicked escape is my astonishment the whole sisterhood having charge of her  for as yet i have not had patience enough to inquire into the particulars nor to let a soul of them approach me  of this i am sure or i had not brought her hither there is not a creature belonging to this house that could be corrupted either by virtue or remorse the highest joy every infernal nymph of this worse than infernal habitation could have known would have been to reduce this proud beauty to her own level  and as to my villain who also had charge of her he is such a seasoned varlet that he delights in mischief for the sake of it no bribe could seduce him to betray his trust were there but wickedness in it  it is well however he was out of my way when the cursed news was imparted to me  gone the villain in quest of her not to return nor to see my ace so it seems he declared till he has heard some tidings of her and all the outofplace varlets of his numerous acquaintance are summoned and employed in the same business  to what purpose brought i this angel angel i must yet call her to this hellish house  and was i not meditating to do her deserved honor by my soul belford i was resolved  but thou know what i had conditionally resolved  and now though i was determined so much in her favor who can tell what hands she may have fallen into  i am mad stark mad by jupiter at the thoughts of this  unprovided destitute unacquainted  some villain worse than myself who adores her not as i adore her may have seized her and taken advantage of her distress  let me perish belford if a whole hecatomb of innocents as the little plagues are called shall atone for the broken promise and wicked artifices of this cruel creature  coming home with resolutions so favorable to her judge thou of my distraction when her escape was first hinted to me although but in broken sentences i knew not what i said nor what i did i wanted to kill somebody i flew out of one room into another while all avoided me but the veteran betty carberry who broke the matter to me i charged bribery and corruption in my first fury upon all and threatened destruction to old and young as they should come in my way  dorcas continues locked up from me sally and polly have not yet dared to appear the vile sinclair   but here comes the odious devil she taps at the door though that is only ajar whining and snuffling to try i suppose to coax me into temper  what a helpless state where a man can only execrate himself and others the occasion of his rage remaining the evil increasing upon reflection time itself conspiring to deepen it  o how i cursed her  i have her now methinks before me blubbering  how odious does sorrow make an ugly face  thine jack and this old beldams in penitentials instead of moving compassion must evermore confirm hatred while beauty in tears is beauty heightened and what my heart has ever delighted to see   what excuse  confound you and your cursed daughters what excuse can you make is she not gone  has she not escaped  but before i am quite distracted before i commit half a hundred murders let me hear how it was  i have heard her story  art damned confounded wicked unpardonable art in a woman of her character  but show me a woman and i will show thee a plotter  this plaguey sex is art itself every individual of it is a plotter by nature  this is the substance of the old wretchs account  she told me that i had no sooner left the vile house than dorcas acquainted the syren do jack let me call her names  i beseech thee jack let me call her names than dorcas acquainted her lady with it and that i had left word that i was gone to doctorscommons and should be heard of for some hours at the horn there if inquired after by the counselor or anybody else that afterward i should be either at the cocoatree or kingsarms and should not return till late she then urged her to take some refreshment  she was in tears when dorcas approached her her saucy eyes swelled with weeping she refused either to eat or drink sighed as if her heart would break false devilish grief not the humble silent grief that only deserves pity  contriving to ruin me to despoil me of all that i held valuable in the very midst of it  nevertheless being resolved not to see me for a week at least she ordered her to bring her up three or four french rolls with a little butter and a decanter of water telling her she would dispense with her attendance and that should be all she would live upon in the interim so artful creature pretending to lay up for a weeks siege  for as to substantial food she no more than other angels  angels said i  the devil take me if she shall be any more an angel  for she is odious in my eyes and i hate her mortally   but oh lovelace thou lie  she is all that is lovely all that is excellent   but is she can she be gone  o how miss how will triumph  but if that little fury receive her fate shall make me rich amends for then will i contrive to have them both  i was looking back for connection  but the devil take connection i have no business with it the contrary best befits distraction and that will soon be my lot  dorcas consulted the old wretch about obeying her o yes by all means for mr lovelace knew how to come at her at any time and directed a bottle of sherry to be added  this cheerful compliance so obliged her that she was prevailed upon to go up and look at the damage done by the fire and seemed not only shocked at it but satisfied it was no trick as she owned she had at first apprehended it to be all this made them secure and they laughed in their sleeves to think what a childish way of showing her resentment she had found out sally throwing out her witticisms that mrs lovelace was right however not to quarrel with her bread and butter  now this very childishness as they thought it in such a genius would have made me suspect either her head after what had happened the night before or her intention when the marriage was so far as she knew to be completed within the week she was resolved to secret herself from me in the same house  she sent will with a letter to wilsons directed to miss how ordering him to inquire if there were not one for her there  he only pretended to go and brought word there was none and put her letter in his pocket for me  she then ordered him to carry another which she gave him to the horntavern to me  all this done without any seeming hurry yet she appeared to be very solemn and put her handkerchief frequently to her eyes  will pretended to come to me with this letter but though the dog had the sagacity to mistrust something on her sending him out a second time and to me whom she had refused to see which he thought extraordinary and mentioned his mistrusts to sally polly and dorcas yet they made light of his suspicions dorcas assuring them all that her lady seemed more stupid with her grief than active and that she really believed she was a little turned in her head and knew not what she did  but all of them depended upon her inexperience her open temper and upon her not making the least motion toward going out or to have a coach or chair called as sometimes she had done and still more upon the preparations she had made for a weeks siege as i may call it  will went out pretending to bring the letter to me but quickly returned his heart still misgiving him on recollecting my frequent cautions that he was not to judge for himself when he had positive orders but if any doubt occurred from circumstances i could not foresee literally to follow them as the only way to avoid blame  but it must have been in this little interval that she escaped for soon after his return they made fast the streetdoor and hatch the mother and the two nymphs taking a little turn into the garden dorcas going up stairs and will to avoid being seen by his lady or his voice heard down into the kitchen  about half an hour after dorcas who had planted herself where she could see her ladys door open had the curiosity to go to look through the keyhole having a misgiving as she said that her lady might offer some violence to herself in the mood she had been in all day and finding the key in the door which was not very usual she tapped at it three or four times and having no answer opened it with madam madam did you call  supposing her in her closet  having no answer she stepped forward and was astonished to find her not there she hastily ran into the dining room then into my apartments searched every closet dreading all the time to behold some sad catastrophe  not finding her anywhere she ran down to the old creature and her nymphs with a have you seen my lady  then she is gone  she is nowhere above  they were sure she could not be gone out  the whole house was in an uproar in an instant some running up stairs some down from the upper rooms to the lower and all screaming how should they look me in the face  will cried out he was a dead man he blamed them they him and every one was an accuser and an excuser at the same time  when they had searched the whole house and every closet in it ten times over to no purpose they took it into their heads to send to all the porters chairmen and hackney coachmen that had been near the house for two hours past to inquire if any of them saw such a young lady describing her  this brought them some light the only dawning for hope that i can have and which keeps me from absolute despair one of the chairmen gave them this account that he saw such a one come out of the house a little before four in a great hurry and as if frighted with a little parcel tied up in a handkerchief in her hand that he took notice to his fellow who plied her without her answering that she was a fine young lady that he would warrant she had either a bad husband or very cross parents for that her eyes seemed swelled with crying upon which a third fellow replied that it might be a do escaped from mother damnables park this mrs sinclair told me with a curse and a wish that she knew the saucy villain  she thought truly that she had a better reputation so handsomely as she lived and so justly as she paid everybody for what she bought her house visited by the best and civillest of gentlemen and no noise or brawls ever heard or known in it  from these appearances the fellow who gave this information had the curiosity to follow her unperceived she often looked back everybody who passed her turned to look after her passing their verdicts upon her tears her hurry and her charming person till coming to a stand of coaches a coachman plied her was accepted alighted opened the coachdoor in a hurry seeing her hurry and in it she stumbled for haste and the fellow believed hurt her shins with the stumble  the devil take me belford if my generous heart is not moved for her notwithstanding her wicked deceit to think what must be her reflections and apprehensions at the time  a mind so delicate heeding no censures yet probably afraid of being laid hold of by a lovelace in everyone she saw at the same time not knowing to what dangers she was going to expose herself nor of whom she could obtain shelter a stranger to the town and to all its ways the afternoon far gone but little money and no clothes but those she had on  it is impossible in this little interval since last night that miss howes townsend could be cooperating  but how she must abhor me to run all these risques how heartily must she detest me for my freedoms of last night o that she had had greater reason for a resentment so violent  as to her virtue i am too much enraged to give her the merit due to that to virtue it cannot be owing that she should fly from the charming prospects that were before her but to malice hatred contempt harlowepride the worst of pride and to all the deadly passions that ever reigned in a female breast  and if i can but recover her  but be still be calm be hushed my stormy passions for is it not clarissa  harlowe must i say that thus i rave against  the fellow heard her say drive fast very fast where madam  to holborn bars answered she repeating drive very fast  and up she pulled both the windows and he lost sight of the coach in a minute  will as soon as he had this intelligence speeded away in hopes to trace her out declaring that he would never think of seeing me till he had heard some tidings of his lady  and now belford all my hope is that this fellow who attended us in our airing to hampstead to highgate to muzzlehill to kentishtown will hear of her at some one or other of those places  and on this i the rather build as i remember she was once after our return very inquisitive about the stages and their prices praising the convenience to passengers in their going off every hour and this in wills hearing who was then in attendance woe be to the villain if he recollect not this  i have been traversing her room meditating or taking up everything she but touched or used the glass she dressed at i was ready to break for not giving me the personal image it was wont to reflect of her whose idea is for ever present with me i call for her now in the tenderest now in the most reproachful terms as if within hearing wanting her i want my own soul at least everything dear to it what a void in my heart what a chilness in my blood as if its circulation were arrested from her room to my own in the dining room and in and out of every place where i have seen the beloved of my heart do i hurry in none can i tarry her lovely image in everyone in some lively attitude rushing cruelly upon me in differently remembered conversations  but when in my first fury at my return i went up two pair of stairs resolved to find the lockedup dorcas and beheld the vainlyburnt windowboard and recollected my baffled contrivances baffled by my own weak folly i thought my distraction completed and down i ran as one frighted at a spectre ready to howl for vexation my head and my temples shooting with a violence i had never felt before and my back aching as if the vertebrae were disjointed and falling in pieces  but now that i have heard the mothers story and contemplated the dawning hopes given by the chairmans information i am a good deal easier and can make cooler reflections most heartily pray i for wills success every four or five minutes if i lose her all my rage will return with redoubled fury the disgrace to be thus outwitted by a novice an infant in stratagem and contrivance added to the violence of my passion for her will either break my heart or what saves many a heart in evils insupportable turn my brain what had i to do to go out a licencehunting at least till i had seen her and made up matters with her and indeed were it not the privilege of a principal to lay all his own faults upon his underlings and never be to blame himself i should be apt to reflect that i am more in fault than anybody and as the sting of this reflection will sharpen upon me if i recover her not how shall i be able to bear it  if ever   here mr lovelace lays himself under a curse too shocking to be repeated if he revenge not himself upon the lady should be once more get her into his hands    i have just now dismissed the sniveling toad dorcas who was introduced to me for my pardon by the whining mother i gave her a kind of negative and ungracious forgiveness  yet i shall as violently curse the two nymphs byandby for the consequences of my own folly and this will be a good way too to prevent their ridicule upon me for losing so glorious an opportunity as i had last night or rather this morning  i have collected from the result of the inquiries made of the chairman and from dorcass observations before the cruel creature escaped a description of her dress and am resolved if i cannot otherwise hear of her to advertise her in the gazette as an eloped wife both by her maiden and acknowleged name for her elopement will soon be known by every enemy why then should not my friends be made acquainted with it from whose inquiries and informations i may expect some tidings of her  she had on a brown lustring nightgown fresh and looking like new as every thing she wears does whether new or not from an elegance natural to her a beaver hat a black ribband about her neck and blue knots on her breast a quilted petticoat of carnation colored satin a rosediamond ring supposed on her finger and in her whole person and appearance as i shall express it a dignity as well as beauty that commands the repeated attention of everyone who sees her  the description of her person i shall take a little more pains about my mind must be more at ease before i can undertake that and i shall threaten that if after a certain period given for her voluntary return she be not heard of i will prosecute any person who presumes to entertain harbor abett or encourage her with all the vengeance that an injured gentleman and husband may be warranted to take by law or otherwise  fresh cause of aggravation  but for this scribbling vein or i should still run mad  again going into her chamber because it was hers and sighing over the bed and every piece of furniture in it i cast my eye toward the drawers of the dressingglass and saw peep out as it were in one of the halfdrawn drawers the corner of a letter i snatched it out and found it superscribed by her to mr lovelace the sight of it made my heart leap and i trembled so that i could hardly open the seal  how does this damned love unman me  but nobody ever loved as i love  it is even increased by her unworthy flight and my disappointment ungrateful creature to fly from a passion thus ardently flaming which like the palm rises the more for being depressed and slighted  i will not give thee a copy of this letter i owe her not so much service  but would thou think that this haughty promisebreaker could resolve as she does absolutely and for ever to renounce me for what passed last night that she could resolve to forego all her opening prospects of reconciliation that reconciliation with a worthless family on which she had set her whole heart  yet she does  she acquits me of all obligation to her and herself of all expectations from me  and for what  o that indeed i had given her real cause damned confounded niceness prudery affectation or pretty ignorance if not affectation  by my soul belford i told thee all  i was more indebted to her struggles than to my own forwardness i cannot support my own reflections upon a decency so illrequited  she could not she would not have been so much a harlowe in her resentment had i deserved as i ought to have done her resentment all she feared had then been over and her own goodsense and even modesty would have taught her to make the best of it  but if ever again i get her into my hands art and more art and compulsion too if she make it necessary  and it is plain that nothing else will do shall she experience from the man whose fear of her has been above even his passion for her and whose gentleness and forbearance she has thus perfidiously triumphed over well says the poet it is nobler like a lion to invade when appetite directs and seize my prey than to wait tamely like a begging dog till dull consent throws out the scraps of love   thou know what i have so lately vowed  and yet at times cruel creature and ungrateful as cruel i can subscribe with too much truth to those lines of another poet she reigns more fully in my soul than ever she garrisons my breast and mans against me even my own rebel thoughts with thousand graces ten thousand charms and newdiscoverd beauties   letter live mr lovelace to john belford esquire a letter is put into my hands by wilson himself   such a letter   a letter from miss how to her cruel friend   i made no scruple to open it  it is a miracle that i fell not into fits at the reading of it and at the thought of what might have been the consequence had it come to the hands of this clarissa harlowe let my justlyexcited rage excuse my irreverence  collins though not his day brought it this afternoon to wilsons with a particular desire that it might be sent with all speed to miss beaumonts lodgings and given if possible into her own hands he had before been here at mrs sinclairs with intent to deliver it to her himself but was told  too truly told that she was abroad but that they would give her any thing he should leave for her the moment she returned  but he cared not to trust them with his business and went away to wilsons as i find by the description of him at both places and there left the letter but not till he had a second time called here and found her not come in  the letter which i shall enclose for it is too long to transcribe will account to thee for his coming hither  o this devilish miss how  something must be resolved upon and done with that little fury  thou will see the margin of this cursed letter crowded with indices  i put them to mark the places devoted for vengeance or requiring animadversion return thou it to me the moment thou have read it  read it here and avoid trembling for me if thou can  to miss laetitia beaumont wednesday june   my dearest friend you will perhaps think that i have been too long silent but i had begun two letters at different times since my last and written a great deal each time and with spirit enough i assure you incensed as i was against the abominable wretch you are with particularly on reading yours of the   st of the past month see letter xxvi of this vol p        the first i intended to keep open till i could give you some account of my proceedings with mrs townsend it was some days before i saw her and this intervenient space giving me time to reperuse what i had written i thought it proper to lay that aside and to write in a style a little less fervent for you would have blamed me i know for the freedom of some of my expressions  execrations if you please and when i had gone a good way in the second the change in your prospects on his communicating to you miss montagues letter and his better behavior occasioning a change in your mind i laid that aside also and in this uncertainty thought i would wait to see the issue of affairs between you before i wrote again believing that all would soon be decided one way or other  i had still perhaps held this resolution as every appearance according to your letters was more and more promising had not the two passed days furnished me with intelligence which it highly imports you to know   but i must stop here and take a little walk to try to keep down that just indignation which rises to my pen when i am about to relate to you what i must communicate  i am not my own mistress enough  then my mother  always up and down  and watching as if i were writing to a fellow  but i will try if i can contain myself in tolerable bounds   the women of the house where you are  o my dear  the women of the house  but you never thought highly of them  so it cannot be so very surprising  nor would you have staid so long with them had not the notion of removing to one of your own made you less uneasy and less curious about their characters and behavior yet i could now wish that you had been less reserved among them  but i teaze you  in short my dear you are certainly in a devilish house  be assured that the woman is one of the vilest of women  nor does she go to you by her right name  very true  her name is not sinclair  nor is the street she lives in doverstreet  did you never go out by yourself and discharge the coach or chair and return by another coach or chair if you did yet i dont remember that you ever wrote to me that you did you would never have found your way to the vile house either by the womans name sinclair or by the streets name mentioned by that doleman in his letter about the lodgings vol iii p   0    the wretch might indeed have held out these false lights a little more excusably had the house been an honest house and had his end only been to prevent mischief from your brother  but this contrivance was antecedent as i think to your brothers project so that no excuse can be made for his intentions at the time  the man whatever he may now intend was certainly then even then a villain in his heart    i am excessively concerned that i should be prevailed upon between your overniceness on one hand and my mothers positiveness on the other to be satisfied without knowing how to direct to you at your lodgings i think too that the proposal that i should be put off to a thirdhand knowledge or rather veiled in a firsthand ignorance came from him  and that it was only acquiesced in by you as it was by me see vol iii p     and p   0 where the reader will observe that the proposal came from herself which as it was also mentioned by mr lovelace as will be seen in miss harlowes letter p     she may be presumed to have forgot so that clarissa had a double inducement for acquiescing with the proposed method of carrying on the correspondence between miss how and herself by wilsons conveyance and by the name of laetitia beaumont  upon needless and weak considerations  because truly i might have it to say if challenged that i knew not where to send to you  i am ashamed of myself  had this been at first excusable it could not be a good reason for going on in the folly when you had no liking to the house and when he began to play tricks and delay with you  what i was to mistrust myself was i  i was to allow it to be thought that i could not keep my own secret  but the house to be taken at this time and at that time led us both on  like fools like tame fools in a string  upon my life my dear this man is a vile a contemptible villain  i must speak out  how has he laughed in his sleeve at us both i warrant for i cannot tell how long  and yet who could have thought that a man of fortune and some reputation this doleman i mean not your wretch to be sure  formerly a rake indeed  i have inquired after him  long ago and so was the easier satisfied  but married to a woman of family  having had a palsyblow  and one would think a penitent  should recommend such a house  why my dear he could not inquire of it but must find it to be bad  to such a man as lovelace to bring his future nay his then supposed bride to   i write perhaps with too much violence to be clear but i cannot help it yet i lay down my pen and take it up every ten minutes in order to write with some temper  my mother too in and out  what need i she asks me lock myself in if i am only reading past correspondencies  for that is my pretense when she comes poking in with her face sharpened to an edge as i may say by a curiosity that gives her more pain than pleasure  the lord forgive me but i believe i shall huff her next time she comes in  do you forgive me too my dear my mother ought because she says i am my fathers girl and because i am sure i am hers i dont know what to do  i dont know what to write next  i have so much to write yet have so little patience and so little opportunity  but i will tell you how i came by my intelligence   that being a fact and requiring the less attention i will try to account to you for that  thus then it came about  miss lardner whom you have seen at her cousin biddulphs saw you at st jamess church on sunday was fortnight she kept you in her eye during the whole time but could not once obtain the notice of yours though she courtesyd to you twice she thought to pay her compliments to you when the service was over for she doubted not but you were married  and for an odd reason  because you came to church by yourself  every eye as usual she said was upon you and this seeming to give you hurry and you being nearer the door than she you slid out before she could get to you but she ordered her servant to follow you till you were housed this servant saw you step into a chair which waited for you and you ordered the men to carry you to the place where they took you up  the next day miss lardner sent the same servant out of mere curiosity to make private inquiry whether mr lovelace were or were not with you there and this inquiry brought out from different people that the house was suspected to be one of those genteel wicked houses which receive and accommodate fashionable people of both sexes  miss lardner confounded at this strange intelligence made further inquiry injoining secrecy to the servant she had sent as well as to the gentleman whom she employed who had it confirmed from a rakish friend who knew the house and told him that there were two houses the one in which all decent appearances were preserved and guests rarely admitted the other the receptacle of those who were absolutely engaged and broken to the vile yoke    say  my dear creature  say  shall i not execrate the wretch  but words are weak  what can i say that will suitably express my abhorrence of such a villain as he must have been when he meditated to bring a clarissa harlowe to such a place  miss lardner kept this to herself some days not knowing what to do for she loves you and admires you of all women at last she revealed it but in confidence to miss biddulph by letter miss biddulph in like confidence being afraid it would distract me were i to know it communicated it to miss lloyd and so like a whispered scandal it passed through several canals and then it came to me which was not till last monday  i thought i should have fainted upon the surprising communication but rage taking place it blew away the sudden illness i besought miss lloyd to reinjoin secrecy to everyone i told her that i would not for the world that my mother or any of your family should know it and i instantly caused a trusty friend to make what inquiries he could about tomlinson   i had thoughts to have done it before but not imagining it to be needful and little thinking that you could be in such a house and as you were pleased with your changed prospects i forbore and the rather forbore as the matter is so laid that mrs hodges is supposed to know nothing of the projected treaty of accommodation but on the contrary that it was designed to be a secret to her and to everybody but immediate parties and it was mrs hodges that i had proposed to found by a second hand   now my dear it is certain without applying to that toomuch favored housekeeper that there is not such a man within ten miles of your uncle very true one tomkins there is about four miles off but he is a daylabourer and one thompson about five miles distant the other way but he is a parsh schoolmaster poor and about seventy   a man though but of  00 l a year cannot come from one county to settle in another but everybody in both must know it and talk of it   mrs hodges may yet be sounded at a distance if you will your uncle is an old man old men imagine themselves under obligation to their paramours if younger than themselves and seldom keep any thing from their knowledge but if we suppose him to make a secret of the designed treaty it is impossible before that treaty was thought of but she must have seen him at least have heard your uncle speak praisefully of a man he is said to be so intimate with let him have been ever so little a while in those parts   yet methinks the story is so plausible tomlinson as you describe him is so good a man and so much of a gentleman the end to be answered by his being an impostor so much more than necessary if lovelace has villainy in his head and as you are in such a house  your wretchs behavior to him was so petulant and lordly and tomlinsons answer so full of spirit and circumstance and then what he communicated to you of mr hickmans application to your uncle and of mrs nortons to your mother some of which particulars i am satisfied his vile agent joseph leman could not reveal to his viler employer his pressing on the marriageday in the name of your uncle which it could not answer any wicked purpose for him to do and what he writes of your uncles proposal to have it thought that you were married from the time that you had lived in one house together and that to be made to agree with the time of mr hickmans visit to your uncle the insisting on a trusty persons being present at the ceremony at that uncles nomination  these things make me willing to try for a tolerable construction to be made of all though i am so much puzzled by what occurs on both sides of the question that i cannot but abhor the devilish wretch whose inventions and contrivances are for ever employing an inquisitive head without affording the means of absolute detection  but this is what i am ready to conjecture that tomlinson specious as he is is a machine of lovelace and that he is employed for some end which has not yet been answered  this is certain that not only tomlinson but mennell who i think attended you more than once at this vile house must know it to be a vile house  what can you then think of tomlinsons declaring himself in favor of it upon inquiry  lovelace too must know it to be so if not before he brought you to it soon after   perhaps the company he found there may be the most probable way of accounting for his bearing with the house and for his strange suspensions of marriage when it was in his power to call such an angel of a woman his    o my dear the man is a villain the greatest of villains in every light  i am convinced that he is  and this doleman must be another of his implements   there are so many wretches who think that to be no sin which is one of the greatest and the most ungrateful of all sins to ruin young creatures of our sex who place their confidence in them that the wonder is less than the shame that people of figure of appearance at least are found to promote the horrid purposes of profligates of fortune and interest    but can i think you will ask with indignant astonishment that lovelace can have designs upon your honor   that such designs he has had if he still hold them not i can have no doubt now that i know the house he has brought you to to be a vile one this is a clue that has led me to account for all his behavior to you ever since you have been in his hands  allow me a brief retrospection of it all   we both know that pride revenge and a delight to tread in unbeaten paths are principal ingredients in the character of this finished libertine   he hates all your family yourself excepted and i have several times thought that i have seen him stung and mortified that love has obliged him to kneel at your footstool because you are a harlowe  yet is this wretch a savage in love  love that humanizes the fiercest spirits has not been able to subdue his his pride and the credit which a few plausible qualities sprinkled among his odious ones have given him have secured him too good a reception from our eyejudging our undistinguishing our selfflattering our tooconfiding sex to make assiduity and obsequiousness and a conquest of his unruly passions any part of his study   he has some reason for his animosity to all the men and to one woman of your family he has always shown you and all his own family too that he prefers his pride to his interest he is a declared marriagehater a notorious intriguer full of his inventions and glorying in them  he never could draw you in to declarations of love nor till your wise relations persecuted you as they did to receive his addresses as a lover  he knew that you professedly disliked him for his immoralities he could not therefore justly blame you for the coldness and indifference of your behavior to him   the prevention of mischief was your first main view in the correspondence he drew you into he ought not then to have wondered that you declared your preference of the single life to any matrimonial engagement he knew that this was always your preference and that before he tricked you away so artfully what was his conduct to you afterward that you should of a sudden change it  thus was your whole behavior regular consistent and dutiful to those to whom by birth you owed duty and neither prudish coquetish nor tyrannical to him   he had agreed to go on with you upon those your own terms and to rely only on his own merits and future reformation for your favor  it was plain to me indeed to whom you communicated all that you know of your own heart though not all of it that i found out that love had pretty early gained footing in it and this you yourself would have discovered sooner than you did had not his alarming his unpolite his rough conduct kept it under   i knew by experience that love is a fire that is not to be played with without burning ones fingers i knew it to be a dangerous thing for two single persons of different sexes to enter into familiarity and correspondence with each other since as to the latter must not a person be capable of premeditated art who can sit down to write and not write from the heart  and a woman to write her heart to a man practiced in deceit or even to a man of some character what advantage does it give him over her   as this mans vanity had made him imagine that no woman could be proof against love when his address was honorable no wonder that he struggled like a lion held in toils against a passion that he thought not returned  and how could you at first show a return in love  fierce a spirit and who had seduc  vile artifices but to the approval of those artifices   hence perhaps it is not difficult to believe that it became possible for such a wretch as this to give way to his old prejudices against marriage and to that revenge which had always been a first passion with him  this is the only way i think to account for his horrid views in bringing you to a vile house  and now may not all the rest be naturally accounted for  his delays  his teazing ways  his bringing you to bear with his lodging in the same house  his making you pass to the people of it as his wife though restrictively so yet with hope no doubt vilest of villains as he is to take you at advantage    his bringing you into the company of his libertine companions the attempt of imposing upon you that miss partington for a bedfellow very probably his own invention for the worst of purposes his terrifying you at many different times his obtruding himself upon you when you went out to church no doubt to prevent your finding out what the people were the advantages he made of your brothers foolish project with singleton  see my dear how naturally all this follows from the discovery made by miss lardner  see how the monster whom i thought and so often called a fool comes out to have been all the time one of the greatest villains in the world   but if this be so what it would be asked by an indifferent person has hitherto saved you glorious creature  what morally speaking but your watchfulness what but that and the majesty of your virtue the native dignity which in a situation so very difficult friendless destitute passing for a wife cast into the company of creatures accustomed to betray and ruin innocent hearts has hitherto enabled you to baffle overawe and confound such a dangerous libertine as this so habitually remorseless as you have observed him to be so very various in his temper so inventive so seconded so supported so instigated too probably as he has been  that native dignity that heroism i will call it which has on all proper occasions exerted itself in its full luster unmingled with that charming obligingness and condescending sweetness which is evermore the softner of that dignity when your mind is free and unapprehensive   let me stop to admire and to bless my beloved friend who unhappily for herself at an age so tender unacquainted as she was with the world and with the vile arts of libertines having been called upon to sustain the hardest and most shocking trials from persecuting relations on one hand and from a villainous lover on the other has been enabled to give such an illustrious example of fortitude and prudence as never woman gave before her and who as i have heretofore observed see p     has made a far greater figure in adversity than she possibly could have made had all her shining qualities been exerted in their full force and power by the continuance of that prosperous run of fortune which attended her for eighteen years of life out of nineteen   but now my dear do i apprehend that you are in greater danger than ever yet you have been in if you are not married in a week and yet stay in this abominable house for were you out of it i own i should not be much afraid for you  these are my thoughts on the most deliberate consideration that he is now convinced that he has not been able to draw you off your guard that therefore if he can obtain no new advantage over you as he goes along he is resolved to do you all the poor justice that it is in the power of such a wretch as he to do you he is the rather induced to this as he sees that all his own family have warmly engaged themselves in your cause and that it is his highest interest to be just to you then the horrid wretch loves you as well he may above all women i have no doubt of this  with such a love as such a wretch is capable of with such a love as herod loved his mariamne  he is now therefore very probably at last in earnest  i took time for inquiries of different natures as i knew by the train you are in that whatever his designs are they cannot ripen either for good or evil till something shall result from this new device of his about tomlinson and your uncle  device i have no doubt that it is whatever this dark this impenetrable spirit intends by it   and yet i find it to be true that counselor williams whom mr hickman knows to be a man of eminence in his profession has actually as good as finished the settlements that two draughts of them have been made one avowedly to be sent to one captain tomlinson as the clerk says  and i find that a license has actually been more than once endeavored to be obtained and that difficulties have hitherto been made equally to lovelaces vexation and disappointment my mothers proctor who is very intimate with the proctor applied to by the wretch has come at this information in confidence and hints that as mr lovelace is a man of high fortunes these difficulties will probably be got over  but here follow the causes of my apprehension of your danger which i should not have had a thought of since nothing very vile has yet been attempted but on finding what a house you are in and on that discovery laying together and ruminating on past occurrences  you are obliged from the present favorable appearances to give him your company when ever he requests it  you are under a necessity of forgetting or seeming to forget past disobligations and to receive his addresses as those of a betrothed lover  you will incur the censure of prudery and affectation even perhaps in your own apprehension if you keep him at that distance which has hitherto been your security  his sudden and as suddenly recovered illness has given him an opportunity to find out that you love him  alas my dear i knew you loved him he is as you relate every hour more and more an incroacher upon it he has seemed to change his nature and is all love and gentleness the wolf has put on the sheeps clothing yet more than once has shown his teeth and his hardly sheathed claws the instance you have given of his freedom with your person which you could not but resent and yet as matters are circumstanced between you could not but pass over when tomlinsons letter called you into his company see p           0 of this volume  show the advantage he has now over you and also that if he can obtain greater he will  and for this very reason as i apprehend it is that tomlinson is introduced that is to say to give you the greater security and to be a mediator if mortal offense be given you by any villainous attempt  the day seems not now to be so much in your power as it ought to be since that now partly depends on your uncle whose presence at your own motion he has wished on the occasion  a wish were all real very unlikely i think to be granted   and thus situated should he offer greater freedoms must you not forgive him  i fear nothing as i know who has said that devil carnate or incarnate can fairly do against a virtue so established see mrs nortons letter p    of this volume  but surprises my dear in such a house as that you are in and in such circumstances as i have mentioned i greatly fear  the man one who has already triumphed over persons worthy of his alliance   what then have you to do but to fly this house this infernal house  o that your heart would let you sly him   if you should be disposed so to do mrs townsend shall be ready at your command  but if you meet with no impediments no new causes of doubt i think your reputation in the eye of the world though not your happiness is concerned that you should be his  and yet i cannot bear that these libertines should be rewarded for their villainy with the best of the sex when the worst of it are too good for them  but if you meet with the least ground for suspicion if he would detain you at the odious house or wish you to stay now you know what the people are fly him whatever your prospects are as well as them  in one of your next airings if you have no other way refuse to return with him name me for your intelligencer that you are in a bad house and if you think you cannot now break with him seem rather to believe that he may not know it to be so and that i do not believe he does and yet this belief in us both must appear to be very gross    but suppose you desire and insist upon it to go out of town for the air this sultry weather  you may plead your health for so doing he dare not resist such a plea your brothers foolish scheme i am told is certainly given up so you need not be afraid on that account  if you do not fly the house upon reading of this or some way or other get out of it i shall judge of his power over you by the little you will have over either him or yourself   one of my informants has made slight inquiries concerning mrs fretchville did he ever name to you the street or square she lived in  i dont remember that you in any of yours mentioned either to me strange very strange this i think no such person or house can be found near any of the new streets or squares where the lights i had from your letters led me to imagine her house might be  ask him what street the house is in if he has not told you and let me know if he make a difficulty of that circumstance it will amount to a detection  and yet i think you have enough without this  i shall send this long letter by collins who changes his day to oblige me and that he may try now i know where you are to get it into your own hands if he cannot he will leave it at wilsons as none of our letters by that conveyance have miscarried when you have been in more apparently disagreeable situations than you are in at present i hope that this will go safe if collins should be obliged to leave it there   i wrote a short letter to you in my first agitations it contained not above twenty lines all full of fright alarm and execration but being afraid that my vehemence would too much affect you i thought it better to wait a little as well for the reasons already hinted at as to be able to give you as many particulars as i could and my thoughts upon all and now i think taking to your aid other circumstances as they have offered or may offer you will be sufficiently armed to resist all his machinations be they what they will   one word more command me up if i can be of the least service or pleasure to you i value not same i value not censure nor even life itself i verily think as i do your honor and your friendship  for is not your honor my honor and is not your friendship the pride of my life  may heaven preserve you my dearest creature in honor and safety is the prayer the hourly prayer of  your everfaithful and affectionate anna how thursday morn   i have written all night  to miss how my dearest creature how you have shocked confounded surpised astonished me by your dreadful communication  my heart is too weak to bear up against such a stroke as this  when all hope was with me when my prospects were so much mended  but can there be such villainy in men as in this vile principal and equally vile agent  i am really ill  very ill  grief and surprise and now i will say despair have overcome me  all all you have laid down as conjecture appears to me now to be more than conjecture  o that your mother would have the goodness to permit me the presence of the only comforter that my afflicted my halfbroken heart could be raised by but i charge you think not of coming up without her indulgent permission  i am too ill at present my dear to think of combating with this dreadful man and of flying from this horrid house  my bad writing will show you this  but my illness will be my present security should he indeed have meditated villainy  forgive o forgive me my dearest friend the trouble i have given you  all must soon  but why add i grief to grief and trouble to trouble  but i charge you my beloved creature not to think of coming up without your mothers leave to the truly desolate and brokenspirited  clarissa harlowe   well jack  and what think thou of this last letter  miss how values not either fame or censure and think thou that this letter will not bring the little fury up though she could procure no other conveyance than her higglers paniers one for herself the other for her maid  she knows where to come now  many a little villain have i punished for knowing more than i would have her know and that by adding to her knowledge and experience  what think thou belford if by getting hither this virago and giving cause for a lamentable letter from her to the fair fugitive i should be able to recover her  would she not visit that friend in her distress think thou whose intended visit to her in hers brought her into the condition she herself had so perfidiously escaped from  let me enjoy the thought  shall i send this letter  thou see i have left room if i fail in the exact imitation of so charming a hand to avoid too strict a scrutiny  do they not both deserve it of me  see thou not how the raveing girl threatens her mother  ought she not to be punished  and can i be a worse devil or villain or monster than she calls me in this letter and has called me in her former letters were i to punish them both as my vengeance urges me to punish them and when i have executed that my vengeance how charmingly satisfied may they both go down into the country and keep house together and have a much better reason than their pride could give them for living the singlelife they have both seemed so fond of  i will set about transcribing it this moment i think i can resolve afterward yet what has poor hickman done to deserve this of me  but gloriously would it punish the mother as well as daughter for all her sordid avarice and for her undutifulness to honest mr how whose heart she actually broke i am on tiptoe jack to enter upon this project  is not one country as good to me as another if i should be obliged to take another tour upon it  but i will not venture mr hickman is a good man they tell me i love a good man i hope one of these days to be a good man myself besides i have heard within this week something of this honest fellow that shows he has a soul when i thought if he had one that it lay a little of the deepest to emerge to notice except on very extraordinary occasions and that then it presently sunk again into its cellula adiposa  the man is a plump man  did ever see him jack  but the principal reason that withholds me for it is a tempting project is for fear of being utterly blown up if i should not be quick enough with my letter or if miss how should deliberate on setting out or try her mothers consent first in which time a letter from my frighted beauty might reach her for i have no doubt wherever she has refuged but her first work was to write to her vixen friend i will therefore go on patiently and take my revenge upon the little fury at my leisure  but in spite of my compassion for hickman whose better character is sometimes my envy and who is one of those mortals that bring clumsiness into credit with the mothers to the disgrace of us clever fellows and often to our disappointment with the daughters and who has been very busy in assisting these doublearmd beauties against me i swear by all the dii majores as well as minores that i will have miss how if i cannot have her more exalted friend  and then if there be so much flaming love between these girls as they pretend what will my charmer profit by her escape  and now that i shall permit miss how to reign a little longer let me ask thee if thou have not in the enclosed letter a fresh instance that a great many of my difficulties with her sistertoast are owing to this flighty girl  it is true that here was naturally a confounded sharp wintry air and if a little cold water was thrown into the path no wonder that it was instantly frozen and that a poor honest traveller found it next to impossible to keep his way one foot sliding back as fast as the other advanced to the endangering of his limbs or neck but yet i think it impossible that she should have baffled me as she has done novice as she is and never before from under her parents wing had she not been armed by a virago who was formerly very near showing that she could better advise than practice but this i believe i have said more than once before  i am loath to reproach myself now the cruel creature has escaped me for what would that do but add to my torment since evils selfcaused and avoidable admit not of palliation or comfort and yet if thou tellest me that all her strength was owing to my weakness and that i have been a cursed coward in this whole affair why then jack i may blush and be vexed but by my soul i cannot contradict thee  but this belford i hope  that if i can turn the poison of this letter into wholesome aliment that is to say if i can make use of it to my advantage i shall have thy free consent to do it  i am always careful to open covers cautiously and to preserve seals entire i will draw out from this cursed letter an alphabet nor was nick row ever half so diligent to learn spanish at the quixote recommendation of a certain peer as i will be to gain a mastery of this vixens hand  letter lv miss clarissa harlowe to miss how thursday evening june   after my last so full of other hopes the contents of this will surprise you o my dearest friend the man has at last proved himself to be a villain it was with the utmost difficulty last night that i preserved myself from the vilest dishonor he extorted from me a promise of forgiveness and that i would see him next day as if nothing had happened but if it were possible to escape from a wretch who as i have too much reason to believe formed a plot to fire the house to frighten me almost naked into his arms how could i see him next day  i have escaped heaven be praised i have and have now no other concern than that i fly from the only hope that could have made such an husband tolerable to me the reconciliation with my friends so agreeably undertaken by my uncle  all my present hope is to find some reputable family or person of my own sex who is obliged to go beyond sea or who lives abroad i care not whither but if i might choose in some one of our american colonies  never to be heard of more by my relations whom i have so grievously offended  nor let your generous heart be moved at what i write if i can escape the dreadfullest part of my fathers malediction for the temporary part is already in a manner fulfilled which makes me tremble in apprehension of the other i shall think the wreck of my worldly fortunes a happy composition  neither is there need of the renewal of your so often tendered goodness to me for i have with me rings and other valuables that were sent me with my clothes which will turn into money to answer all i can want till providence shall be pleased to put me into some way to help myself if for my further punishment my life is to be lengthened beyond my wishes  impute not this scheme my beloved friend either to dejection on one hand or to that romantic turn on the other which we have supposed generally to obtain with our sex from fifteen to twentytwo for be pleased to consider my unhappy situation in the light in which it really must appear to every considerate person who knows it in the first place the man who has had the assurance to think me and to endeavor to make me his property will hunt me and to place to place and search after me as an estray and he knows he may do so with impunity for whom have i to protect me from him  then as to my estate the enviable estate which has been the original cause of all my misfortunes it shall never be mine upon litigated terms what is there in being enabled to boast that i am worth more than i can use or wish to use  and if my power is circumscribed i shall not have that to answer for which i should have if i did not use it as i ought which very few do i shall have no husband of whose interest i ought to be so regardful as to prevent me doing more than justice to others that i may not do less to him  if therefore my father will be pleased as i shall presume in proper time to propose to him to pay two annuities out of it one to my dear mrs norton which may make her easy for the remainder of her life as she is now growing into years the other of  0 l per annum to the same good woman for the use of my poor as i have had the vanity to call a certain set of people concerning whom she knows all my mind that so as few as possible may suffer by the consequences of my error god bless them and give them heartsease and content with the rest  other reasons for my taking the step i have hinted at are these  this wicked man knows i have no friend in the world but you your neighborhood therefore would be the first he would seek for me in were you to think it possible for me to be concealed in it and in this case you might be subjected to inconveniences greater even than those which you have already sustained on my account  from my cousin morden were he to come i could not hope protection since by his letter to me it is evident that my brother has engaged him in his party nor would i by any means subject so worthy a man to danger as might be the case from the violence of this ungovernable spirit  these things considered what better method can i take than to go abroad to some one of the english colonies where nobody but yourself shall know anything of me nor you let me tell you presently nor till i am fixed and if it please god in a course of living tolerably to my mind for it is no small part of my concern that my indiscretions have laid so heavy a tax upon you my dear friend to whom once i hoped to give more pleasure than pain  i am at present at one mrs moores at hampstead my heart misgave me at coming to this village because i had been here with him more than once but the coach hither was so ready a convenience that i knew not what to do better then i shall stay here no longer than till i can receive your answer to this in which you will be pleased to let me know if i cannot be hid according to your former contrivance happy had i given into it at the time by mrs townsends assistance till the heat of his search be over the deptford road i imagine will be the right direction to hear of a passage and to get safely aboard  o why was the great fiend of all unchained and permitted to assume so specious a form and yet allowed to conceal his feet and his talons till with the one he was ready to trample upon my honor and to strike the other into my heart  and what had i done that he should be let loose particularly upon me  forgive me this murmuring question the effect of my impatience my guilty impatience i doubt for as i have escaped with my honor and nothing but my worldly prospects and my pride my ambition and my vanity have suffered in this wreck of my hopefuller fortunes may i not still be more happy than i deserve to be and is it not in my own power still by the divine favor to secure the great stake of all and who knows that this very path into which my inconsideration has thrown me strewn as it is with briars and thorns which tear in pieces my gaudier trappings may not be the right path to lead me into the great road to my future happiness which might have been endangered by evil communication  and after all are there not still more deserving persons than i who never failed in any capital point of duty that have been more humbled than myself and some too by the errors of parents and relations by the tricks and baseness of guardians and trustees and in which their own rashness or folly had no part  i will then endeavor to make the best of my present lot and join with me my best my only friend in praying that my punishment may end here and that my present afflictions may be sanctified to me  this letter will enable you to account for a line or two which i sent to wilsons to be carried to you only for a feint to get his servant out of the way he seemed to be left as i thought for a spy upon me but returning too soon i was forced to write a few lines for him to carry to his master to a tavern near doctorscommons with the same view and this happily answered my end  i wrote early in the morning a bitter letter to the wretch which i left for him obvious enough and i suppose he has it by this time i kept no copy of it i shall recollect the contents and give you the particulars of all at more leisure  i am sure you will approve of my escape  the rather as the people of the house must be very vile for they and that dorcas too did hear me i know they did cry out for help if the fire had been other than a villainous plot although in the morning to blind them i pretended to think it otherwise they would have been alarmed as much as i and have run in hearing me scream to comfort me supposing my terror was the fire to relieve me supposing it were anything else but the vile dorcas went away as soon as she saw the wretch throw his arms about me  bless me my dear i had only my slippers and an underpetticoat on i was frighted out of my bed by her cries of fire and that i should be burnt to ashes in a moment  and she to go away and never to return nor anybody else and yet i heard womens voices in the next room indeed i did  an evident contrivance of them all  god be praised i am out of their house  my terror is not yet over i can hardly think myself safe every welldressed man i see from my windows whether on horseback or on foot i think to be him  i know you will expedite an answer a man and horse will be procured me tomorrow early to carry this to be sure you cannot return an answer by the same man because you must see mrs townsend first nevertheless i shall wait with impatience till you can having no friend but you to apply to and being such a stranger to this part of the world that i know not which way to turn myself whither to go nor what to do  what a dreadful hand have i made of it  mrs moore at whose house i am is a widow and of a good character and of this one of her neighbors of whom i bought a handkerchief purposely to make inquiry before i would venture informed me  i will not set my foot out of doors till i have your direction and i am the more secure having dropped words to the people of the house where the coach set me down as if i expected a chariot to meet me in my way to hendon a village a little distance from this  and when i left their house i walked backward and forward upon the hill at first not knowing what to do and afterward to be certain that i was not watched before i ventured to inquire after a lodging  you will direct for me my dear by the name of mrs harriot lucas  had i not made my escape when i did i was resolved to attempt it again and again he was gone to the commons for a license as he wrote me word for i refused to see him notwithstanding the promise he extorted from me  how hard how nextto impossible my dear to avoid many lesser deviations when we are betrayed into a capital one  for fear i should not get away at my first effort i had apprised him that i would not set eye upon him under a week in order to gain myself time for it in different ways  and were i so to have been watched as to have made it necessary i would after such an instance of the connivance of the women of the house have run out into the street and thrown myself into the next house i could have entered or claimed protection from the first person i had met  women to desert the cause of a poor creature of their own sex in such a situation what must they be  then such poor guilty sort of figures did they make in the morning after he was gone out  so earnest to get me up stairs and to convince me by the scorched windowboards and burnt curtains and vallens that the fire was real  that although i seemed to believe all they would have me believe i was more and more resolved to get out of their house at all adventures  when i began i thought to write but a few lines but be my subject what it will i know not how to conclude when i write to you it was always so it is not therefore owing peculiarly to that most interesting and unhappy situation which you will allow however to engross at present the whole mind of  your unhappy but everaffectionate clarissa harlowe  letter lvi mr lovelace to john belford esquire friday morning past two oclock io triumph io clarissa sing  once more what a happy man thy friend  a silly dear novice to be heard to tell the coachman whither to carry her  and to go to hampstead of all the villages about london  the place where we had been together more than once  methinks i am sorry she managed no better  i shall find the recovery of her too easy a task i fear had she but known how much difficulty enhances the value of any thing with me and had she had the least notion of obliging me she would never have stopped short at hampstead surely  well but after all this exultation thou will ask if i have already got back my charmer  i have not  but knowing where she is is almost the same thing as having her in my power and it delights me to think how she will start and tremble when i first pop upon her how she will look with conscious guilt that will more than wipe off my guilt of wednesday night when she sees her injured lover and acknowleged husband from whom the greatest of felonies she would have stolen herself  but thou will be impatient to know how this came about read the enclosed here and remember the instructions which from time to time i have given my fellow in apprehension of such an elopement and that will tell thee all and what i may reasonably expect from the rascals diligence and management if he wishes ever to see my face again  i received it about half an hour ago just as i was going to lie down in my clothes and it has made me so much alive that midnight as it is i have sent for a blunts chariot to attend me here by daypeep with my usual coachman if possible and knowing not else what to do with myself i sat down and in the joy of my heart have not only wrote thus far but have concluded upon the measures i shall take when admitted to her presence for well am i aware of the difficulties i shall have to contend with from her perverseness  honored sur this is to sertifie your honor as how i am here at hamestet where i have found out my lady to be in logins at one mrs moores near upon hamestet hethe and i have so ordered matters that her ladyship cannot stur but i must have notice of her goins and comins as i knowed i dursted not look into your honners fase if i had not found out my lady thoff she was gone off the premss in a quartir off an

beforend he might play trix so left that to your honor  my lady knows nothing of my being hereaway but i thoute it best not to leve the plase because she has taken the logins but for a fue nites  if

more happy servant wm summers   the two inner letters as will calls them it is plain were wrote for no other purpose but to send him out of the way with them and one of them to amuse me that directed to miss how is only this  thursday june   i write this my dear miss how only for a feint and to see if it will go current i shall write at large very soon if not miserably prevented  cl h   now jack will not her feints justify mine does she not invade my province think thou and is it not now fairly come to who shall most deceive and cheat the other so i thank my stars we are upon a par at last as to this point  which is a great ease to my conscience thou must believe and if what hudibras tells us is true the dear fugitive has also abundance of pleasure to come  doubtless the pleasure is as great in being cheated as to cheat as lookerson find most delight who least perceive the jugglers slight and still the less they understand the more admire the sleight of hand this is my dear jugglers letter to me the other inner letter sent by will  thursday june   mr lovelace do not give me cause to dread your return if you would not that i should hate you for ever send me half a line by the bearer to assure me that you will not attempt to see me for a week to come i cannot look you in the face without equal confusion and indignation the obliging me in this is but a poor atonement for your last nights vile behavior  you may pass this time in a journey to your uncles and i cannot doubt if the ladies of your family are as favorable to me as you have assured me they are but that you will have interest enough to prevail with one of them to oblige me with her company after your baseness of last night you will not wonder that i insist upon this proof of your future honor  if captain tomlinson comes mean time i can hear what he has to say and send you an account of it  but in less than a week if you see me it must be owing to a fresh act of violence of which you know not the consequence  send me the requested line if ever you expect to have the forgiveness confirmed the promise of which you extorted from  the unhappy cl h   now belford what can thou say in behalf of this sweet rogue of a lady what can thou say for her it is apparent that she was fully determined upon an elopement when she wrote it and thus would she make me of party against myself by drawing me in to give her a weeks time to complete it in and wickeder still send me upon a fools errand to bring up one of my cousins  when we came to have the satisfaction of finding her gone off and me exposed for ever  what punishment can be bad enough for such a little villain of a lady  but mind moreover how plausibly she accounts by this billet supposing she had no opportunity of eloping before i returned for the resolution of not seeing me for a week and for the bread and butter expedient  so childish as we thought it  the chariot is not come and if it were it is yet too soon for everything but my impatience and as i have already taken all my measures and can think of nothing but my triumph i will resume her violent letter in order to strengthen my resolutions against her i was before in too gloomy a way to proceed with it but now the subject is all alive to me and my gayer fancy like the sunbeams will irradiate it and turn the solemn deep green into a brighter verdure  when i have called upon my charmer to explain some parts of her letter and to atone for others i will send it or a copy of it to thee  suffice it at present to tell thee in the first place that she is determined never to be my wife  to be sure there ought to be no compulsion in so material a case compulsion was her parents fault which i have censured so severely that i shall hardly be guilty of the same and i am glad i know her mind as to this essential point  i have ruined her she says  now that is a fib take it in her own way  if i had she would not perhaps have run away from me  she is thrown upon the wide world now i own that hampsteadheath affords very pretty and very extensive prospects but it is not the wide world neither and suppose that to be her grievance i hope soon to restore her to a narrower  i am the enemy of her soul as well as of her honor  confoundedly severe nevertheless another fib  for i love her soul very well but think no more of it in this case than of my own  she is to be thrown upon strangers  and is not that her own fault  much against my will i am sure  she is cast from a state of independency into one of obligation she never was in a state of independency nor is it fit a woman should of any age or in any state of life and as to the state of obligation there is no such thing as living without being beholden to somebody mutual obligation is the very essence and soul of the social and commercial life  why should she be exempt from it  i am sure the person she raves at desires not such an exemption  has been long dependent upon her and would rejoice to owe further obligations to her than he can boast of hitherto  she talks of her fathers curse  but have i not repaid him for it an hundredfold in the same coin but why must the faults of other people be laid at my door have i not enough of my own  but the greyeyed dawn begins to peep  let me sum up all  in short then the dear creatures letter is a collection of invectives not very new to me though the occasion for them no doubt is new to her a little sprinkling of the romantic and contradictory runs through it she loves and she hates she encourages me to pursue her by telling me i safely may and yet she begs i will not she apprehends poverty and want yet resolves to give away her estate to gratify whom  why in short those who have been the cause of her misfortunes and finally though she resolves never to be mine yet she has some regrets at leaving me because of the opening prospects of a reconciliation with her friends  but never did morning dawn so tardily as this  the chariot not yet come neither  a gentleman to speak with me dorcas  who can want me thus early  captain tomlinson say thou surely he must have traveled all night  early riser as i am how could he think to find me up thus early  let but the chariot come and he shall accompany me in it to the bottom of the hill though he return to town on foot for the captain is all obliging goodness that i may hear all he has to say and tell him all my mind and lose no time  well now am i satisfied that this rebellious flight will turn to my advantage as all crushed rebellions do to the advantage of a sovereign in possession  dear captain i rejoice to see you just in the nick of time  see see  the rosyfingerd morn appears and from her mantle shakes her tears the sun arising mortals chears and drives the rising mists away in promise of a glorious day excuse me sir that i salute you from my favorite bard he that rises with the lark will sing with the lark strange news since i saw you captain poor mistaken lady  but you have too much goodness i know to reveal to her uncle harlowe the errors of this capricious beauty it will all turn out for the best you must accompany me part of the way i know the delight you take in composing differences but it is the task of the prudent to heal the breaches made by the rashness and folly of the imprudent  and now all around me so still and so silent the rattling of the chariotwheels at a streets distance do i hear  and to this angel of a lady i fly  reward o god of love the cause is thy own reward thou as it deserves my suffering persevereance  succeed my endeavors to bring back to thy obedience this charming fugitive  make her acknowledge her rashness repent her insults implore my forgiveness beg to be reinstated in my favor and that i will bury in oblivion the remembrance of her heinous offense against thee and against me thy faithful votary  the chariot at the door  i come i come   i attend you good captain   indeed sir   pray sir  civility is not ceremony  and now dressed like a bridegroom my heart elated beyond that of the most desiring one attended by a footman whom my beloved never saw i am already at hampstead  end of vol iv the remainder of this
