an epistle from mr pope to dr arbuthnot  neque sermonibus vulgi dederis te nec in praemiis humanis spem posueris rerum tuarum suis te oportet illecebris ipsa virtus trahat ad verum decus quid de te alii loquantur ipsi videant sed loquentur tamen tully london printed by j wright for lawton gilliver at homers head in fleetstreet       advertisement this paper is a sort of bill of complaint begun many years since and drawn up by snatches as the several occasions offered i had no thoughts of publishing it till it pleased some persons of rank and fortune the authors of verses to the imitator of horace and of an epistle to a doctor of divinity from a nobleman at hampton court to attack in a very extraordinary manner not only my writings of which being public the public judge but my person morals and family whereof to those who know me not a truer information may be requisite being divided between the necessity to say something of myself and my own laziness to undertake so awkward a task i thought it the shortest way to put the last hand to this epistle if it have any thing pleasing it will be that by which i am most desirous to please the truth and the sentiment and if any thing offensive it will be only to those i am least sorry to offend the vicious or the ungenerous  many will know their own pictures in it there being not a circumstance but what is true but i have for the most part spared their names and they may escape being laughed at if they please  i would have some of them know it was owing to the request of the learned and candid friend to whom it is inscribed that i make not as free use of theirs as they have done of mine however i shall have this advantage and honor on my side that whereas by their proceeding any abuse may be directed at any man no injury can possibly be done by mine since a nameless character can never be found out but by its truth and likeness  an epistle to dr arbuthnot shut shut the door good john fatigued i said tie up the knocker say i am sick i am dead the dog star rages nay it is past a doubt all bedlam or parnassus is let out fire in their eye and papers in their hand they rave recite and madden round the land what walls can guard me or what shades can hide they pierce my thickets through my grot they glide by land by water they renew the charge they stop the chariot and they board the barge no place is sacred not the church is free even sunday shines no sabbath day to me then from the mint walks forth the man of ryme happy to catch me just at dinnertime is there a parson much bemusd in beer a maudlin poetess a ryming peer a clerk foredoomd his fathers soul to cross who pens a stanza when he should engross is there who locked from ink and paper scrawls with desperate charcoal round his darkened walls all fly to twitnam and in humble strain apply to me to keep them mad or vain arthur whose giddy son neglects the laws imputes to me and my damned works the cause poor cornus sees his frantic wife elope and curses wit and poetry and pope friend to my life which did not you prolong the world had wanted many an idle song what drop or nostrum can this plague remove or which must end me a fools wrath or love a dire dilemma either way i am sped if foes they write if friends they read me dead seized and tied down to judge how wretched i who cannot be silent and who will not lie to laugh were want of goodness and of grace and to be grave exceeds all power of face i sit with sad civility i read with honest anguish and an aching head and drop at last but in unwilling ears this saving counsel keep your piece nine years nine years cries he who high in drury lane lulled by soft zephyrs through the broken pane rymes ere he wakes and prints before term ends obliged by hunger and request of friends the piece you think is incorrect why take it i am all submission what you would have it make it three things anothers modest wishes bound my friendship and a prologue and ten pound pitholeon sends to

think your price too much not sir if you revise it and retouch all my demurrs but double his attacks at last he whispers do and we go snacks glad of a quarrel strait i clap the door sir let me see your works and you no more it is sung when midas ears began to spring  midas a sacred person and a king his very minister who spied them first some say his the story is told by some of his barber but by chaucer of his queen see wife of baths tale in drydens fables queen was forced to speak or burst and is not mine my friend a sorer case when every coxcomb perks them in my face good friend forbear you deal in dangerous things i would never name queens ministers or kings keep close to ears and those let asses prick it is nothing  nothing if they bite and kick out with it dunciad let the secret pass that secret to each fool that he is an ass the truth once told and wherefore should we lie the queen of midas slept and so may i you think this cruel take it for a rule no creature smarts so little as a fool let peals of laughter codrus round thee break thou unconcerned can hear the mighty crack pit box and gallry in convulsions hurled thou standst unshook amidst a bursting world who shames a scribler break one cobweb through he spins the slight selfpleasing thread anew destroy his fib or sophistry in vain the creatures at his dirty work again throned in the center of his thin designs proud of a vast extent of flimzy lines whom have i hurt has poet yet or peer lost the arched eyebrow or parnassian sneer and has not clly still his lord and whore his butchers hley his freemasons mr does not one table bavius still admit still to one bishop phps seem a wit still sapho  hold nay see you you will offend no names  be calm  learn prudence of a friend i too could write and i am twice as tall but foes like these  one flattrers worse than all of all mad creatures if the learned are right it is the slaver kills and not the bite a fool quite angry is quite innocent trust me it is ten times worse when they repent one dedicates in high heroic prose and ridicules beyond a hundred foes one from all grubstreet will my fame defend and more abusive calls himself my friend this prints my letters that expects a bribe and others roar aloud subscribe subscribe there are who to my person pay their court i cough like horace and though lean am short ammons great son one shoulder had too high such ovids nose and sir you have an eye  go on obliging creatures make me see all that disgraced my betters met in me say for my comfort languishing in bed just so immortal maro held his head and when i die be sure you let me know great homer died three thousand years ago why did i write what sin to me unknown dipped me in ink my parents or my own as yet a child nor yet a fool to fame i lispd in numbers for the numbers came i left no calling for this idle trade no duty broke no father disobeyd the muse but served to ease some friend not wife to help me through this long disease my life to second arburthnot thy art and care and teach the being you preserved to bear but why then publish granville the polite and knowing walsh would tell me i could write wellnaturd garth inflamed with early praise and congreve loved and swift endured my lays the courtly talbot summers sheffield read even mitred rochester would nod the head and st johns self great drydens friends before all these were patrons or admirers of mr dryden though a scandalous libel against him entitled drydens satyr to his muse has been printed in the name of the lord summers of which he was wholly ignorant  with open arms received one poet more happy my studies when by these approved happier their author when by these beloved from these the world will judge of men and books not from the authors of secret and scandalous history burnets oldmixons and cooks soft were my numbers who could take offense while pure description held the place of sense like gentle damons was my flowery theme a painted mistress or a purling stream yet then did gildon draw his venal quill i wished the man a dinner and sat still yet then did dennis rave in furious fret i never answered i was not in debt if want provoked or madness made them print i waged no war with bedlam or the mint did some more sober critics come abroad if wrong i smiled if right i kissed the rod pains reading study are their just pretense and all they want is spirit taste and sense commas and points they set exactly right and twere a sin to rob them of their mite yet never one sprig of laurel graced these ribalds from slashing bley down to pidling tds the wight who reads not and but scans and spells the wordcatcher that lives on syllables such piecemeal critics some regard may claim preserved in miltons or in shakespeares name pretty in amber to observe the forms of hairs or straws or dirt or grubs or worms the things we know are neither rich nor rare but wonder how the devil they got there were others angry i excused them too well might they rage i gave them but their due a mans true merit it is not hard to find but each mans secret standard in his mind that castingweight pride adds to emptiness this who can gratify for who can guess the bard whom pilfred pastorals renown who turns a persian tale for half a crown just writes to make his barrenness appear and strains from hardbound brains eight lines a year he who still wanting though he lives on theft steals much spends little yet has nothing left and he who now to sense now nonsense leaning means not but blunders round about a meaning and he whose fustians so sublimely bad it is not poetry but prose run mad all these my modest satire bid translate and owned that nine such poets made a tate how did they fume and stamp and roar and chafe how did they swear not addison was safe peace to all such but were there one whose fires true genius kindles and fair fame inspires blessed with each talent and each art to please and born to write converse and live with ease should such a man too fond to rule alone bear like the turk no brother near the throne view him with scornful yet with jealous eyes and hate for arts that caused himself to rise damn with faint praise assent with civil leer and without sneering teach the rest to sneer willing to wound and yet afraid to strike just hint a fault and hesitate dislike alike reserved to blame or to commend a timorous foe and a suspicious friend dreading even fools by flatterers besieged and so obliging that he never obliged like cato give his little senate laws and sit attentive to his own applause while wits and templers every sentence raise and wonder with a foolish face of praise who but must laugh if such a man there be who would not weep if atticus were he what though my name stood rubric on the walls or plastered posts with claps in capitals or smoking forth a hundred hawkers load on wings of winds came flying all abroad i sought no homage from the race that write i kept like asian monarchs from their sight poems i heeded now berymd so long no more than thou great george a birthday song i never with wits and witlings past my days to spread about the itch of verse and praise nor like a puppy daggled through the town to fetch and carry singsong up and down nor at rehearsals sweat and mouthed and cried with handkerchief and orange at my side but sick of fops and poetry and prate to bufo left the whole castalian state proud as apollo on his forked hill sat fullblown bufo puffed by every quill fed with soft dedication all day long horace and he went hand in hand in song his library where busts of poets dead and a true pindar stood without a head received of wits an undistinguished race who first his judgment asked and then a place much they extolled the pictures much the seat and flattered every day and some days eat till grown more frugal in his riper days he paid some bards with port and some with praise to some a dry rehearsal was assigned and others harder still he paid in kind may some choice patron bless each gray goose quill may every bavius have his bufo still so when a statesman wants a days defense or envy holds a whole weeks war with sense or simple pride for flattery makes demands may dunce by dunce be whistled off my hands blessed be the great for those they take away and those they leave me  for they left me gay left me to see neglected genius bloom neglected die and tell it on his tomb of all thy blameless life the sole return my verse and queensbry weeping over thy urn give me on thamess banks in honest ease to see what friends or read what books i please there let me live my own and die so too to live and die is all i have to do above a patron though i condescend sometimes to call a minister my friend i was not born for courts or great affairs i pay my debts believe and go to prayers can sleep without a poem in my head nor know if dennis be alive or dead why am i asked what next shall see the light heavens was i born for nothing but to write has life no joys for me or to be grave have i no friend to serve no soul to save i found him close with swift  indeed no doubt cries prating balbus something will come out it is all in vain deny it as i will no such a genius never can lie still and then for mine obligingly mistakes the first lampoon sir will or bubo makes poor guiltless i and can i choose but smile when every coxcomb knows me by my style cursed be the verse how well soever it flow that tends to make one worthy man my foe give virtue scandal innocence a fear or from the softeyd virgin steal a tear but he who hurts a harmless neighbors peace insults fallen worth or beauty in distress who loves a lie lame slander helps about who writes a libel or who copies out the fop whose pride affects a patrons name yet absent wounds an authors honest fame who can your merit selfishly approve and show the sense of it without the love who has the vanity to call you friend yet wants the honor injured to defend who tells whatever you think whatever you say and if he lies not must at least betray who to the sea the epistle to the earl of burlington dean and silver bell can swear and sees at cannons what was never there who reads but with a lust to misapply make satire a lampoon and fiction lie a lash like mine no honest man shall dread but all such babbling blockheads in his stead let paris tremble  what that thing of silk  paris that mere white curd of asss milk satire or shame alas can paris feel who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel yet let me flap this bug with gilded wings this painted child of dirt that stinks and stings whose buzz the witty and the fair annoys yet wit never tastes and beauty never enjoys so wellbred spaniels civilly delight in mumbling of the game they dare not bite eternal smiles his emptiness betray as shallow streams run dimpling all the way whether in florid impotence he speaks and as the prompter breathes the puppet squeaks or at the ear of in the fourth book of milton the devil is represented in this posture it is but justice to own that the hint of eve and the serpent was taken from the verses on the imitator of horace eve familiar toad half froth half venom spits himself abroad in puns or politics or tales or lies or spite or smut or rymes or blasphemies did ever smockface act so vile a part a trifling head and a corrupted heart eves tempter thus the rabbis have expressed a cherubs face a reptile all the rest beauty that shocks you parts that none will trust wit that can creep and pride that licks the dust not fortunes worshipper nor fashions fool nor lucres madman nor ambitions tool nor proud nor servile be one poets praise that if he pleased he pleased by manly ways that flattery even to kings he held a shame and thought a lie in verse or prose the same in fancys maze that wandering not too long he stooped to truth and moralizd his song that not for fame but virtues better end he stood the furious foe the timid friend the damning critic halfapproving wit the coxcomb hit or fearing to be hit laughed at the loss of friends he never had the dull the proud the wicked and the mad the tales of vengeance lies so often overthrown lies so often overthrown such as those in relation to mr a that mr p writ his character after his death etc that he set his name to mr brooms verses that he received subscriptions for shakespeare etc which though publicly disproved by the testimonies prefixed to the dunciad were nevertheless shamelesly repeated in the libels and even in the paper called the noblemans epistle  the imputed trash the imputed trash profane psalms court poems and many libellous things in his name printed by curl etc the dullness not his own the morals blackened when the writings escape the libeld person and the pictured shape the abuse on all he loved or loved him spread abuse on all he loved or loved him spread namely on the duke of buckingham earl of burlington bishop atterbury dr swift mr gay dr arbuthnot his friends his parents and his very nurse aspersed in printed papers  a friend in exile or a father dead the whisper that to greatness still too near perhaps yet vibrates on his sovereigns ear  welcome for thee fair virtue all the past for thee fair virtue welcome even the last but why insult the poor affront the great a knaves a knave to me in every state alike my scorn if he succeed or fail glencus at court or japhet in a jayl a hireling scribler or a hireling peer knight of the post corrupt or of the shire if on a pillory or near a throne he gain his princes ear or lose his own yet soft by nature more a dupe than wit sapho can tell you how this man was bit this dreaded satrist dennis will confess foe to his pride but friend to his distress so humble he has knocked at tblds door has drank with cr nay has rymd for mr full ten years slandered ten years it was so long before the author of the dunciad published that poem till when he never writ a word of the many scurrilities and falsehoods concerning him did he once reply three thousand suns went down on welsteds lie welsteds lie this man had the impudence to tell in print that mr p had occasioned a ladys death and to name a person he never heard of he also published that he had libelled the duke of chandos with whom it was added that he had lived in familiarity and received from him a present of five hundred pounds the falsehood of which is known to his grace whom mr p never had the honor to see but twice and never received any present farther than the subscription for homer from him or from any great man whatsoever  budgel in a weekly pamphlet called the be bestowed much abuse on him in the imagination that he writ some things about the last will of dr tindal in the grubstreet journal a paper wherein he never had the least hand direction or supervisal nor the least knowledge of its authors he took no notice of so frantic an abuse and expected that any man who knew himself author of what he was slandered for would have justified him on that article    to please a mistress one aspersed his life he lashed him not but let her be his wife let budgel charge low grubstreet on his quill and write whatever he pleased except his will let the two curls of town and court abuse his father mother body soul and muse his father mother etc in some of curls and other pamphlets mr popes father was said to be a mechanic a hatter a farmer nay a bankrupt but what is stranger a nobleman if such a reflection can be thought to come from a nobleman has dropped an allusion to this pitiful untruth in his epistle to a doctor of divinity and the following line hard as thy heart and as thy birth obscure had fallen from a like courtly pen in the verses to the imitator of horace mr popes father was of a gentlemans family in oxfordshire the head of which was the earl of down whose sole heiress married the earl of lindsey  his mother was the daughter of william turnor esquire of york she had three brothers one of whom was killed another died in the service of king charles the eldest following his fortunes and becoming a general officer in spain left her what estate remained after the sequestrations and forfeitures of her family  mr pope died in      aged    she in      aged    a very few weeks after this poem was finished  yet why that father held it for a rule it was a sin to call our neighbor fool that harmless mother thought no wife a whore  hear this and spare his family james m  unspotted names and memorable long if there be force in virtue or in song of gentle blood part shed in honors cause while yet in britain honor had applause each parent sprung  what fortune pray  their own and better got than bestias from a throne born to no pride inheriting no strife nor marrying discord in a noble wife stranger to civil and religious rage the good man walked innoxious through his age no courts he saw no suits would ever try nor dared an oath nor hazarded a lie unlearnd he knew no schoolmans subtle art no language but the language of the heart by nature honest by experience wise healthy by temperance and by exercise his life though long to sickness past unknown his death was instant and without a groan oh grant me thus to live and thus to die who sprung from kings shall know less joy than i o friend may each domestic bliss be thine be no unpleasing melancholy mine me let the tender office long engage to rock the cradle of reposing age with lenient arts extend a mothers breath make languor smile and smooth the bed of death explore the thought explain the asking eye and keep a while one parent from the sky on cares like these if length of days attend may heaven to bless those days preserve my friend preserve him social cheerful and serene and just as rich as when he served a queen whether that blessing be denied or given thus far was right the rest belongs to heaven
