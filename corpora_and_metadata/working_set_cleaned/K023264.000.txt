a letter to mr secretary dundas  in answer to his speech on the late proclamation  by thomas pain  london printed for j parsons no    paternoster row        price sixpence  to mr secretary dundas sir london june        as you opened the debate in the house of commons may   th on the proclamation for suppressing publications which that proclamation without naming any calls wicked and seditious and as you applied those opprobious epithets to the works entitled rights of man i think it unnecessary to offer any other reason for addressing this letter to you  i begin then at once by declaring that i do not believe there are to be found in the writings of any author ancient or modern on the subject of government a spirit of greater benignity and a stronger inculcation of moral principles than in those which i have published they come sir from a man who by having lived in different countries and under different systems of government and who being intimate in the construction of them is a better judge of the subject than it is possible that you from the want of those opportunities can be  and besides this they come from an heart that knows not how to beguile  i will further say that when that moment arrives in which the best consolation that shall be left will be that of looking back on some past actions more virtuous more meritorious than the rest i shall then with happiness remember among other things i have written the rights of man  as to what proclamations or prosecutions or placemen or placeexpectants  those who possess or those who are gaping for office may say or them it will not alter their character either with the world or with me  having sir made this declaration i shall proceed to remark not particularly upon your own speech on that occasion but on any other speech to which your motion on that day gave rise and i shall begin with that of mr adam  this gentleman accuses me of not having done the very thing that i have done and which he says if i had done he should not have accused me  mr adam in his speech see the morning chronicle of may    says that he had well considered the subject of constitutional publications and was by no means ready to say but the contrary that books of science upon government though recommending a doctrine or system different from the form of our constitution meaning that of england were fit objects of prosecution that if he did he must condemn which he meant not to do harrington for his oceana sir thomas more for his eutopia and hume for his idea of a perfect commonwealth but continued mr adam the publication of mr pain was very different for it reviled what was most sacred in the constitution destroyed every principle of subordination and established nothing in their room  i readily perceive that mr adam had not read the second part of the rights of man and i am put under the necessity either of submitting to an erroneous charge or of justifying myself against it and i certainly shall prefer the latter  if then i shall prove to mr adam that in my reasoning upon systems of government in the second part of rights of man i have shown as clearly i think as words can convey ideas a certain system of government and that not existing in theory only but already in full and established practice and systematically and practically free from all the vices and defects of the english government and capable of producing more happiness to the people and that also with an eightieth part of the taxes which the present system of english government consumes i hope he will do me the justice when he next goes to the house to get up and confess he had been mistaken in saying that i had established nothing and that i had destroyed every principle of subordination having thus opened the case i now come to the point  in the second part of rights of man i have distinguished government into two classes or systems the one the hereditary system the other the representative system  in the first part of rights of man i have endeavored to show and i challenge any man to refute it that there does not exist a right to establish hereditary government or in other words hereditary governors because hereditary government always means a government yet to come and the case always is that the people who are to live afterward have always the same right to choose a government for themselves as the peohad who lived before them  in the second part of rights of man i have not repeated those arguments because they are irrefutable but have confined myself to show the defects of what is called hereditary government or hereditary succession that it must from the nature of it throw government into the hands of men totally unworthy of it from want of principle or unfitted for it from want of capacity  james the iid is recorded as an instance of the first of these cases and instances are to be found almost all over europe to prove the truth of the latter  to show the absurdity of the hereditary system still more strongly i will now put the following case  take any fifty men promiscuously and it will be very extraordinary if out of that number one man should be found whose principles and talents taken together for some might have principles and others have talents would render him a person truly fitted to fill any very extraordinary office of national trust if then such a fitness of character could not be expected to be found in more than one person out of fifty it would happen but once in a thousand years to the eldest son of any one family admitting each on an average to hold the office twenty years mr adam talks of something in the constitution which he calls most sacred but i hope he does not mean hereditary succession a thing which appears to me a violation of every order of nature and of common sense  when i look into history and see the multitudes of men otherwise virtuous who have died and their families been ruined in defense of knaves and fools and which they would not have done had they reasoned at all upon the system i do not know a greater good that an individual can render to mankind than to endeavor to break the chains of political superstition those chains are now dissolving fast and proclamations and prosecutions will serve but to hasten that dissolution  having thus spoken of the hereditary system as a bad system and subject to every possible defect i now come to the representative system and this mr adam will find stated in the second part of rights of man not only as the best but as the only theory of government under which the liberties of a people can be permanently secure  but it is needless now to talk of mere theory since there is already a government in full practice established upon that theory or in other words upon the rights of man and has been so for almost twenty years mr pit in a speech of his some short time since said that there never did and never could exist a government established upon those rights and that if it began at noon it would end at night mr pit is not yet arrived to the degree of a schoolboy in this species of knowledge his practice has been confined to the means of extorting revenue and his boast has been  how much whereas the boast of the system of government that i am speaking of is not how much but how little  the system of government purely representative unmixed with any thing of hereditary nonsense began in america i will now compare the effects of that system of government with the system of government in england both during and since the close of the war  so powerful is the representative system first by combining and consolidating all the parts of a country together however great the extent and secondly by admitting of none but men properly qualified into the government or dismissing them if they prove to be otherwise that america was enabled thereby totally to defeat and overthrow all the schemes and projects of the hereditary government of england against her as the establishment of the revolution and independence of america is a proof of this fact it is needless to enlarge upon it  i now come to the comparative effect of the two systems since the close of the war and i request mr adam to attend to it  america had internally sustained the ravage of upwards of seven years of war which england had not england sustained only the expense of the war whereas america sustained not only the expense but the destruction of property committed by both armies not a house was built during that period and many thousands were destroyed the farms and plantations along the coast of the country for more than a thousand miles were laid waste her commerce was annihilated her ships were either taken or had rotted within her own harbor the credit of her funds had fallen upwards of ninety per cent that is an original hundred pounds would not sell for ten pounds in fine she was apparently put back an hundred years when the war closed which was not the case with england  but such was the event that the same representative system of government though since better organized which enabled her to conquer enabled her also to recover and she now presents a more flourishing condition and a more happy and harmonized society under that system of government than any country in the world can boast under any other her towns are rebuilt much better than before her farms and plantations are in higher improvement than ever her commerce is spread over the world and her funds have risen from less than ten pounds the hundred to upwards of one hundred and twenty mr pit and his colleagues talk of the things that have happened in his boyish administration without knowing what greater things have happened elsewhere and under other systems of government  i next come to state the expense of the two systems as they now stand in each of the countries but it may first be proper to observe that government in america is what it ought to be a matter of honor and trust and not made a trade of for the purpose of lucre  the whole amount of the nett taxes in england exclusive of the expense of collection of drawbacks of seizures and condemnations of fines and penalties of fees of office of litigations and informers which are some of the blessed means of enforcing them is seventeen millions of this sum about nine millions go for the payment of the interest of the national debt and the remainder being about eight millions is for the current annual expenses thus much for one side of the case i now come to the other  the expense of all the several departments of the general representative government of the united states of america extending over a space of country nearly ten times larger than england is two hundred and ninetyfour thousand five hundred and fiftyeight dollars which at  s  d per dollar is      l   s sterling and is thus apportioned  expense of the executive department l s the office of the presidency at which the president receives nothing for himself      0 vice president      0 chief justice  00 0 five associate justices       0 nineteen judges of districts and attorney general         legislative department members of congress at six dollars  l  s per day their secretaries clerks chaplains messengers doorkeepers etc       0 treasury department secretary assistant comptroller auditor treasurer register and loanofficekeeper in each state together with all necessary clerks officekeepers etc       0 department of state including foreign affairs secretary clerks etc etc   0    department of war secretary clerks paymasters commissioner etc       0 commissioners for settling old accounts the whole board clerks etc         incidental and contingent expenses for firewood stationary printing etc  00     total           on account of the incursions of the indians on the back settlements congress is at this time obliged to keep six thousand militia in pay in addition to a regiment of foot and a battalion of artillery which it always keeps and this increases the expense of the war department to   0000 dollars which is      l sterling but when peace shall be concluded with the indians the greatest part of this expense will cease and the total amount of the expense of government including that of the army will not amount to one hundred thousand pounds sterling which as has been already stated is but an eightieth part of the expenses of the english government  i request mr adam and mr dundas and all those who are talking of constitutions and blessings and kings and lords and the lord knows what to look at this statement here is a form and system of government that is better organized and better administered than any government in the world and that for less than one hundred thousand pounds per annum and yet every member of congress receives as a compensation for his time and attendance on public business one pound seven shillings per day which is at the rate of nearly five hundred pounds a year  this is a government that has nothing to fear it needs no proclamations to deter people from writing and reading it needs no political superstition to support it it was by encouraging discussion and rendering the press free upon all subjects of government that the principles of government became understood in america and the people are now enjoying the present blessings under it you hear of no riots tumults and disorders in that country because there exists no cause to produce them those things are never the effect of freedom but of restraint oppression and excessive taxation  in america there is not that class of poor and wretched people that are so numerously dispersed all over england and who are to be told by a proclamation that they are happy and this is in a great measure to be accounted for not by the difference of proclamations but by the difference of governments and the difference of taxes between that country and this what the laboring people of that country earn they apply to their own use and to the education of their children and do not pay it away in taxes as fast as they earn it to support court extravagance and a long enormous list of placemen and pensioners and besides this they have learned the manly doctrine of reverencing themselves and consequently of respecting each other and they laugh at those imaginary beings called kings and lords and all the fraudulent trumpery of courts  when placemen and pensioners or those who expect to be such are lavish in praise of a government it is not a sign of its being a good one the pension list alone in england see sir john sinclairs history of the revenue page   of the appendix is one hundred and seven thousand four hundred and four pounds which is more than the expenses of the whole government of america amount to and i am now more convinced than before that the offer that was made to me of a thousand pounds for the copyright of the second part of the rights of man together with the remaining copyright of the first part was to have effected by a quick suppression what is now attempted to be done by a prosecution the connection which the person who made that offer has with the kings printing office may furnish part of the means of enquiring into this affair when the ministry should please to bring their prosecution to issue but to return to my subject   i have said in the second part of rights of man and i repeat it here that the service of any man whether called king president senator legislator or any thing else cannot be worth more to any country in the regular routine of office than ten thousand pounds per annum we have a better man in america and more of a gentleman than any king i ever knew of who does not occasion even half that expense for though the salary is fixed at five thousand six hundred and twentyfive pounds he does not accept it and it is only the incidental expenses that are paid out of it the name by which a man is called is of itself but an empty thing it is worth and character alone which can render him valuable for without these kings and lords and presidents are but jingling names  but without troubling myself about constitutions of government i have shown in the second part of rights of man that an alliance may be formed between england france and america and that the expenses of government in england may be put back to one million and an half viz civil expense of government l  00000 army  00000 navy  00000   00000 and even this sum is fifteen times greater than the expenses of government are in america and it is also greater than the whole peace establishment of england amounted to about an hundred years ago so much has the weight and oppression of taxes increased since the revolution and especially since the year       to show that the sum of  00000l is sufficient to defray all the civil expenses of government i have in that work annexed the following estimate for any country of the same extent as england  in the first place three hundred representatives fairly elected are sufficient for all the purposes to which legislation can apply and preferable to a larger number  if then an allowance at the rate of five hundred pounds per ann be made for every representative deducting for nonattendance the expense if the whole number attended six months each year would be    000  the official departments could not possibly exceed the following number with the salaries annexed viz  three offices at  0000l each  0000 ten ditto at  000l each  0000 twenty ditto at  000l each  0000 forty ditto at  000l each  0000 two hundred ditto at  00l each  00000 three hundred ditto at  00l each  0000 five hundred ditto at  00l each  0000 seven hundred ditto at   l each    00 l     00  if a nation chose it might deduct four per cent from all the offices and make one of twenty thousand pounds per annum and style the person who should fill it king or majesty or madjesty or give him any other title  taking however this sum of one million and an half as an abundant supply for all the expenses of government under any form whatever there will remain a surplus of nearly six million and a half out of the present taxes after paying the interest of the national debt and i have shown in the second part of rights of man what appears to me the best mode of applying the surplus money for i am now speaking of expenses and savings and not of systems of government  i have in the first place estimated the poorrates at two millions annually and shown that the first effectual step would be to abolish the poorrates entirely which would be a saving of two millions to the housekeepers and to remit four millions out of the surplus taxes to the poor to be paid to them in money in proportion to the number of children in each family and the number of aged persons  i have estimated the number of persons of both sexes in england of fifty years of age and upwards at   0000 and have taken onethird of this number viz   0000 to be poor people  to save long calculations i have taken  0000 of them to be upwards of fifty years of age and under sixty and the other to be sixty years and upwards and to allow six pounds per ann to the former class and ten pounds per ann to the latter the expense of which will be seventy thousand persons at  l per ann   0000 seventy thousand persons at  0l per ann  00000 l    0000 there will then remain of the four millions    0000l i have stated two different methods of appropriating this money the one is to pay it in proportion to the number of children in each family at the rate of three or four pounds per ann for each child the other is to apportion it according to the expense of living in different counties but in either of these cases it would together with the allowance to be made to the aged completely take off taxes from onethird of all the families in england besides relieving all the other families from the burden of poorrates  the whole number of families in england lotting five souls to each family is one million four hundred thousand of which i take one third viz        to be poor families who now pay four million of taxes and that the poorest pays at least four guineas a year and that the other thirteen millions are paid by the other twothirds the plan therefore as stated in the work is first to remit or repay as is already stated this sum of four millions to the poor because it is impossible to separate them from the others in the present mode of collecting taxes on articles of consumption and secondly to abolish the poorrates the house and window light tax and to change the commutation tax into a progressive tax on large estates the particulars of all which are set forth in the work and to which i desire mr adam to refer for particulars i shall here content myself with saying that to a town of the population of manchester it will make a difference in its favor compared with the present state of things of upwards of fifty thousand pounds annually and so in proportion to all other places throughout the nation this certainly is of more consequence than that the same sums should be collected to be afterward spent by riotous and profligate courtiers and in nightly revels at the star and garter tavern pall mall  i will conclude this part of my letter with an extract from the second part of rights of man which mr dundas a man rolling in luxury at the expense of the nation has branded with the epithet of wicked  by the operation of this plan the poor laws those instruments of civil torture will be superseded and the wasteful expense of litigation prevented the hearts of the humane will not be shocked by ragged and hungry children and persons of seventy and eighty years of age begging for bread the dying poor will not be dragged from place to place to breathe their last as a reprisal of parish upon parish widows will have a maintenance for their children and not be carted away on the death of their husbands like culprits and criminals and children will no longer be considered as increasing the distresses of their parents the haunts of the wretched will be known because it will be to their advantage and the number of petty crimes the offspring of poverty and distress will be lessened the poor as well as the rich will then be interested in the support of government and the cause and apprehension of riots and tumults will cease  ye who sit in ease and solace yourselves in plenty and such there are in turkey and russia as well as in england and who say to yourselves are we not well off have ye thought of these things when ye do ye will cease to speak and feel for yourselves alone  rights of man part ii page      after this remission of four millions be made and the poor rates and house and windowlight tax be abolished and the commutation tax changed there will still remain nearly one million and an half of surplus taxes and as by an alliance between england france and america armies and navies will in a great measure be rendered unnecessary and as men who have either been brought up in or long habited to those lines of life are still citizens of a nation in common with the rest and have a right to participate in all plans of national benefit it is stated in that work rights of man part ii to apply annually  0 000l out of the surplus taxes to this purpose in the following manner to fifteen thousand disbanded soldiers  s per week each clear of deductions during life    000 additional pay to the remaining soldiers per ann    00 to the officers of the disbanded corpse during life the same sum of    000 to fifteen thousand disbanded sailors  s per week during life    000 additional pay to the remaining sailors    00 to the officers of the disbanded part of the navy during life    000 l  0 000  the limits to which it is proper to confine this letter will not admit of my entering into further particulars i address it to mr dundas because he took the lead in the debate and he wishes i suppose to appear conspicuous but the purport of it is to justify myself from the charge which mr adam has made  this gentleman as has been observed in the beginning of this letter considers the writings of harrington moore and hume as justifiable and legal publications because they reasoned by comparison though in so doing they showed plans and systems of government not only different from but preferable to that of england and he accuses me of endeavoring to confuse instead of producing a system in the room of that which i have reasoned against whereas the fact is that i have not only reasoned by comparison of the representative system against the hereditary system but i have gone further for i have produced an instance of a government established entirely on the representative system under which much greater happiness is enjoyed much fewer taxes required and much higher credit is established than under the system of government in england the funds in england have risen since the war only from   l to   l and they have been down since the proclamation to   l whereas the funds in america rose in the mean time from  0l to   0l  his charge against me of destroying every principle of subordination is equally as groundless which even a single paragraph from the work will prove and which i shall here quote  formerly when divisions arose respecting governments recourse was had to the sword and a civil war ensued that savage custom is exploded by the new system and recourse is had to a national convention discussion and the general will arbitrates the question and to this private opinion yields with a good grace and order is preserved uninterrupted  rights of man part ii p      that two different charges should be brought at the same time the one by a member of the legislature for not doing a certain thing and the other by the attorney general for doing it is a strange jumble of contradictions i have now justified myself or the work rather against the first by stating the case in this letter and the justification of the other will be undertaken in its proper place but in any case the work will go on  i shall now conclude this letter with saying that the only objection i found against the plan and principles contained in the second part of rights of man when i had written the book was that they would beneficially interest at least ninetynine persons out of every hundred throughout the nation and therefore would not leave sufficient room for men to act from the direct and disinterested principle of honor but the prosecution now commenced has fortunately removed that objection and the approvers and protectors of that work now feel the immediate impulse of honor added to that of national interest  i am mr dundas not your obedient humble servant but the contrary thomas pain  copied from the paper entitled the argus june
