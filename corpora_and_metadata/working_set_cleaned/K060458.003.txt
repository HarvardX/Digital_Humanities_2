for t davies in russel street covent garden and t cadell in the strand mdcclxxi  the history of lady barton letter lvii lady barton to miss cleveland the moment i had laid down my pen harriet flew into my room to express her surprise at lord lucans arrival but joy was much more predominant than wonder in her artless eyes  lucy came into my chamber soon after to assure me that she did not know of his lordships coming or even that he was an acquaintance of sir harrys till he introduced him to her that instant below stairs harriet replied with unusual vivacity surely miss leister you need not make an apology for such an agreeable addition to our society as lord lucan the moment these words had escaped her her face was covered with blushes  i took not the least notice of her emotion though it struck me strongly when contrasted with the different sensations of fear and anxiety that affected my heart a thousand disagreeable thoughts rushed at once into my mind i determined however to act with the utmost circumspection and carefully to avoid any particular interview or conversation with his lordship  i did not quit my chamber till dinner was served  i spent the intermediate hour extremely ill in forming set speeches and fashioning my conduct to impossible rules which all vanished out of my thoughts like a dream the moment i beheld lord lucan and i suppose that no creature could ever have appeared more completely embarrassed upon any occasion  his countenance upon seeing me was expressive of the sincerest delight there was a brilliancy in his eye and a liveliness in his complexion which would have made the homeliest features pleasing  alas his wanted not this adventitious aid   my confusion soon became contagious and seemed to throw a general damp upon the spirits of the whole company  even the happy creswel abated of his cheerfulness and often sent forth a look of inquiry to try if he could discover the cause of his own change in lucys now altered countenance  i could not help perceiving the gloom i had spread and endeavored but in vain to rally my spirits  they were sunk too low to be recalled  i would have retired but that would have been an addition to my friends distress  we made a dull and silent meal and i quitted the table the moment it was possible  i withdrew immediately to my chamber and begged to be left alone  i was indulged by lucy though unwillingly i tried to account to myself for the uncommon heaviness which oppressed my heart  the weakness of my past conduct appeared in the most glaring light to me and from the agonies of remorse which i then felt i concluded myself the most guilty of wretches   yet my reason revolted against this opinion but was still utterly unable to banish it or to account for the sudden change in my sentiments upon this subject as no alteration had happened either in lord lucans conduct or my situation from the time that i had considered my attachment to him as perfectly innocent because it was absolutely involuntary  i became almost distracted with my doubts and traversing my chamber with hasty steps i exclaimed how poor how insufficient is human reason either to direct our actions or restrain our passions  o thou that stillest the raging of the sea and calmest the fury of the winds abate this conflict in thy creatures breast and point the way in which my feet should tread to find the paths of peace  a sudden gush of tears followed this ejaculation my mind grew calm and i thought i could at that instant have taken an everlasting leave of lord lucan with the most perfect resignation  i continued musing upon the subject of my future conduct for a long time and at last determined that i would endeavor to assume as much cheerfulness as possible while i remained at elmgrove that in a very few days after the wedding i would return to southfield but before i went write a letter to lord lucan fully expressive of the change in my sentiments with regard to him or rather myself enjoining him to make no reply nor attempt ever to see me more  soon after i had formed this resolution lucy tapped softly at my chamber door  she saw i had been weeping but as i smiled and held out my hand on her approach she said my face might be compared to an april day but as sunshine seemed now to prevail she hoped there would be no more showers  we joined the company and i with pleasure perceived that i was much less constrained in my manner to lord lucan and every body else than i had been at dinner  a little flight of sir harrys at the time that the gentlemen were to leave us and return to town threw me into a second embarrassment  he insisted upon his being permitted to salute all the ladies as he should never be another night a bachelor and that lord lucan and a young gentleman whose name is weston and was then present should salute miss leister as she should not choose to spare them one of her kisses when he should have an exclusive right to the sole property of them  young weston who perhaps mistakes vivacity for good breeding proposed this follys becoming general and it was impossible to object seriously to a matter that appeared so very trifling especially upon such an occasion as this  once at a wedding you know is a proverb  yet neither you nor any of that company will i hope ever know the pangs i felt at receiving a kiss from lord lucan  it seemed to cost him almost as much pain as it did me for he trembled as if he had been seized with an aguefit  the consent of my heart shocked me with a consciousness of guilt  i am sorry the foolish affair happened  but i will think no more of it  it is now near two of clock in the morning of lucys wedding day and as i suppose i shall not have much leisure for some time to come i would not omit before i lay me down to rest if that may be acquainting my dear confessor and counselor with the state of that heart which while it beats will ever retain the tenderest affection for her  every good wish attends my brother and i hope i may by this time add his amiable wife  my fannys claim to that title is i think and hope not far distant  the renewal of lord humes connections with sir george might have been merely accidental but his continuing them in the manner he has done even to the encumbrance of my brother in his present circumstances speaks the revival of his attachment to you much stronger than the most direct and formal proposition could possibly have done  his attorney might perform the one but his passion only could be capable of the other  lord hume has his merits as well as his faults and the mild eye of my sisters charity is ever more open to the former than the latter and if the union i have hinted at should take place i trust they will become every day more conspicuous  adieu my fanny l barton ps eight of clock in the morning  i have passed a miserable night  disturbed slumbers and terrifying dreams  if i were superstitious i should imagine some ill fate awaits me  alas how totally unfit am i for the festivity of a bridal day    letter lviii lady barton to miss cleveland our wedding my fanny was conducted with the greatest propriety and elegance there were eighteen persons present the eldest of whom mrs layton excepted was not eight and twenty  pleasure sat smiling on every placid brow even i endeavored to assume an air of cheerfulness but thought myself like lucifer in heaven unblessed amidst the blessed  it is said that every woman looks better on her wedding day than any other of her life  i confess i never saw lady creswel appear so beautiful there was a sort of serene happiness in her countenance which i know not how to describe her clear brown complexion appeared almost transparent yet was often heightened to the most becoming blush by the fond looks of her enamoured bridegroom  the dress of all brides is nearly the same  you may therefore conclude that lady creswel wore white and silver  the bridemaids were dressed exactly alike par hazard in pale pink and silver  my clothes were  gracious heaven how can i write about such trifling matters while my heart is breaking  i must fly my fanny for ever fly from the sight of one who becomes every hour more dangerous to my repose  we have now been three days together under the same roof yet have i been lucky enough to avoid any particular conversation with lord lucan  he perceives my caution his vanity is doubtless flattered by it yet he affects to appear unhappy his looks are expressive of the tenderest sorrow and he sometimes gazes on me till he seems to have lost himself  poor harriet watches his eyes  alas they are but seldom turned on her if he is really as wretched as he seems he is to the full as much to be pitied as myself  why did we ever meet or why not sooner that heart which in spite of the restraint of duty is but too much devoted to him now had it been free my sister  i fear it is criminal to indulge this fond idea  i will suppress it then  i have not had leisure to begin the letter i intend to write to him but to morrow or the next day  in short before i seal this i will  and yet what can i say to him  have i ought to complain of in his conduct that can warrant an everlasting breach between us  has he not kept within the bounds prescribed by me has he even presumed to hint he thinks them too severe unless involuntary sighs and tender looks are construed into crimes lucan has not offended  yet yet i will break off this  i know not what to call it  improper at least as well as painful connection  i am almost distracted  i have this moment received a letter from lord lucan  i am glad of it  this is encroaching  i have now some pretense for my intended breach  yet read it fanny  i will copy it if my faststreaming tears dont wash the lines away  to lady barton if as i hoped the most profound submission to her will whom my mind worships and my eyes adore could have preserved me her esteem never had the unhappy lucan infringed lady bartons command nor even dared to repine at being forbidden to express his hopeless passion by speech or letter to her  but alas madam though love is blind lovers are quick sighted and i but too clearly perceive that i have lost that portion of your regard with which i had perhaps too vainly flattered myself  i mean not madam to reproach you with this cruel change but humbly to implore you to inform me if i have  though unwittingly heaven knows  been so unfortunate as to have offended you even in the slightest article of my conduct  if my appearing before you at this time without permission be imputed to me give me leave to transfer the blame upon chance which led me hither without knowing that you had intended to have honored lady creswels wedding with your presence the transports i was sensible of on meeting you so unexpectedly here cannot surely be deemed a crime and yet the misery i have since sustained has made me already sufficiently atone for it as if it had been one  even my present presumption bears its own apology along with it as your cruelty and my justification required it the unhappy but unoffending suppliant may expostulate even with heaven itself without impiety  i shall trespass no farther on you madam than just to assure you that i find i belong no longer to myself and that in spite both of you and me  i am and shall remain ever yours lucan   what shall i say to him my sister what answer shall i make to lines so full of tenderness and submission can i be unjust enough to reproach or condemn him while he is guiltless of any offense toward me yet if i acquit him do i not criminate myself must he not think me unworthy of his regards if female caprice alone should appear the motive of my altered conduct  i will not enter on the subject but coldly tell him that i first repented then conquered my past weakness and bid him try to follow my example  o fanny i shall break his gentle heart if but my own would burst i should be happy  how inconsistent is this letter with my last  why can i not again recover that calmness which even a transient devotion had inspired  alas because my piety was but temporary and transitory  like the ungrateful israelites i sought the lord in my trouble  but has he not promised to be nigh to all those who call upon him  his mercy is not limited and in that hope will i confide  more than half the night is elapsed but i will not close my eyes till i have written to lord lucan  should i defer it till tomorrow his supplicating eye and tender looks may change my unfirm purpose  would to heaven i had not come here  never was any creature so altered in the time  sir william will certainly perceive the change and how shall i account for it  it is done my sister i have taken an everlasting leave of lord lucan  i will copy what i have written  how infinitely short does it fall of what i wished to say  to lord lucan my lord perfectly sensible as i am of the faultiness of my conduct both toward you and myself i submit without repining to the censure implied in your letter  but alas my lord the crime i am there charged with is not the source of my selfcondemnation  that you may be perfectly convinced of my sincerity i will confess that i saw your growing passion from its earliest infancy and at the same time beheld you in the most favorable light  yet i vainly hoped that situated as i then was my virtue would have been proof even against your merit and my sense of it  and that the knowing my heart ought to be devoted to another was sufficient to render it so  how have i since blushed at that presumption which was founded not in strength but weakness  from the moment that the accidental circumstance of the picture at southfield had brought on a confession of our mutual sentiments peace has been a stranger to my breast a consciousness of the irrevocable injury i had been guilty of toward a person i dare not even name at present has haunted me ever since  the constant perturbation of my mind with other mortifications arising from the same source brought on a dangerous illness which led me a willing victim almost to the grave i now rejoice that what i then most ardently desired was not the consequence of the joint disorder both of heart and mind and body  yes my lord i wish to live that my future conduct may atone for my past folly and that the example of the weakest of the weaker sex may enable you to conquer a passion which if indulged must be productive of misery only both to yourself and its unhappy object  i will not boast my lord that i have already accomplished this arduous task  my nature is sincere  but as a proof that i mean seriously to succeed in the attempt i from this moment interdict myself from ever corresponding or conversing with your lordship more and do here declare that i will never pardon your attempting either to see or write to me on any future occasion of our lives  i shall ever retain the sincerest wishes for your lordships happiness though this is the last time that i shall ever subscribe myself  your affectionate friend l b   i will not comment on this hateful letter surely i never wrote so bad a one  but is that wonderful  is not the heart our best inspirer  and can i say that mine dictated this severe decree  yet i trust my dear fanny will approve it  it has afforded my mind too a temporary relief  i mean to order my coach as soon as i rise in the morning to send this letter to lord lucan before i appear at breakfast and set out directly after for southfield without giving him time to recover enough from his surprise so as to attempt an expostulation  i am tempted to leave harriet with lady creswel that i may perform the journey alone  what a journey will it be   adieu adieu l barton  letter lix miss cleveland to lady barton indeed my ever dear louisa your letters have been a heavy alloy to the happiness that i ought now to partake of  but like joseph when surrounded with all the magnificence and delights of the egyptian court i weep upon the neck of my benjamin  yet let me flatter myself that good and not ill fate awaits my sister as i may now believe the conflicts past and that her own reason and virtue have triumphed over a weakness which as she justly observes could only be productive of misery  of misery perhaps in the extreme  yes my sister i do most truly applaud both your letter and your conduct toward lord lucan and what is of infinitely more consequence you will yourself approve it  you will again enjoy that peace which goodness bosoms ever  and even feel an higher degree of exultation in your mind at having recovered the lost path than those who have never strayed can possibly be sensible of  with this prophecy i will close the subject of your late letters and shall be impatient till i find it verified by the calm cheerfulness which will i hope diffuse itself through all your future correspondence  i have much to tell you both of myself and our dear brother  we have had a wedding as well as you but twas a very private one  yet surely i may say with fitzosborne  what though in silence sacred hymen trod  nor lyre proclaimed nor garland crowned the god  what though nor feast nor revel dance was there  vain pomp of joy the happy well may spare  yet love unfeigned and conscious honor led  the spotless virgin to the bridal bed  all heaven and every friendly power  approved the vow and blessed the hour   but to proceed regularly  in my last i told you that we should quit st omers in a few days  do not be shocked louisa when i tell you that we were all very near remaining there for ever  as delia recovered her health sir georges spirits returned and after passing a very cheerful evening this day three weeks we retired rather before midnight to our chambers  i want words to express the terror i felt when i was awaked about four of clock in the morning by people screaming out fire and beating at my door in order to force it open  i found myself involved in so thick a smoke that i could not find the passage out of my chamber and concluded that i must inevitably perish  amidst the variety of voices that repeatedly called upon me to pull up the bolt i thought i distinguished lord humes  perhaps this circumstance added to my confusion  on a sudden the voice ceased and i found myself as it were left alone in the midst of the flames which then burst into one side of the room  at that moment a ladder was fixed against one of my windows and lord hume entering by it caught me in his arms and carried me i know not how but totally devoid of sense to his apartment on the other side of the street  when i had recovered my reason i had the happiness of finding my brother and delia sitting by me and my champion kneeling before me and pouring lavender water on my hands and face with a look of such tender solicitude as if his life depended upon mine  the emotion of my gratitude or call it what you please was too strong for my spirits  i fainted a second time  i was put to bed in this situation and a surgeon had opened a vein in my arm before i opened my eyes again  never can i forget the expressive look of sorrow which appeared in lord humes countenance  i confess it louisa it in one moment obliterated all his past offenses and he became even dearer to my heart than he had ever been before  his saving my life even at the hazard of his own was only a proof of his spirit and humanity which he ought to have exerted for any other woman in the same dreadful situation  but the tender anxiety he showed toward me afterward spoke the fond lover and the delicacy of his behavior from that event has strengthened his claim to that title  as soon as my arm was bound up i tried to express my gratitude to lord hume but could not  tears stopped my utterance but relieved the oppression of my heart  he seemed as little able himself to speak as i but in an incoherent manner said he was the happiest man alive and kissed my hand in transport  sir george then made every person withdraw except my maid and left me for some hours to compose myself  i found upon enquiry that the fire which had consumed three houses began at a sugar bakers who lived next door to us and that it was not discovered till a part of our house was in flames  an old servant of lord humes was the first person who saw the blaze  the poor man happened not to be well and could not sleep  to his sickness under providence are we indebted for our lives and he shall never more feel the fatigue of servitude or labor his lord and my brother having rendered him independent for life  this accident you may suppose retarded our setting out  delia who suffered less than i from the fright was an equal loser by the fire  in short neither we nor our servants had been able to save any of our clothes from the flames  you may conclude that the dear good walter supplied us with every necessary till we could get them made  i fear the apprehension she felt on our account before she knew that we were safe has hurt her much  she looked so very delicate when we parted that i scarce dare flatter myself with the hopes of ever seeing her more  while we were delayed at st omers a second courier arrived from mrs colville with a letter to st george acknowledging her passion for him pleading that in her excuse and imploring him in the most abject terms not to expose her weakness by carrying on the suit against her and assuring him of her full consent to his marriage with her daughter  in order to avoid being brought to england by the chancellors messenger she has retired privately from toulouse and has placed herself in a convent but where we know not nor shall ever enquire  i hope she will remain wherever she is for life as i really believe that the bare sight of her would shock our poor delia more than the fire had done  she has sent back the small trunk which belonged to the person who died at amiens and has desired that sir george may open it in order to forward the papers in it to the party for whom they are designed if this can be discovered from the initials which is the only address they have  my brother has assigned this commission to me and as soon as i have a moments leisure i will execute it faithfully  if i continue to write so circumstantially there will be no end of this letter you must therefore take leave of st omers and suffer yourself to be instantly transported across the water with me as if you were reading one of shakespeares plays and conclude us now safely arrived in london whence i am now writing to you  after my brother had waited on the chancellor and shown him mrs colvilles letters he most readily gave his consent to delias marriage and said if he were a bachelor he should be very proud of such an helpmate as the fair lady  meaning me louisa  who had acted with so much prudence in the conduct of this extraordinary affair  as both the parties were very well inclined to enter into the holy state of matrimony they readily dispensed with the parade of a public wedding and on saturday last my brother had the happiness of receiving his wellbeloved wife from the hands of my beloved husband that is to be  for we shall take more state and form upon us than they have done i assure you  joy to my louisa  the happy pair set out next day for clevelandhall whither i shall follow them in a very few days  mary granville and lord hume are to accompany me and the moment i know my louisas heart is at peace i shall give lord hume a legal claim to mine but not till then for indeed my sister i cannot taste of joy while you are wretched  lord hume and my brother have complained much of the dejection of my spirits since we came from france  i have attributed the change in me to that of the climate but i think they dont acquiesce in that opinion and suspect a hidden cause of sorrow though they know not from whence it can arise  o be happy my louisa and make me so  lord humes chariot stops at the door  a lawyer with him  how tremendous and not a creature with me  run robert for miss granville  horrid parchments  shocking deeds  my hand trembles  i can never sign them  how did you  adieu adieu my sister f cleveland  letter lx lord hume to lord lucan london if you are not absolutely dwindled into a state of vegetation and fixed like a plant to one peculiar spot i conjure you by all the powers of friendship my dear lucan to set out on the receipt of this to be witness to that happiness which i confess beyond either my expectation or deserts and which i can hardly believe to be real  listen  fanny clevelands lovely hand  what a contrast to her cheek then blushing like the rosy morn has signed our marriage articles and i now only wait for that short passport to happiness which is contained in a few mystical words that i suppose are to hold us enchanted for the rest of our lives  for my own part i acknowledge the spell already  could all the arguments of philosophy ever have convinced me without my own experience that the slightest touch of clevelands hand should communicate a richer transport to my soul than the closest embrace of margarita  in one case i feel myself a man in the other but a brute in the first instance i am sensible of the union of mind and body in the second my sensations were totally devoid of all sentiment whatever  is not this charming enthusiasm  i mistook my transports before  took giddiness for frolic extravagance for spirit folly for fondness and appetite for passion  on my honor lucan my fanny is ten thousand times more lovely than when i left england  in short i did not know her then or i could never have been so infatuated as i was to a creature so every way her inferior  but come my friend come i again entreat you and see this earthly paragon  you say you are at an immense distance from the object of your affection  what signifies then a thousand miles more or less since you are deprived of the pleasure of seeing her  i begin to think she must be some unnatural manufactured prude  dont be angry lucan i have no reason to abuse her but on your account  not even to permit your writing to her  perhaps your quitting the kingdom where she is may bring her to better temper  i am but a bad judge in these romantic matters though i am certain that no man living is at this moment more sincerely in love than i am  sir george cleveland was married last week and i had the honor of giving the bride away  she is a charming girl i confess but nothing to be compared to my cleveland  but they have beauty enough between them to stock a seraglio  i do most sincerely wish to have you at my wedding lucan but i shall not wait an hour for your coming nor should i think of your being present at the ceremony but that my fanny has declared she will not bestow her hand without the concurrence of a sister who lives in ireland a lady barton  do you know her lucan she was a charming girl before she married though not quite as handsome as my fanny  you see then you have no time to lose for i must not suppose that her ladyship however matronly she may have become since her marriage can possibly object now to a connection which she seemed once to encourage and approve give the reins to your horses and away my friend to  yours most truly hume ps if you should not find me in london post off to clevelandhall  i long to introduce you to sir george and his lady but more particularly to my dear fanny    letter lxi lady barton to miss cleveland do not i conjure you my dear louisa add to my misery by delaying your own happiness  the first has already reached its zenith  o may the latter do so too  i will not enter into any further explanation nor mention a single particular relative to myself till i know that you are married if therefore you are anxious about the most interesting events of my life i shall shortly receive a letter from lady hume which will then entitle her to a confidence now withheld from my beloved fanny cleveland by her  ever affectionate sister louisa barton  letter lxii miss cleveland to lady barton i have hesitated for some time dear louisa whether in your present dejected state of mind i should venture to communicate to you a story of much woe which was contained in the papers of the unhappy young woman who died at amiens  the diverting of any current must necessarily abate its force and whatever can awaken our sensibility for the misfortunes of others must at least for the time render us insensible to our own  i believe too that comparison weighs much in our estimation of good and evil and though a generous heart even laboring under the severest calamities may be incapable of forming a wish for relief at the expense of anothers happiness yet i am persuaded that there is a sort of alleviation to be found in reflecting that there are or rather that there have been others much more wretched than ourselves  upon this principle then i shall send you this melancholy story which i should never have been mistress of had the papers in which it was contained though unsealed been properly addressed but as they were only superscribed with initials i was obliged to look into the contents in order to forward them to the person for whom they were designed and i hope my taking a copy of them for you and you only will not be considered as a breach of trust either to the living or the dead  as soon as my brother and sister went out of town which was the first moment i had leisure i opened the little trunk which mrs colvilles last messenger brought to st omers and which may properly enough be called the lachrymal urn of the unfortunate maria for in it was the tearful narrative of a life of sorrows deposited and though she is now removed from a possibility of feeling them they still retain the magnetic power of living grief and must attract the sigh of pity from every tender every feeling heart  the story of maria  to mr edward s   will the most tender and affectionate of brothers with patience condescend to read the sad confession of a dying wretch who owns herself unworthy of his kindness  yet trembling on the verge of life solicits to obtain his pardon and pity  alas my edward they will never reach me  no friendly voice can ever sooth my ear or speak peace to my perturbed heart for soon the motion of its pulse shall cease and this poor shattered frame return to dust  drop then one fond forgiving tear upon these pages  it is all i now can ask or you ever long can grant  the story of my misconduct and misfortunes perhaps will reach you before this letter  how does my heart now bleed for that indignant grief your generous mind must feel for a beloved sisters infamy  i do not mean to extenuate my faults  alas they will not bear extenuation  and conscious as i am of my approach to that tribunal before which we must all ever long appear deceit or falsehood would be as weak as wicked  then hear the faithful story of my heart and judge me as one erring mortal should another  in less than a year after you sailed for bengal our dear father died  what an irreparable loss was mine  i need not tell you that as he was in the church we were at once deprived of the principal part of his fortune with his life and that there did not remain above an hundred pounds a year being a life annuity purchased for my mother with her own portion to support her and me  the altered countenances and behavior of those we had formerly called friends at gloucester made my mother determine on quitting a place where from her want of knowing the world she considered herself as particularly ill treated  she was then first taught that prosperity is the cement of modern friendship and when that fails the tottering structure sinks into decay  she condescended to consult me upon our future scheme of life though as i was not then fifteen i was but ill qualified for an adviser however i had heard that bath was a cheap place of residence for those who settle themselves as inhabitants there and as i also believed it to be an agreeable lively scene i had often wished to go thither during my fathers life and therefore used all my little rhetoric with my mother to fix us there  i prevailed and the first year we spent in it was by many degrees the happiest of my life  we lived in a small house near the crossbath with the greatest economy  my mother did not go much into public but we met with many former acquaintances who were so obliging to matronize me to the rooms playhouse and walks as often as it was thought proper to let me appear abroad  you cannot my edward have forgotten my face and person and may suppose that i was not without admirers in the midst of so many gay flutterers as abound at bath  there are i believe fewer serious engagements made there than at any place where such a concourse of young people continually meet  whether this is owing to the perpetual dissipation they live in or to the constant rotation of new faces that appear there daily is not to me material  my heart alas was but too susceptible of a tender impression and captain l  son to sir richard l  first inspired my artless bosom with love  during the first three months of our acquaintance we saw each other every day nor did the idea of parting or any other painful thought obtrude upon our minds to interrupt the pleasing delirium of our mutual fondness  our happiness was then most certainly too great to last  a letter from sir richard l  to his son acquainting him that he was promoted to the rank of captain in a regiment which was then stationed in ireland with a peremptory command to set out thither immediately was the first and we then thought the severest shock that fate could inflict on us  though my mother was extremely indulgent to me yet from a delicacy natural to young minds i had never ventured to acquaint her with my attachment to captain l  to this small but fatal error i perhaps owe most of the subsequent miseries of my life  the most intimate acquaintance i then had was a young married lady about three and twenty who seemed to have the greatest friendship for my lover and tenderness for me imaginable  her name is  but i will not expose her for the sake of a respectable family to whom she is allied  though she has brought infamy and sorrows upon me and mine  i will call her matilda  to her then i disclosed the anguish of my heart at the sad thought of parting with my lover and wept upon her bosom  she seemed to consider my distress as trifling  told me i had too much sensibility to be happy and advised me to conquer it  then added laughing these first passions are always troublesome but you will not be so much affected at parting with your next lover i was offended and disgusted at her speech  the very idea had profligacy in it  she quickly perceived my resentment and had address enough to change her style and soothe me into the most perfect confidence  during the short time that captain l  remained at bath after his fathers summons we three were inseparable  he would have married me at that interval but as he was not of age being then but just turned of twenty he could get no clergyman to perform the ceremony for us  at length the fatal hour of separation arrived  happiness and he were one in my estimation  they fled alas together  from his letters i received the sole consolation that could alleviate the pangs of absence  they were frequent and tender yet i thought latterly that i sometimes discovered a little tendency toward jealousy in them but unconscious as i was of having given the slightest ground for suspicion by my conduct i thought it beneath me to enter into a particular defense against a general charge and therefore suffered every hint upon this subject to pass unnoticed  we had lived now above a year at bath and my mother began to find herself extremely straitened in her circumstances  you had it not then in your power my dear and generous edward to relieve her distress and i am certain that one of the severest which she herself felt was her not being able to assist you in the first dawnings of your then infant fortunes  my mother though past the prime of life was still handsome and at such a crisis dress is of much more consequence to a woman than at an earlier era she had been used to elegance and affluence yet she cheerfully resigned them all and continued to wear deep mourning in order to ornament me with the remains of her former paraphernalia and every little addition that she could make to it  matilda used to take me with her frequently to the rooms and generally invited me to private parties at her own apartments  sometimes with my mother but oftener without  she always played high and seemed solicitous to possess me with the same passion  i resisted the temptation for some time on account of the danger and indecorum of such a course of life  to which she replied that as cards were now become the bon ton of all civilized nations the latter of my objections was sufficiently obviated and that in order to guard against the former the earlier i began to practice the better  for as i should soon be a person of rank and fortune by the death of sir richard l  i could not think of living like a housewife in such an improved and enlightened age as the present and that as high play had now became the general amusement and occupation of all people entitled to associate in polite life the sooner i was initiated into the arts and sciences of gaming the safer it would be for my husbands fortune or my own  she would sometimes make me hold her cards while she sat by and instructed me how to play them then she would make me join in the stake and at last led me in to adventure for myself on her promise to lend me what money i might lose till i should be in a condition of repaying her  i am convinced that there is but one step easy to avoid in vice and that is the first  the fear and disgust with which i had engaged at play at the beginning wore off by degrees and habit had seduced my mind into such a passion for cards in a short time that i regretted the sundays that my mother confined me at home after the church service was over to read proper discourses and listen to her most excellent instructions  mr w  an elderly gentleman of fortune used generally to be of our parties  he seemed to distinguish me in a particular manner and used to favor me at play which as soon as i discovered i immediately resented and declared i would lay down my cards if he should ever again attempt to pay me the least compliment of the kind to the disadvantage either of himself or any of the rest of the company  this proper reproof of mine obliged him to restrain his too indelicate galantry toward me for the future  my cardaccompt preserved itself pretty even for some time without giving me occasion to trespass on the credit which my friend matilda had made me so voluntary a proffer of till one night that i happened to be led in by her to engage at loo which was a game i had never played at before and knew so little of as not to be aware how deeply i might be involved upon a turn of luck against me  the stakes were not high but as the sorfeits were unlimited i found myself indebted to mr w  in the sum of thirty guineas when the party broke up  i applied to my friend for the money but she put me off at that time by saying that i should try my fortune again the next evening at her apartments and that she would then put whatever balance should appear against me on a proper footing for payment  i was tempted to venture on a second essay at the same game and concluded the night with doubling the debt to the same person i then claimed matildas promise but she answered me with great coldness and a constrained smile that my creditor was a gentleman of large fortune and as he had made her a confidant of his partiality in my favor she should think it a breach of honor to take me out of his hands by releasing me from so trifling an obligation as this was  the surprise and alarm i felt upon this occasion is not to be expressed  it was too surely a presage of all my future miseries  i began to find that i had been most treacherously dealt by  i retired to my chamber without speaking even to my mother and passed the night in walking about distractedly and crying out how shall i be ever able to discharge this dangerous debt or how render a justifiable account of my conduct either to my mother to the world but more especially to my dear captain l   i confined myself at home for several days after this adventure during which time matilda came often to solicit my returning into the world again and affected to ridicule my prudery in being rendered so uneasy about so insignificant a circumstance which she assured me was but one of the common events of life however i continued resolute in keeping myself retired and remained inconsolable on this unhappy incident till i received a letter from captain l  which i opened with transport hoping it would calm my mind and restore my peace again  alas what an aggravation to my misfortune and distress did i meet with there  he told me that his regiment was ordered to america and that he should embark with it in less than ten days which time was elapsed at the moment i received his letter  he added that my conduct had convinced him that if he should never return to england i would be easily consoled for his loss though he should never cease to regret mine  wished me every happiness that a life of dissipation could yield and bad me farewell  for ever  my mind already disturbed and agitated this cruel letter almost unhinged my reason and sunk me into the most pitiable state of dejection  my mother who was ignorant of the real cause of my disturbance apprehended some heavy disorder to be falling upon me and attended me night and day with the fondest anxiety imaginable  for some time i continued in a state of the profoundest melancholy  at length the voice of nature waked my reason  the tears and sighs of a fond parent by sympathetic force attracted mine and called forth all my gratitude  i strove to hide my anguish even in smiles but it still preyed upon my tortured heart  the shame of having carried on a clandestine correspondence with a lover who had now so plainly cast me off prevented my revealing to my mother any circumstance of a connection which i then considered as disgraceful to me  but i flew directly to matilda who had been my only confidant in this secret and communicated the letter to her  she received me coldly as she had done before on my former difficulty  told me that this too was but another of the common events of life  that the most constant lovers were not to be considered more than perennials but that bath passions never lasted beyond the season  that they were inspired by the heat of the waters and cooled as they did  what makes girls so woebegone said she upon such disappointments is the overweaning conceit they are too apt to frame of their own consequence but they must abate considerably of their romantic selfsufficience before they will find themselves in the station where nature has designed them  a toy a rattle which ten will play with for one who will think of becoming a serious purchaser  such maxims as these whether true or false were not likely to assuage my grief and i returned home the most unhappy creature breathing  i accused captain l  of falsehood of perjury a thousand times alas in vain did i vow to cast him from my heart and memory for ever  pardon thou dear departed shade these and all other injuries i have unwittingly been the sad occasion of to you  during my confinement mr w  made the most constant and obliging inquiries about me and in the most friendly manner offered my mother a house he had near the hotwells at bristol with the use of his carriage servants etc  as i continued in a very low and languid state even after my recovery change of air was judged necessary for me particularly as the physician who attended me apprehended my falling into a consumption  i had however a very strong objection to accepting mr w  s obliging offer from an unwillingness to receiving farther favors from one to whom i was already too much indebted  but this difficulty was a good deal obviated by his declaring that he was engaged on a party for two months to visit paris and during that time both his house and carriage must be entirely useless to him  at my mothers entreaty and not opposed by me matilda consented to accompany us and i own i felt a gleam of joy at removing from a place where every object reminded me of my unhappiness i did not then reflect that i could not fly from myself and that neither happiness or misery are local  mr w  accompanied us to bristol and put us into possession of a very elegant house in which he left four servants to attend us at board wages  there was an ample supply of tea wine sweetmeats and every elegance which he insisted on our using as if they were our own and took his leave in the politest manner earnestly requesting that he might find us there at his return  the waters and the change of scene certainly conduced to the recovery of my health but peace and cheerfulness were both estranged from my sad bosom and the only moments i enjoyed were those in which i could prevail on matilda to listen to my griefs  i soon discovered that she grew weary of the painful office she was totally immersed in gaiety and used oftener to rally than soothe my affliction  under all the disadvantages which the gloomy veil of sorrow had cast arround me a yorkshire baronet sir james d  saw and liked me he immediately addressed himself to my mother and was by her most favorably received she was overjoyed at the prospect of what she called my happiness and spoke to me of sir jamess proposal with transport  this was the second outrage if i may so call it that my heart had suffered  i fell into an agony of grief and before i could recollect myself or she prevent me i vowed to heaven in the most solemn manner that i would never be sir jamess wife  even at this moment edward i behold the figure of my astonished my offended mother she had however so much reason at command as not to urge my madness farther but quitted the room with a look of indignation mingled with surprise and sorrow  in a few minutes i followed her into her chamber and found her in tears i could not bear them edward i fell upon my knees before her implored her pardon and offered even to sacrifice myself by marrying sir james d  rather than render her wretched  she answered with the utmost calmness i fear maria it is out of your power to prevent my being so you are unhappy my child and i must suffer with you  i hoped  but it is over  for be assured that after the vow you have so rashly made no power on earth should force me to consent to my childs perjury sir james shall have his answer  but let me now inform you of a secret i wished to have concealed for ever from you  penury and want surround us and we shall soon be given up a prey to them  we must return to bath no more i will mortgage our little income to pay our debts in some obscure corner we must labor for our bread help to support ourselves in honest indigence and strive to humble our minds to our conditions  i do not condemn you my child  affections are not to be forced  i flattered myself that your youth and beauty might have obtained an advantageous match which would have been a support to me and an establishment to yourself sir james d  s proposal was beyond my hopes but i do not wish to render you a victim for my sake nor shall this subject ever be mentioned more between us  o my brother think what i suffered while my mother spoke  i would at that moment have died a thousand deaths to have made her happy yet even then i inwardly rejoiced at being relieved from my apprehensions of marrying a man i could not love  you may suppose i uttered all that gratitude could dictate for my mothers kindness and promised for my future life to know no will but hers  talked of contented poverty preferred an humble lot with peace of mind to splendid misery and strove in vain to combat with her sorrows  on this occasion i not only assumed but felt a degree of cheerfulness to which my heart had long been a stranger i triumphed over captain l  s unjust suspicions in the midst of poverty i rejected an advantageous settlement and despised a title which must be bought at the expense of love  i expected matilda would have applauded my heroism but was disappointed  she disapproved my conduct called me romantic and absurd condemned my mothers want of spirit and said that had she been in her place she would have compelled me to marry sir james d  and made me happy in spite of my own folly   in about four days after this event mr w  whom we had imagined to be in france returned to bristol  as i was sensible of the highest gratitude toward him i confess i felt a degree of pleasure at his arrival and received him with all the marks of regard due to a friend  there was a vacant apartment in the house which he asked my mothers leave to occupy  she certainly had not a right to refuse yet i could perceive that she was vastly embarrassed by the request  the next morning she told me that she was determined to quit bristol immediately though she knew not where to bend her course as she did not think it proper to remain longer in mr w  s house  as this person was near fifty years of age i had never considered him in any other light than as a father however the impropriety of living under his roof any longer struck me as soon as it was mentioned  i told her i was ready to attend her when and wherever she pleased  she burst into tears and said alas my child who will receive the friendless widow and her helpless orphan  at that instant mr w  who had overheard our discourse came into the room and taking my mothers hand said behold in me madam a protector and a son who will think himself happy in making you so  the first emotion of my heart at this declaration was gratitude  modesty alone restrained me from embracing mr w  i cried out in an ecstasy o sir you are too good too generous how shall we ever be able to make you an amends  he instantly replied it is in your power madam to overpay all my services i ask no more than that fair hand can give but then your heart as well as person must be mine without the first the latter would be worthless  i will not at this moment expect your answer you are fully apprised of your mothers sentiments and situation and you alone can tell whether you choose or not to dry her tears  he quitted the room directly but he might have remained there and talked for an hour without hazarding any interruption from me i was absolutely petrified with horror and surprise  before i could recover myself my mother with her eyes still streaming threw herself on her knees before me and pressing my hand to her heart said i do not ask you my beloved child to sacrifice yourself for me  but o consider my maria to what insults and misfortunes your innocence and youth must be exposed when you shall lose even the poor support you have in me  i know i cannot long endure distress my death must leave you a prey to every ill to every danger you will then reflect with grief and shame on that false delicacy that actuates you now and vainly lament the loss of a fond parent whom you have suffered to sink with sorrow to the grave  i could bear no more  i fell on my knees before her i clasped her in my arms and bathed her bosom with my flowing tears while i cried out o take me sacrifice me do what you will with me i will not be a parricide but give me time to conquer this poor heart and tear my l  s much loved image from my breast  at the name of l  my mother started up and raised me with her then looking at me with unutterable anguish said it must not be if your heart feels a passion for another object i will much sooner die than make you wretched  but who is mr l  and how has he deserved marias love  shame kept me silent but when my mother repeated her question i replied do not press me farther madam matilda can inform you both of my weakness and misfortune  as i wished to retire upon the instant i opened a door that led by a few steps into the garden  in my confusion i missed my footing and fell from the top to the bottom  my mother flew to my assistance but could not raise me she called for help and when matilda and mr w  who were in the garden lifted me from the ground i could not stand  i was carried into the house and a surgeon sent for who acquainted them that i had dislocated my right ancle  in the midst of the pain i suffered even during the action of setting my ancle i secretly rejoiced in this accident as it must at least for some days retard an event to me more horrible than death  my heart was overflowing still with fondness for the faithless l  and i was sensible of too much respect for mr w  to love him  the second day of my confinement my mother told me that matilda had informed her of every particular relative to the attachment between captain l  and me that though she considered it as a childish and romantic affair on my side and a mere matter of galantry on his yet her tenderness for me had made her consent to matildas writing to him and acquainting him with every particular of my present situation and if in answer to that letter he should declare a serious and honorable passion for me she solemnly promised never to oppose my inclination but cheerfully wait his return and yield her consent to our union but if on the contrary   stop there my dearest mother i exclaimed you have outgone my wishes for if captain l  should hesitate a moment to receive me as his wife not only y hand but my heart shall then be free and gratitude to the best of parents shall enable me to bestow them unreluctantly on any person whom her prudence shall select  my mother embraced me and bathed my cheeks with tears of fondness at that moment i thought myself the happiest of mortals  matilda joined us and read the letter she had written to captain l  i did not think that it sufficiently described either my affection or my distress but as my mother approved of it i did not presume to make any objection but only engaged her promise to add a defense of my conduct from the misapprehensions or misrepresentatations he seemed to have conceived or received before with regard to it  you know my edward that my mother was integrity itself she could not therefore bear to be guilty of the smallest deceit and though mr w  had not pressed for any answer to his proposal on account of the accident that had happened to me she resolved to tell him that there was a friend in america without whose consent i was determined never to marry that this person had been written to and that he should be informed of his answer the moment it arrived  mr w  received this information with a very ill grace but acquiesced so far as to say that he could have no doubt of this unheard of guardians consent to such an offer as his and as an answer might arrive before i was perfectly restored to my health there was no great harm in asking it but he did not suppose that we should be weak enough to refuse his alliance even though this particular friend might not approve of it  my mother though extremely disgusted at the roughness of his reply concealed the coarseness of his expression from me and i considered myself extremely obliged to him for not persecuting me any further for the present with his ungracious and unwelcome passion  matilda was obliged to return to her house at bath and as my mother spent most of her time in my chamber and that mr w  was not permitted to make long visits to me on pretense of the necessity of my being kept quiet he grew weary of passing his domestic hours alone and to my very great joy set out for london         i have written so long my dear louisa that i am scarce able to hold the pen but i could not possibly stop in this interesting narrative such i hope you will think it till i came to what may properly be called a resting place  for though we do not leave maria happy her hopes and fears are held in equipoise and this perhaps may not be one of the least eligible situations in human life  since i wrote to you i have had a letter from mrs walter my apprehensions for her life are increased by it they more than preponderate against my hopes my spirits sink with them  but i am in a gloomy mood at present i will try to shake it off lord hume will assist me i hear him coming up stairs  till tomorrow farewell my loved louisa  f cleveland  letter lxiii miss cleveland to lady barton i shall proceed in my task of copying like a clerk in an office without attending to any thing but the draft before me and indeed my louisa i find it sufficiently interesting to engross all my attention  if it can exclude those pleasing sentiments which my present happiness ought and does inspire may i not reasonably hope that it will be able to suspend at least during the time of reading it that heavy weight which seems to press upon my sisters heart yes i am persuaded that it may and under this belief i reassume the pen  the story of maria continued  in less than a month i was able to walk with a little help and most earnestly wished to quit mr w  s house as i had reason to hope from the justification of my character which matilda assured me she had undertaken that there would be an end of all connection between us the moment i should receive a letter from captain l  and that an interview on such an occasion must be painful to us both  i therefore pressed my mother to try to borrow the money she wanted at bristol and return to bath  she complied with my request and judged it necessary to take up a larger sum on her annuity than she at first intended as either my marriage with mr w  or my waiting captain l  s return to england must be attended with expense  in short on such terms as the poor borrow and the rich lend she obtained two hundred pounds which i then thought an immense sum but did not consider that we owed more than half of it already including my debt to mr w   i am thus circumstantial with you my dear edward that you may be perfectly able to judge of the motives which impelled me to my ruin  o would to heaven that i alone had been to suffer the so much dreaded ills of poverty i would have braved them all but a beloved and tender parent whose fondness toward me had involved her in distress it was not to be born  my mother wrote a very polite letter to mr w  thanking him for all his civilities and acquainting him with our return to bath where he joined us in a few days  he brought some very handsome jewels and other presents from london for me which i absolutely refused and even felt my delicacy offended at his offering them as it seemed to hint at a certainty of my becoming his wife  as the time approached when we might expect an answer from captain l  i counted the hours and rejoiced in their flight the anxiety of suspense was visible in my looks and words i started at every sound and minutely inquired the business of every person who rapped at the door at length the fatal moment arrived that was to change a state of fond hope into the utmost despair  matilda came to our house one morning and requested to see my mother alone the gloom which sat on her brow announced the tidings which she brought and though scarce able to utter a syllable i cried out i will not leave the room i know the worst already he is dead she answered coldly no and reached a letter to me  the contents whereof were as follows   to matilda dear madam honored as i am by the favor of your letter and happy in hearing of your health will you not think me ungrateful if i repine at your wasting so much of your time and paper in relating particulars of a person who now only lives in my memory from the bare recollection of having sometimes seen her with you  but as all preferences are flattering i should be unpolite not to thank miss s  for an offer which i must however decline i heartily wish her happiness with sir james d  mr w  or whomsoever else she shall think proper to honor with her fair hand excepting madam your  most obedient servant t l   my faculties were all suspended for several minutes after reading this insulting letter   no sigh to rise no tear had power to flow i felt like one that had been stunned by a severe stroke  at length recovering myself i flung the hated paper from me and taking my mothers hand said with an effort of calmness how poor madam is the sacrifice that i can now make to duty  a rejected hand and heart but dispose of them as you please and do it quickly while my reason holds  my mother was more alarmed at my behavior than she would have been had i fallen into a passion either of grief or rage  she wept abundantly for my distress and expressed every sentiment of parental fondness  her kindness would have transformed me to a niobe at any other time but the sorrow that had then taken possession of my heart was of too powerful a nature to be softened by her tears or dissipated by my own  twas grief unutterable  my mother kindly indulged me for several days by allowing me to keep my chamber on pretense of a sore throat  this prevented my seeing mr w  and gave me time to reflect upon my own situation  i considered myself as an offering that was to be sacrificed and determined to support the role that fate had allotted me with becoming fortitude  mr w  expressed the utmost impatience for our marriage and in about six weeks after the receipt of captain l  s letter i was led to the altar and became the wretched wife of mr w   in vain did i endeavor to assume an air of cheerfulness with a breaking heart unused to deceit or artifice the veil which i put on could not conceal the gloomy tints which sorrow had engraven upon my mind i was hourly reproached by my husband with illtemper and ingratitude and my mother was accused of having drawn him into a match so much against his interest and so little conducive to his happiness  for her dear sake i exerted my utmost powers to please but they seldom met with success and i with unspeakable grief now saw that she was rendered infinitely more wretched by my marriage than she could have been in any other situation  mr w  s estate was in devonshire he had an old family seat there where i most earnestly wished to spend my days in solitude and peace but as he often told me that he did not think we should make a pleasant teteatete together there he disposed of his house at bristol and hired one at bath from which he frequently made excursions to london or elsewhere for a month or six weeks at a time  during his absence i seldom stirred abroad unless to church to pay some visit of ceremony or to pass an hour or perhaps an evening with matilda  from the moment i was married i had never mentioned the name of captain l  to my mother matilda or any other person  this was a sacrifice i thought due to my husband i would have done more had it been in my power and banished him for ever from my thoughts  one evening while mr w  was away i was prevailed upon by matilda and my mother to go to the rooms on a ballnight  i found my spirits strongly affected with a scene that reminded me of happier days and became so much absorbed in my own reflections that i scarce heard the sound of the music or observed the motion of the dancers though matilda was among then  i was sitting on one of the benches opposite the door of the room and had continued a considerable time in my reverie when my eyes were accidentally caught by the figure of a person who was speaking to a lady that sat just before me  my mind hesitated but my heart admitted not a doubt that it was captain l   had i ever screamed out in my life i should have done so then  so unexpected a view had the same effect on me that is generally produced by thunder and lightning it dimmed my sight and gave me such a sickness in my stomach that i could not long support a sudden chilness succeeded this emotion and my head reclined insensibly on the shoulder of the lady who sat next to me  what passed while i remained in that state i know not but when my senses returned i found myself at home my mother weeping by me and mr w  storming about the room like a madman  not at my illness but at the cause he imputed it to  for he declared before the surgeon who had just then bled me that he had detected me in an intrigue and that on his sudden and unexpected appearance in the rooms at the moment i was conferring with my galant the various passions of love hatred and fear had overpowered my spirits and occasioned my fainting  what an infatuated distemper is jealousy it realises chimeras and draws conclusions without premises  i was holding no conference with captain l  he was only speaking to a person who sat before me nor did i see my husband till i opened my eyes in my own chamber however i suffered him to pour forth his whole stock of causeless abuse without the least interruption till at length not meeting with resistance his rage was exhausted and the surgeon and he retired together  i was put into bed and determined as soon as i was left alone to tear the bandage off my arm and suffer myself to bleed to death but before i could put my resolution in practice a thousand reasons pressed forward to restrain my trembling hand  what had i done to merit death would not the desperate deed confirm the slander of my tyrants tongue and could i leave my mother at once oppressed with her own grief and my infamy  perhaps the love of life pleaded though silently even stronger than these motives and withheld me from my first attempt toward guilt  yet o forgive me edward that i now lament i did not perpetrate the fatal deed i might have hoped for pardon of my first crime but can accumulated sins find mercy yet if contrition may avail a wretch i still will dare to hope         here my louisa i must again break off my melancholy narrative as i have been so much broken in upon all day by company that i find it impossible to conclude it by this post but as the mails to ireland are sometimes delayed by contrary winds for several days nay weeks as i am told you may possibly receive the whole story at once  i will not therefore create a further interruption by talking on any other subject but conclude as usual  most affectionately yours f cleveland  letter lxvi miss cleveland to lady barton once more my sister i return to the sad task of relating marias woes i have not ventured to make any comment on her story nor do i mean to attempt it my louisa can reason far better than i and deduce effects from their causes         the agitation of my spirits had reduced my mind to a state of the lowest weakness i wept the whole night through and when my mother eame to my bedside in the morning i was scarce able to answer her tender inquiries after my health  she told me that mr w  was perfectly well acquainted with my former attachment to captain l  though he had never given the most distant hint of it before  she suspected matilda for having supplied him with this information  that by some chance he had heard of his being at bath and came post from london directly but when he arrived at his house and heard that i was at the rooms he flew into the most violent passion and said every thing against me that rage and mistake could dictate  my poor mother thought to qualify his fury by assuring him that this was the first night i had gone into the rooms since his absence  perhaps this might have confirmed his suspicion as it looked the more like an assignation he hurried on his clothes flew immediately to the assembly and happened unluckily it seems just to enter the door as captain l  had walked up to the place where i sat  he construed every thing against me both appearances and surmises  trifles light as air etc in fine i was condemned without further examination he declared his full determination not to live with me any longer and commanded me to set out immediately for his house in devonshire where he would take care that i should not expose myself or dishonor him any more for the future  surely never was reprieve more welcome to a sentenced wretch than the latter part of this discourse to me  i had languished for solitude before my husbands error had rendered me infamous and earnestly wished to fly from society before i had reason to apprehend that i should be abandoned by the world  but in my present situation both of mind and circumstance the idea of retirement nay absolute seclusion from the whole universe except my mother was doubly dear to my sad heart  i started up with all the alacrity of health and cheerfulness and cried i am ready to obey mr w  let us be gone this moment do not delay my dearest mother but let us fly for ever from this hated place this scene of all my misery  she answered with a sigh your husband has refused to let me go with you or be a witness of the treatment which you are too likely to receive under his tyranny  i shall behold you or your miseries no more but they will prey for ever on my heart  for i have caused them all  your filial duty more than your own ambition was the sole motive which has rendered you a victim to this unequal match  i respected the opinions of the world more than the philosophy of nature and the sin of the parent is now severely visited on the unoffending child  we wept in each others bosom  the thought of being separated from this virtuous this tender parent quite overpowered me and i sunk almost senseless upon my pillow  i knew that she had not now even the means of subsistence when torn from me and i had not the least reason to expect that mr w  would have generosity or humanity sufficient to relieve her distress or assuage her grief  during the few days i remained at bath after this event i never stirred out of my bedchamber nor saw any creature except my dear mother and a maid servant who had been hired upon this occasion to watch rather than attend me and was appointed as one may well suppose to be a spy upon all my actions during my exilement in devonshire  the only favorable circumstance that i remember in this unhappy situation was that mr w  for i will no longer style him husband no more distressed me with his loathsome presence or his foul reproaches while i continued under his roof  matilda never once came near me all this while but this was not the first instance that gave me reason to suspect her of insincerity and double dealing i feared she had been the sole cause of the breach between captain l  and me and this idea not only inspired me with my former passion for him but added a tenderness and compassion to my sentiments that rendered me infinitely more wretched than i was before the brutality of mr w  still further strengthened my affections toward him and the state of divorce to which his violence had now reduced me dissolved that solemn and honorable tie which would otherwise have restrained the wanderings of my heart and ever preserved my duty faithful to him  it would be impossible to describe the pangs i felt when the hour arrived in which i was to be torn from a fond mothers converse  she was all the world to me at least she was all that i then thought truly loved me in the world  we parted  and at her most earnest entreaty i promised to write to mr w  as soon as my mind should be sufficiently composed and to enter into a proper vindication of my hitherto irreproachable conduct  more dead than alive my duenna and i arrived at my destined prison  the house was old large and gloomy extremely out of repair the furniture as antique as the building which was situated on a bleak and barren shore opposite the irish coast  for the first ten or twelve days that i passed in this dismal mansion i was delighted with the stillness and solitude that surrounded me  the family was composed of only three maids and an old gardener and i have sometimes passed a dozen hours without hearing any sound except the roaring of the sea the croaking of the ravens or howling of a mastiff  but when the agitation of my mind began a little to subside i grew sensible to the horrors of my situation and would have preferred a dungeon with any human creature i could converse with to the liberty of stalking through an uninhabited range of chambers in silence and solitude  monasteries afford society and goals are not destitute of companions which are a solace even in misery but here i was both wretched and alone  i used often to consider myself as a delinquent entombed alive secluded from the universe and only conscious of existence from continued regret  i sought for amusement in books and found none that were capable of affording me any the few volumes that i met with were meant to inspire devotion but as they were written on fanatical principles they were either so ridiculously absurd as to create disgust or so extremely rigid as to induce despair  in conformity to my promise i had written to mr w  but received no answer and what was infinitely more grievous to me i had not the happiness of hearing once from my mother or any one else though eight months had lagged with leaden steps along since the first day of my confinement  when the weather permitted i sometimes walked by the sea side and have frequently poured forth my sorrows to the deaf unpitying waves  often my edward have i sighed out your name and sent forth ardent prayers for your return to comfort and support our hapless mother yet i will own that the loved sound of l  still oftener passed my lips  was this a crime my affections were thrown back upon my hands and this methought gave me a right to transfer them  in this situation i had remained in my exile for a tedious interval when one fine evening having indulged my reveries by the sea side longer than usual the twilight coming on warned me of returning home when i saw two men at a small distance walking slowly behind me  a sight so unusual joined to an apprehension that they might have overheard my soliloquy put my spirits into a flutter though from their pace and manner they did not seem as if they intended to pursue me  i was seized with an universal tremor my limbs could scarce support me and i could march but slowly on  before i was able to recover myself and mend my speed one of the persons came up to me while the other retired as if for fear of alarming me  i did not venture even to look at him and began to mend my pace but sight was useless when his well known voice uttered these words o fear no injury from me my dear deceived unhappy and still adored maria  surprise terror hope fear love anger grief and joy  in short every passion of the human heart hatred alone excepted rushed through my mind and totally deprived me of the power of utterance while he  need i write his name  taking advantage of my silence proceeded thus  i have long sought this opportunity of speaking to you but my tenderness my delicacy and respect for the only woman i ever did or can love have prevented my attempting it hitherto in any way that might reflect upon the character of mr w  s wife and by that means countenance and justify the calumny with which he has aspersed your reputation  the lucky moment i have so long watched for in private has at length arrived and if you ever loved me my maria you will not now refuse to hear me for a moment while i tell you that you have been most cruelly deceived  i know it sir i replied you need not now inform me of your own perfidy  to you alone i owe the miseries i suffer and mr w  himself is innocent when compared with you  then let me go this moment for however my duty to him may have been dissolved by his unkindness that which i owe myself forbids my ever holding converse with you more  i attempted to break from him but he held me fast and vowed most solemnly that he would never quit me unless i promised to meet him the next evening on the beach and allow him to exculpate himself of the infidelity i charged him with and which he then denied with the strongest asseverations adding that matilda had betrayed us both and was the vilest being upon earth  then promised if i would but hear him once he would never importune me more  almost distracted with contending passions and terrified lest his imprudence might involve me in farther difficulties i promised to comply with his request provided he would leave me on the instant as i heard the sound of voices which i knew to be the servants coming in quest of me as they must necessarily be alarmed at my unusual sty  he pressed my hand to his lips and withdrew directly  with trembling steps i pursued my way homewards and met my maid with the gardener coming in search of me  the agitation of my mind was too visible in my countenance to pass unnoticed and they naturally inquired if i had met with any fright or accident i told them that the night had fallen upon me sooner than i had expected it that i had been then alarmed at the loneliness of my situation and the haste i was obliged to make homewards had hurried my spirits a little  i desired a glass of water and pretended to retire to rest  as soon as i was left alone i began to reflect upon the extraordinariness of my adventure with captain l  upon the strand and on my own weakness in having consented again to meet a person who had despised and rejected me with the utmost insolence and inhumanity  it was however still easier to account for my conduct on this occasion than for his passion selflove and curiosity all conspired to render me desirous of finding a clue to that labyrinth in which i was involved but wherefore should he seek to distress me farther or why pursue a wretch who already entirely secluded from the world had neither inclination or power to disturb his happiness or oppose his views in any scheme of life  the hints he had dropped about matilda puzzled me still farther  was she not the companion of my youth the friend of my heart the confidant of all my joys and sorrows  some instances of her levity and unkindness i did indeed recollect  but could she betray me impossible nature could not produce so vile a monster  or grant there could be such a fiend clothed in a female form  yet still why unprovoked should she exert her malice against me who never had offended her without a view to her own interest or advantage and how could she be profited by my destruction  the more i considered what captain l  had said on this last subject the less credit it gained with me and i persuaded myself that he had only named matilda as a lure to my curiosity  the night passed away insensibly without my being able either to form any rational conjecture with regard to the motives of his behavior or any resolution relative to my own  a thousand times i determined not to keep my appointment with him and as often changed my resolves  it would be endless to repeat the numless arguments for and against this meeting that my love and reason suggested and set in opposition to each other  at length my evil genius prevailed and determined me for once to hear what captain l  could say  about six oclock in the morning i lay down on my bed in order to make my maid believe that i had slept in it as usual i had lain but a short time when i found my harrassed mind inclined to rest and i fell into a slumber out of which i was soon awakened by a dream which affected my mind as much as a vision would have done my senses  i thought that my father stood before me under the same sickly and emaciated appearance with which that true divine conferred his last blessing on me  i threw myself on my knees and endeavored to embrace his but with his face averse he flitted fast away  i rose and pursued him to the brink of a precipice when he turned quick upon me caught me up in his arms and plunged with me directly into the gulf  i awakened with a loud scream thought i was still falling and was for some time in doubt whether it was the reverie of a disturbed brain or an apparition that had occurred to me and only determined it to have been the former by finding myself in the same place i had laid down to rest  i rose up and walked about the room till i had exhausted my strength endeavoring to shake off the kind of horror which had taken possession of my mind and body from this shocking dream but it clung still about me like a wintry cloud and chilled my nerves to numbness  at length toward evening i began to recover myself again  i am not superstitious besides what crime had i ever committed that might conjure up specter from the grave my life had been innocent though unhappy and my mind continued pure though injured and provoked  the reflections which this incident stirred up in my thoughts more particularly at this time with regard to my dear fathers goodness and virtue served principally to compose my spirits to peace  he was indeed a perfect christian both in faith and works his character and conversation were of a piece his example was precept he urged no borrowed morals but preached the very practice of his life  his doctrines were strict yet indulgent charitable though severe  his austerity was only in his maxims and his mind his mildness in his censures and his heart  these pious thoughts wrought me up to an enthusiasm of devotion i fell on my knees to thank heaven for having been derived from two such pure sources as my father and mother and prayed most fervently that i might never be guilty of any thought or deed which should render me unworthy of such faultless originals  as the hour approached when i was to meet captain l  the terrors of my mind increased yet i found myself so strongly impelled from the motives already mentioned joined to a curiosity to know where the blame lay between matilda and him that i could not resist the temptation of hazarding the interview i went softly down the back stairs which led from a closet within my apartment and found my way out unseen by any of the family  the agitation of my spirits was so violent that i scarce knew what i did i sometimes ran toward the shore as if i had been pursued by wild beasts then stopped and stood motionless as if my faculties had ceased  at length i perceived captain l  at some distance he flew to me and caught me in his arms i burst into a passion of tears and was incapable of utterance  as soon as i could recover my speech i assumed all the dignity of resentment and told him that he was no longer to consider me as the weak tender maria s  but as an injured and offended judge who came to hear the poor defense which he could make for having so ungenerously wronged and so cruelly injured her  again he pressed me to his bosom and exclaimed o could i but repair the wrongs you have suffered as easily as i can prove i never was the author of them my loved maria should be mine and happy  and it shall still be so  victims of artifice and fraud shall we continue to be wretched because matilda and your husband have concurred to render us so  that fatal name of husband i replied has fixed an everlasting bar between happiness and me but were there no such person in the world you cannot think of me so meanly to suppose that i would condescend to accept of one who had rejected and despised me  no blandishments no arts can ever soothe my tortured mind into forgetfulness of your contempt  he then begged that i would hear him justify himself and began by informing me that about a year before my arrival at bath he had gone there as most young people do in quest of amusement that he happened to lodge in the same house with matilda and her husband who both sought and cultivated his acquaintance and as he had no particular attachment to any other persons there he devoted himself entirely to them was of all their parties and never absent from them  he confessed that he liked matilda better than any woman then at bath and that he began to flatter himself he was not disagreeable to her from the levity of her manners he had reason to believe she was not overstrict in her morals and on her husbands being obliged to go to london for a few days she convinced him that he had not been mistaken  their guilty commerce lasted but a short time it began without passion and of course terminated in indifference at least on his side he quitted bath without any design of ever returning though matilda and her husband had taken a house and determined to fix their residence there  some months after he was attacked with a violent bilious complaint and ordered to bath by his physicians and was just recovering from this disorder when my mother and i happened to bend our course thither  what passed between us on our first acquaintance i have already told you except matildas machinations to break off our intercourse and recall him to his former attachment  when she found her arts were unsuccessful she changed her battery and pretended to conceive a particular friendship for me and became our mutual confidant but at the same time from her superior regard for captain l  used often to remonstrate to him how much his family would be offended at his marrying a girl without rank or fortune  but all these arts and insinuations he vowed had not the least manner of effect upon his mind or heart his passion was too firmly founded on admiration and esteem to be so easily shaken and he declared that at the sad moment of our parting his whole affections and sole purpose in life were pointed toward our mutual happiness and honor together  he confessed however that during the unlucky interval of absence the hints and representations of matilda had wrought by degrees the malicious effect intended by them for she had framed a novel against me with so much address and ingenuity so guarded at all points that each part of it seemed to vouch the truth of the rest  even the indiscretion of my having been led into play by her own artifice she most wickedly represented to him as a vice of mine and reported the circumstances of my debt to mr w  which she also exaggerated with such reflections as placed me in the shocking light of a girl who was resolved to make the most of her youth and beauty without any further regard to morals or character  in fine he acknowledged that the plausible manner in which she gave him these advices from time to time with the tender and compassionate expressions she affected now and then to let drop upon the unhappiness of my conduct had at length so entirely injured me in his esteem that it occasioned his writing me the letter before mentioned when he was going to set sail for america  what a recital was this for me to listen to in my then unfortunate circumstances his justification but increased my misery  i had never imagined there was so much vileness in human nature as the base matilda appeared now to be capable of and was shocked to think that i was of the same species with such a monster in wickedness  i wept  we both of us wept while he thus went on with his story  when i quitted europe continued he the poison of matildas correspondence ceased its operations my passion and reflection had liberty to exert themselves and i began to doubt the authenticity of the extraordinary accounts i had received about you  your bloom and beauty presented themselves to my fond imagination in the warmest colors  your candor innocence and ingenuousness of manners occurred then strongly to my mind  could such a character become so quickly abandoned said i to my heart  it must be unnatural and what is contrary to nature must be improbable at least if not impossible  thus did i often plead your cause my ever loved maria against the foul charges of your enemy whom i unhappily however did not look upon then in that light but merely as an unfortunate woman who having been guilty of vice herself was as too generally is the case apt to construe every action of others into the worst sense that the appearances or circumstances of it can bear  upon this fair discussion of the point i wrote once more to matilda expressing my doubts not of her sincerity but about her misapprehensions only of your conduct  said that general charges suspicions and hearsays were but insufficient evidences where so choice a jewel as character was at stake and called upon her for some facts of more public notoriety to support her slanders  as all correspondence had been broken off between you and me said he she ventured now to speak out more boldly and without the least equivocation in her terms assured me that you lived publicly with mr w  and privately intrigued with sir james d  that the extravagance of your dress pleasures and other expenses was supported between them that you had kept them both attached to you by raising a spirit of rivalship between them and used also to render each of the galants jealous in their turns by alarming them with me  with the letter she wrote as she said by your desire from bristol she sent me another in which she told me that you had at length brought mr w  to consent to marry you on account of your being with child and that the letter was framed with a view either of duping me into a marriage which she believed you would prefer or of paying mr w  the compliment of sacrificing me to him if i should return a favorable answer  there is no describing the height of resentment to which i was affected upon this occasion and i should have replied to the proposal in the most outrageous terms imaginable if my love and fondness for you which still remained though my esteem was flown had not restrained my hand and dictated those cool but not violent lines i sent her in answer  he told me that when he returned to england upon his fathers illness he felt himself impelled by a strong desire of seeking some proper opportunity of reproaching me for my infidelity and of covering me with the utmost confusion by expressing the detestation and contempt that even a man and a soldier was capable of conceiving at the breach of honor or virtue in a woman that he loved  he mentioned this purpose he said in a letter to matilda and she most strenuously opposed it she told him that such a sentiment was no good sign of a recovery from his infatuated passion for she feared much that all the malice of his heart was love that this would be but affording me the triumph of thinking him still my slave and might put it in my power to involve him perhaps in a duel with mr w  whom she represented as extremely jealous from very conscious reasons if as it was more than probable i should be willing to exchange my wedding garment for a widows weed  however all these arguments not being sufficient to deter him from coming to bath he wrote her word that he would be there on such a day and has had reason to suppose since that she must have advised mr w  of this particular by his coming so critically from london on the same day and meeting him in the rooms that fatal night which i have before mentioned to you  i need not now my dear brother recapitulate what passed in consequence of this vile womans malice you have hitherto seen me the innocent victim of her cruelty  too happy should i now deem myself had i still remained so  my fainting in the rooms at the sight of captain l  awakened his former tenderness for me and the inhumanity with which mr w  treated me on that occasion for the surgeon had made the story public seemed to demand his pity for a wretch doomed to be punished for an involuntary and guiltless act  he would have gone in person the next morning to mr w  in order to have justified my character as far as it related to the scandal then cast upon it with regard to him but was restrained from the attempt by matildas saying that this would only make the matter worse in all probability that the interfering between man and wife was a dangerous measure in any person whatsoever but that the lover the very cause of the contention must certainly be the most improper mediator in their reconcilement that could possibly be imagined  she therefore advised him to wait with patience till passion on the husbands part might become calm enough to listen to reason and that resentment peculiarly natural to a wife suspected in the wrong place this was her expression should have somewhat subsided and then promised him to undertake the interposition herself at the proper crisis probably to better effect than it could be engaged in even by her during the present violence of the parties  he stayed at bath while i remained there and suffered an anxiety which increased more and more every day a by mixing with the company at the rooms but more particularly with the residents of the place among whom m late adventure was publicly talked o he heard every one take my part an vindicate my innocence from their former knowledge and general good opinion of my character and conduct eve since i had first become an inhabitan of that city  in fine he heard it agreed upon o all sides that mr w  could have n other foundation for his jealousy of m except that sort of suspicion which is naturally apt to arise from too great a diparity in years especially in the breast o a man who had had but little acquainance with any women except those of  profligate character  these fair reports in my favor he said began soon to convince him of matildas treachery and he reproached her with it warmly one day when with the greatest sang froid imaginable she answered him in these very words there is no such thing as eleemosynary wisdom in this life let philosophers and pedagogues say what they will  experience must be purchased at our own proper cost and not at the expense of others  from this warning you will be taught sufficient sense to know for the future that to make a woman the confidant of her rival is appointing a wolf to be the shepherd of a lamb  i forget whether this maxim be taken notice of in ovids art of love if not his precepts are imperfect  he assured me that on this reply his sight and reason forsook him for a time and only returned to enable him to view the hag as she then appeared to him with the greater horror and to possess him with a rage that fell but little short of madness what would i have given at that instant cried he out to have exchanged her sex into a dozen armed men and then concluded the sentence with this expression  but i could not exert such resentment against her as she deserved because she was in my power  he did every thing he could to find out the place of my banishment but could not discover it  he did not know of my being moved from bath till after i had been sent away or he would have employed some trusty person or other to have watched me to the place of my destination  the surmises were various upon this occasion some said i was to be carried over to france and forced into a convent some that i was to be locked up in mr w  s house in london and others that i was to be betrayed into a private madhouse and confined there for life  during the uncertainty of all these several reports captain l  received an account of his fathers illness and immediately repaired to london to attend on him his filial duty claimed his first regard and the exercise of that virtue served to restrain his impatience and balance his anxiety on my account for several months while sir richard l  lingered before his death  captain l  now become sir thomas l  with a large patrimony being at length released from any further restraint upon his time and actions began to turn his whole thoughts toward the unhappiness of my situation and considered himself bound not as a knight errant merely but as a man of honor to rescue me from that distress which he had been the innocent cause of through the treachery of one person and the too hasty sentence and unwarrantable severity of another  he returned immediately to bath in order to get what information he could about me and hearing that my dear mother had retired to a village in flintshire took the resolution of going to wait upon her there  as soon as he had informed her who he was she began to reproach him in the manner it was natural for her to have done from the circumstances of his conduct toward me in the light it had hitherto appeared to her but when he had disclosed the scene of villainy and deceit to which he had likewise fallen a victim her affections softened and she could not help looking upon him then as a third sufferer in our complicated misfortune  he contrived artfully to draw from her the secret of my abode but without suffering the least hint to escape him of any purpose to seek me there then taking her hand and kneeling before her vowed an attachment to me during life said he would ever pay her the respect and duty of a soninlaw attending till death or some more speedy vengeance might remove mr w  out of the way of his happiness and offered her an affluent support out of his fortune becoming the honorable connection which he had then declared between them  my dear unhappy mother returned him the most grateful thanks for the kindness and generosity of his offer but her spirit and delicacy made her decline the acceptance of it she confessed herself alarmed even at his visit and urged him to depart instantly without suffering himself to be known lest this circumstance though accidental and innocent in itself might possibly in the train of our misfortunes happen to be made an additional article of suspicion against us all she plained the distress and difficulty of our situations  they embraced and he retired immediately out of the town  on his route to devonshire bath lay in his way where he happened to meet with captain r  who had been an officer in the same corpse with him in america there had always subsisted a particular intimacy between them and as friendship is apt to inspire a confidence and that his heart was full he imparted the whole secret of our loves and disappointments to him  he also informed him at the same time of his resolve to go and conceal himself somewhere near the place of my retirement till he might meet with a favorable opportunity without hazard to my reputation of seeing me even for a minute in order to vindicate himself from the unjust opinion i must necessarily have conceived of his infidelity and baseness declaring also that he thought it a duty incumbent on him to watch over my destiny and at the expense of his fortune and the sacrifice of his life to defend me from any injury or violence that might ever be attempted against me  captain r  approved his motives and commended his purpose and said that as it was a service of danger he had a right to claim the privilege of a friend and a comrade in sharing it with him  sir thomas readily accepted of his company and they set out the next morning for hartland which is within a mile of the castle where i resided they were attended only by two servants and a couple of pointers on pretense of going into that country merely as unconnected idle traveling sportsmen  sir thomas did not acquaint his friend with my name nor where i was concealed and used every morning and evening to wander alone round the place of my confinement in hopes of seeing me as i should walk abroad and of speaking to me unobserved which after about a fortnights attendance he happened to meet with  in this sweet but dangerous converse did we pass the minute for to us it appeared no more of our assignation and now judge me edward with your wonted candor nor blame this foolish heart if every tender every fond sensation it had ever felt returned with double force remember that i had never loved another and that i still loved him even when i thought him false what must my transports be to find him true  when in my turn i told him the inhuman arts that had been practiced to betray me and estrange our mutual confidence his passions rose almost to madness and he a thousand times exclaimed that i was still his wife that our hearts were joined by heaven and that no power on earth should ever part us more  too eagerly i listened to his ravings and suffered the enchantment of his voice to lull asleep my prudence and my reason  i felt as if there were but us alone of all our species existing in this world and all other connection obligation or regard appeared to me then but metaphysical speculation  our sad attention to each others woes had so entirely engrossed our thoughts that night stole on us almost unperceived tears had quite dimmed my sight and my weak trembling limbs needed assistance to support my weight  i could not then refuse his kind sustaining arm to help me on toward the mansion of my sorrows the dungeon of my misery  while we were on our way a sudden storm arose and the clouds burst forth in horrid thunder and lightning by the time we had come within sight of the backdoor through which i had that evening stolen out a violent shower came on which obliged me to hasten my speed  i entreated him to leave me but he held me fast by the arm till we came to the house which he entered along with me         here drop the curtain edward and let this first false step of my whole life stand as a mark for the innocent and unwary to shun  let them restrain the first encroachments of a favored lover nor vainly fancy when once they yield the reins that they can after check the ardent coursers speed  till that unhappy night guilt was a stranger to my suffering heart and therefore i had never known remorse or fear  it was impossible to soothe my tortured soul to peace  the fond delusion of his prior right both to my person and my heart  my former arguments of dissolved tie and transferred ffections appeared all but selfdeceit in my present circumstances the wretched sophistry vanished like a phantom from me and in its room the priest the altar all the awful scene where i had bound myself by solemn vows to be anothers wife now rushed upon me and in the anguish of my heart i bitterly exclaimed against him as the prime source of all my misery and bad him fly for ever from my sight  sir thomas said every thing that honor could dictate or love inspire to temper my emotions of grief and rage threw himself at my feet entreated my forgiveness called me his wife his betrothed before heaven vowed eternal faith and constancy to me and offered to fly with me to any part of the globe at length seeing that nothing could calm my distraction he started up laid his hand to his sword and declared that he would instantly put an end to that existence which my resentment had now rendered miserable to him  his violence suspended for a time my agitations by adding terror to my other feelings  i caught hold of his arm and now became a suppliant in my turn begging that he would not further injure me by such an horrid outrage and promising to compose my mind by penitence and prayer as soon as i was left alone but upon this condition only that he should never attempt to see me again till it was possible for us to meet for life without a crime we parted mutually wretched in agony and despair  the horror with which i was seized the moment he had quitted me is not to be conceived without guilt i lost that firmness now which had hitherto born up my spirits under all my sufferings purity the only resource in affliction was now fled for ever from my breast  i felt the full weight of all my ills and what appeared before oppression on my innocence seemed now but justice on my crime i rejoiced i had no sister i thought of you my brother of my dear mother too and with a shower of tears took leave of these fond names for ever  i stood in life alone severed from all connection the sustaining hope of being again restored to honor and society like the fair fruit that sprang in pandaemonium now turned to bitter ashes what had i further to do with the world alas i had already forfeited all protection my last nights dream  say rather vision  stared me full in the face and upbraided me with the recollection of a maxim i had often heard my parent saint deliver that we should ever consider those persons we had a respect for as present when absent and as living when dead i kneeled down and strove to pray but could not i felt myself in a state of reprobation and was almost fallen into despair  i had no stay no support no resource in store  in all the other ills of life heaven suffers us not to be afflicted beyond our strength but wretchedness with guilt exceeds the scheme of providence  i then endeavored to rise but was not able to stand  my exhausted spirits failed me and i sunk down again upon the floor where i continued some time in a state of stupidity till my maids opening the door of the antechamber warned me to disguise my disturbance  i concealed my distraction as well as i could by keeping my face turned from her as much as possible and for the first time felt what an irksome thing it is to have any thing to hide  the storm continued all the night with extreme violence but the thunder and lightning did not alarm me as they had done on the evening before  i had now a louder monitor in my breast than the one and with what open arms and welcome greetings should i then have embraced the other  how long sir thomas staid at hartland i cannot tell for i never ventured abroad from that time even to take a walk in the gardens and he behaved with so much honor as to obey my last injunction to him by not seeking any further opportunity as far as i could learn of seeing me again or even of attempting to write a line to me lest it might as it certainly would have been intercepted so that i began soon to reconcile myself to my present situation by making that solitude and confinement a voluntary penance which i had hitherto looked upon as the severest infliction considering it but as a convent within the sequestered walls of which i should then most assuredly have concealed myself from the world had i been at liberty to have chosen my situation  i conformed myself entirely to a true monastic state for a time by spending my days in fasts in contrition and in prayer hoping that my sorrows would ere long have ended with my life but i was alas too soon convinced that fate had not yet emptied all its quiver against me for i had the inexpressible shock to find that i was likely to bring an innocent being into the world at once to prove and share my infamy  i shall not attempt to describe the agonies of my mind upon this discovery  i must live to have endeavored still to solicit that death which my despair had tempted me to wish so ardently for before while it related only to myself would have been a double guilt in my present circumstances  i must therefore submit to become more miserable in order to render myself less criminal  in such a miserable and forlorn situation what measure was left me to pursue there was indeed but one and let the fatal necessity of it plead my excuse  i had refused to fly with sir thomas when he begged it on his knees i could not yield deliberate consent to vice or think of delivering myself over to a life of profligacy but i must now temporize with guilt  i must now extricate myself from my present difficulty shame and danger at any expense though with a determined purpose to cover my head immediately after in some severe convent there to endure the harshest penances and hide me from the world for ever  in the confusion and distraction i was in at that time i could not frame any certain scheme for my relief besides that point depended on the concurrence of another i therefore wrote a letter to sir thomas entreating the favor of him to come to me directly upon a business of consequence to us both and in which something more than my own life was the object of my anxiety  i did not know where sir thomas then was but ventured to direct it to him according to my former address from bath to his fathers house in bloomsbury square  but when i had sealed this billet a new difficulty occured to me how i could possibly get it conveyed to him  all connection between me and the world had been cut off from the moment of my commitment my duenna had at first refused to let a letter from me even to my mother be carried to the post and told me frankly then that any directed to me were ordered to be returned from thence unopened to mr w   the danger pressed and some attempt must be hazarded i recollected that there was a labourer who generally worked in the garden and appeared to be a person of rational intelligence i therefore went out to him and gave the letter into his hands with a bribe of five guineas which fee i promised to double for him on his return with an answer and hinted to him all proper cautions with regard to the secrecy of his commission  i instructed the messenger to make some pretense or other of private business for absenting himself from his service and desired him not to attempt to deliver the answer of my letter to me till he should meet me alone in the garden  i had a full view of it from the windows of my apartment and watched with the utmost impatience for his appearance again from the moment that i thought it possible for him to have returned how much did i envy during this anxious interval the infinitely preferable state of the meanest peasant i heard whistling carelessly across the demesne who enjoyed peace and competence without a consciousness of guilt or the fear of detection  at length i had the satisfaction to see my courier arrive and waiting till i perceived the coast clear i stole out to him and had the pleasure to receive a letter from sir thomas filled with the tenderest professions of love and the fullest assurances of honor he promised to be with me that very evening just at night fall and desired i would meet him at the end of the grove near the house  i was punctual to time and place and found him also exact to his appointment  he was full of transport at the sight of me but i was not in a fit disposition of mind to attend to his ecstasies  i begged he would compose himself while i looked about through every avenue to see that no prying eye was near to observe our motions then led him with fearful hands and trembling steps into the house and we retired up stairs together to my apartment  as i had not used myself to eat suppers ever since my confinement in this place i always dismissed my attendant as soon as she had left candles lighted on my table choosing to sit up alone most part of the nights employed in reading musing and working so that i was under no sort of apprehension of being at any time interrupted in my privacy  as soon as we had got into the room sir thomas attempted to catch me in his arms but i started from his embrace  i told him that we were neither of us in time place or circumstances to admit of unwarrantable liberties that i had desired this meeting to implore the assistance of his friendship and honor only not to receive his love the least overture of which as i had declared to him before i was firmly resolved to oppose till such a time if ever that happy era should arrive as might entitle him to ask and me to grant the unreserved completion of his wishes  with true humanity and generous acquiescence he immediately desisted from all further importunity  as he guessed the situation i was in from the hint in my letter and therefore concluded what the purport of my summons tended to he had the tenderness and politeness not to wait for any further explanation of the matter but immediately proposed to me that we should directly abscond together to some distant part of the kingdom from whence we might sail over to the continent and there secret ourselves for life in some retired spot safe from pursuit or inquiry adding that he should not look upon this retreat to be an exile to himself as he might well be said to carry his country along with him while he was in possession of all he loved or valued in it  i had no other resource left me now and the choice is soon made where there remains but one option  i rendered the most grateful acknowledgments to him for the generosity of his offer which i readily accepted of told him that i from that moment resigned my fate into his hands and that he should thenceforward be the sole arbiter of my destiny accountable to himself alone for all my future weal or woe  he kneeled took my hand kissed and bathed it with his tears  you do not i hope my dear brother imagine me so devoid of sensibility as not to suppose that i then felt the disgrace which my misconduct must entail upon an honored parent nor were you absent edward from my thoughts but let me say this in my excuse that i then flattered myself my flight or rather the motives for it might remain for ever secret and that living in a foreign land under a feigned name my person might possibly never be discovered  and in that case those dear connections could be as little involved in my reproach as they were concerned in my guilt  here end all the reflections i shall ever make  the following part of my unhappy story while i relate it harrows up my soul congeals my faculties and impels me to wild distraction or to reprobate despair  when we had thus settled the article of our flight together we agreed further upon the manner and circumstances of it sir thomas was to retire immediately to his inn before my garrison should be shut up for the night and send off an express to exeter for a postchaise with relays of horses to be ready the next evening at the further end of the grove where i promised to meet him at the close of day from thence to launch into a world unknown without a matron without a guardian  for i had lost my innocence  just as i was rising up to convey him out of the house i heard some hasty steps passing through the antechamber the door of my room was suddenly burst open and i saw mr w  enter with a pistol in each hand sir thomas laid hold of his sword but before he could draw it received a bullet in his breast  he fell  and do i survive to tell it i heard his last groan and saw him exp at my feet  i heard nor saw no more bu falling senseless on his lifeless bosom was for a while released from agonies too great   but my miseries were not so soon to have an end i was dragged back again to life by the still cruel hands of mr w  who assisted my maid to raise me from the floor and lay me on the bed  the first use i made of my returning sense was to rise upon my knees and with uplifted hands implore his mercy to terminate my misfortunes and my life together  he looked as if he would do so but turning from me cried no thou shall be reserved for more exemplary vengeance and walked immediately out of the room taking the maid along with him but leaving the discharged pistol by me on the bed  with my reason my ho returned  let compassion but reflect on my situation barbarity itself must soften into humanity at the thought  loaded with infamy encompassed with misery entombed as it were alive with the dead and gazing horribly without the relief even of tears on the sad victim of my illstarred destiny at length frantic with grief with terror and despair unknowing what i did and without any purposed end i rushed down the backstaris and issued through the private door from that accursed mansion  fear gave wings to my speed yet at the same time retarded my flight for though i ran as fast as it was possible i frequently stopped for several minutes to listen to every sound i heard and sometimes clambered over high ditches and laid myself flat on the ground to prevent my being seen in case i was pursued though the night was so dark that i could almost feel an object before i saw it  my haste was urged by instinct merely determined to no point but like a frightened animal i fled from danger without direction in my course  my mind was all the while in the state of a dream  i knew of no asylum i could frame no purpose  at length exhausted by fatigue and oppressed with sorrow i sat myself down in the corner of a field surrounded by a little coppice just high enough to conceal me from the view of passengers  here nature till now restrained still active for its own relief began to release the utterances of grief and at the very moment that i felt my heart going to burst asunder my tears broke forth and i found myself at libery to express my sufferings in moanings and exclamations  this gave me ease at first and i therefore indulged it for a while till i began to apprehend toward day that the loudness of my complaints might possibly reach the ear of some traveller or villager and betray the situation of my concealment and the particular circumstances of my story  but yet i could not silence my cries and lamentations i became desperate of all human succor and thought that even the hands of cruelty might relieve me from the effects of my own distraction by putting an end to my life without any additional guilt of mine  at length my voice was heard and answered by one who came rustling through the coppice and in a soft slender tone cried out where are you who are you and what ails you the sound at first alarmed me till i was struck with the appearance of a beautiful boy of about seven years old at a little distance who as soon as he spied me came running up and told me that his mamma had been awakened in bed with my cries had rung her bell and ordered her servant to go seek the person in grief but that he got out of the house before him was glad he had sound me first and begged i would go home along with him directly out of that nasty cold place to make his mammas mind easy  the prettiness of the childs person with the goodnatured impatience and anxiety it expressed about my situation charmed me in that instant of distress and woe till he came up close to me when i felt a sudden shock at the sight of him  he seemed to be a son of mr w  s he had every feature of his face  i started and trembled  however i soon recovered myself concluding that such an idea must be owing merely to the strong impression which his countenance had made on my mind at our last interview and which a terrified immagination might possibly have transferred a likeness of to any object viewed in the uncertain light of a just opening dawn  i therefore embraced the lovely child and walked away with him leaning on the servants arm who was then come up to a neat cottage which was but a few yards from the spot i had been found in  i was received at the door of the house by a lady of a genteeler appearance than one could naturally expect to have met with under so mean a roof who with a voice of sweetness welcomed me to what hospitality her circumstances could afford and taking me by the hand led me into her best apartment  i sat down on the first chair i could reach and begged for a glass of water to prevent my fainting which i apprehended from my feelings might probably soon happen  the room we were in was soon lighted up with fire and candles the blaze of which offended my tender sight already dimmed by the darkness of the foregoing night and weakened by my tears which prevented me from being able to view objects distinctly enough at first but when the agitation of my spirits had been somewhat abated and that my eyes had recovered their strength a little i perceived the lady to be a person of about four and twenty years of age and extremely handsome but seeming much impaired in her appearance by grief or sickness  here i began to shudder again for the resemblance between her and mr w  struck me more forcibly than it had done before in the child  there could be no equivocation in this instance  her features marked the likeness stronger and the clear light i had then an opportunity of viewing her by put the similitude beyond a doubt  this mystery alarmed me  i feared i had fallen into dangerous hands but it would have been doubly improper to have asked for a solution of this riddle on account either of the seeming to pry into her secret or the hazard of betraying my own  i therefore concealed my surprise though i could not avoid showing my uneasiness which she perceiving but without suspecting the cause and imputing solely to my misfortunes and fatigue which she seemed to think were sufferings i had not been much accustomed to entreated me to repose myself on the bed that was in the chamber as long as i pleased without fear of interruption till i should be inclined to accept of any other kind of comfort or refreshment that might be within the compass of her poor means to afford me  the voice of kindness to an oppressed heart at once soothes and gives vent to its sufferings i answered only with my tears she rose and taking her child by the hand said that she was too well acquainted with sorrow to attempt to restrain its course or think it capable of any other relief than time and prayer adding that i need be under no manner of apprehension that any curiosity of here is should prompt her to inquire into my story as the measure of her own misfortunes was too full already to admit the addition of anothers grief without the power of alleviating it she retired immediately without waiting for a reply  being now sheltered from all outward ills and violences the distraction of my mind began to feel itself under the less control despair and phrenzy now triumphed over my reason and religion i looked about for some instrument of destruction to put an end to my miserable existence and snatching at a sword that hung unsheathed over the chimney i had just set the hilt of it to the ground when my guardian hostess attentive to my motions running into the room to see what had occasioned my disturbance had just time enough to strike the point aside so that i fell unhurt upon the floor   o stop the hand of rashness she exclaimed nor dare to limit mercy he who severely tries as amply can reward the patient sufferer let thy proud heart bow to his high decrees and learn to bear thy burden with submission  while thus she spoke i gazed upon her with a silent awe and thought her more than human  she raised me from the ground with looks of tenderness and thus proceeded  that sorrow has beset and has subdued you i can well perceive  alas what is your strength or mine opposed to its rude grasp but wherefore then should we rely upon ourselves when offered aid bends from high heaven for our acceptance and bids our weak humanity be strong in its almighty power  i sunk again upon my knees before her and cried out i have no hope in heaven or earth thou messenger of grace thy proffered aid is vain i am an outcast from society nor would even your charity extend itself to such a wretch as me were you to know my crimes  i will not hear them then she answered quick but sure there is no guilt except despair that may not hope for pardon  remove that gloomy vice from your sad heart and penitence shall heal the wounds of your offenc and bid your bleeding bosom be at peace  by slow degrees this more than woman this heaveninstructed comforter calmed my distracted soul and reasoned down my frenzy  i passed my word to her not to attempt my life and i have kept it have waited till the lingering though sure bane of human health unceasing sorrow shall release my promise and lay me gently in the silent grave  as soon as my mind had become somewhat more composed i began to reflect upon the circumstances of my late misfortune  i thought with horror on the impiety  neglecting a duty toward the manes of the unhappy sacrifice of my wayward destiny i felt like an accomplice in the guilt if i should not endeavor to rescue the remains of that dear and unfortunate object from the still continued barbarity of his murderer and attempt to procure it the rites of christian at least of human sepulture  the idea that first occured to me upon this occasion was to fly off directly to the inn at hartnd to captain r  for sir thomas had told me that his friend and confident had accompanied him now as before  and to have acquinted him with the fatal catastrophe of my story  but how to appear before a stranger or indeed any person whatsoever under the sensation of onscious guilt and public infamy besides mig i not happen to be detected there and possibly have involved a third person in my complicated misfortune however i contrived to qualify these scruples by the subterfuge of writing a note to him containing only these few words  your friend is alas no more he lies murdered at castle w  i do not mean by this notice to call even for justice against his assassin but only hope that your humanity and friendship may be able to defend his hapless corse from any further indignity or outrage  to this billet i did not subscribe any name but got my kind hostess to send it off immediately to the inn by one of the villagers who was instructed not to say from whence he came nor to await an answer  this most excellent woman so far from desiring to dive into the secret of my distress made it a point rather that i should not reveal it whenever she heard me begin to mourn but in order as she said to convince me that mine was not a partial lot and that she had herself severely tasted of the bitter cup she would relate some of those very uncommon misfortunes which had attended her through life and which might perhaps in some measure reconcile me to my own  but first she insisted that i should endeavor to recruit my strength and spirits with food and rest as the preserving the proper temperament of the body was certainly one requisite toward restoring the health of the mind  i accepted her hospitality and breakfasted on tea but could not eat  she did not press me  she was reasonable in all things entreaty in my situation would have but added to my fatigue and increased my disgust she thought that sleep might for a time better supply the place of food she therefore obliged me to undress myself and go into bed where after having closed the windows as it was now full day and removed every implement of mischief out of the room she left me to repose myself  if possible  i did what i could for that purpose  i owed that duty to the infant yet unborn and was solicitous to preserve that part of myself at least that was innocent but my sorrows kept me long awake till nature taking advantage of my weakness at length delivered my body over to sleep though without composing my mind for my disturbed imagination pursued me still throughout my slumber presenting visions of slaughter gibbets and executions to my tortured fancy all the while which instead of yielding me any manner of refreshment by frequent starts awoke me adding the pains of labor to my other ills which brought on a miscarriage toward the evening  my humane hostess attended on me with the kindness and tenderness of a sister supplied me with cordials kept every thing quiet about me and would sit up all night by my bedside notwithstanding every opposition i could make to it the next morning she prevailed on me to take some sustenance after which i claimed her promise of letting me into the history of her life which however i did not do to satisfy an idle curiosity but thought that the circumstances of her recital might perhaps amuse my mind from too fixed an attention to my own sorrows and that the gentle murmurs of her voice with the monotony of narrative might possibly have conduced to slumber  but judge of my amazement when she began by telling me that she was the daughter the only child of mr w  i was near betraying myself  i could not conceal my surprise but cried out it is impossible you cannot be his offspring she calmly answered you know him then and without inquiring further thus proceeded         but as the unhappy maria is come now to a pause in her misfortunes let us my dear sister take this opportunity of resting a little ourselves after the fatigue and horror of her story before we enter upon an other i confess that when i came to this part of it i rejoiced to think she was dead my humanity felt less from the reflection that her sufferings were at an end as we are affected more by the distress we see than by what we only hear of so is our compassion always stronger for the living sorrow than the dead one  yet one must still weep for hecuba  the wind is become fair for this narrative but my anxiety has been increased at not hearing from you before it changed  adieu f cleveland  letter lxvi miss cleveland to lady barton the following episode of the fair cottager though short will be some relief to us both before we proceed to the catastrophe of the main action and conclude the history of the unfortunate maria whose peculiar fate suffered not her indignities to terminate with her life but afterward delivered over her corse into the clutches of the brute colville to be carried in the procession of a mock funeral at amiens  the story of mrs n   my mother was the only child of captain h  a younger brother of a distinguished family her ill fortune brought her acquainted very young with mr w  while he was a student at oxford and under age  they saw liked and wedded without the consent of parents on either side  captain h  was afterward made acquainted with the marriage but died before my other grandfather from whom it was thought prudent to keep it still a secret as my dear mother inherited but a very inconsiderable portion this was made a pretense for keeping their union concealed during the life of his father and my mother who tenderly loved her husband consented to let their connection still wear the veil of mystery rather than injure his interest or offend his father  the doubtfulness of her situation by degrees detached her own friends entirely from her and for some years before the death of his father she lived in perfect solitude hardly ever seeing any person but her husband and me her only child who were the sole objects of her care and affection  i was about seven years old when my grandfather w  died and i am persuaded that if my mother felt any joy upon that occasion it was for my sake only as she wished to have my legitimacy acknowledged and my education properly attended to  a long habit of retirement had weaned her from the world and though of an age to relish all its pleasures being then but four and twenty she thought of returning into it rather with disgust than delight  upon various pretenses my father declined owning his marriage for about two years and the gentleness of my mothers temper prevented her from importuning him on this or any subject but when so long an interval had elapsed since his fathers death and that she perceived a visible alteration in his behavior toward her she with the utmost mildness expressed her wishes to live with him publicly as his wife  he strove for near a year more to evade her request but when her apprehensions began to be alarmed by his conduct and that she ventured so far as to press him on the subject he slew into a rage and utterly denied his having ever been married to her  tears and prayers were all the weapons with with she attempted to assert her rights  they had alas no power on his obdurate heart  grief preyed upon her tender frame and when i had just entered my tenth year she fell into a consumption  she was sensible of her approaching fate and though she had remitted her own claim to my fathers rank or fortune she determined not to leave me in the power of a man who had abandoned her to unmerited infamy but immediately to set about proving her marriage and by that means entitling me both to his name and a proper provision from his fortune  she soon found out that doctor n  the clergyman who had married her lived in the parish of  in this shire and that my grandfather old mr w  had presented him to that living which was incumbent on some part of my fathers estate  she took me with her and set out immediately for his house which expedition she could easily make without her husbands knowledge as they had seldom lived under the same roof together for some time past  it is impossible to express this worthy mans surprise at the sight of my mother and me as my father had informed him that she was dead above three years before left no child and earnestly requested him never to mention his having been married to her as it could answer no end to her then would certainly disoblige some of his relations through whose assistance he said he had conceived reasonable hopes of strengthening his interest in the shire and of improving his fortune  as soon as my mother had acquainted him with her story the good old man promised her to pay a visit the next day to my father who had been his pupil at the university and endeavor to influence him by gentle means to do her the justice he owed her rather than reduce her to the irksome necessity of exposing him and herself by an appeal to some higher and more legal tribunal assuring her at the same time that if his mediation should not be attended with that success which he wished and had reason to expect from it he would no longer hesitate a moment about proving the marriage through all the forms of law  my dear unhappy mother wept and thanked him and the doctor according to his promise proceeded the next day to castle w  which is about ten miles from this village being the mansion seat where my father then resided it happened that he was from home at the time the doctor went to his house and in the fullness of his zeal he wrote him an admonitory letter upon this interesting subject and returned much disappointed at not having seen him  in a few days after this event my father came to doctor n  s and endeavored to make my mothers mind easy upon the equivocal appearances of his conduct toward her imputing it all to the prudential reasons he had before mentioned to the doctor in which he said that the future welfare of herself and family were equally interested adding that their living together in england could not be long concealed but that he was ready to retire with her to any part of flanders upon pretense of his going to travel for a few years till the schemes he had in agitation might be brought to bear when they might return home again and enjoy the remainder of their lives in happiness and honor together  my dear mother as was natural to an unsuspecting and ingenuous mind was fondly amused with this artifice and wept with transport at his mock professions the doctor too blessed his pupil with tears of joy and my father returned back to castle w  the next day in order to prepare every thing necessary toward our departure for the continent without any further delay  but this delusion did not long continue for the morning after he had left us mr n  a young ensign and nephew to doctor n  happened to come from exeter where he was then stationed to pay a visit to his uncle and among other articles of news told him that his landlord and patron as he styled my father was soon to be married to a young lady of family and fortune in the city he came from and that he supposed the doctor would be then called upon to perform the ceremony  the young man had never heard any thing of our story and only mentioned this particular among some other indifferent circumstances of the time  his uncle did not open his mind to him upon the subject but retired immediately to my mothers apartment who happened luckily not to be by when this matter was related and after endeavoring to prepare her as much as possible for the shock acquainted her with the intelligence he had just received  to you dear madam who seem to have known affliction it must be needless to describe the emotions of my unhappy mother upon this occasion  the humane doctor n  said every thing he could think of to assuage her distraction and repeated the promise he had made her before of concurring with her in an immediate vindication of her rights seeing there was now no time to lose and that it was sufficiently apparent mr w  meant to take advantage of her too long acquiescence under the concealment of her marriage and by this new and more public engagement to bar her claim forever  he confessed that notwithstanding his plausible professions to them both at parting his mind could not help still harboring some doubts with regard to the sincerity of them  for however said he my christianity may incline me to a perfect faith in the efficacy of divine grace one is naturally apt to suspect your extempore converts especially where the reformation seems as in this case to have been brought about by the necessity of some present urgency  he concluded then that my fathers scheme in carrying my mother and me out of the kingdom must be to separate us from the advice or assistance of whatever friends we might have here and that being bereft of the protection of english laws he meant to shut us up in a convent together for life upon some forged pretense or other which would leave him at liberty to return in triumph home again and complete his base purpose with his new mistress at exeter  that very day doctor n  gave my mother a regular certificate of her marriage signed by himself as the clergyman who had performed the ceremony referring to the page of the parish registry where that transaction was entered at the bottom of which he put a memorandum of the names of the two witnesses who were present one of which is still alive if that were an article of any manner of consequence to me now  the next day my father came to the house with a carriage to convey us off privately through the country to weymouth where he told us he had prepared a ship to sail over directly to the continent my mother made no reply but wept and quitted the room to leave dr n  at liberty to explain the reason of her silence and sorrow  their conversation was warm but short  the doctor made remonstrances to him upon his behavior both from religion morals and the laws which my father resented with the highest intemperance declaring that he had happily one way still left to screen himself from persecution and prosecution both and then rushed out of the house which expression was soon after more fully explained by hearing that he had gone off to france whither no legal process could pursue him  these transactions were kept a perfect secret from me for several years  my fond mother thought it too soon for me to become acquainted with affliction and our worthy protector had also conceived a certain delicate idea about me with regard to vice  his opinion was certainly just that the longer young people are kept ignorant of it the safer for their morals  purity of thought and innocence of action should be suffered to gain strength by habit before they know that there is such a thing as wickedness in human nature  the shock and abhorrence will be the greater on the first instance and the danger of example less  doctor n  kept us with him and supported us out of his own fortune while my poor mother lived or rather languished which she did for about two years and then expired of a broken heart the doctor was so generous as to make her last moments easy by promising to take care of me till he could force my father by law to make a provision for me as his legitimate child saying that he thought it his duty to pay the debt of gratitude he owed to my grandfather to the only part of his family now that deserved it  my fathers emissaries soon informed him of my mothers death and he returned to his seat a joyful widower  the doctor immediately applied to him on my behalf but so far from being softened by his intercession he loaded him with abuse and threatened him with ruin if he did not instantly consent to my being sent to a convent abroad and solemnly swear never to mention his marriage with my mother nor again interfere in his domestic affairs upon any occasion or pretense what became of his exeter amor i know not having never heard a word about it since  faithful to his promise the doctor refused to give him the satisfaction he required nor would he consent to my going into a convent upon any terms conscious of the purity of his life and actions he disregarded my fathers threats and continued to treat me with the same kindness as if i had been his daughter  my father who was lord of the manor stirred up most of the doctors parishioners to nonpayment of tithes and supported them in every kind of insolence and injustice against him this excellent divine who was really a believer and follower of the doctrine which he taught suffered those who had taken his cloak to take his coat also and having no activity in him but for others in a very short time was deprived of the means of support either for himself or family  but why should i dwell longer on those miseries of which i was the unhappy though innocent cause  this best of men breathed his last sigh in a prison about three years after my mothers death and must latterly have wanted even the common necessaries of life but for the duty and affection of his nephew who was now become a captain and more than shared his little income with him and me who from the time that my dear guardian was thrown into confinement had been placed by him to board and lodge with the wife of his parishclerk  during all the sufferings of this true divine he was never prompted to revile the cruel author of them nor to repine at the wretched state to which he was reduced and even to his last moments comforted and exhorted both me and his fellow prisoners to bear their crosses with resignation with cheerfulness and with forgiveness to their persecutors and oppressors  while the doctor was able to keep house captain n  used often to visit there and stay sometimes whole months together with us and after his uncles misfortune which separated us he came frequently to see me at my new lodgings he was a very worthy agreeable young man we had insensibly conceived a liking for each other and just before his uncles death he asked his consent to offer his hand and heart to me  the good man confessed himself much pleased at this overture and upon mentioning it to me said that when i should no longer have a protector in him i must be either thrown upon the world to get my bread in a state of servitude which he thought both dangerous and improper for me or obliged to sue to my father for a support which he feared he would refuse unless he were to confine me in a convent which he most earnestly entreated me not to consent to but to persevere in suffering for the faith wherein i had been bred  and with regard to his nephew he paid me the compliment to think i was capable of rendering him happy and that eventually i might turn out a good fortune to him either by my fathers death or reformation i received the proposal i confess with pleasure and readily pronounced that consent with my lips which my heart had given before  my more than father my guardian my protector now saw his desire accomplished in our union  with his dying hands he joined ours and then slept in peace  for three whole years i was the happiest of human kind my husband was all that my fondest wishes could have framed that child you saw was his delight and mine no frown ever clouded either of our brows or slightest contradiction passed our lips i was  i was too blessed till heaven reclaimed its best its dearest gift and took him early to reward his virtues  though bred with such a shining pattern as doctor n  before me and long nurtured as i had been in the school of adversity yet this trial was too much for my weak mind which sunk oppressed into lethargic woe  the voice of reason is not heard by grief religion only reaches the sad heart  cheered by the boundless hope of passing an eternity of bliss with him i now lamented i raised my drooping eye lids from the grave and turned my views to heaven implored its grace to bend my stubborn soul to its high will and soothe my warring passions to submission  my prayer was heard no murmurs no complainings from that pious moment of reflection have issued from my lips in humble confidence without impatience i wait for my dismission from this vale of sorrow  yet let me own that were there not a weight thrown in that scale that ties me down to earth my resignation would have had more merit my dear my much loved boy abates my ardor for the land of bliss and makes me fear that while his fate is doubtful i should even shudder on the brink of my long wishedfor voyage  in a heart rightly formed there cannot be a void  maternal fondness now fills the place of chaste connubial love and in this soft exercise of my affections no griefs distract no transports rend my soul  this place i live in is a freehold that captain h  my grandfather had purchased soon after i was born for the term of three lives his own my mothers and mine  his wife had been dead some years before it consists of this cottage a small ploughland a close for pasture and a little garden at an inconsiderable rent  here i have lived all my life except while i was sheltered under the protection of the good doctor n  during which interval the farm was let to a tenant at will till i was married when my dear husband and i came to reside here as much as his military duty would permit and here he left me when he was ordered with the regiment abroad last war in the first campaign of which he was killed  the produce of this small demesne with my pension as a captains widow is all i have to maintain my child and me and require the closest attention and economy to render them sufficient  and even these pittances depend upon the precarious tenure of my life  but i will not doubt the goodness of providence and trust it will raise him up a support when it shall think proper to withdraw mine  now judge unhappy stranger she continued if i have not a right to speak of patience of resignation and religion as the surest balm of sorrow philosophy and faith concur in this there is a hope beyond the grave and naught but vice unatoned by penitence and piety need ever urge despair         i had hung with mute attention on her story my tears had flowed with here is and while she spoke her griefs suspended mine admiration of her virtue now succeeded and kept me silent still but there alas our sympathy must end she might rejoice in her afflictions past whilst i must mourn for ever  i passed six days with this uncanonized saint this living patience of whom shakespeares image was but a prototype she sat like patience on a monument smiling at grief twelfth night  she knew me not all the while and i could not reveal myself nor had the particulars of my sad story yet reached her incurious ears to have given her the least cause of suspecting who i was  by various methods and slow degrees i pursued my journey toward flintshire as i drew nearer to my mothers peaceful cottage i anticipated the misery and horror she would feel when she should know my situation and considered myself as a wretch who was going to communicate an incurable disease to the fond bosom that had nursed and cherished it  prophetic were my thoughts  the first emotions she felt on seeing me were those of love and joy she strained me to her honest breast with true maternal tenderness and exclaimed mr w  has at last relented and blessed me with a sight of my maria whilst i oerwhelmed with her unmerited kindness sunk speechless to the earth  tears were the sole return that i could make to her caresses and inquiries  my mother was alarmed sorrow she said my child we both have known but sure that should not seal your lips to those who wish to share and soothe your griefs or render you insensible to love like mine  i grasped her honored hand pressed it to my heart and vainly strove to articulate a sound  for several hours i remained in this situation  at length my speech returned and throwing myself on my knees before her i could not be prevailed on to forsake that posture till i had recounted to her the whole of that horrid tale which you have just now read  i will not wound your heart my brother with attempting to describe the agonies she suffered during the sad recital of my story yet this truly virtuous this scarce erring woman pitied the crimes which she herself detested and spoke of peace and pardon to my afflicted soul even to the latest moment of her life  for she is dead  she strove to hide her anguish and to lessen mine  the night i got there after i had been in bed and just falling into a slumber from the fatigue of my journey and the waste of my spirits i was alarmed by the noise of some persons who knocked loudly at the door of the house and demanded admittance  the people with whom we lodged refused them entrance unless they would first declare the purpose of their errand  this they refused but sending for a sledge soon battered down all opposition and rushed in  my mother and i had but just time to hurry on our clothes when an ill looking fellow with a candle in one hand and a pistol in the other came into our chamber attended by two other ruffians  upon their appearance we instantly offered to surrender all our effects and promised neither to make resistance nor pursuit they seemed highly to resent our manner of reception and replied that they scorned to use any manner of violence that might not be justified by the law  the principal of the men then told me that he was steward to mr w  and had been dispatched by him with a warrant to apprehend me for the murder of sir thomas l  early the next morning after the fact and my flight for the same with directions to come and look for me in that place as it was natural to suppose that i should have flown to my mother for refuge after my crime  he said that he had examined and inquired for me all along the road and had concealed his business in that village for several days lying in wait for my arrival  horror and amazement seized both my unhappy mother and me  i pitied her more than myself  i was hardened to sufferings i wished to die though not with ignominy and felt disappointed at finding the purpose of these housebreakers had ended with so little violence to my life  i apprehended no danger from the prosecution but to think of an arraignment and a public trial was distraction i reflected deeply on the divine and sustaining sentiments of the amiable mrs n  and her precepts and example had a salutary effect on my mind  the steward then returned to the inn to send off to chester for a chaise to carry me to exeter the county town of devonshire to take my trial at the next assizes which were immediately to be held there but left his two guards in the house to prevent my escape  my afflicted mother who had fallen upon the bed when she heard the shocking sentence pronounced lay silent for a minute then turning to me who was standing speechless and motionless before her with a look of wildness and despair cried out i will go with you i will die with you we never shall be parted more i threw myself down by her we embraced and lay folded in each others arms till we were summoned the next morning to begin our journey  we traveled with all the expedition that our conductors were pleased to make and suffered every indignity and insolence of office all the way that mean persons are apt to inflict on those above them whenever they happen to gain an authority over them  all this i felt not but as i sympathized with my unhappy mother for as to myself i welcomed every mortification and distress i met with and even wished them still more severe  we were at length relieved from this oppression by arriving at exeter where we were carried directly to the sheriffs house and delivered over into his custody for my dear mother would not quit me but said that the same prison or the same grave should receive us both  this humane person behaved with the utmost tenderness and politeness toward us offered us every refreshment and accommodation that his hospitality could afford and told me that he would impose no other restraint on me than an earnest request that i would accept of the best apartment in his house and prevail on my mother to share the same comforts and conveniences with me  he then bowed and retired  he returned soon after to introduce a gentleman to us who he said had some affair of business to communicate to me and then withdrew again but how was i overwhelmed with confusion when the person announced his name to be captain r  the confidant of my shame stood before me  my trial was began already  i felt as if i was at the bar  this gentleman behaved with great goodbreeding and compassion to me on that occasion he scarcely looked at me but going up directly to my mother whom he saw in tears assured her that she need not suffer the least uneasiness on account of her daughter as he had already made her innocence appear so fully to the justice that she was not to be arraigned on the trial and might now consider herself perfectly free from her arrest  he prevented us he would not listen to our acknowledgments but directing his discourse to me though without turning his eyes toward me thus proceeded  in order to make you acquainted with the present situation of this unhappy business it is necessary for me madam to recount the regular process of it from the moment i had been informed of the event by an anonymous billet to this time i soon guessed the writer and as quickly suspected the author of the tragedy  upon these hints i immediately applied to a magistrate in the neighborhood and after having given in my depositions according to the notice i had received i became armed with proper force and authority and rode directly to castle w   i was not denied admission and upon opening my commission mr w  charged you madam directly with the fact said you had absconded immediately after the murder and that he had just then issued a warrant and dispatched a pursuit after you in order to have you apprehended and delivered over into the hands of justice  then by way of supporting his assertion by circumstances led me up stairs into the room where the corpse lay extended on the ground showed me the discharged pistol lying on the bed and pointed to the blood with which the coverlet had been stained in many places  i wept over the body of my dear friend said he then turning to mr w  showed him the note i had received and asked him if he knew the hand yes he replied quick it is my wifes and one line in it i think sufficiently certifies against her  i do not mean by this notice to call even for justice against his assassin whose danger i pray you do you imagine she should be so tender of would she not have named the assassin if that might have been done with safety to herself  sir i replied you will now give me leave to reason upon the circumstances relative to this melancholy affair in turn it cannot be difficult considering the several parties both separately and connected to suppose the motive of sir thomass errand hither and whether it were most natural for the fond mistress or the jealous husband to have been the murderer is a question sitter to be argued in a court than discussed here for which reason concluded i i shall pretend to act but ministerially upon this occasion and therefore i do now in the name of justice arrest you and your whole household in order to take your trials jointly and severally for this murder  mr w  seemed startled at this discourse but talked highly and began to put himself into a posture of defense upon which i presented a pistol to his breast and pointing to the mangled corpse cried there sir is your example should you attempt to resist he then surrendered himself a prisoner the rest of his family did the same and after i had got the body laid with decency on the bed left the servants of the deceased to attend it and given charge of the funeral to the clergyman of the parish i escorted my captives to the goal in this city where they have remained ever since  upon their examination before a magistrate in this town continued he the maid servant who said she had attended on you madam turned evidence to save her life and charged her master with the murder she said that he had come to the house in the evening privately and desired her to conceal his arrival from her mistress that he told her there was an assignation fixed for that night between sir thomas l  and his wife and about the time that he thought they might have put out the candles he took her with him to the room to be a witness of what he said would entitle him to a divorce but that being disappointed in that circumstance and alarmed at seeing sir thomas putting his hand to his sword he discharged the pistol and killed him on the spot  mr w  did not make any manner of interruption or reply to this womans deposition while it was going on saying only after it was over that he thought himself sufficiently justified in the action both from law and conscience and that justice without favor was all he should desire to indemnify him on the day of trial  thus situated is this unhappy affair at present and with regard to your arrest madam i have had that superseded already before you arrived in town as the warrant was only founded on surmise and i have myself given bail for your appearance on the trial just to corroborate the servant maids testimony  i had hitherto lain reclined on my arm hiding my face tears and blushes with my hand but when he came to the last expression i forgot all reserve and starting up no sir said i it cannot shall not be  i will never appear in evidence against mr w  you may drag me before the court but no violence shall make me speak there justice i acknowledge to be a duty but there are situations which may exempt one from the observance of it duties cannot contradict duties and i have already too far erred against mine to him to think of adding a further injury  and if my death is to be the consequence of my silence i am willing to pay that forfeit to redeem his  captain r  seemed struck with my sentiments on so difficult an occasion and told me that he would consult his lawyers that night whether my evidence might be dispensed with and would wait on me again the next morning  he then took his leave and left my poor mother and me to pass an anxious sleepless night in mourning the distress of our present situation  the next day he came to us and said that his counsel had told him that as he was the prosecutor he might excuse whatever witness he pleased especially as the servant maids testimony was full enough to the point already  we thanked him extremely for his humanity and politeness and the instant he retired we hired a chaise and drove out of the town on our road back to flintshire flying as fast as possible from a scene of so much horror  the anxiety of mind and fatigue of body which my dear mother had labored under all this while had brought on a fever that confined her in bed from the moment we reached her habitation in flintshire i wept prayed and attended on her during her illness till her last moment  she blessed her children  even me she blessed and prayed for peace and pardon to my polluted soul she expired in my fainting arms  leaveing me friendless in a world alone  but fate had not yet done with me i was not yet unhappy enough about two days after her death i received a letter from captain r  who had found out the place of my residence from mr w  s steward which brought me the following account from exeter  the facts and arguments upon which mr w  grounded his defense were these  when mrs w  had given her letter for sir thomas to the messenger he mentioned it to the gardener and he communicated his intelligence to her maid who had been appointed a spy over all her actions  she took it from the man enclosed it to her master and sent him off directly with it to london  as soon as he received it he broke it open and took a copy which he made his own man compare and witness then sealed and sent off the original to sir thomas by a special messenger who pretended he had come from castle w  not caring to entrust the fellow who had brought it lest he should have betrayed him as he had before deceived mrs w  the answer he proceeded with in the same manner and then dispatched the first carrier with it to mrs w   this state of the case mr w  had sent up to london along with the attested copies of the letters for the opinion of an eminent counsel to know whether upon such a certainty of the fact and finding the adulterer in such an improper situation with his wife the laws did not grant some indulgence to the transports and resentment of a provoked and injured husband  the lawyers reply was that such considerations had indeed been sometimes permitted to be laid before a jury in alleviation of the crime he had been guilty of but that it was only in cases where no premeditation had appeared in the matter and that his was a very different situation as he had confessed his having been apprised of the assignation assisted in forwarding the appointment and had traveled above an hundred miles with a malice praepense to take sir thomas l  at an unfair advantage from all which circumstances he concluded that the laws would not consider him as a provoked husband but a deliberate assassin  this answer deprived him of all hope and drove him to distraction  could the articles mentioned in the state of his case have been prevented from coming before the court he might perhaps have had some chance of escaping but the messenger of the two letters was among the persons that had been taken up for the murder had made a deposition in his own defense and was to be produced on the trial this particular confirmed his despair and in a transport of madness the unhappy man put an end to his life in the prison the day before the assizes began  prepared though i was to expect an account of mr w  s death the manner of it however filled my soul with horror and had a more immediate effect upon my constitution than any of the shocks i had received before from that sad hour when no kind prop remained to stay my overburdened heart i have sunk beneath its weight my wasting form and slackened nerves give hopes of my release and with this heavy task which now draws near an end i trust my woes shall cease  the first thing that occurred to my mind upon this tragical event was the benefit that my humane and hospitable friend of the cottage and her lovely child might possibly receive from it and i had the satisfaction before i left the kingdom to hear that mrs n  had sufficiently proved her mothers marriage by the certificate and witness and taken possession of castle w  as sole heiress to her fathers estate and fortune which were very considerable  i did not make myself known to her as under our different circumstances no manner of connection could ever properly have subsisted between us but as i was entitled to a jointure of four hundred pounds a year by marriage settlement i put the deed which had been left in my mothers possession into the hands of an attorney at chester to claim my rights which were not denied and on receipt of the first payment i quitted england for ever and came over here to france with a purpose of retiring immediately into a convent for life  i began my narrative of woe before i left england and have completed it since i came over and shall put it into the india house for you at paris if i may have life enough to carry me thither as i design to fix my residence in some of the distant provinces beyond it but i have been confined here these two days not being able to proceed further from the failure of my strength and the dejection of my spirits  adieu my dearest brother may watchful angels hover round you and guard and guide your footsteps in the paths of virtue i feel myself growing weaker every line i write and think that here my journey and my cares will shortly end together with my last sigh i pray to be forgiven by heaven and you and now once more adieu i hope for ever  maria  letter lxvii lady barton to miss cleveland in answer to letter lxii  yes fanny your remark is just  the tears which flow for foreign griefs help somewhat to soften the poignancy of home felt sorrows i sympathized throughout every circumstance of the illfated marias distress and was rejoiced at her lucky escape from the desperate guilt of suicide  it is intolerance not intolerability impatience not suffering that ever impels to such an act for it requires no further argument than this that god is just to evince that our strength of mind and body must be equally balanced by nature so that the one may be sufficiently able to bear whatever can be inflicted on the other until death without precipitation necessarily comes to the relief of the overburdened sufferer for pain or grief are able to do their own business without the assistance of a crime  from whence i argue that resolution may last as long as life and that a virtuous soul may be sooner separated than subdued  i have endeavored to express myself upon this subject with all the energy i could  i feel an interest in this reasoning at present and shall repose my trust in it  maria was certainly more wretched than i am by the addition of one circumstance which alone was sufficient to have rendered her so but surely we may hope without offense to the most rigid virtue that penitence and sufferings such as hers may have atoned for her transgression and that she now is happy  it is to be innocent to be unhappy  whilst i must still subscribe myself your unhappy but affectionate sister  l barton  letter lxviii lady hume to lady barton in answer to letter lxi  clevelandhall your fanny my louisa has obeyed your kind command and now claims the sad indulgence promised in your last  i long yet dread to know what those events can be which you deem more interesting than any of those extraordinary circumstances which have already happened to you  i cannot express the mixed sensation which my heart is at present sensible of while i give it up to that joy which happiness like mine should inspire i fancy i defraud you of that portion of sorrow which is due to your distress and while i tenderly reflect upon your sufferings and busy my imagination in trying to discover those additional woes you hint at the big drop which steals down my cheek silently reproaches me with ingratitude to my dear brother to his amiable wife to my reclaimed prodigal to providence and when as it sometimes happens my melancholy becomes contagious and that i see a gloomy look of inquiry spread over those countenances which should be lighted up with smiles i strive forgive me my louisa to forget your sorrows and dispel the cloud i have created by affected efforts of cheerfulness  but i will no longer like miss how in clarissa content myself with poorly lamenting the unhappiness of my friend  i can have no doubt of lord humes indulgence i will request his permission to see and embrace my sister  her sighs and tears shall flow upon my bosom and i will try to pour the balm of comfort into here is  you did not date your last letter so so that i cannot even guess where you are at present but i shall direct this to southfield and impatiently wait for the explanation of that gloomy mystery in which you seem involved  all here salute you with the tenderest affection for as i now consider myself accountable to lord hume for every moment of my time i proclaimed my intention of writing to you before i retired from the drawing room and shall try to return to it with as cheerful a countenance as i can possibly assume but be assured that my heart will never be truly at ease till i know that yours is so  as i shall never cease to be your faithfully affectionate  friend and sister f hume  letter lxix lady barton to lady hume the knowing that my fanny is happy is certainly a reason for my being less wretched than when i wrote last but then the cruel thought of interrupting her felicity must add to my distress  and can it bear addition o yes yes the torturing suspense which i now feel too surely informs me that there yet remains many arrows in the quiver of adversity which may still be pointed at my sad heart and yet not pierce it through  o fanny it is very difficult to die at least i find it so  death sports with human misery and would rather increase than end them  it is his delight to bid the wretch survive the fortunate the feeble wrap the athletic in his shroud and weeping parents build their childrens tombs  excuse this rhapsody  i will try to collect myself and acquaint you with the particulars of my present distress  the morning after i had written to you from elmgrove i ordered my carriage as i had intended and at breakfast acquainted lady creswell with my design of setting out for southfield  every argument that friendship or politeness could urge were used to prevail on me to stay with them for a few days longer but i continued firm to my purpose  i told harriet that she might remain with lady creswell till she came to return my visit which both she and sir harry promised should be in ten days or a fortnight  harriet declined my indulgence and entreated me with uncommon earnestness to take her with me  i considered her refusal as the effect of her attention and complaisance to me till with a very solemn air she said to me when we were alone if you madam think it necessary to quit elmgrove i am sure i ought to do so too i acquiesced in her opinion and desired her to get ready immediately  lord lucan to my great satisfaction did not appear at breakfast  when he was inquired for the servants said he had rode out very early in the morning i took my friend lady creswell aside and requested her not without some confusion to deliver my letter to his lordship as soon as he returned from riding almost at that instant a servant of sir williams galloped into the courtyard and presented the following billet to me  to lady barton the infamy of your late conduct has for some time made me balance whether i should by the bearer command your immediate return to my house or forbid your ever entering it my respect for your family has so far turned the scale in your favor as to make me though unwillingly condescend to receive you under my roof till they shall be acquainted with your vileness and either find you out a proper asylum or join in abandoning you with your highly injured husband  w barton   i have already told you that lady creswell was with me when i received this shocking sentence  amazement suspended all my powers while i read it my sight forsook me the paper dropped out of my hand and i fell almost senseless upon a couch when i recovered my speech i bid her read it and tell me what it meant  she quickly saw through the detested villainy and at once exclaimed your husband is abused that wicked colonel walter has deceived him  my aunt unhappy and infatuated woman corresponds with him and has doubtless transmitted an account of lord lucans being here  her surmise was equal to conviction and i that moment beheld myself the victim of that wretchs disappointed passion  o could my heart have told me i was an innocent one how slightly should i have regarded the utmost malice of this fiend  i need not attempt to describe the distraction of my mind during the journey harriet was so visibly affected with my grief though unknowing of the cause that i would if possible have concealed it from her and even accused myself for making her heart so early acquainted with sorrow  when we arrived at southfield benson with tears in her eyes informed me that sir william was dangerously ill the vein in his lungs which had been closed for some time had opened and the physician who attended him had but very faint hopes of his life  the agony which this account threw me into i shall leave to your own sensibility to imagine  i fell upon my knees and in an heart felt ecstasy cried out gracious god have pity on me spare my husbands life and let not his murderer triumph over him and me at once  harriet and benson raised me from the ground with a mingled expression of pity and horror in their looks  they thought me mad  i was alas too sensible at least to misery  when i became a little more calm harriet asked me if i would not go to see sir william i started up at the question and would have flown that moment to his bedside had not benson interposed by telling me he was just fallen into a slumber and that the doctor had given orders he should not be disturbed  the idea that his mind was at rest afforded a little ease to my own the tears ran silent and plenteous down my cheeks while my heart offered up the most fervent petitions to the fountain of life for his recovery  by degrees i became composed and at harriets entreaty i tried to eat and retired to rest  in the morning doctor hartford who attends sir william desired to see me  he told me that the sudden and violent return of his patients disorder had proceeded from some perturbation of mind and that the only chance he had for his life was the being kept in a state of apathy as much as possible and advised my not seeing him for some days yet as even the most pleasing emotion might be productive of fatal consequences  i told him i would not attempt any thing that should injure his health though i most earnestly wished to see him  he said he had taken the liberty of preventing two letters from being delivered to him for the reasons he had then given me  he presented them to me i saw that one of them was the letter i had sent by the servant the other was from colonel walter  surely if a breach of trust could ever be deemed pardonable the peculiarity of my situation might have furnished an excuse for reading this letter but my heart revolted at the mean idea  i gave both of them to harriet and bid her keep them till her uncle should be able to read them himself  about an hour after this sir william sent for harriet the moment he saw her he cried out where is she  in her chamber sir weeping your illness and praying for your recovery  for my death you mean  indeed you wrong her sir i never saw any person so truly concerned for another  where is lord lucan why do you blush at that question what then art thou become the confident the vile accomplice of your aunts infamy  believe me sir i never heard or saw a word or action of here is that should be called so  she is the best of women  if that be true the whole sex are past redemption  but where is lord lucan  we left him at elmgrove  my dear dear uncle let me entreat you to compose yourself indeed you wrong my aunt most cruelly  she fell on her knees at his bedside and kissed his hand  o harriet i am but too well convinced that your expression refers more justly to her  it is she has wronged herself and me too  but perhaps i have deserved to lose her affection though mine was true to her  yet for her own sake for the honor of her family i did not think she would have been abandoned  but d  n d  n her he wept while he pronounced these horrid words  harriet described the strong emotion she had seen me feel on hearing of his illness he wept again yet called me an hyena and then cried out why does she not appear before me o she is conscious of her crime and dare not look upon me harriet then acquainted him of the restraint his physician had imposed on me it is very true he replied the sight of her would kill me but let her write if she has any thing to say in her defense  she then gave him my letter  he seemed much agitated while he read it then said he was too weak to bear these painful conflicts and bad her tell me he would receive me as soon as he was able but only to confront me with such proofs as were indubitable and never from that moment see me more  alas my sister what will now become of me grant it were possible i could be able to undeceive sir william and remove even the shadow of suspicion from his thoughts must i not always live in fear a fear which my own consciousness will still create that mutual band of conjugal felicity a perfect confidence is now for ever broken  the gloomy reflections that dwell within my bosom will still appear and raise up fresh disquiets and alarms within my husbands breast though he conceals his doubts my heart will feel them and secretly repine that even the sacrifice of my unhappy passion has not been able to procure his peace yet this is the sole prospect this the compounding hope of such a wretch as i  harriet has seen her uncle every day and in consequence of their conversations i have written to him twice  he seems much affected while he reads my letters and yet returns again to his unjust suspicions  colonel walters letter has been delivered to him he inquired whether i knew who it came from and upon harriets telling him i did he replied that has more weight with me than all that she has protested under her hand  there is yet at least some virtue in her  indeed my sister were i not convinced it is my duty to calm sir williams mind i could with the utmost composure submit to and sink under the cruel calumny thrown out against me  the world and all that it contains seems to recede from my now feeble grasp  the dejection of my spirits has diffused an universal languor through my whole frame and some blessed intelligence whispers me that soon very soon this poor torn heart will be at peace surely my fanny you will you ought i mean rejoice at my deliverance  i am glad of your happiness of my brothers and of every ones i could at this moment rejoice in a certainty of my being the only wretched creature upon earth  i wish i could prevent your sending a thought or a sigh this way your sorrow for my misery can but increase it  strive to forget it then perhaps i may yet do so too  but never shall i cease to remember that i am  your truly affectionate sister l barton  letter lxx lord hume to lord lucan would you believe it lucan i am become a philosopher and that by the worst of all possible means experience  i find there is no such thing as permanent happiness for in the very moment that i looked down with pity upon kings my cup has been dashed with a good smart dose of coloquintida  for some time before my marriage both sir george cleveland and i observed that my dear fanny was frequently dejected and melancholy but whenever we seemed to take notice of this indisposition of mind she attributed it to the change of climate and immediately assumed an air of cheerfulness  for my own part i sometimes thought that her uneasiness might proceed from a recollection of my former conduct and therefore endeavored to dissipate her suspicions by every mark of the sincerest attachment  i flattered myself i had succeeded as she had given me her hand without the least affectation of reluctance which young ladies sometimes assume the appearance of in order to enhance the value of the gift  i think there never was a blither bridegroom than myself  indeed i felt myself most truly happy  yet my fannys fits of melancholy frequently returned and i have sometimes surprised her in tears i used to kiss them off and begged to know the cause she constantly evaded my request but with so much tenderness and delicacy that i could not insist on her compliance or even let her see that i was unhappy myself lest it should render her more so  in this kind of mortal state we passed several weeks but a letter that was delivered to her lately has unravelled the mystery  we were alone in her dressing room when it was brought to her  while she read it her countenance changed so visibly that i could not avoid taken notice of it to her she burst into tears and exclaimed my unhappy sister what is she dead i asked  not yet she answered and sunk back as if near fainting in her chair  by heaven lucan i would not go through such another moment for the diamond eyes of the indian idol  i forget his name  that are computed to be worth a million and a half  as soon as she had recovered she entreated me not to mention what had happened to sir george or his lady then told me that lady barton was the most miserable being upon earth from the villainy of a vile fellow who lives in their neighborhood and was himself in love with her who by a false accusation of her to her husband has rendered him so outrageously jealous as almost to endanger sir williams life that from her sisters letters she had reason to believe that she also was dying and implored me to set out for ireland with her immediately in order to rescue lady barton if possible by removing her from that scene of misery and distress  i readily acquiesced in her desire discovering still new charms in her tender and generous affection for her unhappy sister which has been the sole source of her melancholy  she gave me many prudent reasons for not acquainting her brother with this affair so that our scheme was mentioned at dinner as a sudden thought and every thing was fixed for our setting out in two days  but pity me lucan when i tell you that my whole of life my hearts dear fanny was taken ill that night the next day grew much worse and on the third the physicians pronounced her disorder to be a miliary fever she is now thank heaven out of danger but weak low and in her bed i did not know how truly how fondly i loved her lucan till now  i am not ashamed of the blot a tear has just made  her impatience to set out for your country is unabated but i fear it will be some time before her strength will be equal to the journey she has commanded me to write a few lines in gayete de coeur to lady barton as if jealous of the correspondence between them and saying that i will only allow her to answer her letters in person  this is meant to excuse her silence without alarming her about her illness  how tender how considerate  i hope to see you soon in dublin and that we shall return to england together if lady barton should come with us we shall be a good melange enough for a part quarre  i am resolved to be gay my wife will i hope be cheerful when she has rescued her sister from the greeneyed monster  you will be polite and agreeable at least and i think lady barton will have no great cause to be sorrowful at leaving a husband with whom she has never been happy as fanny has now confessed to me on this occasion  in my next i hope i shall be able to fix the day of our setting out  till we meet adieu my dear lucan  yours hume  letter lxxi lady barton to lady hume it is over my dear sister my trial and condemnation are past and i now sink under the weight of his censure from which i neither ought nor desire to appeal  yesterday sir william desired to see me i instantly obeyed his summons and approached him pale and trembling  but my wanness was the effect of ill health and my tremor arose from weakness  yet he perhaps might have attributed these symptoms to guilt or fear for a person arraigned is generally half condemned  i dreaded his flying into a rage at seeing me but to do him justice he was unusually calm  as i entered the chamber he said i am sorry madam that we should meet thus  i told him i was sincerely grieved for having been the innocent cause of so much uneasiness to him  he repeated the word innocent and then launched out into the most cruel and i am happy to say false accusation that ever was uttered  wretched wretched man my heart this moment feels for what his must one day suffer he was violently agitated while he proceeded in his accusation and i sometimes thought that he appeared to doubt the improbabilities he uttered till he produced lord lucans picture which seemed like a visible miracle to corroborate the whole legend  i offered not the least interruption while he spoke but when he had ended i threw myself upon my knees before him and in the most solemn manner assured him that i had never been guilty of an act of dishonor though i confessed that my affections had not been inviolably restrained to him perhaps from the harshness of his manners perhaps from my own weakness  he was variously affected whilst i spoke and often broke out into extravagant exclamations denying the truth of what i said by recurring to the charge against me  at other times he appeared softened for an instant but then the picture like othellos handkerchief still turned his heart to stone  why was i not at liberty to unravel that mystery but my word was long since passed to keep it secret and never shall that bond be forfeited nor shall my innocence ever be justified by dishonor besides this was but a circumstance and that equivocal at most  he then said that as my family all but myself were truly respectable he would for their sakes take some time to consider how he should act before he branded me with infamy and that i might remain a prisoner in his house till he had determined on my sentence  but from that moment interdicted me from quitting my apartment and what was still much more severe from seeing or conversing with my sole comfort the tender the affectionate the amiable harriet  i wept but it was in silence and yielded to this hard decree without a murmur  he might have been more cruel to me  benson is still permitted to attend me nor has he yet forbidden me the melancholy pleasure of writing to my sister i thank him most sincerely for these two indulgencies and most devoutly hope i shall not want them long  while i live i shall never cease to lament my being the fatal and sole source of sorrow to my beloved sister  o dry your tears my fanny and turn your eyes to happier views  see an adoring husband and a tender brother court you to happiness  forget the wretch that mars your present bliss and renders you ungrateful for heavens bounty  my heart sinks in me  my friend my little harriet is just sent away i hear the wheels that carry her from hence  they roll upon my heart protecting angels guard her innocence and soothe the sorrows of her tender mind i know it benson she was drowned in tears  i feel them stream this moment on my breast  alas my fanny my head turns round i cannot write another line  adieu adieu l barton  letter lxxii lady barton to lady hume did you not think i was completely wretched when i last wrote to you i thought so then but find my error now  there is no bounds to miseries like mine the swelling waves rise upon one another and overwhelm me  why does this feeble bark struggle so long why not sink down at once to dark oblivion but i will silence this repining heart nor murmur at my sufferings  about eight oclock this morning there arrived a messenger from waltersburgh and in a few minutes after sir william rushed into my room with an appearance of frenzy in his air and countenance  vilest of women cried he out you have now completed your wickedness  but think not that either you or your accomplice shall escape  that pity which pleaded in my weak heart even for an adultress will but increase my rage against the murderess of my friend he then quitted me abruptly as if bent upon some horrid purpose  yes fanny i have heard my name traduced by the two vilest terms that ever disgraced human nature and yet i neither sighed nor shed a tear  i became petrified with horror and fixed my eyes in stupid silence on the door at which sir william issued till benson opened it some minutes after and found me quite immovable  i blame him not for his intemperate wrath he thinks he has just cause  there has been a duel  lord lucan is in fault  he was the challenger  he has destroyed my fame and peace of mind for ever it is but just it should be so that he who caused my weakness should punish it  i hear that he is dangerously wounded and colonel walter mortally  o could i hope my prayers might reach the throne of mercy but am i not as sir william styles me a murderess too surely so i am the fatal cause of all these crimes  forgive me gracious heaven no words can paint my agonies death only can relieve them  a note from sir william it has broke my heart  i fear i cannot see to copy it  waltersburg madam i know not how to plead the pardon either of myself or the unhappy colonel walter but if the strongest remorse for the injuries he has done you added to the loss of life which is now ebbing fast from his wound may be thought an atonement you will comply with his request and grant him your forgiveness  as to myself i can only say that i have been most cruelly deceived and nothing but colonel walters present situation confession and contrition could ever have induced me to forgive his having been the cause of so much unhappiness to you  i forgive him mine because he has repaired it  my own offense my own failings have rendered me charitable to his  but if heaven shall spare my life it shall be spent in penitence for the wrongs i have done you  colonel walter entreats you will let him know where his wife and child now are judge my surprise at hearing him acknowledge such connections but there is now no time for reflections as doctor hartford and the surgeon both say he has not long to live death will be ease from the agonies he now endures in his tortured mind and i trust in heavens mercy that they will ensure his future peace  be speedy my much injured louisa in affording some relief to the most unhappy wretch i ever yet beheld and in his pardon include that of your abused and much afflicted husband  w barton ps lord lucans wound is not dangerous  i will write for harriet to return immediately to southfield     i wrote upon the instant but even at this short interval cannot recollect what i said  my sensations were too much diversified too rapid to leave strong traces on the memory  what did i not feel horror pity grief and even a gleam of joy joy that my name shall not disgrace my family nor make it hateful when i shall be but dust  sir williams kindness in restoring harriet to me is the most pleasing proof that he could give of his returning confidence  i know that it will make her happy and therefore do i doubly thank him  all other marks of his regard must come too late  we cannot live together  yet i feel that death alone will part us  his approaches have long been welcomed by me i have thought his harbingers were slow and chid their tardy though sure progress  yet would i now delay their lingering steps till i could sold my sister to my heart then bid it cease to beat  this is a cruel but a natural wish  i will not press for the indulgence of it  i am most truly thankful that lord lucans life is safe but cannot form the least conjecture why he should hazard it as he has done  it is impossible that he should know the injuries i have sustained from colonel walter  to you alone have i revealed my sufferings even harriet was a stranger to the cause of my distress till sir williams violence informed her of his suspicions and sure i am she would not publish my disgrace this is a point that i could wish was cleared  yet of what moment is it to me now  i have just received a letter from lord hume  excuse my silence to him and assure him of my affectionate regards  my truest tenderest love awaits my brother  and i charge you fanny never to let him know what i have suffered  it would wound his peace when i shall be at rest  another note from sir william containing unbounded thanks for what he calls my condescending goodness  can there be any merit in the forgiveness of one frail and erring being to another i will try if i can rest  goodnight my dearest sister  l barton  letter lxxiii lady barton to lady hume sir william returned about ten oclock this morning from waltersburgh and i was not up  i used to be an early riser fanny  but may now say with anna in douglas   thy votaries grief great natures orders break  and change the midnight to the moontide hour   it was near eleven before i rang my bell and though sir william expressed the greatest impatience to see me he would not suffer benson to disturb me  why do these petits soins appear too late for him or me to profit from as soon as she informed me that he was in the house i rose and dressed me with the utmost expedition then sent to let him know that i was ready to receive his commands  i found my mind infinitely more agitated than when he had summoned me to appear before him yet i did not tremble as i then had done but my heart beat quicker  he approached me with a look of tender anxiety which i had never seen him wear i arose as he entered he caught my hand and dropped upon one knee lady barton said he it is impossible for words to express my feelings could you be sensible of what they are you would both pardon and pity me i made the strongest effort in my power to raise him from the ground but both my strength and speech forsook me and i sunk motionless within his arms  when i recovered i found myself reclining upon bensons bosom and sir william walking about the room like a distracted person exclaiming she is lost is gone for ever and i have killed her i am the murderer now  the moment i could speak i said every thing in my power to calm his mind but he continued to accuse himself much more severely than he could deserve and when he looked upon my altered face tears streamed from his sad eyes  indeed i am much changed from what i was  i think you scarce could know me  colonel walter is no more  though i have no faith in the efficacy of prayers for the dead yet i cannot refrain from offering up mine  for religion prompted by misfortunes is apt to exceed to superstition but enough or rather say too much of this sad subject  harriet is returned  she started at seeing me  it is amazing what a visible alteration a few days has made in my appearance i do not myself perceive any great internal change an increasing weakness is all that i am sensible of  death seems to be grateful for the ardent wishes i have so often made for him and approaches me with the gentleness of a friend  the variety of terrors i have gone through have disarmed him of his and though they at present seem to be passed pardon me my sister i cannot help considering my dissolution as a deliverance  as soon as harriet arrived sir william brought her by the hand and presenting her to me said i am happy my dear niece to restore you again to the protection of the best and most injured woman breathing  my future conduct to her joined to your care and assiduity will i hope restore her health and make us all happy once more  i bowed assent to sir williams impossible wish and embraced my beloved harriet with all the fondness of a mother  i shall be a loss to her fanny my heart melts at the idea of her distress  i am not able to hold the pen longer at present i will reassume it tomorrow  i hope that contrary winds are the sole cause of my not hearing from you  the agitation of my mind for some time past has prevented my thinking too deeply on your silence  i flatter myself that the next postday will prevent my future anxiety  adieu l barton  letter lxxiv lady barton to lady hume my illness or rather languor increases so fast upon me that it is with much difficulty i can support myself in my chair for an hour together yet they talk of carrying me to lisbon  how absurd as if a long journey could cure a broken heart  mine is the gentlest of decays the marks of my approaching dissolution are almost as visible in the faces that surround me as in my own  sir william is the very statue of grief no pen or pencil can describe the tender expression of concern and solicitude that appears in harriets face  benson is become a spectre and doctor hartford though long used to look on the approaches of death seems startled and affected by them now  the unhappy affair of the duel has not yet been explained but i have neither curiosity or concern about that or any thing else now left  even my unhappy passion have i long since sacrificed to my duty  be witness for me heaven that from the moment of sir williams danger the fond delirium vanished from my heart and left not even one tainted trace behind  you have known all the conflicts of my soul and were there ought that could disturb it now to you i would confess the painful perturbation as to heaven  but all is calm my sister   still as the sea ere winds were taught to blow  or moving spirit bad the waters flow  soft as the slumbers of a saint forgiven  and mild as opening gleams of promised heaven may the last lines be prophetic amen adieu i will not yet say a last one to my beloved sister  l barton ps you are at liberty to acquaint my brother with my situation  no stain will now reflect on him from me my memory will still be dear to those i love to him to you my sister  this thought will smooth my passage to the grave and i shall rest in peace    letter lxxv lord lucan to lord hume dear hume your last letter has brought about a fatal event i shall make no merit of letting you into a secret which is now at an end for ever lady barton was the charming woman to whom my heart had dedicated my life her beauty purity and frankness sure never yet were equalled my attentions and regards i fear were too much marked toward her for it seems they were taken notice of by a gentleman colonel walter who likewise visited at her house  this happened unfortunately to excite some jealousy in his breast though how was it possible for such a being as her to inspire a love without honor he gave hints of his suspicion though they then appeared to be of no consequence but upon reading your letter my mind quickly referred to the persons in question though you neither mentioned his name or mine  i was shocked at the falsehood and villainy of the story  had lady barton been an object of the utmost indifference to me honor and humanity must have excited me to exculpate both her and myself from so vile a slander  but adoring her as i do mere justice was too lukewarm a principle of action  i added resentment to it  i set out immediately for his house and charged him with his perfidy  he denied it at first but when i had produced my voucher he attempted to excuse himself by saying that as the lady had herself acknowledged a passion for me to him it required no great reach of philosophy to deduce the natural conclusion he had drawn from such premises  i shall then render myself worthy of such a confession said i by chastising your breach of honor in repeating it  i had come prepared and told him so desiring him to follow me to the end of a grove near the place which he soon did  we were both wounded but he mortally i took care of him home  he seemed sensible and sorry for his crime and said he would repair it  he is since dead  lady barton is now languishing in the last stage of a consumption  and i am the most wretched being upon earth  i would fly out of the kingdom this moment but that i must stay to take my trial here  alas of what use would flight be to me  can i leave the remembrance of my sorrows behind let me see you as soon as you arrive and beieve me  your unhappy friend lucan  letter lxxvi lady hume to lady barton chester in what terms shall i express the feelings of my heart for my more than amiable my unhappy sister her sufferings have brought me near the brink of the grave and now that they are past why does she cruelly refuse her own assent to life and happiness live my louisa and do not doom me for ever to lament that i was blessed with such a friend  i am scarce recovered from a dangerous fever and yet have got so far on my way to assist your recovery unmindful of my own  let not my fond attention be thrown away i conjure you but in pity to sir william to the gentle harriet and to me at least exert a wish to live  i ask no more the rest may be expected from your youth and the unceasing assiduity of such tender friends  i have not strength to undertake a journey through wales besides it must delay our meeting  i shall sail this night from pargate  my dear lord trembles for what i may suffer from sea sickness  i can feel no ills but yours  the moment we land i shall set out for southfield i hope i shall be there before this letter  i am incapable of writing my fears distract me yet i will strive to hope  i acquainted my brother with every particular of your story the moment i had received your permission which was the very hour before we parted  he wept and would have accompanied me if his delia had been in a condition for traveling  the tenderest of husbands joins me in the most fervent prayers and wishes for your recovery  o live to be a witness of the happiness i experience from his kindness and that happiness will be then complete  adieu my dearest sister  f hume  letter lxxvii lady hume to sir george cleveland southfield yes my dear brother i have seen her but fear i shall not long enjoy that blessing  death lies in ambush on her lovely cheek and lurks beneath the dimples of her smiles  my lord said she never looked so beautiful as now  i think so too why must those beauties perish in the grave she was transported at seeing me joy overpowered her feeble frame she became quite exhausted and was obliged to retire to her chamber very early  the next morning she sent for sir william and me into her dressing room she appeared more animated than i had ever seen her when she addressed him thus  heaven has indulged my utmost wish in granting me the happiness of seeing my beloved sister but i should be unworthy of this blessing if i did not endeavor that you also should be a gainer by it  here sir william pointing to me here is the witness of my weakness and my virtue every movement of my heart has been laid open to her view and to her i dare appeal to justify its purity while with myself she must condemn its frailty  if there yet needs a farther proof to satisfy you i will entreat my fanny to submit the letters which have passed between us to your perusal  there you will see the conflicts of a weak not wicked mind and for the single trespass of my heart though an involuntary one i now upon my knees implore your pardon  sir william caught her in his arms before she could kneel and bathed her face with his fast flowing tears  his voice was inarticulate and he could scarce pronounce it is i that ought to kneel and sue for pardon my angel my louisa o spare yourself and me these strong emotions i only i have been to blame and could i now restore your life and happiness by parting with my own i should not think my punishment severe  but o to lose you thus is misery extreme  how severely do i now reproach myself for not sooner acquainting you with the unhappy situation of our dear sister perhaps you might have rendered it more easy and saved her precious life but it was at her request that i concealed it till colonel walters dying confession had cleared her innocence  i cannot write more my heart is breaking soon too soon shall i i fear subscribe myself your only and  affectionate sister f hume  letter lxxviii lady hume to sir george cleveland southfield she is gone for ever i shall no more behold her her gentle spirit took its flight to heaven while these fond arms in vain endeavored to support the feeble frame from whence it parted  she sunk upon my bosom and expired nor sigh nor groan gave warning of her death she closed her eyes and slept for ever  no words can paint the grief and distraction of her unhappy husband the tender sorrow of the gentle harriet or the heartfelt anguish of your  afflicted sister f hume  the end
