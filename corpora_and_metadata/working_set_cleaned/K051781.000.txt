three oclock soh a notable hour for one of my regular disposition to be strolling like a bravo through the streets of seville well of all services to serve a young lover is the hardest  not that i am an enemy to love but my love and my masters differ strangely  don ferdinand is much too gallant to eat drink or sleep  now my love gives me an appetite  then i am fond of dreaming of my mistress and i love dearly to toast her  this cannot be done without good sleep and good liquor hence my partiality to a feather bed and a bottle  what a pity now that i have not further time for reflections but my master expects thee honest lopez to secure his retreat from donna claras window as i guess music without hey sure i heard music so so who have we here oh don antonio my masters friend come from the masquerade to serenade my young mistress donna louisa i suppose soh we shall have the old gentleman up presently  lest he should miss his son i had best lose no time in getting to my post exit   enter antonio with masks and music antonio  song  soft sym tell me my lute can thy soft strain so gently speak thy masters pain so softly sing so humbly sigh that though my sleeping love shall know who sings  who sighs below her rosy slumbers shall not fly thus may some vision whisper more than ever i dare speak before     st mask antonio your mistress will never wake while you sing so dolefully love like a cradled infant is lulled by a sad melody   antonio i do not wish to disturb her rest    st mask the reason is because you know she does not regard you enough to appear if you waked her   antonio then i will convince you   sings the breath of morn bids hence the night unveil those beauteous eyes my fair nor till the dawn of love is there i feel no day i own no light  louisa replies from a window waking i heard thy numbers chide waking the dawn did bless my sight it is phoebus sure that woos i cried who speaks in song who moves in light  don jerome from a window what vagabonds are these i hear fidling fluting rhyming ranting piping scraping whining canting fly scurvy minstrels fly     trio louisa nay pray thee father why so rough  ant an humble lover i  jer how durst you daughter lend an ear to such deceitful stuff quick from the window fly  louisa adieu antonio  ant musi you go  louisa we soon perhaps may meet again  ant for though hard fortune is our foe the god of love will fight for us  jer reach me the blunderbuss  ant and lou the god of love who knows our pai  jer hence or these slugs are through your brain  exeunt severally   scene ii  a piazza enter ferdinand and lopez lopez truly sir i think that a little sleep once in a week or so    ferd peace fool dont mention sleep to me   lopez no no sir i dont mention your lowbred vulgar sound sleep but i cannot help thinking that a gentle slumber or half an hours dozing if it were only for the novelty of the thing   ferd peace booby i say o clara dear cruel disturber of my rest   lopez and of mine too   ferd gods death to trifle with me at such a juncture as this  now to stand on punctilios  love me i dont believe she ever did   lopez nor i either   ferd or is it that her sex never know their desires for an hour together   lopez ah they know them oftener than they will own them   ferd is there in the world so inconstant a creature as clara   lopez i could name one   ferd yes the tame fool who submits to her caprice   lopez i thought he could not miss it   ferd is she not capricious teizing tyrannical obstinate perverse absurd ay a wilderness of faults and follies her looks are scorn and her very smiles  gods death i wish i had not mentioned her smiles for she does smile such beaming loveliness such fascinating brightness  o death and madness i shall die if i lose her   lopez o those damned smiles have undone all   air  ferdinand could i ber faults remember forgetting every charm soon would impartial reason the tyrant love disarm but when enraged i number each failing of her mind love still suggests each beauty and sees  while reasons blind    lopez here comes don antonio sir   ferd well go you home  i shall be there presently   lopez ah those cursed smiles exit   enter antonio ferd antonio lopez tells me he left you chaunting before our door  was my father waked   ant yes yes he has a singular affection for music so i left him roaring at his barred window like the print of bajazet in the cage and what brings you out so early   ferd i believe i told you that to morrow was the day fixed by don pedro and claras unnatural stepmother for her to enter a convent in order that her brat might possess her fortune made desperate by this i procured a key to the door and birbd claras maid to leave it unbolted at two this morning i entered unperceived and stole to her chamber  i found her waking and weeping   ant happy ferdinand   ferd sdeath hear the conclusion  i was rated as the most confident ruffian for daring to approach her room at that hour of night   ant ay ay this was at first   ferd no such thing she would not hear a word from me but threatened to raise her mother if i did not instantly leave her   ant well but at last   ferd at last why i was forced to leave the house as he came in   ant and did you do nothing to offend her   ferd nothing as i hope to be saved  i believe i might snatch a dozen or two of kisses   ant was that all well i think i never heard of such assurance   ferd zounds i tell you i behaved with the utmost respect   ant o lord i dont mean you but in her  but harky ferdinand did you leave your key with them   ferd yes the maid who saw me out took it from the door   ant then my life for it her mistress elopes after you   ferd ay to bless my rival perhaps  i am in a humor to suspect every body  you loved her once and thought her an angel as i do now   ant yes i loved her till i found she would not love me and then i discovered that she had not a good feature in her face air i never could any luster see in eyes that would not look on me i never saw nectar on a lip but where my own did hope to sip has the maid who seeks my heart cheeks of rose untouched by art i will own the color true when yielding blushes aid their hue is her hand so soft and pure i must press it to be sure nor can i be certain then till it grateful press again must i with attentive eye watch her heaving bosom sigh i will do so when i see that heaving bosom sigh for me besides ferdinand you have full security in my love for your sister help me there and i can never disturb you with clara   ferd as far as i can consistently with the honor of our family you know i will but there must be no eloping   ant and yet now you would carry off clara   ferd ay that is a different case we never mean that others should act to our sisters and wives as we do to others  but tomorrow clara is to be forced into a convent   ant well and am not i so unfortunately circumstancd tomorrow your father forces louisa to marry isaac the portugueze  but come with me and well devise something i warrant   ferd i must go home   ant well adieu   ferd but antonio if you did not love my sister you have too much honor and friendship to supplant me with clara   air  antonio friendship is the bond of reason but if beauty disapprove heaven dissolves all other treason in the heart that is true to love the faith which to my friend i swore as a civil oath i view but to the charms which i adore it is religion to be true   exit antonio ferd there is always a levity in antonios manner of replying to me on this subject that is very alarming  sdeath if clara should love him after all air though cause for suspicion appears yet proofs of her love too are strong i am a wretch if i am right in my fears and unworthy of bliss if i am wrong what heartbreaking torments from jealousy flow ah none but the jealous the jealous can know when blessed with the smiles of my fair i know not how much i adore those smiles let another but share and i wonder i prized them no more then whence can i hope a relief from my woe when the falser she seems still the fonder i grow   exit scene  a room in don jerome s house enter louisa and duenna louisa but my dear margaret my charming duenna do you think we shall succeed   duenna i tell you again i have no doubt on it but it must be instantly put to the trial  every thing is prepared in your room and for the rest we must trust to fortune   louisa my fathers oath was never to see me till i had consented to    duenna i was thus i overheard him say to his friend don guzman i will demand of her tomorrow once for all whether she will consent to marry isaac mendoza  if she hesitates i will make a solemn oath never to see or speak to her till she returns to her duty  these were his words   louisa and on his known obstinate adherence to what he has once said you have formed this plan for my escape  but have you secured my maid in our interest   duenna she is a party in the whole  but remember if we succeed you resign all right and title in little isaac the jew over to me   louisa that i do with all my soul get him if you can and i shall wish you joy most heartily he is twenty times as rich as my poor antonio air thou canst not boast of fortunes store my love vhile me they wealthy call but i was glad to find thee poor for with my heart i would give thee all and then the grateful youth shall own i loved him for himself alone but when his worth my hand shall gain no word or look of mine shall show that i the smallest thought retain of what my bounty did bestow yet still his grateful heart shall own i loved him for himself alone    duenna i hear don jerome coming  quick give me the last letter i brought you from antonio  you know that is to be the ground of my dismission  i must slip out to seal it up as undelivered exit   enter don jerome and ferdinand jerome what i suppose you have been serenading too eh disturbing some peaceable neighborhood with villainous catgut and lascivious piping out on it you set your sister here a vile example  but i come to tell you madam that i will suffer no more of these midnight incantations these amorous orgies that steal the senses in the hearing as they say egyptian embalmers serve mummies extracting the brain through the ears however there is an end of your frolics  isaac mendoza will be here presently and tomorrow you shall marry him   louisa never while i have life   ferd indeed sir i wonder how you can think of such a man for a soninlaw   jerome sir you are very kind to favor me with your sentiments  and pray what is your objection to him   ferd he is a portugueze in the first place   jerome no such thing boy he has forsworn his country   louisa he is a jew   jerome another mistake he has been a christian these six weeks   ferd ay he has left his old religion for an estate and has not had time to get a new one   louisa but stands like a dead wall between church and synagogue or like the blank leaves between the old and new testament   jerome any thing more   ferd but the most remarkable part of his character is his passion for deceit and tricks of cunning   louisa though at the same time the fool predominates so much over the knave that i am told he is generally the dupe of his own art   ferd true like an unskilful gunner he usually misses his aim and is hurt by the recoil of his own piece   jerome any thing more   louisa to sum up all he has the worst fault a husband can have  he is not my choice   jerome but you are his and choice on one side is sufficient  two lovers should never meet in marriage  be you sour as you please he is sweettemperd and for your good fruit there is nothing like ingrafting on a crab   louisa i detest him as a lover and shall ten times more as a husband   jerome i dont know that  marriage generally makes a great change  but to cut the matter short will you have him or not   louisa there is nothing else i could disobey you in   jerome do you value your fathers peace   louisa so much that i will not fasten on him the regret of making an only daughter wretched   jerome very well maam then mark me  never more will i see or converse with you till you return to your duty  no reply  this and your chamber shall be your apartments i never will stir out without leaving you under lock and key and when i am at home no creature can approach you but through my library  well try who can be most obstinate  out of my sight  there remain till you know your duty pushes her out   ferd surely sir my sisters inclinations should be consulted in a matter of this kind and some regard paid to don antonio being my particular friend   jerome that doubtless is a very great recommendation  i certainly have not paid sufficient respect to it   ferd there is not a man living i would sooner choose for a brotherinlaw   jerome very possible and if you happen to have ever a sister who is not at the same time a daughter of mine i am sure i shall have no objection to the relationship  but at present if you please well drop the subject   ferd nay sir it is only my regard for my sister makes me speak   jerome then pray sir in future let your regard for your father make you hold your tongue   ferd i have done sir  i shall only add a wish that you would reflect what at our age you would have felt had you been crossed in your affection for the mother of her you are so severe to   jerome why i must confess i had a great affection for your mothers ducats but that was all boy  i married her for her fortune and she took me in obedience to her father and a very happy couple we were  we never expected any love from one another and so we were never disappointed  if we grumbled a little now and then it was soon over for we were never fond enough to quarrel and when the good woman died why why  i had as lieve she had lived and i wish every widower in seville could say the same  i shall now go and get the key of this dressing room  so good son if you have any lecture in support of disobedience to give your sister it must be brief so make the best of your time do you hear exit jerome   ferd i fear indeed my friend antonio has little to hope for  however louisa has firmness and my fathers anger will probably only increase her affection  in our intercourse with the world it is natural for us to dislike those who are innocently the cause of our distress but in the hearts attachment a woman never likes a man with ardour till she has suffered for his sake noise soh what bustle is here between my father and the duenna too  i will even get out of the way exit   enter don jerome with a letter putting in the duenna jerome i am astonished i am thunder struck here is treachery and conspiracy with a vengeance you antonios creature and chief manager of this plot for my daughters eloping you that i placed here as a scarecrow   duenna what   jerome a scarecrow  to prove a decoyduck  what have you to say for yourself   duenna well sir since you have forced that letter from me and discovered my real sentiments i scorn to renounce em  i am antonios friend and it was my intention that your daughter should have served you as all such old tyrannical sots should be served  i delight in the tender passions and would befriend all under their influence   jerome the tender passions yes they would become those impenetrable features  why thou deceitful hag i placed thee as a guard to the rich blossoms of my daughters beauty  i thought that dragons front of thine would cry aloof to the sons of gallantry  steel traps and spring guns seemed writ in every wrinkle of it  but you shall quit my house this instant  the tender passions indeed go thou wanton sybil thou amorous woman of endor go   duenna you base scurrilous old  but i will not demean myself by naming what you are  yes savage i will leave your den but i suppose you dont mean to detain my apparel  i may have my things i presume   jerome i took you mistress with your wardrobe on  what have you pilferd heh   duenna sir i must take leave of my mistress she has valuables of mine besides my cardinal and veil are in her room   jerome your veil forsooth what do you dread being gazed at or are you afraid of your complexion well go take your leave and get your veil and cardinal soh you quit the house within these five minutes  in  in  quick exit duenna  here was a precious plot of mischief these are the comforts daughters bring us air if a daughter you have she is the plague of your life no peace shall you know though you have buried your wife at twenty she mocks at the duty you taught her o what a plague is an obstinate daughter sighing and whining dying and pining o what a plague is an obstinate daughter when scarce in their teens they have wit to perplex us with letters and lovers for ever they vex us while each still rejects the fair suitor you have brought her o what a plague is an obstinate daughter wrangling and jangling flouting and pouting o what a plague is an obstinate daughter    enter louisa dressed as the duenna with cardinal and veil and seeming to cry jerome this way mistress this way  what i warrant a tender parting  soh tears of turpentine down those deal cheeks  aye you may well hide your head  yes whine till your heart breaks but i will not hear one word of excuse  so you are right to be dumb this way  this way  exeunt enter duenna duenna so speed you well sagacious don jerome o rare effects of passion and obstinacy  now shall i try whether i cannot play the fine lady as well as my mistress and if i succeed i may be a fine lady for the rest of my life  i will lose no time to equip myself exit   scene iv the court before don jeromes house enter don jerome and louisa jerome come mistress there is your way  the world lies before you so troop thou antiquated eve thou original sin  hold yonder is some fellow skulking perhaps it is antonio  go to him do you hear and tell him to make you amends and as he has got you turned away tell him i say it is but just he should take you himself go  exit louisa soh i am rid of her thank heaven and now i shall be able to keep my oath and confine my daughter with better security exit   scene v  the piazza enter clara and her maid maid but where madam is it you intend to go   clara any where to avoid the selfish violence of my motherinlaw and ferdinands insolent importunity   maid indeed maam since we have profited by don ferdinands key in making our escape i think we had best find him if it were only to thank him   clara no  he has offended me exceedingly retire   enter louisa louisa so i have succeeded in being turned out of doors  but how shall i find antonio i dare not enquire for him for fear of being discovered i would send to my friend clara but that i doubt her prudery would condemn me   maid then suppose maam you were to try if your friend donna louisa would not receive you   clara no her notions of filial duty are so severe she would certainly betray me   louisa clara is of a cold temper and would this step of mine highly forward   clara louisas respect for her father is so great she would not credit the unkindness of mine louisa turns and sees clara and maid   louisa ha who are those sure one is clara  if it be i will trust her  clara advances   clara louisa and in masquerade too   louisa you will be more surprised when i tell you that i have run away from my father   clara surprised indeed and i should certainly chide you most horridly only that i have just run away from mine   louisa my dear clara embrace   clara dear sister truant and whither are you going   louisa to find the man i love to be sure  and i presume you would have no aversion to meet with my brother   clara indeed i should  he has behaved so ill to me i dont believe i shall ever forgive him  air  clara when sable night each drooping plant restoring wept over the flowers her breath did cheer as some sad widow over her babe deploring wakes its beauty with a tear when all did sleep whose weary hearts did borrow one hour from love and care to rest lo as i pressed my couch in silent sorrow my lover caught me to his breast he vowed he came to save me from those who would enslave me then kneeling kisses stealing endless faith he swore but soon i hid him thence for had his fond pretense obtained oe favor then and he had press dgain i feared my treacherous heart might grant him more    louisa well for all this i would have sent him to plead his pardon but that i would not yet a while have him know of my flight and where do you hope to find protection   clara the lady abbess of the convent of st catherine is a relation and kind friend of mine  i shall be secure with her and you had best go thither with me   louisa no i am determined to find antonio first and as i live here comes the very man i will employ to seek him for me   clara who is he he is a strange figure   louisa yes that sweet creature is the man whom my father has fixed on for my husband   clara and will you speak to him are you mad   louisa he is the fittest man in the world for my purpose  for though i was to have married him tomorrow he is the only man in seville who i am sure never saw me in his life   clara and how do you know him   louisa he arrived but yesterday and he was shown me from the window as he visited my father   clara well i will be gone   louisa hold my dear clara  a thought has struck me will you give me leave to borrow your name as i see occasion   clara it will but disgrace you  but use it as you please  i dare not stay  going but louisa if you should see your brother be sure you dont inform him that i have taken refuge with the dame prior of the convent of st catherine on the left hand side of the piazza which leads to the church of st anthony   louisa ha ha ha i will be very particular in my directions where he may not find you exeunt clara and maid so my swain yonder has done admiring himself and draws nearer retires   enter isaac and carlos isaac with a pocket glass isaac  looking in the glass i tell you friend carlos i will please myself in the habit of my chin   clara but my dear friend how can you think to please a lady with such a face   isaac why what is the matter with the face i think it is a very engaging face and i am sure a lady must have very little taste who could dislike my beard  sees louisa see now  i will die if here is not a little damsel struck with it already   louisa signor are you disposed to oblige a lady who greatly wants your assistance unveils   isaac egad a very pretty blackeyed girl she has certainly taken a fancy to me carlos  first maam i must beg the favor of your name   louisa soh it is well i am provided  aside my name sir is donna clara dalmanza   isaac what  don guzmans daughter in faith i just now heard she was missing   louisa but sure sir you have too much gallantry and honor to betray me whose fault is love   isaac so a passion for me poor girl why maam as for betraying you i dont see how i could get any thing by it so you may rely on my honor but as for your love i am sorry your case is so desperate   louisa why so signor   isaac because i am positively engaged to another  ant i carlos   louisa nay but hear me   isaac no no what should i hear for it is impossible for me to court you in an honorable way and for any thing else if i were to comply now i suppose you have some ungrateful brother or cousin who would want to cut my throat for my civility  so truly you had best go home again   louisa odious wretch  aside but good signor it is antonio dercilla on whose account i have eloped   isaac how what it is not with me then that you are in love   louisa no indeed it is not   isaac then you are a forward impertinent

donna clara your very obedient  carlos to your post   duett isaac my mistress expects me and i must go to her or how can i hope for a smile  louisa soon may you return a prosperous wooer but think

win her to that and she gains a father and a husband at once   isaac gad i shall never be able to deal with her alone nothing keeps me in such awe as perfect beauty  now there is something consoling and encouraging in ugliness song give isaac the nymph who no beauty can boast but health and good humor to make her his toast if strait i dont mind whether slender or sat and six feet or four  well never quarrel for that whatever her complexion i vow i dont care if brown it is lasting more pleasing if fair and though in her face i no dimples should see let her smile and each dell is a dimple to me let her locks be the reddest that ever were seen and her eyes may be even any color but green be they light gray or black their luster and hue i swear i have no choice only let her have two it is true i would dispense with a throne on her back and white teeth i own are genteeler than black a little round chin toos a beauty i have heard but i only desire she may not have a heard    jerome you will change your note my friend when you have seen louisa   isaac o don jerome the honor of your alliance    jerome aye but her beauty will affect you  she is though i say it who am her father a very prodigy  there you will see peatures with an eye like mine  yes in faith there is a kind of wicked sparkling  something of a roguish brightness that shows her to be my own   isaac pretty rogue   jerome then when she smiles you will see a little dimple in one cheek only a beauty it is certainly yet you shall not say which is prettiest the cheek with the dimple or the cheek without   isaac pretty rogue   jerome then the roses on those cheeks are shaded with a sort of velvet down that gives a delicacy to the glow of health   isaac pretty rogue   jerome her skin pure dimity yet more fair being spangled here and there with a golden freckle   isaac charming pretty rogue how is the tone of her voice   jerome remarkably pleasing  but if you could prevail on her to sing you would be

wait on you presently goes to the door   isaac when she is at leisure  dont hurry her exit maid  i wish i had ever practiced a lovescene  i doubt i shall make a poor figure  i coudnt be more afraid if i was going before the inquisition  so the door opens  yes she is coming  the very rustling of her silk has a disdainful sound  enter duenna  dressed as louisa now darnt i look round for the soul of me  her beauty will certainly strike me dumb if i do i wish she would speak first   duenna sir i attend your pleasure   isaac so the ice is broke and a pretty civil beginning too hem madam  miss  i am all attention   duenna nay sir it is i who should listen and you propose   isaac egad this isnt so disdainful neither  i believe i may venture to look  no  i darnt  one glance of those roguish sparklers would fix me again   duenna you seem thoughtful sir  let me persuade you to sit down   isaac so so she mollifies apace  she is struck with my figure this attitude has had its effect   duenna come sir here is a chair   isaac madam the greatness of your goodness overpowers me  that a lady so lovely should deign to turn her beauteous eyes on me so she takes his hand he turns and sees her   duenna you seem surpised at my condescension   isaac why yes madam i am a little surprised at it zounds this can never be louisa  she is as old as my mother  aside   duenna but former prepossessions give way to my fathers commands   isaac  aside her father yes it is she then  lord lord how blind some parents are   duenna signor isaac   isaac truly the little damsel was right  she has rather a matronly air indeed ah it is well my affections are fixed on her fortune and not her person   duenna signor will not you sit  she sits   isaac pardon me madam i have scarce recovered my astonishment at  your condescension madam  she has the devils own dimples to be sure  aside   duenna nay you shall not stand  he sits i do not wonder sir that you are surpised at my affability  i own signor that i was vastly prepossessed against you and being teizd by my father i did give some encouragement to antonio but then sir you were described to me as a quite different person   isaac aye and so you was to me upon my soul madam   duenna but when i saw you i was never more struck in my life   isaac that was just my case too madam i was struck all on a heap for my part   duenna well sir i see our misapprehension has been mutual  you expected to find me haughty and averse and i was taught to believe you a little black snubnosed fellow without person manners or address   isaac egad i wish she had answered her picture as well   duenna but sir your air is noble  something so liberal in your carriage with so penetrating an eye and so bewitching a smile   isaac egad now i look at her again i
