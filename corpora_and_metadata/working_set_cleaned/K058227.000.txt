to the author as behind the scenes dont be alarmed my friend you need not be in fear none but goodnatured folks i am positive are here coming forward to the audience to plead a brothers cause who trembling stands behind a volunteer i come  and beg you will be kind to this his first begotten  show your fostring care and let his tender bantling in your favors share in arts perfection is the growth of years the bud must open ere the flower appears each litele fault or blemish pass regardless by but mark each glimpse of merit with approving eye though yet a raw unpracticed novice he appear let but your generous plaudits dissipate his fear to bolder heigths hereafter he may wing his flight and give you then much greater pleasure and delight for applause you all knows the life of endeavor without it in vain is our study and labor to each critic i sue  on each fair one rely many looks of indulgence methinks i espy as a sketch of his plan  his attempt is to show the nice fop of the age and the libertine too their vices and follies hold up to derision that feeling its force they may show their contrition virtue and beautys charms he likewise sets to view allpowerful charms such as should every heart subdue from natures wide and ample field his plan he draws and hopes to please you all by her unerring laws then with candor attend  let no prejudice rise but show yourselves pleased both with hands and with eyes  the writers of the two following prologues it is hoped will excuse their not being spoken as the foregoing one was written for that purpose prior to their being received  prologue i when folly with dame fashions forces joined usurped inglorious empire over mankind when virtue sunk beneath the ironband of vice who stalked gigantic through the land often has thalia fired with generous rage lashed the proud tyrants on the instructive stage unmasked their every art then headlong hurled from their high thrones those sovereigns of our world bid injured reason her lost rights again resume and of the passions take the rein whilst fickle fashion owned her ruling hand and fixed the mode or altered at her dread command twas she who bid our trembling bard engage to lash the folly of this fribbling age h she cried often has a fluttering train of empty beings scarce the shades of men provoked my laughter as they moved along  each to the music of his own soft tongue the task be thine to seize the motly crew and drag them forth exposed to public view haste  can thy eye mistakeem  no  on high their fronts arise and seem to prop the sky whilst all their wit and sense and judgment joined in one large roll bangs pendant from behind like the sweet warblers of italian strains unknown to lovessoft pleasures and his pains when beauty courts them with alluring eye fleet as the slag before the hounds they fly when britain calls her valiant sons to arms their milky souls no martial ardour warms for all their courage lodges in the heel and fears the only passion they can feel save that in which they every hour employ narcissuslike  the selfadmiring joy haste  seize the dear insipids  bravely dare to wage with folly and with fashion war these these are comic satyrs noblest game she ceased  and sought fair aganippesstream our bard obedient to the high command the feeble effort of his trembling hand this night presents o deign ye generous fair with smiles propitious to reward his care ye that reside in our theatric skies higher than ever adventurous muse durst rise ye in the clouds  and ye who lowly sit judges supreme of poetry and wit kindly receivet  he asks no deathless name bright in the annals of eternal fame kindly receivt  nor to the infernal gloom of plutos realms his infant offspring doom but judge with candor each observing

reprieve that done  i will never  trust me when i swear  prove dupe to you  or any other playr comes forward bold was the man that first engaged in fight far bolder he  that durst engage  to write the

epi show him up  enter lord promise what promise  where the deuce have you hid yourself for the last fortnight   lord promise though buried in obscurity yet busily employed i assure you  but hey day  what can you be possibly dressed for now  you are not going to a masquerade   epi no   l pro you dont intend this for a wedding suit i hope   epi no  strike me into a non entity if i do   l pro ha ha ha  come what is the real occasion   epi to display my taste and elegance and i think this will give a convincing proof of both   l pro ha ha ha  upon my soul you make such large advances to the feminine gender that in a little time twill be difficult to tell to which sex you belong   epi i would have it so  i do it to be distinguished from the tramontane  but i want to know where you have been  i have hunted all the public places in london for you without success and i thought if alive i must have met you at one of them   l pro you find you are mistaken then  i can readily live without a continual round of dissipation though to you it may be impossible  your existence depends upon dress and fashion  i despise both  even my pleasures are different from yours  i am wholly devoted to the charms of beauty you to those hourly discovered by your lookingglass   epi and pray which are most harmless to mankind i who am amused by dress and a passion for myself or you who for a trifling gratification are continually studying the ruin of every girl handsome enough to attract your notice   l pro why jack you have not spirit enough to make an attack upon any female either in an honorable or any other manner  now the warmth of my constitution hurries me on to pleasures which you tasteless mortals never dream of   epi and often exposes you to very disagreeable consequences  witness miss standfield   l pro true it sometimes happens so  but then i have courage to support myself under those difficulties  and now you mention her i own she was a girl i loved more than i thought the levity of my nature could admit of   epi yes you gave a conspicuous proof of that   l pro i did  her father major standfield was my particular friend a man i had an uncommon regard for  therefore i avoided meeting him afterward lest some unlucky chance should lodge my sword in his bosom  that you will allow was honorable   epi oh humane and honorable to the highest degree   l pro yes after the many proofs of my skill in the sword i could have no reason to doubt its success with an old man so to be entirely out of harms way i took that opportunity of gratifying my desire in visiting the principal courts of europe   epi to which accident i was indebted for the pleasure of your company home from naples   l pro you was  during near five years residence abroad i have never even heard from the poor girl though upon my soul i have often severely felt for the unhappy situation i left her in  which plainly proves that i am not destitute of compassion   epi oh a miracle of tenderness   l pro in foreign climes as well as at home i was confirmed in my favorite principle that women if rightly attacked are sure to yield  i found you indeed an altered fellow without either life or soul nor could my utmost endeavors arouse you  i wanted you to be a man of spirit your ambition was to appear a firstrate macaroni you are returned fully qualified and determined i see to show the world what a contemptible creature an englishman dwindles into when he adopts the follies and vices of other nations   epi strike me speechless george if you are not devilish severe  but par late liber amente  i cannot take any thing ill you say  may illbreeding be my portion if i dont pity your want of taste  let me tell you my lord it is we who enjoy all the real pleasures of life without any of its inconveniences  love i grant you is not admitted into our system we look upon it at best as a passion attended with so many disagreeable sensations that it is not worth the pursuit   l pro what a fellow for a girl of my sisters sense to be united to   epi it is true we do amuse ourselves sometimes with the ladies  imitate their manners  but carefully avoid all serious connection with them  oh lord what a horrid thing love must be  to take off all attention from ourselves and study to be what you call manly brave noble and generous in order to appear amiable in the eyes of the fair  ha ha ha  no no by all that is ridiculous it will never do   l pro then has a pretty girl no influence on thee   epi not in the least  may the sun freckle me if she has but as she regards my dress and conversation   l pro no you do not wish to make a conquest of one   epi not i by all that is fashionable hearkee promise do you think if i loved a girl that i could devote the time i do to the more essential business of decorating my person  look at me well and answer truly   l pro no  that would then be one of your least cares   epi then may my clothes misfit me if i would forego that happiness to possess all the graces the poets ever assembled in women   l pro you will except my sister  how do you intend to manage in that affair   epi now you puzzle me  but when i know myself i will tell you   l pro have you seen her since you came home   epi no but i design it   l pro take care or you will lose her  she is followed now by a brisker lover  but that i find would be no misfortune to you  dont you think our old dads were rather foolish when they signed that contract which obliges you to marry each other or forfeit thirty thousand pounds   epi i am afraid i shall suffer by their folly  but who is the happy man   l pro tom clement a worthy young fellow of family and fortune   epi i dont know him   l pro i suppose not  come i will introduce you to two of the loveliest angelic creatures the sun ever shone upon   epi if you can convince me the sun shines upon any one i love better than myself you may if not excuse me  pray who are these lovely angelic creatures   l pro they are two of the fairest of eves daughters whom i have just decoyed up to town upon the old scheme   epi then i may conclude it was about them you were so busily employed during your late invisibility   l pro right  not having visited my fathers eslate in the wilds of yorkshire since my return from travel i resolved upon an excursion thither  the romantic beauty of the country pleased me much presenting an agreeable contrast to the place i had just left  on sunday knowing the church to be the only spot where i might pick and choose the rustics to advantage i resolved not to miss the opportunity   epi for shame my lord have you so little religion in you   l pro much the same as yourself in that respect my boy  there is only this difference you cannot think i will not  but how shall i express the astonishment which seized me upon beholding amongst many of homely garb and feature two of the sweetest girls nature ever formed   epi so so  fresh game   l pro on enquiry i found they were daughters to an old gentleman whom a variety of misfortunes had drove to this part of the world as an asylum  the eldest was handsome enough to justify the disguises of jove had he been on earth  but never was modesty beauty and native elegance so happily united as in the youngest  i am not adamant at any time here i took fire in an instant  as soon as service was over which i thought the longest ever performed i introduced myself to the father and his two sylvan deities   epi you have a laconic method by all that is modest  well what success   l pro i think you need not ask that at any time  i seldom fail even when circumstances are against me much less when considered as the only son of the earl of witton and heir to the estate many miles round about me  the father received me with the greatest respect the daughters with a bewitching innocent diffidence which gave fresh luster to their increasing charms   epi and yet those very charms you are laboring to destroy   l pro dont interrupt me  i soon found that nothing was to be done amongst those peaceful wilds  london was the only place where i could manage them to my wish  they never had been there and i gloried in being their introducer   epi i should have thought it a hard matter to have enticed them hither   l pro no quite easy to me  a few days ingratiated me into the old gentlemans favor  replete with every virtue which can warm the human heart his honest unsuspecting mind has not an idea of deceit  indeed if he had my plan was laid so well he could hardly have suspected it  many years had he passed in this unfrequented vale where he entombed one of the best of wives  since her decease his chief care has been the education of these two darling daughters    epi which for the future you are willing to ease him the trouble of  very charitable upon my word my lord   l pro to own a truth to you epicene i often know i am acting wrong though i have not courage enough to set myself right  even in this case  such is mr lambtons character so revered his goodness that i will freely confess i never undertook any project of the like nature with half the remorse or compunction i did this   epi you are an original by all that is whimsical  how can you be so deliberately wicked   l pro i am not  youth and the impetuous dictates of nature impel me  i dread to look back  yet could i find but one of the sex above temptation perhaps i might be reclaimed  but no more i want your immediate assistance in this affair   epi mine   l pro yes yours  dont be amazed  that was my errand hither   epi the deuce it was  to what end   l pro why as you are a particular friend i will spare you one of the girls   epi i am much obliged to you george but i beg to be excused   l pro ha ha ha  are you afraid of venturing yourself with her this is my business  your house is very large commodious and retired   epi well what of that   l pro cannot you spare me half of it to remain entirely at my disposal during this affair   epi why my house   l pro as this is a particular case i could not so well manage every thing at one of those common receptacles  besides if there should be any noise it cannot so easily be heard there   epi pray let us hear your scheme   l pro i found that my father knew mr lambton and intended had he not been called abroad so suddenly to have drawn him from obscurity i like a dutiful son was resolved to fulfill his desires therefore counterfeiced a letter from him inviting mr lambton up to town promising to provide handsomely for him  full of primitive simplicity he immediately swallowed the bait the family are just arrived in london and i am about to consummate my project   epi a hopeful one i perceive   l pro only to separate the daughters from the father and under pretense of visiting my sister bring them hither   epi how will you manage for a lady to represent her   l pro suppose i dress you up they are ignorant of the world and the deceit will easily pass upon them   epi no that i think would be carrying the joke too far    l pro i did but jest i have already provided one for the character  you will have no objection though i hope to lend me a helping hand upon the occasion   epi why if you will free me from any danger which may ensue on a discovery i confess i should like the frolic well enough   l pro never fear  yours will be an agreeable task to entertain the eldest  she is wild and flighty owing to the solitude she was educated in yet fraught with such innocence and simplicity that had i not beheld her sister every wish would have been gratified in her   epi so you want me to amuse her while you besiege your favorite object   l pro i do who in such a situation i think cannot fail to surrender   epi what do you imagine the father will be doing in the mean time   l pro i have taken care the shall not interrupt me and now that matters are settled with you i will step and see how they do after their journey   epi do you hear george come back directly that i may know how to proceed   l pro as soon as possible  not a minute is now to be lost till that arrives which crowns my bliss in the enjoyment of love and beauty   exit epi how these foolish passions transport the man what are his raptures of love and beauty to the superior delights of a grand coup declat at the dear dear masquerade   exit scene varnishs house mr lambton miss lambton maria mr lambton thank heaven we are safe arrived  twas a fatiguing journey for one of my years and nothing could have induced me to revisit the world but the hopes of you my children reaping some future advantage from it  as for myself declined in the vale of life i was content with my situation  i thankfully enjoyed the blessings of providence nor envied the ideal happiness of those above me   maria indeed papa i think you were much in the right  for my part i prefer a cottage with virtue to a palace with guilt   miss lambton so do i yet i think it possible to gain the palace without partaking of the guilt   mar i am afraid you will find yourself mistaken sister   miss lamb perhaps not  every thing at present seems fair for it  under the protection of so great a man as the earl of witton what have we to fear  are not we to be introduced to lord promises sister  what may not she do for us  i am sure if i enjoyed her fortune my heart would delight in finding out proper objects to make happy   mr lamb true child it should be the province of those whom providence has thus distinguished and i acknowledge i have heard the best of characters of both  i am not apt lightly to distrust yet when i reflect on our situation it makes me dread a disappointment  above two hundred miles from home  our money almost exhausted in coming hither  not even an acquaintance in london to apply to  and two daughters in some degree objects of temptation exposed to the snares of such a town as this with only an aged father to protect them  in such    miss lamb i can assure you papa you torment yourself with groundless chimeras  could any one behave more politely than lord promise  did not he say you might depend upon his fathers friendship for you  is not his letter the greatest security  surely then you cannot hesitate a moment in preferring affluence to the indigence we have just quitted   mr lamb daughter he that possesses content is richer than a sceptered monarch  what cares had i to disturb me at monktown  my honest friends and neighbors during the many years i passed amongst them regarded me as a father friend and instructor poor people my heart is with you still  but i must now go see that ralph has got our little baggage sage we need not expect to meet here with that fidelity and simplicity which characterizes our untaught villagers   exit miss lamb still sister i find you have not a very favorable opinion of the cause which brought us hither   mar i own i have not  ever since leaving our peaceful dwelling i know not why but an unusual sadness has taken possession of me   miss lamb oh that is easily accounted for  it is because you left that dear sweet sighing swain of yours mr wilville behind  though sir harry temple was with him yet i was not sad  our journey to me seemed enchantingly pleasant  oh lud  the swiftness of our expedition  the variety of objects  the uncommon politeness we were treated with on the road  the amazing noise hurry and bustle we saw in coming hither has filled my mind with images i never had the least idea of before  oh happy happy creatures who continually enjoy such blessings without interruption   mar perhaps not so happy as you imagine sister  there may be real enjoyments here as well as in retirement but i am apt to think true content is easier to be found in the mossgrown cot than the cloudaspiring dome   miss lamb there again we differ  i am heartily weary of solitude and leave to you the undisturbed enjoyment of going to rest with the sun that like him you may be the harbinger of morn  treading the cowslip bending green to visit your lowing herds who constantly welcome and reward you with overflowing bowls of nectar  at noon feasting on patriarchal luxuries  toward eve  but let that suffice contrast it with what lord promise told us of a sine ladys life  rising at noon  paying morning visits  dining at six  dressing  then whirling away to routs balls assemblies masquerades where brilliant company music dancing and card parties make the time glide insensibly away till blushing morn unfolds the fringed curtains of the gilded east and tears them unwillingly from their half enjoyed pleasures  if such a description be true who in their senses would have a doubt which to prefer   mar sister we had better not entirely depend upon all lord promise told us  a little time i am afraid will dispel the mist which overshadows your reason   miss lamb then if it be a mist sister i never desire it to be removed  adieu i hope for ever to those purling rills deep embowerd shades and fleecy nibblers of the plain that hitherto have been our companions a brighter scene now opens to my view and if sir harry temple knew but where to trace us my joys then would be complete   mar flatter not yourself so much charlotte as to imagine we have such power over them  to accident only are we indebted for their acquaintance  nor have we a right to expect it to continue  it is true they did us a signal piece of service in rescuing us from such a crew of gypsies who meeting us where they did would probably have robbed perhaps murdered us   miss
