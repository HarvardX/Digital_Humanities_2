the good natured man a comedy as performed at the theater royal in covent garden  by mr goldsmith  london printed for w griffin in catharinestreet strand mdcclxviii  preface when i undertook to write a comedy i confess i was strongly prepossessed in favor of the poets of the last age and strove to imitate them the term genteel comedy was then unknown amongst us and little more was desired by an audience than nature and humor in whatever walks of life they were most conspicuous the author of the following scenes never imagined that more would be expected of him and therefore to delineate character has been his principal aim those who know any thing of composition are sensible that in pursuing humor it will sometimes lead us into the recesses of the mean i was even tempted to look for it in the master of a spunginghouse but in deference to the public taste grown of late perhaps too delicate the scene of the bailiffs was retrenched in the representation in deference also to the judgment of a few friends who think in a particular way the scene is here restored the author submits it to the reader in his closet and hopes that too much refinement will not banish humor and character from ours as it has already done from the french theater indeed the french comedy is now become so very elevated and sentimental that it has not only banished humor and moliere from the stage but it has banished all spectators too  upon the whole the author returns his thanks to the public for the favorable reception which the good natured man has met with and to mr colman in particular for his kindness to it it may not also be improper to assure any who shall hereafter write for the theater that merit or supposed merit will ever be a sufficient passport to his protection  prologue written by dr johnson spoken by mr bensley pressed by the load of life the weary mind surveys the general toil of human kind with cool submission joins the laboring train and social sorrow loses half it is pain our anxious bard without complaint may share this bustling seasons epidemic care like caesars pilot dignified by fate tossed in one common storm with all the great distressed alike the statesman and the wit when one a borough courts and one the pit the busy candidates for power and fame have hopes and fears and wishes just the same disabled both to combat or to fly must hear all taunts and hear without reply uncheckd on both loud rabbles vent their rage as mongrels bay the lion in a cage the offended burgess hoards his angry tale for that blessed year when all that vote may rail their schemes of spite the poets foes dismiss till that glad night when all that hate may hiss this day the powdered curls and golden coat says swelling crispin begged a coblers vote this night our wit the pert apprentice cries lies at my feet i hiss him and he dies the great it is true can charm the electing tribe the bard may supplicate but cannot bribe yet judged by those whose voices never were sold he feels no want of ill persuading gold but confident of praise if praise be due trusts without fear to merit and to you dramatis personae men mr honeywood mr powell croaker mr shuter lofty mr woodward sir william honeywood mr clarke leontine mr bensley jarvis mr dunstall butler mr cushing bailiff mr r smith dubardieu mr holtom postboy mr quick women miss richland mrs bulkley olivia mrs mattocks mrs croaker mrs pit garnet mrs green landlady mrs white scene london the good natured man act the first scene an apartment in young honeywoods house enter sir william honeywood jarvis sir will good jarvis make no apologies for this honest bluntness fidelity like yours is the best excuse for every freedom   jarvis i cannot help being blunt and being very angry too when i hear you talk of disinheriting so good so worthy a young gentleman as your nephew my master all the world loves him   sir will say rather that he loves all the world that is his fault   jarvis i am sure there is no part of it more dear to him than you are though he has not seen you since he was a child   sir will what signifies his affection to me or how can i be proud of a place in a heart where every sharper and coxcomb find an easy entrance   jarvis i grant you that he is rather too good natured that he is too much every mans man that he laughs this minute with one and cries the next with another but whose instructions may he thank for all this   sir will not mine sure my letters to him during my employment in italy taught him only that philosophy which might prevent not defend his errors   jarvis faith begging your honors pardon i am sorry they taught him any philosophy at all it has only served to spoil him this same philosophy is a good horse in the stable but an errant jade on a journey for my own part whenever i hear him mention the name on it i am always sure he is going to play the fool   sir will dont let us ascribe his faults to his philosophy i entreat you no jarvis his good nature arises rather from his fears of offending the importunate than his desire of making the deserving happy   jarvis what it rises from i dont know but to be sure every body has it that asks it   sir will ay or that does not ask it i have been now for some time a concealed spectator of his follies and find them as boundless as his dissipation   jarvis and yet faith he has some fine name or other for them all he calls his extravagance generosity and his trusting every body universal benevolence it was but last week he went security for a fellow whose face he scarce knew and that he called an act of exalted mu  mu  munificence ay that was the name he gave it   sir will and upon that i proceed as my last effort though with very little hopes to reclaim him that very fellow has just absconded and i have taken up the security now my intention is to involve him in fictitious distress before he has plunged himself into real calamity to arrest him for that very debt to clap an officer upon him and then let him see which of his friends will come to his relief   jarvis well if i could but any way see him thoroughly vexed every groan of his would be music to me yet faith i believe it impossible i have tried to fret him myself every morning these three years but instead of being angry he sits as calmly to hear me scold as he does to his hairdresser   sir will we must try him once more however and i will go this instant to put my scheme into execution and i dont despair of succeeding as by your means i can have frequent opportunities of being about him without being known what a pity it is jarvis that any mans good will to others should produce so much neglect of himself as to require correction yet we must touch his weaknesses with a delicate hand there are some faults so nearly allied to excellence that we can scarce weed out the vice without eradicating the virtue  exit jarvis well go thy ways sir william honeywood it is not without reason that the world allows thee to be the best of men but here comes his hopeful nephew the strange good natured foolish open hearted  and yet all his faults are such that one loves him still the better for them   enter honeywood honeyw well jarvis what messages from my friends this morning   jarvis you have no friends   honeyw well from my acquaintance then   jarvis pulling out bills a few of our usual cards of compliment that is all this bill from your tailor this from your mercer and this from the little broker in crookedlane he says he has been at a great deal of trouble to get back the money you borrowed   honeyw that i dont know but i am sure we were at a great deal of trouble in getting him to lend it   jarvis he has lost all patience   honeyw then he has lost a very good thing   jarvis there is that ten guineas you were sending to the poor gentleman and his children in the fleet i believe that would stop his mouth for a while at least   honeyw ay jarvis but what will fill their mouths in the mean time must i be cruel because he happens to be importunate and to relieve his avarice leave them to insupportable distress   jarvis sdeath sir the question now is how to relieve yourself yourself  havnt i reason to be out of my senses when i see things going at sixes and sevens   honeyw whatever reason you may have for being out of your senses i hope you will allow that i am not quite unreasonable for continuing in mine   jarvis youre the only man alive in your present situation that could do so  every thing upon the waste there is miss richland and her fine fortune gone already and upon the point of being given to your rival   honeyw i am no mans rival   jarvis your uncle in italy preparing to disinherit you your own fortune almost spent and nothing but pressing creditors false friends and a pack of drunken servants that your kindness has made unfit for any other family   honeyw then they have the more occasion for being in mine   jarvis soh what will you have done with him that i caught stealing your plate in the pantry in the fact i caught him in the fact   honeyw in the fact if so i really think that we should pay him his wages and turn him off   jarvis he shall be turned off at tyburn the dog well hang him if it be only to frighten the rest of the family   honeyw no jarvis it is enough that we have lost what he has stolen let us not add to it the loss of a fellow creature   jarvis very fine well here was the footman just now to complain of the butler he says he does most work and ought to have most wages   honeyw that is but just though perhaps here comes the butler to complain of the footman   jarvis ay its the way with them all from the scullion to the privycounsellor if they have a bad master they keep quarrelling with him if they have a good master they keep quarrelling with one another   enter butler drunk butler sir i will not stay in the family with jonathan you must part with him or part with me that is the exexexposition of the matter sir   honeyw full and explicit enough but what is his fault good philip   butler sir he is given to drinking sir and i shall have my morals corrupted by keeping such company   honeyw ha ha he has such a diverting way    jarvis o quite amusing   butler i find my wines a going sir and liquors dont go without mouths sir i hate a drunkard sir   honeyw well well philip i will hear you upon that another time so go to bed now   jarvis to bed let him go to the devil   butler begging your honors pardon and begging your pardon master jarvis i will not go to bed nor to the devil neither i have enough to do to mind my cellar i forgot your honor mr croaker is below i came on purpose to tell you   honeyw why didnt you show him up blockhead   butler show him up sir with all my heart sir up or down all is one to me  exit jarvis ay we have one or other of that family in this house from morning till night he comes on the old affair i suppose the match between his son that is just returned from paris and miss richland the young lady he is guardian to   honeyw perhaps so mr croaker knowing my friendship for the young lady has got it into his head that i can persuade her to what i please   jarvis ah if you loved yourself but half as well as she loves you we should soon see a marriage that would set all things to rights again   honeyw love me sure jarvis you dream no no her intimacy with me never amounted to more than friendship  mere friendship that she is the most lovely woman that ever warmed the human heart with desire i own but never let me harbor a thought of making her unhappy by a connection with one so unworthy her merits as i am no jarvis it shall be my study to serve her even in spite of my wishes and to secure her happiness though it destroys my own   jarvis was ever the like i want patience   honeyw besides jarvis though i could obtain miss richlands consent do you think i could succeed with her guardian or mrs croaker his wife who though both very fine in their way are yet a little opposite in their dispositions you know   jarvis opposite enough heaven knows the very reverse of each other she all laugh and no joke he always complaining and never sorrowful a fretful poor soul that has a new distress for every hour in the four and twenty    honeyw hush hush he is coming up he will hear you   jarvis one whose voice is a passing bell    honeyw well well go do   jarvis a raven that bodes nothing but mischief a coffin and cross bones a bundle of rue a sprig of deadly night shade a  honeywood stopping his mouth at last pushes him off  exit jarvis honeyw i must own my old monitor is not entirely wrong there is something in my friend croakers conversation that quite depresses me his very mirth is an antidote to all gaiety and his appearance has a stronger effect on my spirits than an undertakers shop  mr croaker this is such a satisfaction    enter croaker croaker a pleasant morning to mr honeywood and many of them how is this you look most shockingly to day my dear friend i hope this weather does not affect your spirits to be sure if this weather continues  i say nothing  but god send we be all better this day three months   honeyw i heartily concur in the wish though i own not in your apprehensions   croaker may be not indeed what signifies what weather we have in a country going to ruin like ours taxes rising and trade falling money flying out of the kingdom and jesuits swarming into it i know at this time no less than an hundred and twentyseven jesuits between charing cross and temple bar   honeyw the jesuits will scarce pervert you or me i should hope   croaker may be not indeed what signifies whom they pervert in a country that has scarce any religion to lose i am only afraid for our wives and daughters   honeyw i have no apprehensions for the ladies i assure you   croaker may be not indeed what signifies whether they be perverted or no the women in my time were good for something i have seen a lady dressed from top to toe in her own manufactures formerly but now adays the devil a thing of their own manufactures about them except their faces   honeyw but however these faults may be practiced abroad you dont find them at home either with mrs croaker olivia or miss richland   croaker the best of them will never be canonized for a saint when she is dead by the bye my dear friend i dont find this match between miss richland and my son much relished either by one side or the other   honeyw i thought otherwise   croaker ah mr honeywood a little of your fine serious advice to the young lady might go far i know she has a very exalted opinion of your understanding   honeyw but would not that be usurping an authority that more properly belongs to yourself   croaker my dear friend you know but little of my authority at home people think indeed because they see me come out in a morning thus with a pleasant face and to make my friends merry that all is well within but i have cares that would break an heart of stone my wife has so encroachd upon every one of my privileges that i am now no more than a mere lodger in my own house   honeyw but a little spirit exerted on your side might perhaps restore your authority   croaker no though i had the spirit of a lion i do rouse sometimes but what then always hagling and hagling a man is tired of getting the better before his wife is tired of losing the victory   honeyw it is a melancholy consideration indeed that our chief comforts often produce our greatest anxieties and that an increase of our possessions is but an inlet to new disquietudes   croaker ah my dear friend these were the very words of poor dick doleful to me not a week before he made away with himself indeed mr honeywood i never see you but you put me in mind of poor  dick ah there was merit neglected for you and so true a friend we loved each other for thirty years and yet he never asked me to lend him a single farthing   honeyw pray what could induce him to commit so rash an action at last   croaker i dont know some people were malicious enough to say it was keeping company with me because we used to meet now and then and open our hearts to each other to be sure i loved to hear him talk and he loved to hear me talk poor dear dick he used to say that croaker rhimd to joker and so we used to laugh  poor dick going to cry   honeyw his fate affects me   croaker ay he grew sick of this miserable life where we do nothing but eat and grow hungry dress and undress get up and lie down while reason that should watch like a nurse by our side falls as fast asleep as we do   honeyw to say truth if we compare that part of life which is to come by that which we have past the prospect is hideous   croaker life at the greatest and best is but a froward child that must be humored and coaxd a little till it falls asleep and then all the care is over   honeyw very true sir nothing can exceed the vanity of our existence but the folly of our pursuits we wept when we came into the world and every day tells us why   croaker ah my dear friend it is a perfect satisfaction to be miserable with you my son leontine shall not lose the benefit of such fine conversation i will just step home for him i am willing to show him so much seriousness in one scarce older than himself  and what if i bring my last letter to the gazetteer on the increase and progress of earthquakes it will amuse us i promise you i there prove how the late earthquake is coming round to pay us another visit from london to lisbon from lisbon to the canary islands from the canary islands to palmyra from palmyra to constantinople and so from constantinople back to london again  exit honeyw poor croaker his situation deserves the utmost pity i shall scarce recover my spirits these three days sure to live upon such terms is worse than death itself and yet when i consider my own situation a broken fortune an hopeless passion friends in distress the wish but not the power to serve them  pausing and sighing   enter butler butler more company below sir mrs croaker and miss richland shall i show them up but they are showing up themselves  exit enter mrs croaker and miss richland miss rich youre always in such spirits   mrs croaker we have just come my dear honeywood from the auction there was the old deaf dowager as usual bidding like a fury against herself and then so curious in antique herself the most genuine piece of antiquity in the whole collection   honeyw excuse me ladies if some uneasiness from friendship makes me unfit to share in this good humor i know you will pardon me   mrs croaker i vow he seems as melancholy as if he had taken a dose of my husband this morning well if richland here can pardon you i must   miss rich you would seem to insinuate madam that i have particular reasons for being disposed to refuse it   mrs croaker whatever i insinuate my dear dont be so ready to wish an explanation   miss rich i own i should be sorry mr honeywoods long friendship and mine should be misunderstood   honeyw there is no answering for others madam but i hope you will never find me presuming to offer more than the most delicate friendship may readily allow   miss rich and i shall be prouder of such a tribute from you than the most passionate professions from others   honeyw my own sentimenrs madam friendship is a disinterested commerce between equals love an abject intercourse between tyrants and slaves   miss rich and without a compliment i know none more disinterested or more capable of friendship than mr honeywood   mrs croaker and indeed i know nobody that has more friends at least among the ladies miss fruzz miss odbody and miss winterbottom praise him in all companies as for miss biddy bundle she is his professed admirer   miss rich indeed an admirer i did not know sir you were such a favorite there but is she seriously so handsome is she the mighty thing talked of   honeyw the town madam seldom begins to praise a ladys beauty till she is beginning to lose it smiling   mrs croaker but she is resolved never to lose it it seems for as her natural face decays her skill improves in making the artificial one well nothing diverts me more than one of those fine old dressy things who thinks to conceal her age by every where exposing her person sticking herself up in the front of a sidebox trailing through a minuet at almacks and then in the public gardens looking for all the world like one of the painted ruins of the place   honeyw every age has its admirers ladies while you perhaps are trading among the warmer climates of youth there ought to be some to carry on an useful commerce in the frozen latitudes beyond fifty   miss rich but then the mortifications they must suffer before they can be fitted out for traffic i have seen one of them fret an whole morning at her hairdresser when all the fault was her face   honeyw and yet i will engage has carried that face at last to a very good market this good natured town madam has husbands like spectacles to fit every age from fifteen to fourscore   mrs croaker well youre a dear goodnatured creature but you know youre engaged with us this morning upon a stroling party i want to show olivia the town and the things i believe i shall have business for you for the whole day   honeyw i am sorry madam i have an appointment with mr croaker which it is impossible to put off   mrs croaker what with my husband then i am resolved to take no refusal nay i protest you must you know i never laugh so much as with you   honeyw why if i must i must i will swear you have put me into such spirits well do you find jest and i will find laugh i promise you well wait for the chariot in the next room  exeunt enter leontine and olivia leont there they go thoughtless and happy my dearest olivia what would i give to see you capable of sharing in their amusements and as cheerful as they are   olivia how my leontine how can i be cheerful when i have so many terrors to oppress me the fear of being detected by this family and the apprehensions of a censuring world when i must be detected    leont the world my love what can it say at worst it can only say that being compelled by a mercenary guardian to embrace a life you disliked you formed a resolution of flying with the man of your choice that you confided in his honor and took refuge in this house the only one where yours could remain without censure   olivia but consider leontine your disobedience and my indiscretion your being sent to france to bring home a sister and instead of a sister bringing home    leont one dearer than a thousand sisters one that i am convinced will be equally dear to the rest of the family when show comes to be known   olivia and that i fear will shortly be   leont impossible till we ourselves think proper to make the discovery my sister you know has been with her aunt at lions since she was a child and you find every creature in the family takes you for her   olivia but may not she write may not her aunt write   leont her aunt scarce ever writes and all my sisters letters are directed to me   olivia but will not your refusing miss richland for whom you know the old gentleman intends you create a suspicion   leont there there is my masterstroke i have resolved not to refuse her nay an hour hence i have consented to go with my father to make her an offer of my heart and fortune   olivia your heart and fortune   leont dont be alarmed my dearest can olivia think so meanly of my honor or my love as to suppose i could ever hope for happiness from any but her no my olivia neither the force nor permit me to add the delicacy of my passion leave any room to suspect me i only offer miss richland an heart i am convinced she will refuse as i am confident that without knowing it her affections are fixed upon mr honeywood   olivia mr honeywood you will excuse my apprehensions but when your merits come to be put in the balance    leont you view them with too much partiality however by making this offer i show a seeming compliance with my fathers commands and perhaps upon her refusal i may have his consent to choose for myself   olivia well i submit and yet my leontine i own i shall envy her even your pretended addresses i consider every look every expression of your esteem as due only to me this is folly perhaps i allow it but it is natural to suppose that merit which has made an impression on ones own heart may be powerful over that of another   leont dont my lifes treasure dont let us make imaginary evils when you know we have so many real ones to encounter at worst you know if miss richland should consent or my father refuse his pardon it can but end in a trip to scotland and    enter croaker croaker where have you been boy i have been seeking you my friend honeywood here has been saying such comfortable things ah he is an example indeed where is he i left him here   leont sir i believe you may see him and hear him too in the next room he is preparing to go out with the ladies   croaker good gracious can i believe my eyes or my ears i am struck dumb with his vivacity and stunned with the loudness of his laugh was there ever such a transformation a laugh behind the scenes croaker mimics it ha ha ha there it goes a plague take their balderdash yet i could expect nothing less when my precious wife was of the party on my conscience i believe she could spread an horselaugh through the pews of a tabernacle   leont since you find so many objections to a wife sir how can you be so earnest in recommending one to me   croaker i have told you and tell you again boy that miss richlands fortune must not go out of the family one may find comfort in the money whatever one does in the wife   leont but sir though in obedience to your desire i am ready to marry her it may be possible she has no inclination to me   croaker i will tell you once for all how it stands a good part of miss richlands large fortune consists in a claim upon government which my good friend mr le bronze assures me the treasury will allow one half of this she is to forfeit by her fathers will in case she refuses to marry you so if she rejects you we seize half her fortune if she accepts you we seize the whole and a fine girl into the bargain   leont but sir if you will but listen to reason    croaker come then produce your reasons i tell you i am fixed determined so now produce your reasons when i am determined i always listen to reason because it can then do no harm   leont you have alleged that a mutual choice was the first requisite in matrimonial happiness   croaker well and you have both of you a mutual choice she has her choice  to marry you or lose half her fortune and you have your choice  to marry her or pack out of doors without any fortune at all   leont an only son sir might expect more indulgence   croaker an only father sir might expect more obedience besides has not your sister here that never disobliged me in her life as good a right as you he is a sad dog livy my dear and would take all from you but he shall not i tell you he shall not for you shall have your share   olivia dear sir i wish you would be convinced that i can never b happy in any addition to my fortune which is taken from his   croaker well well its a good child so say no more but come with me and we shall see something that will give us a great deal of pleasure i promise you old ruggins the currycombmaker lying in state i am told he makes a very handsome corpse and becomes his coffin prodigiously he was an intimate friend of mine and these are friendly things we ought to do for each other  exeun end of the first act act the second scene croakers house miss richland garnet miss rich olivia not his sister olivia not leontines sister you amaze me   garnet no more his sister than i am i had it all from his own servant i can get any thing from that quarter   miss rich but how tell me again garnet   garnet why madam as i told you before instead of going to lions to bring home his sister who has been there with her aunt these ten years he never went further than paris there he saw and fell in love with this young lady by the bye of a prodigious family   miss rich and brought her home to my guardian as his daughter   garnet yes and daughter she will be if he dont consent to their marriage they talk of trying what a scotch parson can do   miss rich well i own they have deceived me  and so demurely as olivia carried it too  would you believe it garnet i told her all my secrets and yet the sly cheat concealed all this from me   garnet and upon my word madam i dont much blame her she was loath to trust one with her secrets that was so very bad at keeping her own   miss rich but to add to their deceit the young gentleman it seems pretends to make me serious proposals my guardian and he are to be here presently to open the affair in form you know i am to lose half my fortune if i refuse him   garnet yet what can you do for being as you are in love with mr honeywood madam    miss rich how idiot what do you mean in love with mr honeywood is this to provoke me   gar that is madam in friendship with him i meant nothing more than friendship as i hope to be married nothing more   miss rich well no more of this as to my guardian and his son they shall find me prepared to receive them i am resolved to accept their proposal with seeming pleasure to mortify them by compliance and so throw the refusal at last upon them   gar delicious and that will secure your whole fortune to yourself well who could have thought so innocent a face could cover so much cuteness   miss rich why girl i only oppose my prudence to their cunning and practice a lesson they have taught me against themselves   gar then youre likely not long to want employment for here they come and in close conference   enter croaker leontine leon excuse me sir if i seem to hesitate upon the point of putting the lady so important a question   croaker lord good sir moderate your fears youre so plaguey shy that one would think you had changed sexes i tell you we must have the half or the whole come let me see with what spirit you begin well why dont you eh what well then  i must it seems  miss richland my dear i believe you guess at our business an affair which my son here comes to open that nearly concerns your happiness   miss rich sir i should be ungrateful not to be pleased with any thing that comes recommended by you   croaker how boy could you desire a finer opening why dont you begin i say  to leont leont it is true madam my father madam has some intentions  hem  of explaining an affair  which  himself  can best explain madam   croaker yes my dear it comes entirely from my son it is all a request of his own madam and i will permit him to make the best of it   leont the whole affair is only this madam my father has a proposal to make which he insists none but himself shall deliver   croaker my mind misgives me the fellow will never be brought on aside in short madam you see before you one that loves you one whose whole happiness is all in you   miss rich i never had any doubts of your regard sir and i hope you can have none of my duty   croaker that is not the thing my little sweeting my love no no another guess lover than i there he stands madam his very looks declare the force of his passion  call up a look you dog but then had you seen him as i have weeping speaking soliloquies and blank verse sometimes melancholy and sometimes absent    miss rich i fear sir he is absent now or such a declaration would have come most properly from himself   croaker himself madam he would die before he could make such a confession and if he had not a channel for his passion through me it would ere now have drowned his understanding   miss rich i must grant sir there are attractions in modest diffidence above the force of words a silent address is the genuine eloquence of sincerity   croaker madam he has forgot to speak any other language silence is become his mother tongue   miss rich and it must be confessed sir it speaks very powerfully in his favor and yet i shall be thought too forward in making such a confession shall not i mr leontine   leont confusion my reserve will undo me but if modesty attracts her impudence may disgust her i will try aside dont imagine from my silence madam that i want a due sense of the honor and happiness intended me my father madam tells me your humble servant is not totally indifferent to you he admires you i adore you and when we come together upon my soul i believe we shall be the happiest couple in all st jamess   miss rich if i could flatter myself you thought as you speak sir    leont doubt my sincerity madam by your dear self i swear ask the brave if they desire glory ask cowards if they covet safety    croaker well well no more questions about it   leont ask the sick if they long for health ask misers if they love money ask    croaker ask a fool if he can talk nonsense what is come over the boy what signifies asking when there is not a soul to give you an answer if you would ask to the purpose ask this ladys consent to make you happy   miss rich why indeed sir his uncommon ardour almost compels me forces me to comply and yet i am afraid he will despise a conquest gained with too much ease wont you mr leontine   leont confusion aside o by no means madam by no means and yet madam you talked of force there is nothing i would avoid so much as compulsion in a thing of this kind no madam i will still be generous and leave you at liberty to refuse   croaker but i tell you sir the lady is not at liberty its a match you see she says nothing silence gives consent   leont but sir she talked of force consider sir the cruelty of constraining her inclinations   croaker but i say there is no cruelty dont you know blockhead that girls have always a roundabout way of saying yes before company so get you both gone together into the next room and hang him that interrupts the tender explanation get you gone i say i will not hear a word   leon but sir i must beg leave to insist    croaker get off you puppy or i will beg leave to insist upon knocking you down stupid whelp but i dont wonder the boy takes entirely after his mother  exeunt miss rich and leont enter mrs croaker mrs croaker mr croaker i bring you something my dear that i believe will make you smile   croaker i will hold you a guinea of that my dear   mrs croaker a letter and as i knew the hand i ventured to open it   croaker and how can you expect your breaking open my letters should give me pleasure   mrs croaker poo its from your sister at lions and contains good news read it   croaker what a frenchified cover is here that sister of mine has some good qualities but i could never teach her to fold a letter   mrs croaker fold a fiddlestick read what it contains   croaker reading dear nick an english gentleman of large fortune has for some time made private though honorable proposals to your daughter olivia they love each other tenderly and i find she has consented without letting any of the family know to crown his addresses as such good offers dont come every day your own good sense his large fortune and family considerations will induce you to forgive her  yours ever  rachel croaker  my daughter olivia privately contracted to a man of large fortune this is good news indeed oh my heart never foretold me of this and yet how slily the little baggage has carried it since she came home not a word on it to the old ones for the world yet i thought i saw something she wanted to conceal   mrs croaker well if they have concealed their amor they shall not conceal their wedding that shall be public i am resolved   croaker i tell thee woman the wedding is the most foolish part of the ceremony i can never get this woman to think of the more serious part of the nuptial engagement   mrs croaker what would you have me think of their funeral but come tell me my dear dont you owe more to me than you care to confess would you have ever been known to mr lofty who has undertaken miss richlands claim at the treasury but for me who was it first made him an acquaintance at lady shabbaroons route who got him to promise us his interest is not he a backstairs favorite one that can do what he pleases with those that do what they please is not he an acquaintance that all your groaning and lamentations could never have got us   croaker he is a man of importance i

lofty oh a modern we men of business despise the moderns and as for the ancients we have no time to read them poetry is a pretty thing enough for our wives and daughters but not for us why now here i stand that know nothing of books i say madam i know nothing of books and yet i believe upon a land carriage fishery a stamp act or a jaghire i can talk my two hours without feeling the want of them   mrs croaker the world is no stranger to mr loftys eminence in every capacity   lofty i vow to gad madam you make me blush i am nothing nothing nothing in the world a mere obscure gentleman to be sure indeed one or two of the present ministers are pleased to represent me as a formal man i know they are pleased to bespatter me at all their little dirty levees yet upon my soul i wonder what they see in me to treat me so measures not men have always been my mark and i vow by all that is honorable my resentment has never done the men as mere men any manner of harm  that is as mere men   mrs croaker what importance and yet what modesty   lofty oh if you talk of modesty madam there i own i am accessible to praise modesty is my foible it was so the duke of brentford used to say of me i love jack lofty he used to say no man has a finer knowledge of things quite a man of information and when he speaks upon his legs by the lord he is prodigious he scouts them and yet all men have their faults too much modesty is his says his grace   mrs croaker and yet i dare say you dont want assurance when you come to solicit for your friends   lofty o there indeed i am a bronze apropos i have just been mentioning miss richlands case to a certain personage we must name no names when i ask i am not to be put off madam no no i take my friend by the button a fine girl sir great justice in her case a friend of mine borough interest business must be done mr secretary i say mr secretary her business must be done sir that is my way madam   mrs croaker bless me you said all this to the secretary of state did you   lofty i did not say the secretary did i well curse it since you have found me out i will not deny it it was to the secretary   mrs croaker this was going to the fountain head at once not applying to the understrappers as mr honeywood would have had us   lofty honeywood he he he was indeed a fine solicitor i suppose you have heard what has just happened to him   mrs croaker poor dear man no accident i hope   lofty undone madam that is all his creditors have taken him into custody a prisoner in his own house   mrs croaker a prisoner in his own house how at this very time i am quite unhappy for him   lofty why so am i the man to be sure was immensely good natured but then i could never find that he had any thing in him   mrs croaker his manner to be sure was excessive harmless some indeed thought it a little dull for my part i always concealed my opinion   lofty it cannot be concealed madam the man was dull dull as the last new comedy a poor impracticable creature i tried once or twice to know if he was fit for business but he had scarce talents to be groomporter to an orange barrow   mrs croaker how differently does miss richland think of him for i believe with all his faults she loves him   lofty loves him does she you should cure her of that by all means let me see what if she were sent to him this instant in his present doleful situation my life for it that works her cure distress is a perfect antidote to love suppose we join her in the next room miss richland is a fine girl and has a fine fortune  two very fine things  and must not be thrown away upon my honor madam i have a regard for miss richland and rather than she should be thrown away i should think it no indignity to marry her myself  exeunt enter olivia and leontine leont and yet trust me olivia i had every reason to expect miss richlands refusal as i did every thing in my power to deserve it her indelicacy surprises me   olivia sure leontine there is nothing so indelicate in being sensible of your merit if so i fear i shall be the most guilty thing alive   leont but you mistake my dear the same attention i used to advance my merit with you i practiced to lessen it with her what more could i do   olivia let us now rather consider what is to be done we have both dissembled too long  i have always been ashamed  i am now quite weary of it sure i could never have undergone so much for any other but you   leont and you shall find my gratitude equal to your kindest compliance though our friends should totally forsake us olivia we can draw upon content for the desiciencies of fortune   olivia then why should we defer our scheme of humble happiness when it is now in our power i may be the favorite of your father it is true but can it ever be thought that his present kindness to a supposed child will continue to a known deceiver   leont i have many reasons to believe it will as his attachments are but few they are lasting his own marriage was a private one as ours may be besides i have sounded him already at a distance and find all his answers exactly to our wish nay by an expression or two that dropped from him i am induced to think he knows of this affair   olivia indeed but that would be an happiness too great to be expected   leont however it be i am certain you have power over him and am persuaded if you informed him of our situation that he would be disposed to pardon it   olivia you had equal expectations leontine from your last scheme with miss richland which you find has succeeded most wretchedly   leont and that is the best reason for trying another   olivia if it must be so i submit   leont as we could wish he comes this way now my dearest olivia be resolute i will just retire within hearing to come in at a proper time either to share your danger or confirm your victory  exit enter croaker croaker yes i must forgive her and yet not too easily neither it will be proper to keep up the decorums of resentment a little if it be only to impress her with an idea of my authority   olivia how i tremble to approach him  might i presume sir  if i interrupt you    croaker no child where i have an affection it is not a little thing can interrupt me affection gets over little things   olivia sir youre too kind i am sensible how ill i deserve this partiality yet heaven knows there is nothing i would not do to gain it   croaker and you have but too well succeeded you little hussy you with those endearing ways of yours on my conscience i could be brought to forgive any thing unless it were a very great offense indeed   olivia but mine is such an offense  when you know my guilt  yes you shall know it though i feel the greatest pain in the confession   croaker why then if it be so very great a pain you may spare yourself the trouble for i know every syllable of the matter before you begin   olivia indeed then i am undone   croaker ay miss you wanted to steal a match without letting me know it did you but i am not worth being consulted i suppose when there is to be a marriage in my own family no i am to have no hand in the disposal of my own children no i am nobody i am to be a mere article of family lumber a piece of cracked china to be stuck up in a corner   olivia dear sir nothing but the dread of your authority could induce us to conceal it from you   croaker no no my consequence is no more i am as little minded as a dead russian in winter just stuck up with a pipe in his mouth till there comes a thaw  it goes to my heart to vex her   olivia i was prepared sir for your anger and despaired of pardon even while i presumed to ask it but your severity shall never abate my affection as my punishment is but justice   croaker and yet you should not despair neither livy we ought to hope all for the best   olivia and do you permit me to hope sir can i ever expect to be forgiven but hope has too long deceived me   croaker why then child it shall not deceive you now for i forgive you this very moment i forgive you all and now you are indeed my daughter   olivia o transport this kindess overpowers me   croaker i was always against severity to our children we have been young and giddy ourselves and we cannot expect boys and girls to be old before their time   olivia what generosity but can you forget the many falsehoods the dissimulation    croaker you did indeed dissemble you urchin you but where is the girl that will not dissemble for an husband my wife and i had never been married if we had not dissembled a little before hand   olivia it shall be my future care never to put such generosity to a second trial and as for the partner of my offense and folly from his native honor and the just sense he has of his duty i can answer for him that    enter leontine leont permit him thus to answer for himself kneeling thus sir let me speak my gratitude for this unmerited forgiveness yes sir this even exceeds all your former tenderness i now can boast the most indulgent of fathers the life he gave compared to this was but a trifling blessing   croaker and good sir who sent for you with that fine tragedy face and flourishing manner i dont know what we have to do with your gratitude upon this occasion   leont how sir is it possible to be silent when so much obliged would you refuse me the pleasure of being grateful of adding my thanks to my olivias of sharing in the transports that you have thus occasioned   croaker lord sir we can be happy enough without your coming in to make up the party i dont know what is the matter with the boy all this day he has got into such a rhodomontade manner all the morning   leont but sir i that have so large a part in the benefit is it not my duty to show my joy is the being admitted to your favor so slight an obligation is the happiness of marrying my olivia so small a blessing   croaker marrying olivia marrying olivia marrying his own sister sure the boy is out of his senses his own sister   leont my sister   olivia sister how have i been mistaken  aside leont some cursed mistake in all this i find  aside croaker what does the booby mean or has he any meaning eh what do you mean you blockhead you   leont mean sir  why sir  only when my sister is to be married that i have the pleasure of marrying her sir that is of giving her away sir  i have made a point of it   croaker o is that all give her away you have made a point of it then you had as good make a point of first giving away yourself as i am going to prepare the writings between you and miss richland this very minute what a fuss is here about nothing why what is the matter now i thought i had made you at least as happy as you could wish   olivia o yes sir very happy   croaker do you foresee any thing child you look as if you did i think if any thing was to be foreseen i have as sharp a look out as another and yet i foresee nothing  exit leontine olivia olivia what can it mean   leont he knows something and yet for my life i cannot tell what   olivia it cannot be the connection between us i am pretty certain   leont whatever it be my dearest i am resolved to put it out of fortunes power to repeat our mortification i will haste and prepare for our journey to scotland this very evening my friend honeywood has promised me his advice and assistance i will go to him and repose our distresses on his friendly bosom and i know so much of his honest heart that if he cannot relieve our uneasinesses he will at least share them  exeunt end oe the second act act the third scene young honeywoods house bailiff honeywood follower bailiff looky sir i have arrested as good men as you in my time no disparagement of you neither men that would go forty guineas on a game of cribbage i challenge the town to show a man in more genteeler practice than myself   honeyw without all question mr i forget your name sir   bailiff how can you forget what you never knew he he he   honeyw may i beg leave to ask your name   bailiff yes you may   honeyw then pray sir what is your name sir   bailiff that i didnt promise to tell you he he he a joke breaks no bones as we say among us that practice the law   honeyw you may have reason for keeping it a secret perhaps   bailiff the law does nothing without reason i am ashamed to tell my name to no man sir if you can show cause as why upon a special capus that i should prove my name but come timothy twitch is my name and now you know my name what have you to say to that   honeyw nothing in the world good mr twitch but that i have a favor to ask that is all   bailiff ay favors are more easily asked than granted as we say among us that practice the law i have taken an oath against granting favors would you have me perjure myself   honeyw but my request will come recommended in so strong a manner as i believe you will have no scruple pulling out his purse the thing is only this i believe i shall be able to discharge this trifle in two or three days at farthest but as i would not have the affair known for the world i have thought of keeping you and your good friend here about me till the debt is discharged for which i shall be properly grateful   bailiff oh that is another maxum and altogether within my oath for certain if an honest man is to get any thing by a thing there is no reason why all things should not be done in civility   honeyw doubtless all trades must live mr twitch and yours is a necessary one gives him money   bailiff oh your honor i hope your honor takes nothing amiss as i does as i does nothing but my duty in so doing i am sure no man can say i ever give a gentleman that was a gentleman ill usage if i saw that a gentleman was a gentleman i have taken money not to see him for ten weeks together   honeyw tenderness is a virtue mr twitch   bailiff ay sir its a perfect treasure i love to see a gentleman with a tender heart i dont know but i think i have a tender heart myself if all that i have lost by my heart was put together it would make a  but no matter for that   honeyw dont account it lost mr twitch the ingratitude of the world can never deprive us of the conscious happiness of having acted with humanity ourselves   bailiff humanity sir is a jewel its better than gold i love humanity people may say that we in our way have no humanity but i will show you my humanity this moment there is my follower here little flanigan with a wife and four children a guinea or two would be more to him than twice as much to another now as i cannot show him any humanity myself i must beg leave you will do it for me   honeyw i assure you mr twitch yours is a most powerful recommendation giving money to the follower   bailiff sir youre a gentleman i see you know what to do with your money but to business we are to be with you here as your friends i suppose but set in case company comes  little flanigan here to be sure has a good face a very good face but then he is a little seedy as we say among us that practice the law not well in clothes smoke the pocket holes   honeyw well that shall be remedied without delay   enter servant servant sir miss richland is below   honeyw how unlucky detain her a moment we must improve my good friend little mr flanigans appearance first here let little mr flanigan have a suit of my clothes  quick  the brown and silver  do you hear   servant that your honor gave away to the begging gentleman that makes verses because it was as good as new   honeyw the white and gold then   servant that your honor i made bold to sell because it was good for nothing   honeyw well the first that comes to hand then the blue and gold i believe mr flanigan will look best in blue  exit flanigan bailiff rabbit me but little flanigan will look well in any thing ah if your honor knew that bit of flesh as well as i do you would be perfectly in love with him there is not a prettyer scout in the four counties after a shycock than he scents like a hound sticks like a weazle he was master of the ceremonies to the black queen of moroco when i took him to follow me heh ecod i think he looks so well that i dont care if i have a suit from the same place for myself   honeyw well well i hear the lady coming dear mr twitch i beg you will give your friend directions not to speak as for yourself i know you will say nothing without being directed   bailiff never you fear me i will show the lady that i have something to say for myself as well as another one man has one way of talking and another man has another that is all the difference between them   enter miss richland and her maid miss rich you will be surprised sir with this visit but you know i am yet to thank you for choosing my little library   honeyw thanks madam are unnecessary as it was i that was obliged by your commands chairs here two of my very good friends mr twitch and mr flanigan pray gentlemen sit without ceremony   miss rich who can these odd looking men be i fear it is as i was informed it must be so  aside bailiff after a pause pretty weather very pretty weather for the time of the year madam   follower very good circuit weather in the country   honeyw you officers are generally favorites among the ladies my friends madam have been upon very disagreeable duty i assure you the fair should in some measure recompense the toils of the brave   miss rich our officers do indeed deserve every favor the gentlemen are in the marine service i presume sir   honeyw why madam they do  occasionally serve in the fleet madam a dangerous service   miss rich i am told so and i own it has often surprised me that while we have had so many instances of bravery there we have had so few of wit at home to praise it   honeyw i grant madam that our poets have not written as our soldiers have fought but they have done all they could and hawke or amherst could do no more   miss rich i am quite displeased when i see a fine subject spoiled by a dull writer   honeyw we should not be so severe against dull writers madam it is ten to one but the dullest writer exceeds the most rigid french critic who presumes to despise him   follower damn the french the parle vous and all that belongs to them   miss rich sir   honeyw ha ha ha honest mr flanigan a true english officer madam he is not contented with beating the french but he will scold them too   miss rich yet mr honeywood this does not convince me but that severity in criticism is necessary it was our first adopting the severity of french taste that has brought them in turn to taste us   bailiff taste us by the lord madam they devour us give monseers but a taste and i will be damned but they come in for a bellyful   miss rich very extraordinary this   follower but very true what makes the bread rising the parle vous that devour us what makes the mutton fivepence a pound the parle vous that eat it up what makes the beer three pence halfpenny a pot    honeyw ah the vulgar rogues all will be out right gentlemen very right upon my word and quite to the purpose they draw a parallel madam between the mental taste and that of our senses we are injured as much by french severity in the one as by french rapacity in the other that is their meaning   miss rich though i dont see the force of the parallel yet i will own that we should sometimes pardon books as we do our friends that have now and then agreeable absurdities to recommend them   bailiff that is all my eye the king only can pardon as the law says for set in ase    honeyw i am quite of your opinion sir i see the the whole drift of your argument yes certainly our presuming to pardon any work is arrogating a power that belongs to another if all have power to condemn what writer can be free   bailiff by his habus corpus his habus corpus can set him free at any time for set in case    honeyw i am obliged to you sir for the hint if madam as my friend observes our laws are so careful of a gentlemans person sure we ought to be equally careful of his dearer part his fame   follower ay but if so be a mans nabbd you know    honeyw mr flanigan if you speak for ever you could not improve the last observation for my own part i think it conclusive   bailiff as for the matter of that mayhap    honeyw nay sir give me leave in this instance to be positive for where is the necessity of censuring works without genius which must shortly sink of themselves what is it but aiming our unnecessary blow against a victim already under the hands of justice   bailiff justice o by the eleven if you talk about justice i think i am at home there for in a course of law    honeyw my dear mr twitch i discern what you would be at perfectly and i believe the lady must be sensible of the art with which it is introduced i suppose you perceive the meaning madam of his course of law   miss rich i protest sir i do not i perceive only that you answer one gentleman before he has finished and the other before he has well begun   bailiff madam you are a gentlewoman and i will make the matter out this here question is about severity and justice and pardon and the like of they now to explain the thing    honeyw o curse your explanations  aside enter servant servant mr leontine sir below desires to speak with you upon earnest business   honeyw that is lucky aside dear madam you will excuse me and my good friends here sor a few minutes there are books madam to amuse you come gentlemen you know i make no ceremony with such friends after you sir excuse me well if i must but i know your natural politeness   bailiff before and behind you know   follower ay ay before and behind before and behind  exeunt honeywood bailiff and follower miss rich what can all this mean garnet   garnet mean madam why what should it mean but what mr lofty sent you here to see these people he calls officers are officers sure enough sheriffs officers bailiffs madam   miss rich ay it is certainly so well though his perplexities are far from giving me pleasure yet i own there is something very ridiculous in them and a just punishment for his dissimulation   garnet and so they are but i wonder madam that the lawyer you just employed to pay his debts and set him free has not done it by this time he ought at least to have been here before now but lawyers are always more ready to get a man into troubles than out of them   enter sir william sir will for miss richland to undertake setting him free i own was quite unexpected it has totally unhinged my schemes to reclaim him yet it gives me pleasure to find that among a number of worthless friendships he has made one acquisition of real value for there must be some softer passion on her side that prompts this generosity ha here before me i will endeavor to sound her affections madam as i am the person that have had some demands upon the gentleman of this house i hope you will excuse me if before i enlarged him i wanted to see yourself   miss rich the precaution was very unnecessary sir i suppose your wants were only such as my agent had power to satisfy   sir will partly madam but i was also willing you should be fully apprized of the character of the gentleman you intended to serve   miss rich it must come sir with a very ill grace from you to censure it after what you have done would look like malice and to speak favorably of a character you have oppressed would be impeaching your own and sure his tenderness his humanity his universal friendship may atone for many faults   sir will that friendship madam which is exerted in too wide a sphere become totally useless our bounty like a drop of water disappears when diffused too widely they who pretend most to this universal benevolence are either deceivers or dupes men who desire to cover their private ill nature by a pretended regard for all or men who reasoning themselves into false feelings are more earnest in pursuit of splendid than of useful virtues   miss rich i am surprised sir to hear one who has probably been a gainer by the folly of others so fevere in his censure of it   sir will whatever i may have gained by folly madam you see i am willing to prevent your losing by it   miss rich your cares for me sir are unnecessary i always suspect those services which are denied where they are wanted and offered perhaps in hopes of a refusal no sir my directions have been given and i insist upon their being complied with   sir will thou amiable woman i can no longer contain the expressions of my gratitude my pleasure you see before you one who has been equally careful of his interest one who has for some time been a concealed spectator of his follies and only punished in hopes to reclaim them  his uncle   miss rich sir william honeywood you amaze me how shall i conceal my confusion i fear sir you will think i have been too forward in my services i confess i    sir will dont make any apologies madam i only find myself unable to repay the obligation and yet i have been trying my interest of late to serve you having learnt madam that you had some demands upon government i have though unasked been your solicitor there   miss rich sir i am infinitely obliged to your intentions but my guardian has employed another gentleman who assures him of success   sir will who the important little man that visits here trust me madam he is quite contemptible among men in power and utterly unable to serve you mr loftys promises are much better known to people of fashion than his person i assure you   miss rich how have we been deceived as sure as can be here he comes   sir will does he remember i am to continue unknown my return to england has not as yet been made public with what impudence he enters   enter lofty lofty let the chariot  let my chariot drive off i will visit to his graces in a chair miss richland here before me punctual as usual to the calls of humanity i am very sorry madam things of this kind should happen especially to a man i have shown every where and carried amongst us as a particular acquaintance   miss rich i find sir you have the art of making the misfortunes of others your own   lofty my dear madam what can a private man like me do one man cannot do every thing and then i do so much in this way every day let me see something considerable might be done for him by subscription it could not fail if i carried the list i will undertake to set down a brace of dukes two dozen lords and half the lower house at my own peril   sir will and after all its more than probable sir he might reject the offer of such powerful patronage   lofty then madam what can we do you know i never make promises in truth i once or twice tried to do something with him in the way of business but as i often told his uncle sir william honeywood the man was utterly impracticable   sir will his uncle then that gentleman i suppose is a particular friend of yours   lofty meaning me sir  yes madam as i often said my dear sir william you are sensible i would do any thing as far as my poor interest goes to serve your family but what can be done there is no procuring first rate places for ninth rate abilities   miss rich i have heard of sir william honeywood he is abroad in employment he confided in your judgment i suppose   lofty why yes madam i believe sir william had some reason to confide in my judgment one little reason perhaps   miss rich pray sir what was it   lofty why madam but let it go no further it was i procured him his place   sir will did you sir   lofty either you or i sir   miss rich this mr lofty was very kind indeed   lofty i did love him to be sure he had some amusing qualities no man was fitter to be toastmaster to a club or had a better head   miss rich a better head   lofty ay at a bottle to be sure he was as dull as a choice spirit but hang it he was grateful very grateful and gratitude hides a multitude of faults   sir will he might have reason perhaps his place is pretty considerable i am told   lofty a trifle a mere trifle among us of business the truth is he wanted dignity to fill up a greater   sir will dignity of person do you mean sir i am told he is much about my size and figure sir   lofty ay tall enough for a marching regiment but then he wanted a something  a consequence of form  a kind of a  i believe the lady perceives my meaning   miss rich o perfectly you courtiers can do any thing i see   lofty my dear madam all this is but a mere exchange we do greater things for one another every day why as thus now let me suppose you the first lord of the treasury you have an employment in you that i want i have a place in me that you want do me here do you there interest of both sides few words flat done and done and its over   sir will a thought strikes me aside now you mention sir william honeywood madam and as he seems sir an acquaintance of yours you will be glad to hear he is arrived from italy i had it from a friend who knows him as well as he does me and you may depend on my information   lofty the devil he is if i had known that we should not have been quite so well acquainted aside   sir will he is certainly returned and as this gentleman is a friend of yours he can be of signal service to us by introducing me to him there are some papers relative to your affairs that require dispatch and his inspection   miss rich this gentleman mr lofty is a person employed in my affairs i know you will serve us   lofty my dear madam i live but to serve you sir william shall even wait upon him if you think proper to command it   sir will that would be quite unnecessary   lofty well we must introduce you then call upon me  let me see  ay in two days   sir will now or the opportunity will be lost for ever   lofty well if it must be now now let it be but damn it that is unfortunate my lord grigs cursed pensacola business comes on this very hour and i am engaged to attend  another time    sir will a short letter to sir william will do   lofty you shall have it yet in my opinion a letter is a very bad way of going to work face to face that is my way   sir will the letter sir will do quite as well   lofty zounds sir do you pretend to direct me direct me in the business of office do you know me sir who am i   miss rich dear mr lofty this request is not so much his as mine if my commands  but you despise my power   lofty delicate creature your commands could even control a debate at midnight to a power so constitutional i am all obedience and tranquillity he shall have a letter where is my secretary dubardieu and yet i protest i dont like this way of doing business i think if i spoke first to sir william  but you will have it so  exit with miss rich sir william alone sir will ha ha ha this too is one of my nephews hopeful associates o vanity thou constant deceiver how do all thy efforts to exalt serve but to sink us thy false colorings like those employed to heighten beauty only seem to mend that bloom which they contribute to destroy i am not displeased at this interview exposing this fellows impudence to the contempt it deserves may be of use to my design at least if he can reflect it will be of use to himself   enter jarvis sir will how now jarvis where is your master my nephew   jarvis at his wits end i believe he is scarce gotten out of one scrape but he is running his head into another   sir will how so   jarvis the house has but just been cleared of the bailiffs and now he is again engaging tooth and nail in assisting old croakers son to patch up a clandestine match with the young lady that passes in the house for his sister   sir will ever busy to serve others   jarvis ay any body but himself the young couple it seems are just setting out for scotland and he supplies them with money for the journey   sir will money how is he able to supply others who has scarce any for himself   jarvis why there it is he has no money that is true but then as he never said no to any request in his life he has given them a bill drawn by a friend of his upon a merchant in the city which i am to get changed for you must know that i am to go with them to scotland myself   sir will how   jarvis it seems the young gentleman is obliged to take a different road from his mistress as he is to call upon an uncle of his that lives out of the way in order to prepare a place for their reception when they return so they have borrowed me from my master as the properest person to attend the young lady down   sir will to the land of matrimony a pleasant journey jarvis   jarvis ay but i am only to have all the fatigues on it   sir will well it may be shorter less fatiguing than you imagine i know but too much of the young ladys family and connexions whom i have seen abroad i have also discovered that miss richland is not indifferent to my thoughtless nephew and he endeavors though i fear in vain to establish that connection but come the letter i wait for must be almost finished i will let you further into my intentions in the next room  exeunt end of the third act act the fourth scene croakers house lofty lofty well sure the devils in me of late for running my head into such defiles as nothing but a genius like my own could draw me from i was formerly contented to husband out my places and pensions with some degree of frugality but curse it of late i have given away the whole court register in less time than they could print the title page yet hang it why scruple a lie or two to come at a fine girl when i every day tell a thousand for nothing ha honeywood here before could miss richland have set him at liberty  enter honeywood mr honeywood i am glad to see you abroad again i find my concurrence was not necessary in your unfortunate affairs i had put things in a train to do your business but it is not for me to say what i intended doing   honeyw it was unfortunate indeed sir but what adds to my uneasiness is that while you seem to be acquainted with my misfortune i myself continue still a stranger to my benefactor   lofty how not know the friend that served you   honeyw cannot guess at the person   lofty enquire   honeyw i have but all i can learn is that he chooses to remain concealed and that all enquiry must be fruitless   lofty must be fruitless   honeyw absolutely fruitless   lofty sure of that   honyw very sure   lofty then i will be damned if you shall ever know it from me   honeyw how sir   lofty i suppose now mr honeywood you think my rentroll very considerable and that i have vast sums of money to throw away i know you do the world to be sure says such things of me   honeyw the world by what i learn is no stranger to your generosity but where does this tend   lofty to nothing nothing in the world the town to be sure when it makes such a thing as me the subject of conversation has asserted that i never yet patronized a man of merit   honeyw i have heard instances to the contrary even from yourself   lofty yes honeywood and there are instances to the contrary that you shall never hear from myself   honeyw ha dear sir permit me to ask you but one question   lofty sir ask me no questions i say sir ask me no questions i will be damned if i answer them   honeyw i will ask no further my friend my benefactor it is it must be here that i am indebted for freedom for honor yes thou worthiest of men from the beginning i suspected it but was afraid to return thanks which if undeserved might seem reproaches   lofty i protest i dont understand all this mr honeywood you treat me very cavalierly i do assure you sir  blood sir cannot a man be permitted to enjoy the luxury of his own feelings without all this parade   honeyw nay do not attempt to conceal an action that adds to your honor your looks your air your manner all confess it   lofty confess it sir torture itself sir shall never bring me to confess it mr honeywood i have admitted you upon terms of friendship dont let us fall out make me happy and let this be buried in oblivion you know i hate ostentation you know i do come come honeywood you know i always loved to be a friend and not a patron i beg this may make no kind of distance between us come come you and i must be more familiar  indeed we must   honeyw heavens can i ever repay such friendship is there any way thou best of men can i ever return the

have opened the affair to her for me between ourselves i think she likes me i am not apt to boast but i think she does   honeyw indeed but do you know the person you apply to   lofty yes i know you are her friend and mine that is enough to you therefore i commit the success of my passion i will say no more let friendship do the rest i have only to add that if at any time my little interest can be of service  but hang it i will make no promises  you know my interest is yours at any time no apologies my friend i will not be answered it shall be so  exit honeyw open generous unsuspecting man he little thinks that i love her too and with such an ardent passion  but then it was ever but a vain and hopeless one my torment my persecution what shall i do love friendship a hopeless passion a deserving friend love that has been my tormentor a friend that has perhaps distressed himself to serve me it shall be so yes i will discard the fondling hope from my bosom and exert all my influence in his favor and yet to see her in the possession of another  insupportable but then to betray a generous trusty friend  worse worse yes i am resolved let me but be the instrument of their happiness

gunpowder they are preparing to blow me up into the clouds murder we shall be all burnt in our beds we shall be all burnt in our beds   enter miss richland miss rich lord sir what is the matter   croaker murders the matter we shall be a blown up in our beds before morning   miss rich i hope not sir   croaker what signifies what you hope madam when i have a certificate of it here in my hand will nothing alarm my family sleeping and eating sleeping and eating is the only work from morning till night in my house my insensible crew could sleep though rocked by an earthquake and fry beef steaks at a volcano   miss rich but sir you have alarmed them so often already we have nothing but earthquakes famines plagues and mad dogs from years end to years end you remember sir it is not above a month ago you assured us of a conspiracy among the bakers to poison us in our bread and so kept the whole family a week upon potatoes   croaker and potatoes were too good for them but why do i stand talking here with a girl when i should be facing the enemy without here john nicodemus search the house look into the cellars to see if there be any combustibles below and above in the apartments that no matches be thrown in at the windows let all the fires be put out and let the engine be drawn out in the yard to play upon the house in case of necessity  exit miss richland alone miss rich what can he mean by all this yet why should i enquire when he alarms us in this manner almost every day but honeywood has desired an interview with me in private what can he mean or rather what means this palpitation at his approach it is the first time he ever showed any thing in his conduct that seemed particular sure he cannot mean to  but he is here   enter honeywood honeyw i presumed to solicit this interview madam before i left town to be permitted    miss rich indeed leaving town sir    honeyw yes madam perhaps the kingdom i have presumed i say to desire the favor of this interview  in order to disclose something which our long friendship prompts and yet my fears    miss rich his fears what are his fears to mine  aside we have indeed been long acquainted sir very long if i remember our first meeting was at the french ambassadors  do you recollect how you were pleased to rally me upon my complexion there   honeyw perfectly madam i presumed to reprove you for painting but your warmer blushes soon convinced the company that the coloring was all from nature   miss rich and yet you only meant it in your good natured way to make me pay a compliment to myself in the same manner you danced that night with the most awkward woman in company because you saw nobody else would take her out   honeyw yes and was rewarded the next night by dancing with the finest woman in company that every body wished to take out   miss rich well sir if you thought so then i fear your judgment has since corrected the errors of a first impression we generally show to most advantage at first our sex are like poor tradesmen that put all their best goods to be seen at the windows   honeyw the first impression madam did indeed deceive me i expected to find a woman with all the faults of conscious flattered beauty i expected to find her vain and insolent but every day has since taught me that it is possible to possess sense without pride and beauty without affectation   miss rich this sir is a style very unusual with mr honeywood and i should be glad to know why he thus attempts to increase that vanity which his own lessons taught me to despise   honeyw i ask pardon madam yet from our long friendship i presumed i might have some right to offer without offense what you may refuse without offending   miss rich sir i beg you would reflect though i fear i shall scarce have any power to refuse a request of yours yet you may be precipitate consider sir   honeyw i own my rashness but as i plead the cause of friendship of one who loves  dont be alarmed madam  who loves you with the most ardent passion whose whole happiness is placed in you    miss rich i fear sir i shall never find whom you mean by this description of him   honeyw ah madam it but too plainly points him out though he should be too humble himself to urge his pretensions or you too modest to understand them   miss rich well it would be affectation any longer to pretend ignorance and i will own sir i have long been prejudiced in his favor it was but natural to wish to make his heart mine as he seemed himself ignorant of its value   honeyw i see she always loved him aside i find madam youre already sensible of his worth his passion how happy is my friend to be the favorite of one with such sense to distinguish merit and such beauty to reward it   miss rich your friend sir what friend   honeyw my best friend  my friend mr lofty madam   miss rich he sir   honeyw yes he madam he is indeed what your warmest wishes might have formed him and to his other qualities he adds that of the most passionate regard for you   miss rich amazement  no more of this i beg you sir   honeyw i see your confusion madam and know how to interpret it and since i so plainly read the language of your heart shall i make my friend happy by communicating your sentiments   miss rich by no means   honeyw excuse me i must i know you desire it   miss rich mr honeywood let me tell you that you wrong my sentiments and yourself when i first applied to your friendship i expected advice and assistance but now sir i see that it is vain to expect happiness from him who has been so bad an oeconomist of his own and that i must disclaim his friendship who ceases to be a friend to himself  exit honeyw how is this she has confessed she loved him and yet she seemed to part in displeasure can i have done any thing to reproach myself with no i believe not yet after all these things should not be done by a third person i should have spared her confusion my friendship carried me a little too far   enter croaker with the letter in his hand and mrs croaker mrs croaker ha ha ha and so my dear it is your supreme wish that i should be quite wretched upon this occasion ha ha   croaker mimicking ha ha ha and so my dear it is your supreme pleasure to give me no better consolation   mrs croaker positively my dear what is this incendiary stuff and trumpery to me our house may travel through the air like the house of loretto for ought i care if i am to be miserable in it   croaker would to heaven it were converted into an house of correction for your benefit have we not every thing to alarm us perhaps this very moment the tragedy is beginning   mrs croaker then let us reserve our distress till the rising of the curtain or give them the money they want and have done with them   croaker give them my money  and pray what right have they to my money   mrs croaker and pray what right then have you to my good humor   croaker and so your good humor advises me to part with my money why then to tell your good humor a piece of my mind i would sooner part with my wife here is mr honeywood see what he will say to it my dear honeywood look at this incendiary letter dropped at my door it will freeze you with terror and yet lovey here can read it  can read it and laugh   mrs croaker yes and so will mr honeywood   croaker if he does i will suffer to be hanged the next minute in the rogues place that is all   mrs croaker speak mr honeywood is there any thing more foolish than my husbands fright upon this occasion   honeyw it would not become me to decide madam but doubtless the greatness of his terrors now will but invite them to renew their villainy another time   mrs croaker i told you he would be of my opinion   croaker how sir do you maintain that i should lie down under such an injury and show neither by my tears or complaints that i have something of the spirit of a man in me   honeyw pardon me sir you ought to make the loudest complaints if you desire redress the surest way to have redress is to be earnest in the pursuit of it   croaker ay whose opinion is he of now   mrs croaker but dont you think that laughing off our fears is the best way   honeyw what is the best madam few can say but i will maintain it to be a very wise way   croaker but we are talking of the best surely the best way is to face the enemy in the field and not wait till he plunders us in our very very bedchamber   honeyw why sir as to the best that  that is a very wise way too   mrs croaker but can any thing be more absurd than to double our distresses by our apprehensions and put it in the power of every low fellow that can scrawl ten words of wretched spelling to torment us   honeyw without doubt nothing more absurd   croaker how would it not be more absurd to despise the rattle till we are bit by the snake   honeyw without doubt perfectly absurd   croaker then you are of my opinion   honeyw entirely   mrs croaker and you reject mine   honeyw heavens forbid madam no sure no reasoning can be more just than yours we ought certainly to dsepise malice if we cannot oppose it and not make the incendiarys pen as fatal to our repose as the highwaymans pistol   mrs croaker o then you think i am quite right   honeyw perfectly right   croaker a plague of plagues we cannot be both right i ought to be sorry or i ought to be glad my hat must be on my head or my hat must be off   mrs croaker certainly in two opposite opinions if one be perfectly reasonable the other cannot be perfectly right   honeyw and why may not both be right madam mr croaker in earnestly seeking redress and you in waiting the event with good humor pray let me see the letter again i have it this letter requires twenty guineas to be left at the bar of the talbot inn if it be indeed an incendiary letter what if you and i sir go there and when the writer comes to be paid his expected booty seize him   croaker my dear friend its the very thing the very thing while i walk by the door you shall plant yourself in ambush near the bar burst out upon the miscreant like a masqued battery extort a confession at once and so hang him up by surprise   honeyw yes but i would not choose to exercise too much severity it is my maxim sir that crimes generally punish themselves   croaker well but we may upbraid him a little i suppose ironically   honeyw ay but not punish him too rigidly   croaker well well leave that to my own benevolence   honeyw well i do but remember that universal benevolence is the first law of nature  exeunt honeywood and mrs croaker croaker yes and my universal benevolence will hang the dog if he had as many necks as a hydra   end of the fourth act act the fifth scene an inn enter olivia jarvis olivia well we have got safe to the inn however now if the postchaise were ready    jarvis the horses are just finishing their oats and as they are not going to be married they choose to take their own time   olivia you are for ever giving wrong motives to my impatience   jarvis be as impatient as you will the horses must take their own time besides you dont consider we have got no answer from our fellow traveller yet if we hear nothing from mr leontine we have only one way left

little couple set off from this two days ago for the same place the gentleman for a tailor was to be sure as fine a spoken tailor as ever blew froth from a full pot and the young lady so bashful it was near half an hour before we could get her to finish a pint of rasberry between us   olivia but this gentleman and i are not going to be married i assure you   landlady may be not that is no business of mine for certain scotch marriages seldom turn out there was of my own knowledge miss macfag that married her fathers footman  alackaday she and her husband soon parted and now keep separate cellars in hedgelane   olivia a very pretty picture of what lies before me  aside enter leontine leont my dear olivia my anxiety till you were out of danger was too great to be resisted i could not help coming to see you set out though it exposes us to a discovery   olivia may every thing you do prove as fortunate indeed leontine we have been most cruelly disappointed mr honeywoods bill upon the city has it seems been protested and we have been utterly at a loss how to proceed   leont how an offer of his own too sure he could not mean to deceive us   olivia depend upon his sincerity he only mistook the desire for the power of serving us but let us think no more of it i believe the postchaise is ready by this   landlady not quite yet and begging your ladyships pardon i dont think your ladyship quite ready for the postchaise the north road is a cold place madam i have a drop in the house of as pretty rasberry as ever was tipped over tongue just a thimble full to keep

be seen myself   landlady that shall be done wha solomon are you all dead there wha solomon i say  exit bawling olivia well i dread lest an expedition begun in fear should end in repentance  every moment we stay increases our danger and adds to my apprehensions   leont there is no danger trust me my dear there can be none if honeywood has acted with honor and kept my father as he promised in employment till we are out of danger nothing can interrupt our journey   olivia i have no doubt of mr honeywoods sincerity and even his desires to serve us my fears are from your fathers suspicions a mind so disposed to be alarmed without a cause will be but too ready when there is a reason   leont why let him when we are out of his power but believe me olivia you have no great reason to dread his resentment his repining temper as it does no manner of injury to himself so will it never do harm to others he only frets to keep himself employed and scolds for his private amusement   olivia i dont know that but i am sure on some occasions it makes him look most shockingly   croaker discovering himself how does he look now  how does he look now   olivia ah   leont undone   croaker how do i look now sir i am your very humble servant madam i am yours what you are going off are you then first if you please take a word or two from me with you before you go tell me first where you are going and

information from you puppy and you too good madam what answer have you got eh a cry without stop him i think i heard a noise my friend honeywood without  has he seized the incendiary ah no for now i heard no more on it   leont honeywood without then sir it was mr honeywood that directed you hither   croaker no sir it was mr honeywood conducted me hither   leont is it possible   croaker possible why he is in the house now sir more anxious about me than my own son sir   leont then sir he is a villian   croaker how sirrah a villian because he takes most care of your father i will not bear it i tell you i will not bear it honeywood is a friend to the family and i will have him treated as such   leont i shall study to repay his friendship as it deserves   croaker ah rogue if you knew how earnestly he entered into my griefs and pointed out the means to detect them you would love him as i do a cry without stop him fire and fury they have seized the incendiary they have the villian the incendiary in view stop him stop an incendiary a murderer stop him  exit olivia oh my terrors what can this new tumult mean   leont some new mark i suppose of mr honeywoods sincerity but we shall have satisfaction he shall give me instant satissaction   olivia it must not be my leontine if you value my esteem or my happiness whatever be our fate let us not add guilt to our misfortunes  consider that our innocence will shortly be all we have left us you must forgive him   leont forgive him has he not in every instance betrayed us forced me to borrow money from him which appears a mere trick

you sir i know you   honeyw why wont you hear me by all that is just i knew not    leont hear you sir to what purpose i now see through all your low arts your ever complying with every opinion your never refusing any request your friendship as common as a prostitutes favors and as fallacious all these sir have long been contemptible to the world and are now perfectly so to me   honeyw ha contemptible to the world that reaches me aside   leont all the seeming sincerity of your professions i now find were only allurements to betray and all your seeming regret for their consequences only calculated to cover the cowardice of your heart draw villain   enter croaker out of breath croaker where is the villain where is the incendiary seizing the postboy hold him fast the dog he has the

see the whole affair my son is either married or going to be so to this lady whom he imposed upon me as his sister ay certainly so and yet i dont find it afflicts me so much as one might think there is the advantage of fretting away our misfortunes beforehand we never feel them when they come   enter miss richland and sir william sir will but how do you know madam that my nephew intends setting off from this place   miss rich my maid assured me he was come to this inn and my own knowledge of his intending to leave the kingdom suggested the rest but what do i see my guardian here before us

miss rich but with whom   croaker with greater fools than myself   miss rich explain   croaker why mr honeywood brought me here to do nothing now i am here and my son is going to be married to i dont

more than the man in the moon   sir will then sir i can inform you and though a stranger yet you shall find me a friend to your family it will be enough at present to assure you that both in point of birth and fortune the young lady is at least your sons equal being left by her father sir james woodville    croaker sir james woodville what of the west   sir will being left by him i say to the care

cannot find out half the goodness of it   lofty you cannot ha ha   croaker no for the soul of me i think it was as confounded a bad answer as ever was sent from one private gentleman to another   lofty and so you cannot find out the force of the message why i was in the house at that very time ha ha it was i that sent that very answer to my own letter ha ha   croaker indeed how why   lofty in one word things between sir william and me must be behind the curtain a party has many eyes he sides with lord buzzard i side with sir gilbert goose so that unriddles the mystery   croaker and so it

suspects who am i i say who am i   sir will since sir youre so pressing for an answer i will tell you who you are a gentleman as well acquainted with politics as with men in power as well acquainted with persons of fashion as with modesty with lords of the treasury as with truth and with all as you are with sir william honeywood i am sir william honeywood  discovering his ensigns of the bath croaker sir william honeywood   honeyw astonishment my uncle  aside lofty so then my confounded genius has been all this time only leading me up to the garret in order to fling me out of the window   croaker what mr importance and are these your works suspect you you who have been dreaded by the inns and outs you who have had your hand to addresses and your head stuck up in printshops if your were served right you should have your head stuck up in the pillory   lofty ay stick it where you will for by the lord it cuts but a very poor figure where it sticks at present   sir will well mr croaker i hope you now see how incapable this gentleman is of serving you and how little miss richland has to expect from his influence   croaker ay sir too well i see it and i cannot but say i have had some boding of it these ten days so i am resolved since my son has placed his affections on a lady of moderate fortune to be satisfied with his choice and not run the hazard of another mr lofty in helping him to a better   sir will i approve your resolution and here they come to receive a confirmation of your pardon and consent   enter mrs croaker jarvis leontine olivia mrs croaker where is my husband come come lovely you must forgive them jarvis here has been to tell me the whole affair and i say you must forgive them our own was a stolen match you know my dear and we never had any reason to repent of it   croaker i wish we could both say so however this gentleman sir william honeywood has been beforehand with you in obtaining their pardon so if the two poor fools have a mind to marry i think we can tack them together without crossing the tweed for it  joining their hands leont how blessed and unexpected what what can we say to such goodness but our future obedience shall be the best reply and as for this gentleman to whom we owe    sir will excuse me sir if i interrupt your thanks as i have here an interest that calls me turning to honeywood yes sir you are surprised to see me and i own that a desire of correcting your follies led me hither i saw with indignation the errors of a mind that only sought applause from others that easiness of disposition which though inclined to the right had not courage to condemn the wrong i saw with regret those splendid errors that still took name from some neighboring duty your charity that was but injustice your benevolence that was but weakness and your friendship but credulity i saw with regret great talents and extensive learning only employed to add sprightliness to error and increase your perplexities i saw your mind with a thousand natural charms but the greatness of its beauty served only to heighten my pity for its prostitution   honeyw cease to upbraid me sir i have for some time but too strongly felt the justice of your repoaches but there is one way still left me yes sir i have determined this very hour to quit for ever a place where i have made myself the voluntary slave of all and to seek among strangers that fortitude which may give strength to the mind and marshal all its diffipated virtues yet ere i depart permit me to solicit favor for this gentleman who notwithstanding what has happened has laid me under the most signal obligations mr lofty    lofty mr honeywood i am resolved upon a reformation as well as you i now begin to find that the man who first invented the art of speaking truth was a much cunninger fellow than i thought him and to prove that i design to speak truth for the future i must now assure you that you owe your late enlargement to another as upon my soul i had no hand in the matter so now if any of the company has a mind for preferment he may take my place i am determined to resign  exit honeyw how have i been deceived   sir will no sir you have been obliged to a kinder fairer friend for that favor to miss richland would she complete our joy and make the man she has honored by her friendship happy in her love i should then forget all and be as blessed as the welfare of my dearest kinsman can make me   miss rich after what is past it would be but affectation to pretend to indifference yes i will own an attachment which i find was more than friendship and if my entreaties cannot alter his resolution to quit the country i will even try if my hand has not power to detain him  giving her hand honeyw heavens how can i have deserved all this how express my happiness my gratitude a moment like this overpays an age of apprehension   croaker well now i see content in every face but heaven send we be all better this day three months   sir will henceforth nephew learn to respect yourself he who seeks only for applause from without has all his happiness in anothers keeping   honeyw yes sir i now too plainly perceive my errors my vanity in attempting to please all by fearing to offend any my meanness in approving folly lest fools should disapprove henceforth therefore it shall be my study to reserve my pity for real distress my friendship for true merit and my love for her who first taught me what it is to be happy   finis epilogue spoken by mrs bulkley as puffing quacks some caitiff wretch procure to swear the pill or drop has wrought a cure

has gone about and teased each rhyming friend to help him out an epilogue things cannot go on without it it could not fail would you but set about it young man cries one a bard laid up in clover alas

roses no no i have other contests to maintain tonight i head our troops at warwick lane go ask your manager  who me your pardon those things are not our fort at covent garden our authors friends thus placed at happy distance gives him good words indeed but no assistance as some unhappy wight at some new play at the pit door stands elbowing away while often with many a smile and many a shrug he eyes the center where his friends sit snug his simpering friends with pleasure in their eyes sink as he sinks and as he rises rise he nods they nod he cringes they grimace but not a soul will budge to give him place since then unhelpd our bard must now conform to bide the pelting of this pittiless storm blame where you must be candid where you can and view with favor the goodnatured man
