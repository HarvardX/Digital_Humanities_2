a true account of the design and advantages of the south sea trade with answers to all the objections raised against it a list of the commodities proper for that trade and the progress of the subscription toward the south sea company  london printed and sold by j morphew near stationers hall      price six pence  a true account of the sovthsea trade etc great debts of the nation it is but too notorious that the debts of the nation which at her majestys happy accession to the throne were very great instead of being lessened were rather accumulated to an immense degree when this present parliament began their first session  necessity to satisfy them to restore public credit without invidiously tracing up this evil to its causes either primary or subordinate it must be agreed on all hands that there lay a duty incumbent on the parliament and ministry to apply to it a speedy remedy without which public credit must have had such a fall as might have drawn after it if not the ruin of the state at least of a vast number of private persons  difficulties to do it during the war when a man seriously considered that the nation has for near twenty years sustained the weight of two burdensome expensive wars the second of which is yet unfinished and must of necessity be carried on with the utmost vigor and reflected besides that some of the best old funds were clogged with mortgages and anticipations and that some new ones had proved deficient there appeared insuperable difficulties in satisfying public debts removed by the ministry and parliament but the wisdom and skill of the ministry and the honesty of the parliament have surmounted all obstacles  the first step they made was like able physicians to probe the wound and inform themselves of all the circumstances of the evil they undertook to cure  having by this means come to a perfect knowledge of the debts of the nation and found that they amounted to about nine millions sterling which twas altogether impossible to discharge whilst the war lasted provision made for the payment of an interest on all public debit they made however provision for the payment of the interest at the rate of six per cent for ever redeemable by parliament which considering the goodness of the security and the exemption of public taxes may in time prove more advantageous to the respective creditors than the actual payment of the capital sum  advantage allowed to the proprietors of those debts by incorporating them to carry on a trade to the southseas besides this provision for the interest at six per cent of all the national debts the parliament readily gave into a project formed with great wisdom and public spirit by the prime minister for incorporating the proprietors of the said debts to carry on a trade to the southseas whereby a further advantage will in all probibility accrue to the said proprietors and through their means to the whole nation  we have hitherto made war for honors sake for we may here observe that hitherto we seem to have been fighting like knighterrants for honors sake and to redress public grievances without any regard to our private interest thus instead of making a good use either of the necessities and streights of the house of austria or of the misfortunes of the common enemy as the duke of savoy in the first case and the dutch in the second have wisely done we have even neglected the pursuit of those advantageous conditions on which we entered into the grand alliance viz that we should remain masters of such as we should possess our selves of in the west indies during the course of the war to be undertaken for the recovery of the spanish dominions  on the other hand it is melancholy to reflect that france notwithstanding all the difficulties she has struggled with notwithstanding those repeated disgraces that have attended her arms and given such terrible shocks to her power has yet got a handle to compass her main design viz the engrossing all the wealth of the west indies which if not prevented will not only repair all her former losses but enable her to arrive at universal empire in europe  settlements of the french in america all the world knows that upon occasion of taking possession of oldspain for king philip and other specious pretenses the french took also possession of great part of newspain pretending to put it into a posture of defense which indeed they have done but too well having in particular built a strong fort at calo that secures the entrance to the wealthy city of lima and they have improved this possession to the infinite advantage of france in an open trade to the spanish west indies directly a thing they never attempted before  at which the spaniards were uneasy the spaniards could not without jealousy and uneasiness see the increase of the french trade and power in america so that at last the chamber of commerce in sevil made earnest application to king philip to put a stop to it that prince represented to his grandfather the absolute necessity of yielding to the importunities of the spanish merchants backed by the powerful solicitations of the nobility but the french king who was resolved not to abandon the trade to america contented himself with causing it to be publicly declared in spain that his subjects should be recalled from the spanish west indies and that the trade thither should return to its old proper channel and at the same time contrary to this declaration that politic monarch connived at if not directed the sending of several ships more than usual to the southseas with cannon mortars arms ammunition officers soldiers and ingeniers to put the several ports of peru and chili in a posture of defense in order to keep possession of them by force in case the spaniards should insist on the removing the french from their settlements on that coast  but succeeding events prevented the further importunities of the spaniards on that head and rather favored the designs of the court of france who made a very politic use of king philips misfortunes for the spanish army being routed at almenara and soon after totally defeated near saragossa upon the application the grandees of spain made to the french king for immediate assistance it was required from them that they should give their solemn consent to the new treaty of alliance then agitating between the two crowns whereby very advantageous concessions were made to the french in the west indies which through the desperate condition of their affairs the grandees were obliged to agree to by this treaty the french retain several forts and fortifications and being planted over the whole kingdom of chili they have at this time several ships of force trading in those seas which come home with rich cargoes from at least  0000 to  00000 l ster in silver  by this means the french have laid a foundation not only to keep oldspain in a perpetual dependence upon them by depriving them of that commerce in which their riches and subsistence mainly consist but also if not speedily prevented to supplant all the rest of the world in the beneficial trade to old and newspain and to increase the wealth and power of france to such a degree as which i hinted before in process of time to put that ambitious crown in a condition to give laws to europe and to revive her lately baffled project of an universal monarchy it is certain at least that as the trade to the spanish west indies is the present support of our enemies so consequently as long as they preserve that trade there is little possibility of bringing this necessary but expensive war to a safe and honorable conclusion  the french must be removed from the west indies we may therefore lay down this political axiom or maxim that the french must be removed from their settlements in the spanish west indies as the most effectual means both to procure a lasting peace and to settle the grand trade and wealth of europe on a due balance  the spaniards wish to do it but cannot therefore we must undertake it though the spaniards have it undoubtedly in their wishes yet it is beyond dispute that they are not like ever to have it in their power to drive the french out of southamerica and as next to the spaniards we are the most concerned in that undertaking so we ought to exert our utmost power to accomplish it  this was the main design in eresting the south sea company upon this wise consideration it was that the ministry and parliament thought fit to incorporate the proprietors of the armydebentures navybills deficienttallies and other public debts to carry on a trade to the southseas which corporation when formed and regulated will have the largest stock of any tradingcompany in the whole world and therefore will be best able with a small contribution of each proprietor the concurrent assistance of the national shipping and landforces and other advantages that shall be specified in their charter to dislodge the french from the spanish west indies or at least to make settlements there and carry on a trade most benefical to the said corporation and to the whole british nation  this undertaking no new project it rather adds to than derogates from the honor and praise due to the great genius who brought this undertaking so near execution to observe that the vast advantages that will attend its success are so obvious that a project not unlike this was formed above fourscore years ago as appears by a remarkable speech made by sir benjamin rudyerd at a committee of the whole house of commons in the parliament    jac   about a westindiaassociation which was to the effect following sir benjamin rudyerds speech at a committee of the whole house of commons    jac   anno      sir dudley digs i do profess that as my affection my reason and my judgment go strongly with the scope and drift of this proposition so shall a good part of my poor fortune when it comes to execution  for to my understanding there was never propounded in parliament a design more proper for this kingdom nor of more pregnant advantage to it whether we consider the nature of our situation or the quality of our enemys forces  as we are an island it concerns our very being to have store of ships to defend us and also our wellbeing by their trade to enrich us  this association for the west indies when it shall be regulated and established by act of parliament and thereby secured from the violence and injury of any intruding hand will certainly give many men encouragement and confidence voluntarily to bring in large and liberal contributions toward so noble so profitable an enterprise so that in short time we shall see many new ships built many brave men employed and enabled for the service of their country none of this money shall be carried out of the kingdom but laid out for shipping which is the defense of it and bestowed upon our own men who must be fed and maintained though they stay at home for this we shall reap the fruit of whatsoever benefit plantation traffic or purchase can procure us besides honor and security  now let us a little consider the enemy we are to encounter the king of whatever was then said of the king of spain may in the main be now applied to the french king spain they are not his great territories which make him so powerful and so troublesome to all christendom for it is very well known that spain it self is but weak in men and barren of natural commodities as for his other territories they lie divided and asunder which is a weakness in it self besides they are held by force and maintained at an extraordinary charge insomuch as although he be a great king yet he is like that giant who was said to have a hundred hands but he had  0 bellies to feed so that ratably he had no more hands than another man  no sir they are his mines in the west indies which minister fuel to feed his vast ambitious desire of universal monarchy it is the money he has from thence which makes him able to levy and pay soldiers in all places and to keep an army continually on foot ready to invade and endanger his neighbors  so that we have no other way but to endeavor to cut him off at root and seek to impeach or to supplant him in the west indies by part of which course that famous queen of most glorious memory had heretofore almost brought him on his knees and this our undertaking if it please god to bless it must needs effect it sooner and quicker the whole body of the kingdom being united and concurring in a perpetual supply to this action so that he will have no free time given him to rest  moreover this will be a means not only to save but to fill his majestys coffers enabling the people to give him liberally and often the kings ships will have little to do but to guard the coasts for the seawar will chiefly be made at the charge of the subject thus sir dudley digs i doubt not but that in a short time both king and people shall be safe at home and feared abroad to conclude i shall be very glad to hear any man make objections against this design so that he do it with an intention to retine and perfect the work but if any shall speak against it with a mind to hinder and destroy it i must entreat him to pardon me if i do scarce think him to be a good englishman    the project of a south sea trade laid before king william about the middle of king williams reign a project of much the same nature as this was also laid before his majesty who highly approved of it and would have pursued it had he not been diverted from it either by the short and selfinterested views of some persons about him or by the contradictions he met with in most of his publickspirited undertakings however being informed by father hennepin who was introduced to his majesty and dedicated to him the account of his voyages and travels in the west indies that the french were at that time endeavoring to lay a foundation to engross the trade thither by means of a communication between the river canada and that of missisippi which empties itself into the gulf of mexico his majesty upon the decease of the king of spain resolved to pursue the scheme beforementioned in order to that commodore bembow was sent with a strong squadron to the west indies to both intercept the spanish galleons and to countenance some attempts intended to be made on the spanish settlements in america and of which history has preserved us the following particulars annals of q anne vol   p  0   0  about the beginning of february   0   letters from port royal in jamaica brought the melancholy news of the death of that brave and experienced seaofficer rear admiral bembow who upon the  th of december died of the wound he received in his late engagement with monsieur du casse etc successes of the english in america in the year   0  these letters added not long after his death colonel robert daniel arriving at port royal from carolina brought an account that colonel moore governor of that plantation marched from charlestown in carolina with  00 men in order to attack a colony of the spaniards about  00 miles distant called st augustine near the gulf of florida that he soon possessed himself of the town the inhabitants deserting it and retiring with their best effects into a strong castle surrounded by a very deep and broad moat in which place they had laid up provisions enough to last them four months and that they defended themselves there very obstinately so it being impossible to take this castle by storm colonel moore had ordered it to be blocked up and sent colonel daniel to port royal to borrow a mortar and stoneshells to bombard it and doubted not but he should by that means soon force them to surrender if this expedition had succeeded it would have greatly contributed to the security of carolina there being no other place from whence they could afterward be disturbed except a small settlement which the french call the palissadoes about  00 miles farther into the country to the westward but some french and spanish galleons being arrived at st augustines port before the return of colonel daniel colonel moore was obliged to raise the blockade and to return to his government by land after having burnt the ship in which he was come the same letters brought advice that six or eight frigates of our small privateers attacked a place called toulon on the continent about  0 leagues from carthagena which they took plundered and burnt from thence they sailed to caledonia went up the river darien and in twelve days march to the gold mines at santa cruz de cana near santa maria the  th day of their march they fell within an outguard of ten men which the spaniards had at some distance from the place of whom they took nine but the other escaping gave notice at the mines of their approach whereupon the richest of the inhabitants retired from thence with their money and jewels however our party which consisted of about four hundred men being come up took the fort and possessed themselves of the mine where there remained  0 negroes whom they set to work and continued there    days in which time they got about  0 pound weight of gold dust they also found several parcels of plate which the inhabitants had buried at their leaving that place our men at their departure burnt all the town except the church and returned to their sloops bringing away the negroes some went further up the river in their sloops having a design upon another gold mine called chocoa and two of the sloops commanded by captain plowman and captain grandy sailed toward cuba landed near trinidado and with   0 men took the town burnt a great part of it and brought off a very considerable booty  k williams project resumed by q anne not long after her majestys happy accession to the throne some advances were made toward the prosecution of king williams project the lords pass an act to encourage it in order to which the lords passed a bill entitled an act for the better carrying on the present war by sea and land in the west indies which the commons read a second time on the   th of february   0    and committed the same to a grand committee which is lost but two days after  february   th upon a debate arising about the speakers leaving the chair to consider of the said bill the debate was adjourned to the   th of that month and the parliament being prorogued the   th that bill was lost the dutch forward in the intended expedition nevertheless the court seemed still resolved upon an expedition to the west indies in conjunction with the dutch under the command of the earl of peterborow and there is no doubt to be made that if that resolute and pushing general had carried our victorious forces and his good fortune to the west indies instead of going to spain the enemy would long before now have been obliged to submit to the conditions of a safe and lasting peace but though the dutch were very earnest and forward in this intended expedition having for that purpose sent a squadron with   00 landmen on board to portsmouth in the beginning of the spring of the year   0  which however is laid aside yet either as twas reported upon a disgust given to that noble peer by refusing him several necessaries or for some other reasons that undertaking was then laid aside the design revived and brought to perfection by the present ministry this design lay dormant for about eight years till the scheme of it was newmodelld and digested into better consistency and form by the present ministry who did wisely incorporate the proprietors of public debts to carry it on  advantages resulting from a settlement in the southseas the settlements which the british corporation are allowed to make in the southseas both by the treaty of the grandalliance and by act of parliament will certainly be attended with infinite advantages   the trade of such places as we shall seize and plant will by degrees increase both within it self and with others and will open such a vein of riches will return such wealth as in few years will make us more than sufficient amends for the vast expenses we have been at since the revolution   for it will occasion a great consumption of our woollen iron and other manufactures as will be hereunder specified   consequently it will find work and employment for abundance of our poor and thereby ease the parishes of that heavy burden   it will advance the value of land   it will increase our shipping and the number of our sea men in both which the chief and natural strength of this nation consists   our settling in southamerica may open a beneficial trade for our plantations in north america who want a market for the overplus of those provisions that grow in those countries   the southseatrade may greatly contribute toward the buoying up and supporting the sinking and near expiring royal africancompany by affording it an opportunity of vending great numbers of negroes to the spaniards who by a contract with the jamaicans did formerly buy them at the rate of  00 pieces of eight ahead as an illustration of this it may be observed that the chief motive that engaged the french in the attempt they made some years ago upon the islands of nevis and st christophers was the alluring booty of the negroes on those plantations the french king having borrowed a great sum from the spaniards upon condition of furnishing them with a certain number of negroes which he could not have performed but for the successful invasion of the said island   in the last place though it was not thought consistent with the honor of the nation to grant the pirates of madagascar a pardon yet since they have established and formed themselves into a kind of regular government it will not be more dishonorable for the south sea company to trade with them than it was for the people of italy to hold a commerce and friendly correspondence with the first founders of old rome who were but a company of public robbers it may indeed be alleged that the southseacorporation is not allowed to trade in madagascar which would be an incroachment on the east india company but as the act of parliament only limits places and not persons so the southseacompany may within the limitations of the act carry on a very beneficial commerce with the madagascarians who drive themselves a considerable trade in the southseas either in a friendly or a piratical manner   and here it may not be improper to subjoin the account which in the year   0  was given of the pirates of madagascar which was as follows account of the wealth of the pirates in madagascar and of what they offered for their pardon captain wheeler captain brent and dr dawsone who was within the limitation of king williams proclamation and had the benefit of the same as also captain hicks and others that were condemned for piracy but pardoned by her present majesty as also captain brown and peter dearlove who were bailed out of prison did all give the following account of the number and wealth of the pirates to captain martin laycock and did assure him that if he could get a general pardon without exception of crimes persons or places as also liberty for their effects they could bring him to full fifteen hundred men that would willingly give one fourth part of what they were worth and that one with another they had full  000 l a man  captain averys crew was then  00 at  000 l each man is   00000 l captain reads crew was  00 men who shared at one time   00 l at another time   00 l at another time  00 l and at another time  00 l each man which to each man amounts to   00 l in all    0000 l capt thomas tongss crew consisted of  00 men worth full  000 l each man he being a westindian born and one of the boldest and forwardest of them all worth in all   00000 l total    0000 l captain avery capt read and capt tongs were reckoned to be worth each as much as their entire respective crews viz    0000 l and the officers under them were accounted to be worth about three millions more  000000 l in all  0  0000 l  besides captain browns crew and others in the southseas and those that go between madagascar and the west indies whom they could give no certain account of to captain laycock but who they were sure would readily give the fourth part of what they were worth for their pardon so that by a modest computation the fourth part of the whole would bring in above six millions sterling to the government  thus far the account of the madagascarians given in   0   upon the whole matter the real advantages of this trade will with gods blessing abundantly answer the charge and expectation both of the private adventurers and of the whole nation

oils objections raised against the south sea trade but though common benefit was the only view of those that formed this project though the undertaking be noble great and advantageous yet such is the perverseness of humane nature so prone are the generality of men to censure and find fault that it is no wonder this publickspirited design has met with contradiction and opposition either from a jealousy and uneasiness of temper almost inseparable from moneydmen or from the particular disgusts of some persons who like waspish and sullen patients reject the most wholesome physic because they are not pleased with the hand that administers it  first objection in the first place it is objected that considering what strong footing the french have got in the spanish west indies the attempt to remove them from thence is like to be attended with insuparable difficulties the rather because they are in conjunction with the spaniards both at land and sea and supposing we could get some settlement in the continent of southamerica yet while the war lasts we could trade with no more of the country than we possess unless it be clandestinely and after the peace we must expect to have less trade whereas the french have an open uninterrupted commerce with the whole country  answer to the first branch of it as to the first branch of this objection i answer that the necessity of driving the french out of the spanish west indies being once laid down as a fundamental maxim no difficulties whatsoover ought to deterr us from the undertaking whereas on the contrary the infinite advantage and benefit that will attend the success of the attempt ought to be a powerful incentive to it we have in the course of this war with our shipping and a handful of landmen compassed things of far greater difficulty such as the taking of barcelona gibraltar and portmahon and to bring in a fresher instance did not colonel nicholson with inconsiderable forces make himself master of port royal in nova scotia which we may well suppose was in a better posture of defense than several places in southamerica in which the french are but newly settled  besides can any man of common sense entertain so mean an opinion of those who made this project and have thereby justly merited public acknowledgments and rewards as to think that they did not foresee and provide against all difficulties that might attend it there is no doubt to be made but the ministry have had all the lights and informations necessary to carry on so great an undertaking with probability of success but the scheme they have framed with the assistance of several persons who are perfectly well acquainted with those countries is and ought to remain an absolute secret till all things be ready for execution otherwise the enemy might take such measures and precautions as might render the design abortive  answer to the second branch of the first objection to the second part of the first objection i answer that by a trade to the southseas it is not to be understood that we shall take possession of some ports or places on the west side of southamerica which being to be allowed as our acquisitions pursuant to the treaty of the grandalliance beforementioned we shall possess the same after the peace is made and that from these places we shall carry on a free trade with the spaniards and natives of america throughout the rest of their plantations as the french do now to be sure to expect such a free trade would be a fond conceit for as during the war the french in conjunction with the spaniards will certainly endeavor to prevent it so after the peace oldspain will not easily consent to it the same reasons that induced them notwithstanding their inbred antipathy to the french rather to call the duke of anjou to the throne than to suffer a partition of their monarchy will undoubtedly incline them not to acquiesce in a partition of their direct american trade which as was hinted before is the main spring of their riches and would in effect be the same with a partition of their dominions  but the trade intended to be carried on by the british corporation to the southseas will be so far from being prejudicial to the spaniards that as we may with gods blessing during the war deliver them from the intruding french of whom as i hinted before they wish themselves to be rid so in time of peace our settlements in the southseas will rather be an advantage than a detriment to oldspain this position may at first blush look like a paradox but as it is most certain that there is room enough on the westerncoast of southamerica for us to plant and establish a flourishing trade in without invading the property or injuring the original commerce of the spaniards so on the other hand we may assist them in carrying on the said trade by supplying them with what they stand most in need of for that purpose viz negroes which we may easily do with no final advantage to our selves as was before mentioned by this it appears that the spaniards have no reason to be d but rather to rejoice at and favor our undertaking since the old treaty of commerce between england and spain of which the exclusive article was with respect to newspain may yet with exception only to such places as we may possess our selves of during the war remain entire after the peace notwithstanding our south seatrade  and here we may cursorily take notice that besides the concessions made to us by the treaty of the grand alliance of such places as we shall possess in the spanish dominions in america our title to california we have also a right to the great island of california as having been first discovered by our countryman sir francis drake a title of equal validity with any pretensions of other european princes or states to any part of the west or east indies and that island lying to the northwest of mexico may be of great advantage to us toward the carrying on and improvement of the south sea trade   d objection in the second place the vast distance between england and the southseas is alleged as a great obstacle to the success of this undertaking answered but this objection will appear to be of no weight if we consider that by the benefit of our ports in ireland we are as to that particular upon a level with the french and in several other respects we have great advantages over them as in the strength of shipping number of seamen ports on the coast of africa and in our american plantations particularly in jamaica etc   d objection a third outery has by some ill designing people been raised against this project as if the parliament intended to pay all national debts with the floating expectations of a precarious south sea trade confuted than which nothing can be more maliciously or more falsely suggested for the parliament has provided an interest of six per cent which will be punctually paid till the nation be in a condition to redeem the same by paying off the capital sum and the south sea corporation as was hinted before was erected only as an additional advantage both to the proprietors of the said debts and through their means to the whole nation   th objection but the loudest most popular and indeed most plausible clamor against this undertaking is the cumpulsion put upon the proprietors of public debts to subscribe their tallies debentures bills etc into this new company as if the whole debt was to be the stock in trade and this stock was to be employed toward the dislodging the french out of the spanish west indies etc  first part of it answered as to the first part of this objection i answer that between man and man to force a free debtor to take an interest for his debt and not receive the principal according to contract is certainly very hard and unjust but the case is vastly different between a private man and a nation for the first may fail and prove insolvent the latter never can it is too visible that the public debts were too great to be paid off in any number of years while the burden of an expensive war lies heavy upon the nation and therefore all that an honest parliament and wise ministry could do was to secure those debts by ascertaining them and putting them into one lump and by allowing an interest of six per cent that is as large an interest as was ever allowed by parliament except upon extraordinary emergencies and one per cent more than some of those debts viz the army and transportdebentures had before so far the justice and honor of the nation are clear and unblemished  on the other hand the parliament and ministry upon a contemplation of the absolute necessity of removing the french out of southamerica in order to attain a safe honorable and lasting peace and of the other great advantages beforementioned that will result from a south sea trade resolved to erect a company for that purpose and thereupon incorporated the proprietors of the public debts who by reason of their large stock are certainly the most able to carry on this undertaking with probability of success now if ever compulsion can be justified and no government can subsist without it it is certainly in a case not only of necessity but visible benefit the forcing therefore the proprietors of public debts that is a multitude of persons of different humors interests and views to agree and meet in one common center viz the public good and their own private advantage is certainly a very happy and commendable violence not but that such a compulsion may occasion inconveniences to several particular persons but as salus populi suprema lex so private ought to yield to public considerations   d branch of the fourth objection answered the second branch of the fourth objection is grounded either upon a mistake or a false suggestion for the south sea company is not to make war and endeavor to dislodge the french out of the spanish west indies at their own sole cost and expense but only with the assistance of the nationalnavy and landforces as will be specified in their charter   th objection from the fourth there arises a fifth objection viz that the call for the fishery being limited to twenty shillings upon every hundred pound and the calls for the south sea trade left unstinted and discretionary the proprietors of the public debts are justly apprehensive that great sums of money will be called in for carrying on the said undertaking which has hitherto kept many of the said proprietors from subscribing  answered to this i answer first that the company shall be at no further charge than shall be thought necessary for their own benefit and advantage  secondly that their capitalstock being near ten millions sterling a call of five pound upon very hundred pound will raise near  00000 l a sum much greater than the capital joint stock with which the french king his grandson and the subjects of the two respective crowns undertook and have settled the trade to the south sea and which was only of six millions of french livers that is about  00000 l sterling  thirdly that according to her majestys charter all the several calls toward the south sea trade are not to exceed ten pound upon every hundred pound  fourthly and in the last place that the company being under the conduct and management of a governor and directors who shall have the largest share in the adventure and consequently be most concerned in the prosperity of the whole there is no doubt to be made that if after such trials as are necessary to be made in all great and difficult undertakings they find that the south sea trade will turn to no account they will fairly throw it up and sit down contented with an interest of six per cent for their capitalstock till the parliament is in a condition and thinks fit to redeem it for the company is only empowered and not compelled to trade exclusive of all others to the southseas which is so far from being a hardship that it really is as it was meant a distinguishing favor  false report about the subscription and here we may take notice of a false report broached either through mistake or a sinister design viz that a fourth part of the subscription into this company was to be made in ready money which being inserted in one of the public foreign prints of the best credit has undoubtedly hindered many foreigners who are proprietors of armydebentures or other public debts from subscribing  notwithstanding all difficulties four millions were subscribed in three weeks but notwithstanding these false reports and surmizes notwithstanding the malicious endeavors and discouraging suggestions of some disgusted on illdesigning persons notwithstanding all the great trouble that has unavoidably attended the subscription such as the examining the title and casting up the broken sums of every particular bill and debenture and other difficulties yet it is very remarkable that in the few days the books were open which did not exceed three weeks near four millions were subscribed two millions more ready to be subscribed to this if we add above two millions that are to be subscribed for the use of the public but which cannot be done till the accounts of the several offices are made up it may be computed that above six millions are as good as subscribed and the greatest part of the three millions and a half remaining would have also come in had it not been for the uncertainty of the time when the transferrbooks will be opened which cannot be before the charter of this corporation has passed the seals and the remoteness from great britain of several proprietors of the public debts who could not have time to send orders to their correspondents while the subscriptionbooks were opened this great undertaking brought so near perfection one of the wonders of this glorious reign so that the bringing so great an undertaking so near perfection in so short a time may well be reckoned among the wonders of her majestys glorious reign  to conclude some doubts that have arisen about some clauses in the act of parliament for the erecting the south sea corporation have filled the minds of some of the proprietors of the public debts with illgrounded jealousies which may also have put some stop to the subscription but as it is next to impossible that an act of so vast magnitude so comprehensive of public ends and
