critical observations on the sixth book of the aeneid  as the reasonable de la bruyere observes  qui ne sait etre un erasme doit penser a etre un eveque  popes works vol iv p     with the commentaries and notes of mr warburton london originally printed    0 reprinted        a most clear elegant and decisive work of criticism which could not indeed derive authority from the greatest name but to which the this book is ascribed and i think with great probability to the very learned and ingenious author to whom the public is indebted for the history of the decline and fall of the roman empire be the writer who he will the reader will say with me that the work is  tracts by warburton and a warburtonian page     greatest name might with propriety have been affixed  critical observations on the design of the sixth book of the aeneid the allegorical interpretation which the bishop of gloucester has given of the sixth book of the aeneid seems to have been very favorably received by the public many writers both at home and abroad have mentioned it with approbation or at least with esteem and i have more than once heard it alleged in the conversation of scholars as an ingenious improvement on the plain and obvious sense of virgil as such it is not undeserving of the notice of a candid critic nor can the enquiry be void of entertainment whilst virgil is our constant theme whatever may be the fortune of the chase we are sure it will lead us through pleasant prospects and a fine country  that i may escape the imputation as well as the danger of misrepresenting his lordships hypothesis i shall expose it in his own words the purpose of this discourse is to show that aeneass adventure to the infernal shades is no other than a figurative description of his initiation into the mysteries and particularly a very exact one of the spectacles of the eleusinian see warburtons dissertation etc in the third volume of mr wartons virgil i shall quote indifferently that dissertation or the divine legation itself  this general notion is supported with singular ingenuity dressed up with an easy yet pompous display of learning and delivered in a style much fitter for the hierophant of eleusis than for a modern critic who is observing a remote object through the medium of a glimmering and doubtful light ibant obscuri sola sub nocte per umbram  his lordship naturally enough pursues two different methods which unite as he apprehends in the same conclusion from general principles peculiar to himself he infers the propriety and even necessity of such a description of the mysteries and from a comparison of particular circumstances he labors to prove that virgil has actually introduced it into the aeneid each of these methods shall be considered separately  as the learned prelates opinions branch themselves out into luxuriant systems it is not easy to resume them in a few words i shall however attempt to give a short idea of those general principles which occupy i know not how so great a share of the divine legation of moses demonstrated  the whole system of paganism of which the mysteries were an essential part was instituted by the ancient lawgivers for the support and benefit of society the mysteries themselves were a school of morality and religion in which the vanity of polytheism at least of the vulgar polytheism by revealing that the dii majorum gentium had been mere mortals  and the unity of the first cause were revealed to the initiated virgil who intended his immortal poem for a republic in action as those of plato and tully were in precept could not avoid displaying this first and noblest art of government his perfect lawgiver must be initiated as the ancient founders of states had been before him and as augustus himself was many ages afterward  what a crowd of natural reflections must occur to an unblassed mind was the civil magistrate the mover of the whole machine the sole contriver or at least the sole support of religion were ancient laws always designed for the benefit of the people and never for the private interest of the lawgiver could the first fathers of rude societies instruct their newmade subjects in philosophy as well as in agriculture did they all agree in britain as in egypt in persia as in greece to found these secret schools on the same common principle which subsisted near eighteen hundred years at eleusis from their institution      years before the christian era marm arundel ep    till their suppression toward the end of the fourth century in its primaeval purity can these things be yes replies the learned prelate they are egypt was the mysterious mother of religion and policy and the arts of egypt were diffused with her colonies over the ancient world inachus carried the mysteries into greece zoroaster into persia though i hate to be positive yet i would almost venture to affirm that zorcasters connection with egypt is no where to be found except in the d l etc etc  i retire from so wide a field in which it would be easy for me to lose both myself and my adversary the ancient world eighteen centuries and four hundred authors genuine and apocryphal see a list of four hundred authors quoted etc in the d l from st austin and aristotle down to scarron and rabelais amongst these authors we may observe sanchoniatho orpheus zaleucus charondas the oracles of prophry and the history of jeffrey of monmouth  the bishop has entered the lists with the tremendous bentley who treated the laws of zaleucus and charondas as the forgeries of a sophist a whole section of mistakes or misrepresentations is devoted to this controversy but bentley is no more and wn may sleep in peace  i shall however disturb his repose by asking him on what authority he supposes that the old language of the twelve tables was altered for the convenience of succeeding ages the fragments of those laws collected by lipsius sylburgius etc bear the stamp of the most remote antiquity lipsius himself tom i p  0  was highly delighted with those antiquissima verba but what is much more decisive horace l ii ep i ver    seneca epistol     and aulus gellius xx   rank those laws amongst the oldest remains of the latin tongue their obsolete language was admired by the lawyers ridiculed by the wits and pleaded by the friends of antiquity as an excuse for the frequent obscurities of that code  had an adversary to the divine legation been guilty of this mistake i am afraid it would have been styled an egregious blunder   would under tolerable management furnish some volumes of controversy and since i have perused the two thousand and fourteen pages of the unfinished legation i have less inclination than ever to spin out volumes of laborious trifles  i shall however venture to point out a fact not very agreeable to the favorite notion that paganism was entirely the religion of the magistrate the oracles were not less ancient nor less venerable than the mysteries every difficulty religious or civil was submitted to the decision of those infallible tribunals during several ages no war could be undertaken no colony founded without the sanction of the delphic oracle the first and most celebrated amongst several hundred others see vandale de oraculis p     that valuable book contains whatever can now be known of oracles i have borrowed his facts and could with great ease have borrowed his quotations  here then we might expect to perceive the directing hand of the magistrate yet when we study their history with attention instead of the alliance between church and state we can only discover the ancient alliance between the avarice of the priest and the credulity of the people  for my own part i am very apt to consider the mysteries in the same light as the oracles an intimate connection subsisted between them the prophet alexander whose arts are so admirably laid open by lucian instituted his oracle and his mysteries as regular parts of the same plan it is here we may say with the learned catholic les nouveaux saints me font douter des anciens    both were preceded and accompanied with fasts sacrifices and lustrations with mystic sights and preternatural sounds but the most essential preparation for the aspirant was a general confession of his past life which was exacted of him by the priest in return for this implicit confidence the hierophant conferred on the initiated a sacred character and promised them a peculiar place of happiness in the elysian fields whilst the souls of the profane however virtuous they had been were wallowing in the mire see diogen laert vi    and menag ad loc  nor did the priests of the mysteries neglect to recommend to the brethren a spirit of friendship and the love of virtue so pleasing even to the most corrupt minds and so requisite to render any society respectable in its own eyes of all these religious societies that of eleusis was the most illustrious from being peculiar to the inhabitants of attica it became at last common to the whole pagan world indeed i should suspect that it was much indebted to the genius of the athenian writers who bestowed fame and dignity on whatever had the least connection with their country nor am i surprised that cicero and atticus who were both initiated should express themselves with enthusiasm when they speak of the sacred rites of their beloved athens  but our curiosity is yet unsatisfied we would press forwards into the sanctuary and are eager to learn what was the secret which was revealed to the initiated and to them alone many of the profane possessed of leisure and ingenuity haved tried to guess what has been so religiously concealed the secret of each is curious and philosophical for as soon as we attempt this enquiry the honor of the mysteries becomes our own i shall sum them up in a curious passage of the celebrated freret les sects philosophiques cherchoient a diviner le dogme cache sous le voile des ceremonies and tachoient de le ramener chacune a leur doctrine dans lhypothese des epicuriens adoptee de nos jours par m m leclerc and warburton leclerc adopted it in the year      mr warburton

lacademie des inscriptions etc tom xxi p    hist    i too could frame an hypothesis as plausible perhaps and as uncertain as any of theirs did i not feel myself checked by the apprehension of discovering what never existed je ne suis pas si convaincu de notre ignorance par les chooses qui sont and dont la raison nous est inconnue que par celles qui ne sont point and dont nous trouvons la raison oeuvres de fontenelle tom xi p      i admire the discretion of the initiated but the best security for discretion is the vanity of concealing that we have nothing to reveal  the examples of great men when they cannot serve as models may serve as warnings to us i should be very sorry to have discovered that an atheistical history the fragment of sanchoniathos phoenician history eusebius and bishop cumberland have already observed that the formation of the world is there attributed to the blind powers of matter without the least mention of an intelligent cause was used in the celebration of the mysteries to prove the unity of the first cause and that an ancient hymn orpheuss hymn to musaeus quoted by justin martyr and several other fathers but rejected as spurious by

are unanswerable will allow that they deserved to be answered was sung for the edification of the devout athenians which was most probably a modern forgery of some jewish or christian impostor had i delivered these two discoveries with an air of confidence and triumph i should be still more mortified  after all as i am not apt to give the name of demonstration to what is mere conjecture his lordship may take advantage of my skepticism and still affirm that his favorite mysteries were schools of theism instituted by the lawgiver yet unless aeneas is the lawgiver of virgils republic he has no more business with the mysteries of athens than with the laws of sparta we will therefore reflect a moment on the true nature and plan of the aeneid  an epic fable must be important as well as interesting great actions great virtues and great distresses are the peculiar province of heroic poetry this rule seems to have been dictated by nature and experience and is very different from those chains in which genius has been bound by artificial criticism the importance i speak of is not indeed always dependant on the rank or names of the personages columbus exploring a new world with three sloops and ninety sailors is a hero worthy of the epic muse yet our imagination would be much more strongly affected by the image of a virtuous prince saved from the ruins of his country and conducting his faithful followers through unknown seas and through hostile lands such is the hero of the aeneid but his peculiar situation suggested other beauties to the poet who had an opportunity of adorning his subject with whatever was most pleasing in grecian fable or most illustrious in roman history aeneas had fought under the walls of ilium and conducted to the banks of the tyber a colony from which rome claimed her origin  the character of the hero is expressed by one of his friends in a few words and though drawn by a friend does not seem to be flattered rex erat aeneas nobis quo justior alter nec pietate fecit nec bello major and armis aeneid i      these three virtues of justice of piety and of valor are finely supported throughout the poem m de voltaire condemns the latter part of the aeneid as far inferior in fire and spirit to the former as quoted in the legation he thinks that virgil  sepuise avec didon and rate a la fin lavinie a pretty odd quotation for a bishop but i most sincerely hope that neither his lordship nor mrs wn are acquainted with the true meaning of the word rater     i shall here mention one instance of the heros justice which has been less noticed than its singularity seems to deserve  after evander had entertained his guests with a sublime simplicity he lamented that his age and want of power made him a very useless ally however he points out auxiliaries and a cause worthy of a hero the etruscans tired out with the repeated tyrannies of mezentius had driven that monarch from his throne and reduced him to implore the protection of turnus unsatisfied with freedom the etruscans called loudly for revenge and in the poets opinion revenge was justice ergo omnis furiis surrexit etruria justis regem ad supplicum praesenti mart reposcunt aeneid viii      aeneas with the approbation of gods and men accepts the command of these brave rebels and punishes the tyrant with the death he so well deserved the conduct of aeneas and the etruscans may in point of justice seem doubtful to many the sentiments of the poet cannot appear equivocal to any one milton himself i mean the milton of the commonwealth could not have asserted with more energy the daring pretensions of the people to punish as well as to resist a tyrant such opinions published by a writer whom we are taught to consider as the creature of augustus have a right to surprise us yet they are strongly expressive of the temper of the times the republic was subverted but the minds of the romans were still republican    aeneass piety has been more generally confessed than admired st evremond laughs at it as unsuitable to his own temper the bishop of gloucester defends it as agreeable to his own system of the lawgivers religion the french wit was too superficial the english scholar too profound to attend to the plain narration of the poet and the peculiar circumstances of ancient heroes we believe from faith and reason they believed from the report of their senses aeneas had seen the grecian divinities overturning the foundations of fated troy he was personally acquainted with his mother venus and with his persecutor juno mercury who commanded him to leave carthage was as present to his eyes as dido who strove to detain him such a knowledge of religion founded on sense and experience must insinuate itself into every instant of our lives and determine every action all this is indeed fiction but it is fiction in which we choose to acquiesce and which we justly consider as the charm of poetry if we allow that aeneas lived in an intimate commerce with superior beings we must likewise allow his love or his fear his confidence or his gratitude toward those beings to display themselves on every proper occasion far from thinking aeneas too pious i am sometimes surprised at his want of faith forgetful of the fates which had so often and so clearly pointed out the destined shores of latium he deliberates whether he shall not sit down quietly in the fields of sicily an apparition of his father is necessary to divert him from this impious and ungenerous design    a heros valor will not bear the rude breath of suspicion yet has the courage of aeneas suffered from an unguarded expression of the poet extemplo aeneae solvuntur frigore membra ingemit aeneid i     on every other occasion the trojan chief is daring without rashness and prudent without timidity in that dreadful night when troy was delivered up to her hostile gods he performed every duty of a soldier a patriot and a son moriamur and in media arma ruamus una salus victis nullam sperare salutem aeneid ii      iliaci cineres and flamma extrema meorum testor in occasu vestro nec tela nec ullas vitavisse vices danaum and si fata fuissent ut caderem meruisse manu idem ii      to quote other proofs of the same nature would be to copy the six last books of the aeneid i cannot however forbear mentioning the calm and superior intrepidity of the hero when after the perfidy of the rutuli and his wound he rushed again to the field and restored victory by his presence alone ipse neque aversos dignatur sternere morti nec pede congressos aequo nec tela ferentes insequitur solum densa in caligine turnum vestigat lustrans solum in certamina poscit idem xii      at length indignant that his victim has escaped him his contempt gives way to fury jam tandem invadit medios and mart secundo terribilis saevam nullo discrimine caedem suscitat irarumque omnes effundit habenas idem xii        the heroic character of aeneas has been understood and admired by every attentive reader but to discover the lawgiver in aeneas and a system of politics in the aeneid required the critical telescope others are furnished by criticism with a telescope they see with great clearness whatever is too remote to be discovered by the rest of mankind but are totally blind to all that lies immediately before them they discover in every passage some secret meaning some remote allusion some artful allegory or some occult imitation which no other reader ever suspected but they have no perception of the cogency of arguments the contexture of narration the various colors of diction or the flowery embellishments of fancy of all that engages the attention of others they are totally insensible while they pry into the worlds of conjecture and amuse themselves with phantoms in the clouds rambler of the great wn the naked eye of common sense cannot reach so far i revolve in my memory the harmonious sense of virgil virgil seems as ignorant as myself of his political character i return to the less pleasing pages of the legation so far from condescending to proofs the author of the legation is even sparing of conjectures  many political instructions may be drawn from the aeneid and from what book which treats of man and the adventures of human life may they not be drawn his lordships chemistry did his hypothesis require it would extract a system of policy from the arabian nights entertainments  a system of policy delivered in the example of a great prince must show him in every public occurrence of life hence aeneas was of necessity to be found voyaging with ulysses and fighting with achilles d l vol i p       there is another public occurrence at least as much in the character of a lawgiver as either voyaging or fighting i mean giving laws except in a single line aeneid iii      aeneas never appears in that occupation in sicily he compliments acestes with the honor of giving laws to the colony which he himself had founded interea aeneas urbem designat aratro sortiturque domos hoc ilium and haec loca trojae esse jubet gaudet regno trojanus acestes indicitque forum and patribus dat jura vocatis idem v      in the solemn treaty which is to fix the fate of his posterity he disclaims any design of innovating the laws of latium on the contrary he only demands a hospitable seat for his gods and his trojans and professes to leave the whole authority to king latinus non ego nec teucris italos parere jubebo nec mihi regna peto paribus se legibus ambae invictae gentes aeterna in foedera mittant sacra deosque dabo socer arma latinus habeto imperium solemn socer mihi moenia teucri constituent urbique dabit lavinia nomen aeneid xii        but after all is not the fable of the aeneid the establishment of an empire yes in one sense i grant it is aeneas had many external difficulties to struggle with when the latins were defeated turnus slain and juno appeased these difficulties were removed the heros labor was over the lawgivers commenced from that moment and as if virgil had a design against the bishops system at that very moment the aeneid ends virgil who corrected with judgment and felt with enthusiasm thought perhaps that the sober arts of peace could never interest a reader whose mind had been so long agitated with scenes of distress and slaughter he might perhaps say like the sylla of montesquieu jaime a remporter des victoires a fonder ou detruire des etats a fair des ligues a punir un usurpateur mais pour ces minces details de government ou les genies mediocres ont tant davantages cette lent execution des loix cette discipline dune milice tranquille mon ame ne scauroit sen occuper oeuvres de montesquieu tom iii p       had virgil designed to compose a political institute the example of fenelon his elegant imitator may give us some notion of the manner in which he would have proceeded the preceptor of the duke of burgundy professedly designed to educate a prince for the happiness of the people every incident in his pleasing romance is subservient to that great end the goddess of wisdom in a human shape conducts her pupil through a varied series of instructive adventures and every adventure is a lesson or a warning for telemachus the pride of sesostris the tyranny of pygmalion the perfidy of adrastus and the imprudence of idomeneus are displayed in their true light the innocence of the inhabitants of boetica the commerce of tire and the wise laws of crete and salentum instructed the prince of the various means by which a people may be made happy from the telemachus of fenelon i could pass with pleasure to the cyropoedia of xenophon but i should be led too far from my subject were i to attempt to lay open the true nature and design of that philosophical history we must return from fenelon and xenophon to the bishop of gloucester  his lordship props the legislative character of aeneas with an additional support augustus who was shadowed in the person of aeneas was initiated into the eleusinian mysteries d l p      ergo etc this doctrine of types and shadows though true in general has on this as well as on graver occasions produced a great abuse of reason or at least of reasoning to confine myself to virgil i shall only say that he was too judicious to compliment the emperor at the expense of good sense and probability every age has its manners and the poet must suit his hero to the age and not the age to his hero it is easy to give instances of this truth marc antony when defeated and besieged in alexandria challenged his competitor to decide their quarrel by a single combat this was rejected by augustus with contempt and derision as the last effort of a desperate man plutarch in vit m anton tom i   0 edit wechel  and the world applauded the prudence of augustus who preferred the part of a general to that of a gladiator the temper and good sense of virgil must have made him view things in the same light yet when virgil introduces aeneas in similar circumstances he gives him a quite different conduct the hero wishes to spare the innocent people provokes turnus to a single combat and even after the perfidy and last defeat of the rutuli is still ready to risk his person and victory against the unhappy life and desperate fortunes of his rival the laws of honor are different in different ages and a behavior which in augustus was decent would have covered aeneas with infamy  we may apply this observation to the very case of the eleusinian mysteries augustus was initiated into them at a time when eleusis was become the common temple of the universe the trojan hero could not with the smallest propriety set him that example as the trojan hero lived in an age when those rites were confined to the natives of greece and even of attica plutarch in vit thesei tom i p    herodot viii    cicero de not deor i    the gradation of athenians greeks and mankind at large may be traced in these passages   i have now wandered through the scientific maze in which the bishop of gloucester has concealed his first and general argument it appears when resumed to amount to this irrefragable demonstration that if the mysteries were instituted by legislators which they probably were not aeneas who was no legislator must of course be initiated into them by the poet  and here i shall mention a collateral reason assigned by his lordship which might engage virgil to introduce a description of the mysteries the practice of other poets this proof is so exceedingly brittle that i fear to handle it and shall report it faithfully in the words of our ingenious critic d l vol i p       had the old poem under the name of orpheus been now extant it would perhaps have shown us that no more was meant than orpheuss initiation and that the hint of this sixth book was taken from thence  as nothing now remains of that old poem except the title it is not altogether so easy to guess what it would or would not have shown us  but farther it was customary for the poets of the augustan age to exercise themselves on the subject of the mysteries as appears from cicero who desires atticus then at athens and initiated to send to chilius a poet of eminence an account of the eleusinian mysteries in order as it would seem to insert them into some poem he was then writing  the eleusinian mysteries are not mentioned in the original passage cicero using the obscure brevity of familiar letters desires that atticus would send their friend chilius eyolpidon patpia chilius te rogat and ego ejus rogatu  cicero ad attic i    which may signify twenty different things relative either to the worship of ceres in particular or to the athenian institutions in general but which can hardly be applied to the eleusinian mysteries as the b of g alleges the authority of victorius i shall shelter myself under the names and reasons of groevius and the abbe mongault and even transcribe the words of the former non est ut hic intelligantur ritus illi secretories qui tantum mystis noti erant and sine capitis periculo vulgari non poterant sed illa sacra and ceremoniae quibus in eleusiniis celebrandis utebantur in omnium oculis eumolpidae quasque poetae and prisi scriptores alii commemorant passim aut forte per eumolpidas intelligit tecte ipsos athenienses ut petierit chilius atheniensium leges and disciplinam sibi describi and mitti     thus it appears that both the ancient and modern poets afforded virgil a pattern for this famous episode  how does this appear from an old poem of whose contents the critic is totally ignorant and from an obscure passage the meaning of which he has most probably mistaken  instead of conjecturing what virgil might or ought to do it would seem far more natural to examine what he has done the bishop of gloucester attempts to prove that the descent to hell is properly an initiation since the sixth book of the aeneid really contains the secret doctrine as well as the ceremonies of the eleusinian mysteries  what was this secret doctrine as i profess my ignorance we must consult the oracle the secret doctrine of the mysteries revealed to the initiated that jupiter and the whole rabble of licentious deities were only dead mortals d l vol i p      is any thing like this laid open in the sixth book of virgil not the remotest hint of it can be discovered throughout the whole book and thus to use his lordships own words something i had almost written every thing is still wanting to complete the identification idem p       notwithstanding this disappointment which is cautiously concealed from the reader the learned bishop still courses round the elysian fields in quest of a secret once he is so lucky as to find aeneas talking with the poet musaeus whom tradition has reckoned among the founders of the eleusinian mysteries the critic listens to their conversation but alas aeneas is only enquiring in what part of the garden he may find his fathers shade to which musaeus returns a very polite answer anchises himself is our last hope as that venerable shade explains to his son some mysterious doctrines concerning the universal mind and the transmigration of souls his lordship is pleased to assure us that these are the hidden doctrines of perfection revealed only to the initiated let us for a moment lay aside hypothesis and read virgil  it is observable that the three great poets of rome were all addicted to the epicurean philosophy a system however the least suited to a poet since it banishes all the genial and active powers of nature to substitute in their room a dreary void blind atoms and indolent gods a description of the infernal shades was incompatible with the ideas of a philosopher whose disciples boasted that he had rescued the captive world from the tyranny of religion and the fear of a future state these ideas virgil was obliged to reject but he does still more he abandons not only the chance of epicurus but even these gods whom he so nobly employs in the rest of his poem that he may offer to the readers imagination a far more specious and splendid set of ideas principio coelum ac terras camposque liquentes lucentemque globum lunae titaniaque astra spiritus intus alit totamque infusa per artus mens agitat molem and magno se corpore miscet aeneid vi      the more we examine these lines the more we shall feel the sublime poetry of them but they have likewise an air of philosophy and even of religion which goes off on a nearer approach the mind which is infused quomodo porro deus iste si nihil esset nisi animus aut infixus aut infusus esset in mundo cicero de natura deor l i c    into the several parts of matter and which mingles itself with the mighty mass scarce retains any property of a spiritual substance and bears too near an affinity to the principles which the impious spinoza revived rather than invented  i am not insensible that we should be slow to suspect and still slower to condemn the poverty of human language and the obscurity of human ideas makes it difficult to speak worthily of the great first cause our most religious poets in striving to express the presence and energy of the deity in every part of the universe deviate unwarily into images which are scarcely distinguished from materialism thus our ethic poet all are but parts of one stupendous whole whose body nature is and god the soul popes essay on man epistle i ver      and several passages of thomson require a like favorable construction but these writers deserve that favor by the sublime manner in which they celebrate the great father of the universe and by those effusions of love and gratitude which are inconsistent with the materialists system virgil has no such claim to our indulgence the mind of the universe is rather a metaphysical than a theological being his intellectual qualities are faintly distinguished from the powers of matter and his moral attributes the source of all religious worship form no part of virgils creed  yet is this creed approved d l vol i p     by our orthodox prelate as free from any mixture of spinozism i congratulate his lordship on his indulgent and moderate temper his brethren i mean those of former times had much sharper eyes for spying out a latent heresy yet i cannot easily persuade myself that virgils notions were ever the creed of a religious society like that of the mysteries luckily indeed i have no occasion to persuade myself of it unless i should prefer his lordships mere authority to the voice of antiquity which assures me that this system was either invented or imported into greece by pythagoras from the writings of whose disciples virgil might so very naturally borrow it  anchises then proceeds to inform his son that the souls both of men and of animals were of celestial origin and as i understand him parts of the universal mind but that by their union with earthly bodies they contracted such impurities as even death could not purge away many expiations continues the venerable shade are requisite before the soul restored to its original simplicity is capable of a place in elysium the far greater part are obliged to revisit the upper world in other characters and in other bodies and thus by gradual steps to reascend toward their first perfection  this moral transmigration was undoubtedly taught in the mysteries as the bishop asserts this from the best authority we are surprised at a sort of diffidence unusual to his lordship when he advances things from his own intuitive knowledge in one place this transmigration is part of the hidden doctrine of perfection d l vol i p      in another it is one of those principles which were promiscuously communicated to all idem p      the truth seems to be that his lordship was afraid to rank among the secrets of the mysteries what was professed and believed by so many nations and philosophers the preexistence of the human soul is a very natural idea and from that idea speculations and fables of its successive revolution through various bodies will arise from japan to egypt the transmigration has been part of the popular and religious creed see our modern relations of japan china india etc and for egypt herodotus l ii  pythagoras ovid metamorph xv    etc     etc and plato plato in phaedro and in republic l x have endeavored to demonstrate the truth of it by facts as well as by arguments  of all these visions which should have been confined to the poets none is more pleasing and sublime than that which virgil has invented aeneas sees before him his posterity the heroes of ancient rome a long series of airy forms demanding life impatient for the skies and prepared to assume with their new bodies the little passions and transient glories of their destined lives  having i shall mention here once for all that i do not always confine myself to the order of his lordships proofs thus revealed the secret doctrine of the mysteries the learned prelate examines the ceremonies with the assistance of meursius meursii eleusinia five de cereris eleusinae sacro  he pours out a torrent of erudition to convince us that the scenes through which aeneas passed in his descent to the shades were the same as were represented to the aspirants in the celebration of the eleusinian mysteries from thence his lordship draws his great conclusion that the descent is no more than an emblem of the heros initiation  a staunch polemic will feed a dispute by dwelling on every accessory circumstance whilst a candid critic will confine himself to the more essential points of it i shall therefore readily allow what i believe may in general be true that the mysteries exhibited a theatrical representation of all that was believed or imagined of the lower world that the aspirant was conducted through the mimic scenes of erebus tartarus and elysium and that a warm enthusiast in describing these awful spectacles might express himself as if he had actually visited the infernal regions see d l vol i particularly p   0  all this i can allow and yet allow nothing to the bishop of gloucesters hypothesis it is not surprising that the copy was like the original but it still remains undetermined whether virgil intended to describe the original or the copy  lear and garrick when on the stage are the same nor is it possible to distinguish the player from the monarch in the greenroom or after the representation we easily perceive what the warmth of fancy and the justness of imitation had concealed from us in the same manner it is from extrinsical circumstances that we may expect the discovery of virgils allegory every one of those circumstances persuades me that virgil described a real not a mimic world and

venture to boast that he believes no author was ever more averse to take to himself what belonged to another letter from a late professor of oxford etc p      besides he has enriched this mysterious discovery with many collateral arguments which would for ever have escaped all inferior critics in the case of hercules for instance he demonstrates that the initiation and the descent to the shades were the same thing because an ancient has affirmed that they were different d l vol iii p      and that alcides was initiated at eleusis before he set out for taenarus in order to descend to the infernal regions  there is however a single circumstance in the narration of virgil which has justly surprised critics unacquainted with any but the obvious sense of the poet i mean the ivory gate the bishop of gloucester seizes this as the secret mark of allegory and becomes eloquent in the exultation of triumph idem vol i p      i could however represent to him that in a work which was deprived of the authors last revision virgil might too hastily employ what homer had invented and at last unwarily slide into an epicurean idea idem vol i p      let this be as it may an obscure expression is a weak basis for an elaborate system and whatever his lordship may choose to do i had much rather reproach my favorite poet with want of care in one line than with want of taste throughout a whole book horace seems to have used as unguarded an expression et adscribi quietis ordinibus patiar deorum od l iii   the word and idea of quietis are perfectly epicurean but rather clash with the active passions displayed in the rest of junos speech  his lordship d l vol ii p   0 accuses virgil himself of a like inattention which with his usual gentleness he calls an absurdity     virgil has borrowed as usual from homer his episode of the infernal shades and as usual has infinitely improved what the grecian had invented if among a profusion of beauties i durst venture to point out the most striking beauties of the sixth book i should perhaps observe   that after accompanying the hero through the silent realms of night and chaos we see with astonishment and pleasure a new creation bursting upon us   that we examine with a delight which springs from the love of virtue the just empire of minos in which the apparent irregularities of the present system are corrected where the patriot who died for his country is happy and the tyrant who oppressed it is miserable   as we interest ourselves in the heros fortunes we share his feelings the melancholy palinurus the wretched deiphobus the indignant dido the grecian kings who tremble at his presence and the venerable anchises who embraces his pious son and displays to his sight the future glories of his race all these objects affects us with a variety of pleasing sensations  let us for a moment obey the mandate of our great critic and consider these awful scenes as a mimic show exhibited in the temple of ceres by the contrivance of the priest or if he pleases of the legislator whatever was animated i appeal to every reader of taste whatever ever was terrible or whatever was pathetic evaporates into lifeless allegory tenuem sine viribus umbram dat inania verba dat sine mente sonum gressusque effingit euntis   the end of philosophy is truth the end of poetry is pleasure i willingly adopt any interpretation which adds new beauties to the original i assist in persuading myself that it is just and could almost show the same indulgence to the critics as to the poets fiction but should a grave doctor lay out fourscore pages in explaining away the sense and spirit of virgil i should have every inducement to believe that virgils soul was very different from the doctors  i have almost exhausted my own and probably my readers patience whilst i have obsequiously waited on his lordship through the several stages of an intricate hypothesis he must now permit me to allege two very simple reasons which persuade me that virgil has not revealed the secret of the eleusinian mysteries the first is his ignorance and the second his discretion  i as his lordship has not made the smallest attempt to prove that virgil was himself initiated it is plain that he supposed it as a thing of course had he any right to suppose it by no means that ceremony might naturally enough finish the education of a young athenian but a barbarian a roman would most probably pass through life without directing his devotion to the foreign rites of eleusis  the philosophical sentiments of virgil were still more unlikely to inspire him with that kind of devotion it is well known that he was a determined epicurean see the life of virgil by donatus the sixth eclogue and the second georgic ver   0  and a very natural antipathy subsisted between the epicureans and the managers of the mysteries the celebration opened with a solemn excommunication of those atheistical philosophers who were commanded to retire and to leave that holy place for pious believers lucian in alexandro p      the zeal of the people was ready to enforce this admonition i will not deny that curiosity might sometimes tempt an epicurean to pry into these secret rites and that gratitude fear or other motives might engage the athenians to admit so irreligious an aspirant atticus was initiated at eleusis but atticus was the friend and benefactor of athens cornel nepos in vit attici c        these extraordinary exceptions may be proved but must not be supposed  nay more i am strongly inclined to think that virgil was never out of italy till the last year of his life i am sensible that it is not easy to prove a negative proposition more especially when the materials of our knowledge are so very few and so very defective the life of virgil attributed to donatus contains many characteristic particulars but which are lost in confusion and disgraced with a mixture of absurd stories such as none but a monk of the darker ages could either invent or believe i always considered them as the interpolations of some more recent writer and am confirmed in that opinion by the life of virgil pure from those additions which mr spence lately published from a florence ms at the beginning of mr holdsworths valuable observations on virgil  and yet by glancing our eye over the several periods of virgils life we may perhaps attain a sort of probability which ought to have some weight since nothing can be thrown into the opposite scale  although virgils father was hardly of a lower rank than horaces yet the peculiar character of the latter afforded his fon a much superior education virgil did not enjoy the same opportunities of observing mankind on the great theater of rome or of pursuing philosophy in her favorite shades of the academy adjecere bonae paulo plus artis athenae scilicet ut possem curvo dignoscere rectum atque inter silvas academi quaerere verum horat l ii ep ii ver     the sphere of virgils education did not extend beyond mantua cremona milan and naples donat in virgil   after the accidents of civil war had introduced virgil to the knowledge of the great he passed a few years at rome in a state of dependence the juvenum nobilium cliens horat l iv od xii  it was during that time that he composed his eclogues the hasty productions of a muse capable of far greater things donat in virgil   by the liberality of augustus and his courtiers virgil soon became possessed of an affluent fortune prope centies sestertium about eighty thousand pounds  he composed the georgics and the aeneid in his elegant villas of campania and sicily and seldom quitted those pleasing retreats even to come to rome donat in virgil   after he had finished the aeneid he resolved on a journey into greece and asia to employ three years in revising and perfecting that poem and to devote the remainder of his life to the study of philosophy id ibid  he was at athens with augustus in the summer of avc     and whilst augustus was at athens the eleusinian mysteries were celebrated they always began the fifteenth of the attic month boedromion and lasted nine days those who take the trouble of calculating the athenian calendar on the principles laid down by mr dodwell de cyclis antiquis and by dr halley will find that a v c varr     the   th of boedromion coincided with the   th of august of the julian year but if we may believe dion cassius the celebration was this year anticipated on account of augustus and the indian philosopher l live p     edit reimar  it is not impossible that virgil might then be initiated as well as the indian philosopher strabo l xv p   0  but the aeneid could receive no improvement from his newlyacquired knowledge he was taken ill at megara the journey increased his disorder and he expired at brundusium the twentysecond of september of the same year     donat in virgil   should it then appear probable that virgil had no opportunity of learning the secret of the mysteries it will be something more than probable that he has not revealed what he never knew  his lordship will perhaps tell me that virgil might be initiated into the eleusinian mysteries without making a journey to athens since those mysteries had been brought to rome long before d l vol i p      here indeed i should be apt to suspect some mistake or at least a want of precision in his lordships ideas as salmasius salmasius ad scriptores hist august p    and casaubon casaubon ad scriptor hist august p     men tolerably versed in antiquity assure me that indeed some grecian ceremonies of ceres had been practiced at rome from the earliest ages but that the mysteries of eleusis were never introduced into that capital either by the emperor hadrian or by any other and i am the more induced to believe that these rites were not imported in virgils time as the accurate suetonius speaks of an unsuccessful attempt for that purpose made by the emperor claudius above threescore years after virgils death sueton in claud c      ii none but the initiated could reveal the secret of the mysteries and the initiated could not reveal it without violating the laws as well of honoras of religion i sincerely acquit the bishop of gloucester of any design yet so unfortunate is his system that it represents a most virtuous and elegant poet as equally devoid of taste and of common honesty  his lordship acknowledges that the initiated were bound to secrecy by the most solemn obligations d l vol i p      that virgil was conscious of the imputed impiety of his design that at athens he never durst have ventured on it that even at rome such a discovery was esteemed not only impious but infamous and yet his lordship maintains that after the compliment of a formal apology sit mihi fas audita loqui idem p   0  virgil lays open the whole secret of the mysteries under the thin veil of an allegory which could deceive none but the most careless readers d l vol i p       an apology an allegory such artifices might perhaps have saved him from the sentence of the areopagus had some zealous or interested priest denounced him to that court as guilty of publishing a blasphemous poem but the laws of honor are more rigid and yet more liberal than those of civil tribunals sense not words is considered and guilt is aggravated not protected by artful evasions virgil would still have incurred the severe censure of a contemporary who was himself a man of very little religion vetabo qui cereris sacrum vulgarit arcanae sub iisdem sit trabibus fragilemque mecum solvat phaselum horat l iii od ii  nor can i easily persuade myself that the ingenuous mind of virgil could have deserved this excommunication  these lines belong to an ode of horace which has every merit except that of order that death in our countrys cause is pleasant and honorable that virtue does not depend on the caprice of a popular election and that the mysteries of ceres ought not to be disclosed are ideas which have no apparent connection the beautiful disorder of lyric poetry is the usual apology made by professed critics on these occasions son style impetueux souvent march au hazard chez elle un beau desordre est un effet de l art boileau art poetique l ii v     an insufficient apology for the few who dare judge from their own feelings i shall not deny that the irregular notes of an untutored muse have sometimes delighted me we can very seldom be displeased with the unconstrained workings of nature but the liberty of an outlaw is very different from that of a savage it is a mighty disagreeable sight to observe a lyric writer of taste and reflection striving to forget the laws of composition disjointing the order of his ideas and working himself up into artificial madness ut cum ratione insaniat i had once succeeded as i thought in removing this defect by the help of an hypothesis which connected the several parts of horaces ode with each other my ideas appeared i mean to myself most ingeniously conceived i read the ode once more and burnt my hypothesis but to return to our principal subject  the date of this ode may be of use to us and the date may be fixed with tolerable certainty from the mention of the parthians who are described as the enemies against whom a brave youth should signalize his valor parthos feroces vexet eques metuendus hasta etc those who are used to the labored happiness of all horaces expressions curiosa felicitas the ingenious dr warton has a very strong dislike to this celebrated character of horace i suspect that i am in the wrong since in a point of criticism i differ from dr warton i cannot however forbear thinking that the expression is itself what petronius wished to describe the happy union of such ease as seems the gift of fortune with such justness as can only be the result of care and labor will readily allow that if the parthians are mentioned rather than the britons or cantabrians the gauls or the dalmatians it could be only at a time when a parthian war engaged the public attention this reflection confines us between the years of rome     and     of these six years that of     has a superior

animate both prince and people to revenge the manes of crassus horat l i od ii l iii od v l ii sermon i v    etc  the cautious policy of augustus still averse to war was at length roused in the year

olympo illo virgilium me tempore dulcis alebat parthenope studiis florentem ignobilis oti   whilst caesar humbled the parthians virgil was composing the aeneid it is well known that this noble poem occupied the author without being able to satisfy him during the twelve last years of his life from the year     to the year     donat in virgil  the public expectation was soon raised and the modest virgil was sometimes obbliged to gratify the impatient curiosity of his friends soon after the death of young marcellus marcellus died in the latter end of the year     usserii annals p      he recited the second fourth and sixth books of the aeneid in the presence of augustus and octavia donat in virgil  he even sometimes read parts of his work to more numerous companies with a desire of obtaining their judgment rather than their applause in this manner propertius seems to have heard the shield of aeneas and from that specimen he ventures to foretell the approaching birth of a poem which will surpass the iliad actia virgilium custodis litora phoebi caesaris and fortes dicere posse rates qui nunc aeneae trojani suscitat arma jactaque lavinis moenia litoribus cedite romani scriptores cedite graii nescio quid majus nascitur iliade propert l ii el xxv v     as a friend and as a critic horace was entitled to all virgils confidence and was probably acquainted with the whole progress of the aeneid from the first rude sketch which virgil drew up in prose to that harmonious poetry which the author alone thought unworthy of posterity  to resume my idea which depended on this long deduction of circumstances when horace composed the second ode of his third book the aeneid and particularly the sixth book were already known to the public the detestation of the wretch who reveals the mysteries of ceres though expressed in general terms must be applied by all rome to the author of the sixth book of the aeneid can we seriously suppose that horace would have branded with such want on in famy one of the men in the world whom he loved and honored the most horat l i od iii l i sermon v ver    etc   nothing remains to say except that horace was himself ignorant of his friends allegorical meaning which the bishop of gloucester has since revealed to the world it may be so yet for my own part i should be very well satisfied with understanding virgil no better than horace did  it is perhaps some such foolish fondness for antiquity which inclines me to doubt whether the bishop of gloucester has really united the severe sense of aristotle with the sublime imagination of longinus yet a judicious critic who is now i believe archdeacon of gloucester assures the public that his patrons mere amusements have done much more than the joint labors of the two grecians i shall conclude these observations with a remarkable passage from the archdeacons dedication see the dedication of horaces epistle to augustus with an english commentary and notes  it was not enough in your enlarged view of things to restore either of these models aristotle or longinus to their original splendour they were both to be revived or rather a new original plan of criticism to be struck out which should unite the virtues of each of them this experiment was made on the two greatest of our own poets shakespeare and pope and by reflecting all the lights of the imagination on the severest reason every thing was affected which the warmest admirer of ancient art could promise himself from such a union but you went farther by joining to these powers a perfect insight into human nature and so ennobling the exercise of literary by the justest moral censure you have now at length advanced criticism to its full glory  postscript i was not ignorant that several years since the rev dr jortin had favored the public with a dissertation on the state of the dead as described by homer and virgil six dissertations on different subjects published in a volume in octavo in the year      it is the sixth dissertation p  0      but the book is now grown so scarce that i was not able to procure a sight of it till after these papers had been already sent to the press i found dr jortins performance as i expected moderate learned and critical among a variety of ingenious observations there are two or three which are very closely connected with my present subject  i had passed over in silence one argument of the bishop of gloucester or rather of scarron and the bishop of gloucester since the former found the remark and the latter furnished the inference discite justitiam moniti and non temnere divos cries the unfortunate phlegyas in the midst of his torments he preaches justice and piety like ixion in pindar a very useful piece of advice says the french buffoon for those who were already damned to all eternity cette sentence est bonne and belle mais en enfer de quoi sert elle from this judicious piece of criticism his lordship argues that phlegyas was preaching not to the dead but to the living and that virgil is only describing the mimic tartarus which was exhibited at eleusis for the instruction of the initiated  i shall transcribe one or two of the reasons which dr jortin condescends to oppose to scarrons criticism  to preach to the damned says he is labor in vain and what if it is it might be part of his punishment to exhort himself and others when exhortations were too late this admonition as far as it relates to himself and his companions in misery is to be looked upon not so much as an admonition to amend but as a bitter sarcasm and reproaching of past iniquities  it is labor in vain but in the poetical system it seems to have been the occupation of the damned to labor in vain to catch at meat and drink that fled from them etc  his instruction like that of ixion in pindar might be for the use of the living you will say how can that be surely nothing is more easy and intelligible the muses hear him  the muses reveal it to the poet and the inspired poet reveals it to mankind and so much for phlegyas and monsieur scarron    it is prettily observed by dr jortin that virgil after having shone out with full splendour through the sixth book sets at last in a cloud the ivory gate puzzles every commentator and grieves every lover of virgil yet it affords no advantages to the bishop of gloucester the objection presses as hard on the notion of an initiation as on that of a real descent to the shades the troublesome conclusion still remains as it was and from the manner in which the hero is dismissed after the ceremonies we learn that in those initiations the machinery and the whole show was in the poets opinion a representation of things which had no truth or reality altera candenti perfecta nitens elephanto sed falsa ad coelum mittunt insomnia manes   dreams in general may be called vain and deceitful somnia vana or somnia falsa if you will as they are opposed to the real objects which present themselves to us when we are awake but when false dreams are opposed to true ones there the epithet falsa has another meaning true dreams represent what is real and show what is true false dreams represent things which are not or which are not true thus homer and virgil and many other poets and indeed the nature of the thing distinguish them  dr jortin though with reluctance acquiesces in the common opinion that by six unlucky lines virgil is destroying the beautiful system which it had cost him eight hundred to raise he explains too this preposterous conduct by the usual expedient of the poets epicureism i only differ from him in attributing to haste and indiscretion what he considers as the result of design  another reason both new and ingenious is assigned by dr jortin for virgil explaining away his heros descent into an idle dream all communication with the dead the infernal powers etc belonged to the art magic and magic was held in abomination by the romans yet if it was held in abomination it was supposed to be real a writer would not have made his court to james the first by representing the stories of witchcraft as the phantoms of an overheated imagination  whilst i am writing a sudden thought occurs to me which rude and imperfect as it is i shall venture to throw out to the public it is this after virgil in imitation of homer had described the two gates of sleep the horn and the ivory he again takes up the first in a different sense qua veris facilis datur exitus umbris the true shades verae umbrae were those airy forms which were continually sent to animate new bodies such light and almost immaterial natures as could without difficulty pass through a thin transparent substance in this new sense aeneas and the sybill who were still incumbered with a load of flesh could not pretend to the prerogative of true shades in their passage over styx they had almost sunk charons boat gemuit sub pondere cymba sutilis and multam accepit rimosa paludem   some other expedient was requisite for their return and since the horn gate would not afford them an easy dismission the other passage which was adorned with polished ivory was the only one that remained either for them or for the poet  by this explanation we save virgils judgment and religion though i must own at the expense of an uncommon harshness and ambiguity of expression let it only be remembered that those who in desperate cases conjecture with modesty have a right to be heard with indulgence  finis
