the school for wives  a comedy  as it is performed at the theater royal in drury lane  london printed for t becket in the strand       price one shilling and sixpence  preface the author of the following performance cannot commit it to the press without acknowledging the deepest sense of gratitude for the uncommon marks of approbation with which he has been honored by the public  though he has chosen a title used by moliere he has neither borrowed a single circumstance from that great poet nor to the best of his recollection from any other writer  his chief study has been to steer between the extremes of sentimental gloom and the excesses of uninteresting levity he has some laugh yet he hopes he has also some lesson and fashionable as it has been lately for the wits even with his friend mr garrick at their head to ridicule the comic muse when a little grave he must think that she degenerates into farce where the grand business of instruction is neglected and consider it as a heresy in criticism to say that one of the most arduous tasks within the reach of literature should when executed be wholly without utility  the author having been presumptuous enough to assert that he has not purloind a single sprig of bays from the brow of any other writer he may perhaps be asked if there are not several plays in the english language which before his produced generals lawyers irishmen duels masquerades and mistakes he answers yes and confesses moreover that all the comedies before his were composed not only of men and women but that before his the great business of comedy consisted in making difficulties for the purpose of removing them in distressing poor young lovers and in rendering a happy marriage the object of every catastrophe  yet though the author of the school for wives pleads guilty to all these charges still in extenuation of his offense he begs leave to observe that having only men and women to introduce upon the stage he was obliged to compose his dramatis personae of mere flesh and blood if however he has thrown this flesh and this blood into new situations if he has given a new fable and placed his characters in a point of light hitherto unexhibited  he flatters himself that he may call his play a new play and though it did not exist before the creation of the world like the famous welsh pedigree that he may have some small pretensions to originality  two things besides the general moral inculcated through his piece the author has attempted the first to rescue the law as a profession from ridicule or obliquy and the second to remove the imputation of a barbarous ferocity which dramatic writers even meaning to compliment the irish nation have connected with their idea of that gallant people  the law like every other profession may have members who occasionally disgrace it but to the glory of the british name it is well know that in the worst of times it has produced numbers whose virtues reflected honor upon human nature many of the noblest privileges the constitution has to boast of were derived from the integrity or the wisdom of lawyers yet the stage has hitherto cast an indiscriminate stigma upon the whole body and labored to make that profession either odious or contemptible in the theater which if the laws are indeed dear to good englishmen can never be too much respected in this kingdom there is scarcely a play in which a lawyer is introduced that is not a libel upon the long robe and so ignorant have many dramatic writers been that they have made no distinction whatever between the characters of the first barristers in westminster hall and the meanest solicitors at the old bailey  with respect to the gentlemen of ireland where even an absolve attempt is manifested to place them in a favorable point of view they are drawn with a brutal promptitude to quarrel which is a disgrace to the well known humanity of their country  the gentlemen of ireland have doubtless a quick sense of honor and like the gentlemen of england as well as like the gentlemen of every other highspirited nation are perhaps unhappily too ready to draw the sword where they conceive themselves injured  but to make them proud of a barbarous propensity to duelling to make them actually delight in the effusion of blood is to fasten a very unjust reproach upon their general character and to render them universally obnoxious to society the author of the school for wives therefore has given a different picture of irish manners though in humble life and flatters himself that those who are really acquainted with the original will acknowledge it to be at least a tolerable resemblance  it would be ungrateful in the highest degree to close this preface without acknowleging the very great obligations which the author has to mr garrick every attention which either as a manager or as a man he could give to the interest of the following play he has bestowed with the most generous alacrity but universally admired as he is at present his intrinsic value will not be known till his loss is deplored and the public have great reason to wish that this may be a very distant event in the annals of the theater the epilogue sufficiently marks the masterly hand from which it originated so does the comic commencement of the prologue and the elegant writer of the graver part is a character of distinguished eminence in the literary republic  it has been remarked with great justice that few new pieces were ever better performed than the school for wives mr king that highlydeserving favorite of the town was every thing the author could possibly wish in general savage mr reddish acquired a very considerable share of merited reputation in belville mr moody is unequalled in his irishmen mr palmer from his manner of supporting leeson was entitled to a much better part and mr weston in torington was admirable miss young in mrs belville extorted applause from the coldest auditor her tenderness  her force  her pathos were the true effusions of genius and proved that she has no superior where the feelings are to be interested with respect to mrs abington enough can never be said the elegance the vivacity the critical nicety with which she went through miss walsingham is only to be guessed at by those who are familiar with the performance of that exquisite actress her epilogue was delivered with an animation not to be conceived and manifested the strict propriety with which she is called the first priestess of the comic muse in this country  jan        the school for wives being a comedy in which the ladies are particularly interested it should be addressed to the first ornament of the sex and is therefore inscribed with the highest admiration and the most profound reverence to her majesty not because she is the greatest of queens but because in the milder and more endearing relations of life she is the brightest pattern of all the female virtues  january

young lady rachel mildew mrs hopkins mrs tempest mrs greville miss leeson miss jarratt maid mrs millidge the school for wives act i scene an apartment at belvilles enter captain savage and miss walsingham capt ha ha ha well miss walsingham this fury is going what a noble peal she has rung in belvilles ears   miss wall did she see you captain savage   capt no i took care of that for though she isnt married to my father she has ten times the influence of a wife and might injure me not a little with him if i didnt support her side of the question   miss wall it was a pleasant conceit of mr belville to insinuate the poor woman was disordered in her senses    capt and did you observe how the termagants violence of temper supported the probability of the charge   miss wall yes she became almost frantic in reality when she found herself treated like a madwoman   capt belvilles affected surprise too was admirable   miss wall yes the hypocritical composure of his countenance and his counterfeit pity for the poor woman were intolerable   capt while that amiable creature his wife implicitly believed every syllable he said    miss wall and felt nothing but pity for the accuser instead of paying the least regard to the accusation but pray is it really under a pretense of getting the girl upon the stage that belville has taken away mrs tempests neice from the people she boarded with   capt it is belville ever on the look out for fresh objects met her in those primitive regions of purity the greenboxes where discovering that she was passionately desirous of becoming an actress he improved his acquaintance with her in the fictitious character of an irish manager and she eloped last night to be as she imagines the heroine of a dublin theater   miss wall so then as he has kept his real name artfully concealed mrs tempest can at most but suspect him of miss leesons seduction   capt of no more and this only from the description of the people who saw him in company with her at the play but i wish the affair may not have a serious conclusion for she has a brother a very spirited young fellow who is a council in the temple and who will certainly call belville to an account the moment he hears of it   miss wall and what will become of the poor creature after he has deserted her   capt you know that belville is generous to profusion and has a thousand good qualities to counterbalance this single fault of gallantry which contaminates his character   miss wall you men you men  you are such wretches that there is no having a moments satisfaction with you and what is still more provoking there is no having a moments satisfaction without you   capt nay dont think us all alike   miss wall i will endeavor to deceive myself for it is but a poor argument of your sincerity to be the confidant of anothers falsehood   capt nay no more of this my love no people live happier than belville and his wife nor is there a man in england notwithstanding all his levity who considers his wife with a warmer degree of affection if you have a friendship therefore for her let her continue in an error so necessary to her repose and give no hint whatever of his gallantries to any body   miss wall if i had no pleasure in obliging you i have too much regard for mrs belville not to follow your advice but you need not enjoin me so strongly on the subject when you know i can keep a secret   capt you are all goodness and the prudence with which you have concealed our private engagements has eternally obliged me had you trusted the secret even to mrs belville it would not have been safe she would have told her husband and he is such a rattleskul that notwithstanding all his regard for me he would have mentioned it in some moment of levity and sent it in a course of circulation to my father   miss wall the peculiarity of your fathers temper joined to my want of fortune made it necessary for me to keep our engagements inviolably secret there is no merit therefore either in my prudence or in my laboring assiduously to cultivate the good opinion of the general since both were so ecessary to my own happiness dont despise me for this acknowledgement now   capt bewitching softness  but your goodness i flatter myself will be speedily rewarded you are now such a favorite with him that he is eternally talking of you and i really fancy he means to propose you to me himself for last night in a few minutes after he had declared you would make the best wife in the world he seriously asked me if i had any aversion to matrimony   miss wall why that was a very great concession indeed as he seldom stoops to consult any bodys inclinations   capt so it was i assure you for in the army being used to nothing but command and obedience he removes the discipline of the parade into his family and no more expects his orders should be disputed in matters of a domestic nature than if they were delivered at the head of his regiment   miss wall and yet mrs tempest who you say is as much a storm in her nature as her name is disputing them eternally   enter mr and mrs belville bell well miss walsingham havnt we had a pretty mornings visitor   miss wall really i think so and i have been asking capt savage how long the lady has been disordered in her senses   bell why will they let the poor woman abroad without some body to take care of her   capt o she has her lucid intervals   miss wall i declare i shall be as angry with you as i am with belville aside to the captain   mrs bell you cannot think how sensibly she spoke at first   bell i should have had no conception of her madness if she had not brought so preposterous a charge against me   enter a servant ser lady rachel mildew madam sends her compliments and if you are not particularly engaged will do herself the pleasure of waiting upon you   mrs bell our compliments and we shall be glad to see her ladyship ex servant   bell i wonder if lady rachel knows that torrington came to town last night from bath   mrs bell i hope he has found benefit by the waters for he is one of the best creatures existing he is a downright parson adams in good nature and simplicity   miss wall lady rachel will be quite happy at his return and it would be a laughable affair if a match could be brought about between the old maid and the old bachelor   capt mr torrington is too much taken up at westminster hall to think of paying his devoirs to the ladies and too plain a speaker i fancy to be agreeable to lady rachel   bell you mistake the matter widely she is deeply smitten with him but honest torrington is utterly unconscious of his conquest and modestly thinks that he has not a single attraction for any woman in the universe   mrs bell yet my poor aunt speaks sufficiently plain in all conscience to give him a different opinion of himself   miss wall yes and puts her charms into such repair whenever she expects to meet him that her cheeks look for all the world like a rasberry ice upon a ground of custard   capt i thought apollo was the only god of lady rachels idolatary and that in her passion for poetry she had taken leave of all the less elevated affections   bell o you mistake again the poets are eternally in love and can by no means be calculated to describe the imaginary passions without being very susceptible of the real ones   enter servant ser the man madam from tavistockstreet has brought home the dresses for the masquerade and desires to know if there are any commands for him   mrs bell o bid him stay till we see the dresses   ex servant miss wall they are only dominos   bell i am glad of that for characters are as difficult to be supported at the masquerade as they are in real life the last time i was at the pantheon a vestal virgin invited me to sup with her and swore that her pocket had been picked by a justice of peace   miss wall nay that was not so bad as the hamlets ghost that boxd with henry the eighth and afterward danced a hornpipe to the tune of nancy dawson ha ha ha  we follow you mrs belville exeunt   scene changes to leeson s chambers in the temple enter leeson lees where is this clerk of mine

hangs upon my spirits though i have every reason from the tenderness the politeness and the generosity of mr belville as well as from the womans behavior to believe the whole charge the result of a disturbed imagination  yet suppose it should be actually true  heigho  well suppose it should  i would endeavor  i think i would endeavor to keep my temper  a frowning face never recovered a heart that was not to be fixed with a smiling one  but women in general forget this grand article of the matrimonial creed entirely the dignity of insulted virtue obliges them to play the fool whenever their corydons play the libertine  and poh they must pull down the house about the traitors ears though they are themselves to be crushed in pieces by the ruins   enter a servant ser lady rachel mildew madam exit ser   enter lady rachel mildew lady rach my dear how have you done since the little eternity of my last seeing you mr torrington is come to town i hear   mrs bell he is and must be greatly flattered to find that your ladyship has made him the hero of your new comedy   lady rach yes i have drawn him as he is an honest practitioner of the law which is i fancy no very common character    mrs bell and it must be a vast acquisition to the theater   lady rach yet the managers of both houses have refused my play have refused it peremptorily though i offered to make them a present of it   mrs bell that is very surprising when you offered to make them a present of it   lady rach they allege that the audiences are tired of crying at comedies and insist that my despairing shepherdess is absolutely too dismal for representation   mrs bell what though you have introduced a lawyer in a new light   lady rach yes and have a boardingschool romp that slps her mothers face and throws a basin of scalding water at her governess   mrs bell why surely these are capital jokes   lady rach but the managers cannot find them out  however i am determined to bring it out somewhere and i have discovered such a treasure for my boardingschool romp as exceeds the most sanguine expectation of criticism   mrs bell how fortunate   lady rach goings to mrs le blond my milleners this morning to see some contraband silks for you know there is a foreign minister just arrived i heard a loud voice rehearsing juliet from the dining room and upon enquiry found that it was a country girl just elopd from her friends in town to go upon the stage with an irish manager   mrs bell ten to one the strange womans neice who has been here this morning aside   lady rach mrs le blond has some doubts about the manager it seems though she hasnt seen him yet because the apartments are very expensive and were taken by a fine gentleman out of livery   mrs bell what am i to think of this  pray lady rachel as you have conversed with this young actress i suppose you could procure me a sight of her   lady rach this moment if you will i am very intimate with her already but pray keep the matter a secret from your husband for he is so witty you know upon my passion for the drama that i shall be teized to death by him   mrs bell o you may be very sure that your secret is safe for i have a most particular reason to keep it from mr belville but he is coming this way with captain savage let us at present avoid him exeunt   enter belville and captain savage capt you are a very strange man belville you are for ever tremblingly solicitous about the happiness of your wife yet for ever endangering it by your passion for variety   bell why there is certainly a contradiction between my principles and my practice but if ever you marry you will be able to reconcile it perfectly possession savage o possession is a miserable whetter of the appetite in love and i own myself so sad a fellow that though i would not exchange mrs belvilles mind for any womans upon earth there is scarcely a womans person upon earth which is not to me a stronger object of attraction   capt then perhaps in a little time you will be weary of miss leeson   bell to be sure i shall though to own the truth i have not yet carried my point conclusively with the little monkey   capt why how the plague has she escaped a moment in your hands   bell by a mere accident  she came to the lodgings which my man spruce prepared for her rather unexpectedly last night so that i happened to be engaged particularly in another quarter  you understand me  and the damned aunt found me so much employment all the morning that i could only send a message by spruce promising to call upon her the first moment i had to spare in the course of the day   capt and so your are previously satisfied that you shall be tired of her   bell tired of her  why i am at this moment in pursuit of fresh game against the hour of satiety  game that you know to be exquisite and i fancy i shall bring it down though it is closely guarded by a deal of that pride which passes for virtue with the generallity of your mighty good people   capt indeed and may a body know this wonder   bell you are to be trusted with any thing for you are the closest fellow i ever knew and the rack itself would hardly make you discover one of your own secrets to any body  what do you think of miss walsingham   capt miss walsingham  death and the devil   aside bell miss walsingham   capt why surely she has not received your addresses with any degree of approbation   bell with every degree of approbation i could expect   capt she has   bell ay why this news surprises you   capt it does indeed   bell ha ha ha i cannot help laughing to think what a happy dog miss walsinghams husband is likely to be   capt a very happy dog truly   bell she is a delicious girl isnt she savage  but she will require a little more trouble  for a fine woman like a fortified town to speak in your fathers language demands a regular siege and we must even allow her the honors of war to magnify the greatness of our own victory   capt well it amazes me how you gay fellows ever have the presumption to attack a woman of principle miss walsingham has no apparent levity of any kind about her   bell no but she continued in my house after i had whispered my passion in her ear and gave me a second opportunity of addressing her improperly what greater encouragement could i desire  enter spruce well spruce what are your commands   spruce my lady is just gone out with lady rachel sir   bell i understand you   spruce i believe you do  aside exit   capt what is the english of these significant looks between spruce and you   bell only that miss walsingham is left alone and that i have now an opportunity of entertaining her you must excuse me savage you must upon my soul but not a word of this affair to any body because when i shake her off my hands there may be fools enough to think of her upon terms of honorable matrimony exit   capt so here is a discovery a precious discovery and while i have been racking my imagination and sacrificing my interest to promote the happiness of this woman she has been listening to the addresses of another to the addresses of a married man the husband of her friend and the immediate friend of her intended husband  by belvilles own account however she has not yet proceeded to any criminal lengths  but why did she keep the affair a secret from me or why did she continue in his house after a repeated declaration of his unwarrantable attachment  what is to be done  if i open my engagement with her to belville i am sure he will instantly desist  but then her honor is left in a state extremely questionable  it shall be still concealed  while it remains unknown belville will himself tell me every thing  and doubt upon an occasion of this nature is infinitely more insupportable than the downright falsehood of the woman whom we love   exit the end of the first act act ii scene an apartment in general savages house enter general savage and torrington genesis zounds torrington give me quarter when i surrender up my sword i own that for these twenty years i have been suffering all the inconveniences of marriage without tasting any one of its comforts and rejoicing in an imaginary freedom while i was really grovelling in chains   tor in the dirtiest chains upon earth  yet you would not be convinced but laughed at all your married acquaintance as slaves when not one of them put up with half so much from the worst wife as you were obliged to crouch under from a kept mistress   genesis it is too true but you know she sacrificed much for me  you know that she was the widow of a colonel and refused two very advantageous matches on my account    tor if she was the widow of a judge and had refused a high chancellor she was still a devil incarnate and you were of course a madman to live with her   genesis you dont remember her care of me when i have been sick    tor i recollect however her usage of you in health and you may easily find a tenderer nurse when you are bound over by the gout or the rheumatism   genesis well well i agree with you that she is a devil incarnate but i am this day determined to part with her for ever   tor not you indeed   genesis what dont i know my own mind   tor not you indeed when she is in the question with every body else your resolution is as unalterable as a determination in the house of peers but mrs tempest is your fate and she reverses your decrees with as little difficulty as a fraudulent debtor nowadays procures his certificate under a commission of bankruptcy   genesis well if like the roman fabius i conquer by delay in the end there will be no great reason to find fault with my generalship the proposal of parting now comes from herself   tor o you darnt make it for the life of you   genesis you must know that this morning we had a smart cannonnading on belvilles account and she threatens as i told you before to quit my house if i dont challenge him for taking away her neice   tor that fellow is the very devil among the women and yet there is not a man in england fonder of his wife   genesis poh if the young minx had not surrendered to him she would have capitulated to somebody else and i shall at this time be doubly obliged to him if he is any ways isntrumental in getting the aunt off my hands   tor why at this time   genesis because to show you how fixed my resolution is to be a keeper no longer i mean to marry immediately   tor and cannot you avoid being pressed to death like a felon who refuses to plead without incurring a sentence of perpetual imprisonment   genesis i fancy you would yourself have no objection to a perpetual imprisonment in the arms of miss walsingham   tor but have you any reason to think that upon examination in a case of love she would give a favorable reply to your interrogatories   genesis the greatest  do you think i would hazard such an engagement without being perfectly sure of my ground notwithstanding my present connection will not suffer me to see a modest woman at my own house  she always treats me with particular attention whenever i visit at belvilles or meet her any where else  if fifty young fellows are present she directs all her assiduities to the old soldier and my son has a thousand times told me that she professes the highest opinion of my understanding   tor and truly you give a notable proof of your understanding in thinking of a woman almost young enough to be your granddaughter   genesis nothing like an experienced chief to command in any garrison   tor recollect the state of your present citadel   genesis well if i am blown up by my own mine i shall be the only sufferer  there is another thing i want to talk of i am going to marry my son to miss moreland   tor miss moreland    genesis belvilles sister   tor

she only waits to communicate it to belville who is her oracle you know   tor and are you sure the captain will like her   genesis i am not so unreasonable as to insist upon his liking her i shall only insist upon his marrying her   tor what whether he likes her or not   genesis when i issue my orders i expect them to be obeyed and dont look for an examination into their propriety   tor what a delightful thing it must be to live under a military government where a man is not to be troubled with the exercise of his understanding   genesis miss moreland has thirty thousand pounds  that is a large sum of ammunition money   tor ay but a marriage merely on the score of fortune is only gilding the deathwarrant sent down for the execution of a prisoner however as i know your obstinate attachment to what you once resolve i shall not pretend to argue with you where are the papers which you want me to consider   genesis they are in my library  file off with me to the next room and they shall be laid before you  but first i will order the chariot for the moment i have your opinion i purpose to sit down regularly before miss walsingham  who waits there   enter a servant genesis

you rascal if both pannels were broke and the back shattered to pieces   serve the coachman thinks that one of the wheels is damaged sir   genesis dont attempt to reason you dog but execute your orders  bring the chariot without the wheels  if you cannot bring it with them   tor ay bring it if you reduce it to a sledge and let your master look like a malefactor for high treason on his journey

master  though indeed i dont see what business he has ut of the house   exeunt mrs tempest and robert tor when you issu your orders you expect them to be byd and dont look for an examination into their propriety   genesis the fury  this has steeled me against her for ever and nothing on earth can now prevent me from drumming her out immediately   mrs temp behind an unreasonable old fool  but i will make him know who governs this house   genesis zounds here she comes again she has been lying in ambuscade i suppose and has over heard us   tor what if she has you are steeled against her for ever   genesis no she is not coming  she is going down stairs  and now dear torrington you must be as silent as a sentinel on an outpost about this affair if that virago was to hear a syllable of it she might perhaps attack miss walsingham in her very camp and defeat my whole plan of operations   tor i thought you were determined to drum her out immediately exeunt   the scene changes to belvilles enter miss walsingham followed by belville miss wall i beg sir that you will insult me no longer with solicitations of this nature  give me proofs of your sincerity indeed what proofs of sincerity can your situation admit of if i could be even weak enough to think of you with partiality at all   bell if our affections madam were under the government of our reason circumstanced as i am this unhappy bosom wouldnt be torn by passion for miss walsingham  had i been blessed with your acquaintance before i saw mrs belville my hand as well as my heart would have been humbly offered to your acceptance  fate however has ordered it otherwise and it is cruel to reproach me with that situation as a crime which ought to be pitied as my greatest misfortune   miss wall he is actually forcing tears into his eyes  however i will mortify him severely  aside   bell but such proofs of sincerity as my situation can admit of you shall yourself command as my only business in existence is to adore you   miss wall his only business in existence to adore me  aside   bell prostrate at your feet my dearest miss walsingham kneeling behold a heart eternally devoted to your service  you have too much good sense madam to be the slave of custom and too much humanity not to pity the wretchedness you have caused  only therefore say that you commiserate my sufferings  i will ask no more  and surely that may be said without any injury to your purity to snatch even an enemy from distraction  where is my handkerchief aside   miss wall now to answer in his own way and to make him ridiculous to himself  aside if i thought if i could think  affecting to weep that these protestations were real   bell how can you madam be so unjust to your own merit how can you be so cruelly doubtful of my solemn asseverations  here i again kneel and swear eternal love   miss wall i dont know what to say  but there is one proof  affecting to weep   bell name it my angel this moment and make me the happiest of mankind   miss wall swear to be mine for ever   bell i have sworn it a thousand times my charmer and i will swear it to the last moment of my life   miss wall why then  but dont look at me i beseech you  i dont know how to speak it    bell the delicious emotion  do not check the generous tide of tenderness that fills me with such ecstasy   miss wall you will despise me for this weakness   bell this weakness  this generosity which will demand my everlasting gratitude   miss wall i am a fool  but there is a kind of fatality in this affair  and i do consent to go off with you   bell eternal blessings on your condescension   miss wall you are irresistible and i am ready to fly with you to any part of the world   bell fly to any part of the world indeed  you shall fly by yourself then  aside you are the most lovely the most tender creature in the world and thus again let me thank you o miss walsingham i cannot express how happy you have made me  but where is the necessity of our leaving england    miss wall i thought he wouldnt like to go abroad   aside that i may possess the pleasure of your company unrivaled   bell i must cure her of this taste for traveling     aside miss wall you dont answer mr belville   bell why i was turning the consequence of your proposal in my thoughts as going off  going off  you know    miss wall why going off you know is going off  and what objections can you have to going off   bell why going off will subject you at a certainty to the slander of the world whereas by staying at home we may not only have numberless opportunities of meeting but at the same time prevent suspicion it self from ever breathing on your reputation   miss wall i didnt dream of your starting any difficulties sir  just now i was dearer to you than all the world   bell and so you are by heaven   miss wall why will not you sacrifice the world then at once to obtain me   bell surely my dearest life you must know the necessity which every man of honor is under of keeping up his character   miss wall so here is this fellow swearing to ten thousand lies and yet talking very gravely about his honor and his character aside why to be sure in these days mr belville the instances of conjugal infidelity are so very scarce and men of fashion are so remarkable for a tender attachment to their wives that i dont wonder at your circumspection  but do you think i can stoop to accept you by halves or admit of any partnership in your heart   bell o you must do more than that if you have any thing to say to me aside surely madam when you know my whole soul unalterably your own you will permit me to preserve those appearances with the world which are indispensibly requisite  mrs belville is a most excellent woman however it may be my fortune to be devoted to another  her happiness besides constitutes a principal part of my felicity and if i was publicly to forsake her i should be hunted as a monster from society   miss wall then i suppose it is by way of promoting mrs belvilles repose sir that you make love to other women and by way of showing the nicety of your honor that you attempt the purity of such as your own roof peculiarly intitles to protection for the honor intended to me  thus low to the ground i thank you mr belville   bell laughed at by all the stings of mortification   miss wall good bye  dont let this accident mortify your vanity too much  but take care the next time you vow everlasting love that the object is neither tender enough to sob  sob  at your distress nor provoking enough to make a proposal of leaving england  how greatly a little common sense can lower these fellows of extraordinary impudence   exit bell alone so then i am fairly taken in and she has been only diverting herself with me all this time  however lady fair i may chance to have the laugh in a little time on my side for if you can sport in this manner about the flame i think it must in the run lay hold of your wings  what shall i do in this affair  she sees the matter in its true light and there is no good to be expected from thumping of bosoms or squeezing white handkerchiefs  no these will not do with women of sense and in a short time they will be ridiculous to the very babies of a boardingschool   enter captain savage capt well belville what news you have had a fresh opportunity with miss walsingham   bell why faith savage i have had a most extraordinary scene with her and yet have but little reason to brag of my good fortune though she offered in express terms to run away with me   capt prithee explain yourself man she could not surely be so shameless   bell o her offering to run away with me was by no means the worst part of the affair   capt no then it must be damned bad indeed but prithee hurry to an explanation   bell why then the worst part of the affair is that she was laughing at me the whole time and made this proposal of an elopement with no other view than to show me in strong colors to myself as a very dirty fellow to the best wife in england   capt i am easy aside   enter spruce spruce sir there is an irish gentleman below with a letter for you who will deliver it to nobody but yourself   bell show him up then   spruce yes sir exit   capt it may be on business belville i will take my leave of you   bell o by no means i can have no business which i desire to keep from you though you are the arrantst miser of

you is mr belville   bell my name is belville at your service sir   con i have a little bit of a letter for you sir   bell  reads sir the people where miss leeson lately lodged asserting positively that you have taken her away in a fictitious character the brother of that unhappy girl thinks himself obliged to demand satisfaction for the injury which you have done his family though a stranger to your person he is sufficiently acquainted with your reputation for spirit and shall therefore make no doubt of seeing you with a case of pistols near the ring in hyde park at eight oclock this evening to answer the claims of  george leeson  to craggs belville esquire     capt eight oclock in the evening it is a strange time   con why so honey a fine evening is as good a time for a bad action as a fine morning and if a man of sense can be such a fool as to fight a duel he should never sleep upon the matter for the more he thinks of it the more he must feel himself ashamed of his resolution   bell a pretty letter   con o yes an invitation to a brace of bullets is a very pretty thing   bell for a challenge however it is very civilly written   con faith if it was written to me i shoudnt be very fond of such civility i wonder he does not sign himself your most obedient servant   capt i told you leesons character and what would become of this damned business but your affairs  are they settled belville   bell o they are always settled  for as this is a country where people occasionally die i take constant care to be prepared for contingencies   con occasionally die  i will be very much obliged to you sir if you tell me the country where people do not die for i will immediately go and end my days there   bell ha ha ha   con faith you may laugh gintlemin but though i am a foolish irishman and come about a foolish piece of business i would prefer a snug birth in this world bad as it is to the finest coffin in all christendom   bell i am surprised sir that thinking in this manner you would be the bearer of a challenge   con and well you may sir  but we must often take a pleasure in serving our friends by doing things that are very disagreeable to us   capt then you think mr leeson much to blame perhaps for hazarding his life where he can by no means repair the honor of his sister   con indeed and i do  but i shall think this gintleman begging his pardon much more to blame for meeting him   bell and why so sir  you woudnt have me disappoint your friend   con faith and that i would  he poor lad may have some reason at present to be tired of the world but you have a fine estate a fine wife a fine parcel of children  in short honey you have every thing to make you fond of living and the devil burn me was i in your case if i would stake my own happiness against the misery of any man   bell i am very much obliged to your advice sir though on the present occasion i cannot adopt it be so good as to present my compliments to your friend and tell him i shall certainly do myself the honor of attending his appointment   con why then upon my soul i am very sorry for it   capt it is not very customary sir with gentlemen of ireland to oppose an affair of honor   con they are like the gintlemin of england sir they are brave to a fault yet i hope to see the day that it will be infamous to draw the swords of either against any body but the enemies of their country   exit bell i am quite charmed with this honest hibernian and would almost fight a duel for the pleasure of his acquaintance   capt come step with me a little and let us consider whether there may not be some method of accommodating this cursed business   bell poh dont be uneasy upon my account my character with regard to affairs of this nature is unhappily too well established and you may be sure that i shall not fight with leeson   capt no  you have injured him greatly   bell the very reason of all others why i should not cut his throat exeunt   enter spruce spruce what the devil this master of mine has got a a duel upon his hands zounds i am sorry for that he is a prince of a fellow and a good subject must always love his prince though he may now and then be a little

occasion to inform her of it for here she is spruce exit spruce   enter miss walsingham miss wall general savage your most humble servant   genesis my dear miss walsingham it is rather cruel that you should be left at home by yourself and yet i am greatly rejoiced to find you at present without company   miss wall i cannot but think myself in the best company when i have the honor of your conversation general   genesis you flatter me too much madam yet i am come to talk to you on a serious affair miss walsingham an affair of importance to me and to yourself have you leisure to favor me with a short audience if i beat a parley   miss wall any thing of importance to you sir is always sufficient to command my leisure  it is as the captain suspected aside   genesis you tremble my lovely girl but dont be alarmed for though my business is of an important nature i hope it will not be of a disagreeable one   miss wall and yet i am greatly agitated aside   genesis soldiers miss walsingham are said to be generally favored by the kind partiality of the ladies   miss wall the ladies are not without gratitude sir to those who devote their lives peculiarly to the service of their country   genesis generously said madam then give me leave without any masked battery to ask if the heart of an honest soldier is a prize at all worth your acceptance   miss wall upon my word sir there is no masked battery in this question   genesis i am as fond of a coup de main madam in love as in war and hate the tedious method of sapping a town when there is a possibility of entering sword in hand   miss wall why really sir a woman may as well know her own mind when she is first summoned by the trumpet of a lover as when she undergoes all the tiresome formality of a siege you see i have caught your own mode of conversing general   genesis and a very great compliment i consider it madam but now that you have heartily confessed an acquaintance with your own mind answer me with that frankness for which every body admires you so much have you any objection to change the name of walsingham   miss wall why then frankly general savage i say no   genesis ten thousand thanks to you for this kind declaration   miss wall i hope you will not think it a forward one   genesis i would sooner see my son run away in the day of battle  i would sooner think lord russell was bribed by lewis the xivth and sooner villify the memory of algernoon sidney   miss wall how unjust it was ever to suppose the general a tyrannical father aside   genesis you have told me condescendingly miss walsingham that you have no objection to change your name i have but one question more to ask   miss wall pray propose it   genesis would the name of savage be disagreeable to you  speak frankly again my dear girl   miss wall why then again i frankly say no   genesis you make me too happy and though i shall readily own that a proposal of this nature would come with more propriety from my son    miss wall i am much better pleased that you make the proposal yourself sir   genesis you are too good to me  torrington thought that i should meet with a repulse aside   miss wall have you communicated this business to the captain sir   genesis no my dear madam i did not think that at all necessary i have always been attentive to the captains happiness and i propose that he shall be married in a few days   miss wall what whether i will or no   genesis o you can have no objection   miss wall i must be consulted however about the day general but nothing in my power shall be wanting to make him happy   genesis obliging loveliness   miss wall you may imagine that if i was not previously impressed in favor of your proposal it would not have met my concurrence so readily   genesis then you own that i had a previous friend in the garrison   miss wall i dont blush to acknowledge it when i consider the accomplishments of the object sir   genesis o this is too much madam the principle merit of the object is his passion for miss walsingham   miss wall dont say that general i beg of you for i dont think there are many women in the kingdom who could behold him with indifference   genesis ah you flattering flattering angel  and yet by the memory of marlborough my lovely girl it was the idea of a prepossession on your part which encouraged me to hope for a favorable reception   miss wall then i must have been very indiscreet for i labored to conceal that prepossession as much as possible   genesis you could not conceal it from me you could not conceal it from me  the female heart is a field which i am thoroughly acquainted with and which has more than once been a witness to my victories madam   miss wall i dont at all doubt your success with the ladies general but as we now understand one another so perfectly you will give me leave to retire   genesis one word my dear creature and no more i shall wait upon you sometime to day with mr torrington about the necessary settlements   miss wall you must do as you please general you are invincible in every thing   genesis and if you please well keep every thing a profound secret till the articles are all settled and the definitive treaty ready

against miss walsingham mistakes have already happened mistakes may happen again and i will not give up a ladys honor upon an evidence that would not cast a common pickpocket at the old baily   capt come to the masquerade then and be convinced   genesis let us detach a party for dresses immediately yet remember torrington that the punctuality of evidence which is necessary in a court of law is by

it is now time you should see your sister i know you will be gentle with her though you have so much reason to condemn her choice and generously remember that her elopement proceeded from the great improbability there was of a beggars ever meeting with the approbation of her family   bell dont apologize for your circumstances leeson a princess could do no more than make you happy and if you make her so you meet her upon terms of the most perfect equality   lees this is a new way of thinking mr belville   bell it is only an honest way of thinking and i consider my sister a gainer upon the occasion for a man of your merit is more difficult to be found than a woman of her fortune exeunt leeson and belville   con what is the reason now that i cannot skip and laugh and rejoice at this affair upon my soul my hearts as full as if i had met with some great misfortune well pleasure in the extreme is certainly a very painful thing i am really ashamed of these womans drops and yet i dont

miss walsingham expects to find you there burning with impatience  but my dear friend after the occurrences of the day can you be weak enough to plunge into fresh crimes can you be base enough to abuse the goodness of that angel your wife and wicked enough not only to destroy the innocence which is sheltered beneath your own roof but to expose your family perhaps again to the danger of losing a son a brother a father and a husband the possession of the three graces is surely too poor a recompense for the folly you must commit for the shame you must feel and the consequences you must hazard upon my soul if i struggle a little longer i shall rise in my own opinion and be less a rascal than i think myself  ay but the object is bewitching  the matter will be an eternal secret  and if it is known that i sneak in this pitiful manner from a fine woman when the whole elysium of her person solicits me  well and am i afraid the world should know that i have shrunk from an infamous action  a thousand blessings on you dear conscience for that one argument  i shall be an honest man after all  suppose however that i give her the meeting that is dangerous  that is dangerous  and i am so little accustomed to do what is right that i shall certainly do what is wrong the moment i am in the way of temptation come belville your resolution is not so very slender a dependence and you owe miss walsingham reparation for the injury which you have done her principles i will give her the meeting  i will take her to the house i intended  i will  zounds what a fool i have been all this time

make her comply i should be at no loss for language aside the situation in which i must appear before you madam is certainly a very humiliating one but i am persuaded that your generosity will be

not die in his debt for the present obligation   capt and depend upon it sir pay the obligation when you will i shall not stir till i see miss walsingham  lookee belville there are secret reasons for my behaving in this manner reasons which you yourself will approve when you know them  my father here    genesis disavows your conduct in every particular and would rejoice to see you at the halberds

marrying miss walsingham i looked upon myself as the only person acquainted with the secret   genesis that thought has marched itself two or three times to my own recollection for though i gave him

curiosity enough to be anxious about the determination   genesis come along my old boy and remember the song  servile spirits etc exeunt   the scene changes to belvilles enter captain savage and miss walsingham capt nay but my dearest miss walsingham the extenuation of my own conduct to belville made it absolutely necessary for me to discover my engagements with you and as happiness is now so fortunately in our reach i flatter myself you will be prevailed upon to forgive an error which proceeded only from an extravagance of love   miss wall to think me capable of such an action captain savage i am terrified at the idea of a union with you and it is better for a woman at any time to sacrifice an insolent lover than to accept of a suspicious husband   capt in the happiest unions my dearest creature there must be always something to overlook on both sides   miss wall very civil truly   capt pardon me my life for this frankness and recollect that if the lover has through misconception been unhappily guilty he brings a husband altogether reformed to your hands   miss wall well i see i must forgive you at last so i may as well make a merit of necessity you provoking creature   capt and may i hope indeed for the blessing of this hand   miss wall why you wretch would you have me force it upon you i think after what i have said a soldier might have ventured to take it without farther ceremony   capt angelic creature thus i seize it as my lawful prize   miss wall well but now you have obtained this inestimable prize captain give me again leave to ask if you have had a certain explanation with the general   capt how can you doubt it   miss wall and he is really impatient for our marriage   capt it is incredible how earnest he is   miss wall what did he tell
