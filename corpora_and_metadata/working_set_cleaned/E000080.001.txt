an opera its success was great and the author was called before the curtain an honor until then unknown in france the interest of the following correspondence justifies its length   marquis scipio maffei a letter to the marquis scipio maffei author of the italian mérope and many other celebrated performances sir the greeks and romans to whom modern italy as well as all other nations are indebted for almost everything dedicated their works without the ridiculous form of compliments to their friends who were masters of the art by this claim i take the liberty of addressing to you the french mérope the italians who have been the restorers of almost all the fine arts and the inventors of many were the first who under the auspices of leo x revived tragedy and you sir are the first who in this age when the sophoclean art became enervated by loveintrigues often foreign to the subject and so often debased by idle buffooneries that reflected dishonor on the taste of your ingenious countrymen you sir were the first who had courage and genius enough to hazard a tragedy without gallantry a tragedy worthy of athens in its glory wherein the maternal affection constitutes the whole intrigue and the most tender interest arises from the purest virtue france prides herself in her athalie it is indeed the masterpiece of our stage perhaps of poetry itself of all the pieces that are exhibited among us it is the only one where love is not introduced but at the same time we must allow that it is supported by the pomp of religion and that majesty of eloquence which appears in the prophets you had not that resource and yet you have so contrived as to furnish out five acts which it is so   extremely difficult to fill up without episodes i must own your subject appeared to me much more interesting and tragical than that of athalie and even if our admirable racine had worked up his masterpiece with more art more poetry and more sublimity than he has yours i am satisfied would have drawn more tears from the audience the preceptor of alexander—kings ought always to have such preceptors—the great aristotle that extensive genius so just and so deeply versed in all the learning of those times aristotle in his art of poetry has declared that the meeting of mérope and her son was the most interesting circumstance of the whole grecian theatre this stroke was in his opinion infinitely superior to all the rest plutarch tells us that the greeks who of all the people in the world had the quickest feeling trembled with fear lest the old man who was to stop the arm of mérope should not come in time enough that piece which was played in his time and a few fragments of which are still extant appeared to him the most affecting of all the tragedies of euripides but it was not the choice of his subject alone to which that poet owed his success though in every species of the drama a happy choice is no doubt of the greatest service france has seen several méropes but none of them ever succeeded the authors perhaps overloaded this simple subject with foreign ornaments it was the naked venus of praxiteles which they wanted to cover with tinsel it requires a great deal of time to teach men that everything which is great should be simple and natural in      when the french flag began to flourish and even to raise itself above that of greece by the genius of p   corneille cardinal richelieu who ambitiously sought for glory of every kind and who had just then built a magnificent hall for theatrical representations in the palais royal of which he had himself furnished the design had a mérope played there under the name of telephonte the plot of it is generally believed to have been entirely his own there are about a hundred verses in it supposed to be written by him the rest was by colletet boisroberts desmarets and chapelain but all the power of cardinal richelieu could not impart to those writers that genius which they never possessed his own was not indeed adapted to the stage though he had a good taste so that all he could do or that could be expected from him was to patronize and encourage the great corneille mr gilbert resident of the celebrated queen christina in      gave us his mérope which is at present as little known as the other la chapelle of the french academy author of a tragedy called cléopatre which was played with some success gave us another mérope in      and took care to insert a love episode he complains withal in his preface that the critics reproached him with too great a degree of the marvellous but he was mistaken it was not the marvellous that sank his performance but in reality the want of genius added to the coldness and insipidity of his versification this is the great point the capital fault that condemns so many poems to oblivion the art of eloquence in verse is of all arts the most difficult and the most uncommon there are a thousand geniuses to be found who can plan a work and put it into verse after the common manner but to treat it like a true poet is a talent which   is seldom bestowed on above two or three men on the face of the whole earth in december   0  m de la grange played his amasis which is nothing more than the subject of mérope under another name gallantry has its share in this performance likewise and there is more of the marvellous in it than even in la chapelles but it is more interesting conducted with more art and genius and written with more warmth and power notwithstanding which it met with no great success et habent sua fata libelli since that however it has been revived with great applause and is one of those few pieces which generally give pleasure in the representation before and after amasis we have had several tragedies on subjects very nearly resembling this wherein a mother is going to avenge the death of her son on the son himself and discovers him just at the instant when she was about to kill him we frequently saw on our stage that striking but rarely probable situation wherein a person comes with a poniard in his hand ready to destroy his enemy and another arrives at the same instant and snatches it from him this incident recommended at least for a time the camma of thomas corneille but amongst all the tragedies on this subject which i have here enumerated there is not one of them but is filled with some episode of love or rather gallantry for everything must give way to the reigning taste but you must not believe sir that this unhappy custom of loading our tragedies with ridiculous loveintrigues was owing to racine a crime which in italy i know he is generally   reproached with on the contrary he did everything in his power to reform the public taste in this particular the passion of love is never brought in by him as a mere episode it is the foundation or groundplot of all his pieces and forms the principal interest it is certainly of all the passions the most truly theatrical the most fruitful in sentiments and admits of the greatest variety it ought therefore no doubt to be the soul of a dramatic performance or entirely to be banished from it if love is not tragical it is insipid and when it is tragical it should reign alone it was never made for a second place it was rotrou or rather we must own the great corneille himself who in his creation of the stage at the same time disfigured and disgraced it by those ridiculous intrigues bespoken as it were and made on purpose those affairs of gallantry which not being true passions were unworthy of the stage if you would know the reason why corneilles tragedies are so seldom played the reason is plain enough it is because in his otho otho makes a compliment to his mistress more like a man of wit than a real lover he follows step by step the effort of his memory which it is much more easy to admire than to believe camille herself seemed to be of his opinion she would have liked much better a discourse less studied—tell me then when otho made love to camille was he contented or was she kind it is because in pompey cleopatra—a useless character—says that cæsar sighs for her and in a plaintive style calls himself her captive even in the field of victory it is because cæsar asks antony if he has seen  0 this adorable queen to which antony replies yes my lord i have seen her she is incomparable it is because in sertorius old sertorius falls in love not only because he likes the lady but with a political view and cries out i love but it suits my age so ill to be in love that i even conceal it from the fair one who has charmed me as i know that the deep and yellow wrinkles on my forehead can have no great power in captivating the senses it is because in œdipus theseus begins by saying to dirce whatever dreadful havoc the plague may make here absence to true lovers is far more dreadful in a word it is because such love as this will never make us shed tears and when that passion does not affect us it must be quite insipid i have said no more here sir than what all good judges and men of taste say to one another every day what you have often heard at my house in short what everybody thinks but none dare to publish you know well enough the nature of mankind half the world write in opposition to their own opinions for fear of shocking received prejudices and vulgar errors with regard to myself who have never mixed any political reserve with my sentiments on literature i speak the truth boldly and will add that i respect corneille more and have a higher opinion of the real merit of this great father of the stage than those who praise him indiscriminately and are blind to all his faults a mérope was exhibited at london in      who would have thought a loveintrigue could ever have been thought of at that time but ever since the reign of charles ii love has taken possession of the english stage though there is not a    nation upon earth by whom that passion is so ill painted but the intrigue so absurdly brought in and so badly treated is the least fault of the english mérope the young ægisthus delivered out of prison by a maid of honor who is in love with him is brought before the queen who presents him with a bowl of poison and a dagger and speaks thus to him if you dont swallow the poison this dagger shall put an end to your mistress life the young man drinks the poison and is carried off in the agonies of death he comes back in the fifth act coldly to inform mérope that he is her son and that he has slain the tyrant mérope asks him how this miracle was performed to which he replies that a friend of the maid of honor had put poppywater instead of poison into the cup i was only asleep says he when they thought me dead i learned when i awaked that i was your son and immediately killed the tyrant thus ends the tragedy no doubt but it met with a bad reception but is it not strange that it should ever have been represented is it not a proof that the english stage is not yet refined it seems as if the same cause that deprives the english of any excellency in or genius for music and painting takes from them also all perfection in tragedy this island which has produced the finest philosophers in the world is not equally productive of the fine arts and if the english do not seriously apply themselves to the study of those precepts which were given them by their excellent countrymen addison and pope they will never come near to other nations in point of taste and literature but whilst the subject of mérope has been thus disgraced and disfigured in one part of europe it    has met with better fate in italy where it has for a long time been treated in the true taste of the ancients in this sixteenth century which will be famous throughout all ages the count de torelli gave us his mérope with choruses if in la chapelles tragedy we find all the faults of the french stage such as useless intrigues episodes and a romantic air and in the english author the highest degree of indecency barbarism and absurdity we likewise meet in the italian with all the faults of the greek theatre such as the want of action and declamation you sir have avoided all the rocks which they split upon you who have done honor to your country by complete models of more than one kind you have given us in your mérope an example of a tragedy that is at once both simple and interesting the moment i read it i was struck with it my love to my own country has never shut my eyes against the merit of foreigners on the other hand the more regard i have for it the more i endeavor to enrich it by the addition of treasures that are not of its own growth the desire which i had of translating your mérope was increased by the honor of a personal acquaintance with you at paris in the year      by loving the author i became still more enamored with his work but when i sat down to it i found it was impossible to bring it on the french stage we are grown excessively delicate like the sybarites of old we are so immersed in luxury that we cannot bear that rustic simplicity and that description of a country life which you have imitated from the greek theatre i am afraid our audiences would not suffer young ægisthus to make a present of his ring to the man that stops    him i could not have ventured to seize upon a hero and take him for a robber though at the same time the circumstances he is in authorize the mistake our manners which probably admit of many things which yours do not would not permit us to represent the tyrant the murderer of méropes husband and children pretending after fifteen years to be in love with her nor could i even have dared to make the queen say to him why did not you talk to me of love before when the bloom of youth was yet on my face conversations of this kind are natural but our pit which at some times is so indulgent and at others so nice and delicate would think them perhaps too familiar and might even discover coquetry where in reality there might be nothing but what was just and proper our stage would by no means have suffered mérope to bind her son to a pillar nor to run after him with a javelin and an axe in her hand nor have permitted the young man to run away from her twice and beg his life of the tyrant much less could we have suffered the confidante of mérope to have persuaded ægisthus to go to sleep on the stage merely to give the queen an opportunity of coming there to assassinate him not but all this is natural but you must pardon us for expecting that nature should always be presented to us with some strokes of art strokes that are extremely different at paris from those which we meet with at verona to give you a proper idea of the different taste and judgment of polite and cultivated nations with regard to the same arts permit me here to quote a few passages from your own celebrated performance which seem dictated by pure nature the    person who stops young cresphontes and takes the ring from him says   or dunque in tuo paese i servi   han di coteste gemme un bel pacse   sia questo tuo nel nostro una tal gemma   ad un dito real non sconverebbe i will take the liberty to translate this into blank verse in which your tragedy is written as i have not time at present to work it into rhyme   have slaves such precious jewels where thou livest   sure tis a noble country for with us   such rings might well adorn a royal hand the tyrants confidant tells him when speaking of the queen who refuses after twenty years to marry the known murderer of her family   la donna come sai ricusa e brama   women we know refuse when most they love the queens waitingwoman answers the tyrant who presses her to use her influence in his favor thus   —dissimulato in vano   soffre di febre assalto alquanti giorni   donare e forza a rinfrancar suoi spiriti   the queen sir has a fever tis in vain   to hide it and her spirits are oppressed   she must have time to recollect them in your fourth act old polydore asks one of méropes courtiers who he is to which he replies i am eurises the son of nicander polydore then speaking of nicander talks in the style of homers nestor      —egli cra humano   eliberal quando appariva tutti   faceangli honor io mi ricordo ancora   diquanto ei festeggio con bella pompa   le sue nozze con silvia chera figlia   dolimpia e di glicon fratel dipparcho   ju dunque sir quel fanciullin che in corte   silvia condur solea quasi per pompa   parmi laltir hieri o quanto siete presti   quanto voi vaffrettate o giovinetti   a farvi adulti ed a gridar tacendo   che noi diam loco   the most humane most generous of mankind   whereer he went respected and beloved   o i remember well the feast he gave   when to his sylvia wedded the fair daughter   of glycon brother of the brave hipparchus   and chaste olympia and art thou that infant   whom sylvia to the court so often brought   and fondled in her arms alas methinks   it was but yesterday how quickly youth   shoots up and tells us we must quit the scene in another place the same old man being invited to the ceremony of the queens marriage says   —oh curioso   punto io non son passo stagione assai   veduti ho sacrificii io mi recordo   di quello ancora quando il re cresphonte   incomincio a regnar quella fu pompa   ora piu non si fanno a questi tempi   di cotai sacrificii piu di cento   fur le beste sivenate i sacerdoti   risplendean tutti ed ove ti volgessi   altro non si vedea che argento ed oro   my time is past and curiosity   is now no more already i have seen   enough of nuptial rites enough of pomp        and sacrifice i still remember well   the great solemnity when king cresphontes   began his reign o twas a noble sight   we cannot boast of such in these our days   a hundred beasts were offered up the priests   in all their splendor shone and naught was seen   but gold and silver— all these strokes are natural all agreeable to the characters and manners represented such familiar dialogues would no doubt have been well received at athens but paris and our pit expect a simplicity of another kind we may perhaps even boast of a more refined taste than athens itself where though the principal city of all greece it does not appear to me that they ever represented any theatrical pieces except on the four solemn festivals whereas at paris there is always more than one every day in the year at athens the number of citizens was computed at only ten thousand and paris has nearly eight hundred thousand inhabitants among whom i suppose we may reckon thirty thousand judges of dramatic performances who really do pass their judgments almost every day of their lives in your tragedy you took the liberty to translate that elegant and simple comparison from virgil   qualis populea maerens philomela sub umbra   amissos queritur faetus but if i were to take the same in mine they would say it was fitter for an epic poem such a rigid master have we to please in what we call the public   nescis heu nescis nostra fastidia romae   et pueri nasum rhinocerontis habent    the english have a custom of finishing almost all their acts with a simile but we expect that in a tragedy the hero should talk and not the poet our audience is of opinion that in an important crisis of affairs in a council in a violent passion or a pressing danger princes and ministers should never make poetical comparisons how could i ever venture to make the under characters talk together for a long time with you those conversations serve to prepare interesting scenes between the principal actors they are like the avenues to a fine palace but our spectators are for coming into it at once we must therefore comply with the national taste which is perhaps grown more difficult from having been cloyed as it were with such a variety of fine performances and yet among these recitals which our excessive severity condemns how many beauties do i regret the loss of how does simple nature delight me though beneath a form that appears strange to us i have here sir given you some of those reasons which prevailed on me not to follow what i so much admired i was obliged not without regret to write a new mérope i have done it in a different manner but i am far from thinking that i have therefore done it better i look upon myself with regard to you as a traveller to whom an eastern monarch had made a present of some very rich stuffs the king would certainly permit this traveller to wear them according to the fashion of his own country my mérope was finished in the beginning of the year      pretty nearly as it now stands studies of another kind prevented me from bringing it on the stage but what weighed most with me was    the hazard which i ran in producing it after several successful pieces on almost the same subject though under different names at length however i ventured to produce it and the public gave me a convincing proof that they could condescend to see the same matter worked up in a different manner that happened to our stage which we see every day in a gallery of pictures where there are many of them on exactly the same subject the judges are pleased by the observation of these different manners and everyone marks down and enjoys according to his own taste the character of every painter this is a kind of happy concurrence which at the same time that it contributes towards the perfection of the art gives the public a better insight into it if the french mérope has met with the same success as the italian it is to you sir i am indebted for it to that simplicity in your performance which i have taken for my model and which i was always an admirer of though i walked in a different path you were always my guide i could have wished after the examples of the italians and english to employ the happy facility of blank verse and have often called to mind this passage of rucellai   tu sai purche l imagine della voce   che risponde da i sassi dove l echo alberga   sempre nemica fu del nostro regno   e fu inventrice delle prime rime but i am satisfied as i have long since declared that such an attempt would never succeed in france and it would be rather a mark of weakness than good sense to endeavor to shake off a yoke which so many authors have borne whose works will last    as long as the nation itself our poetry has none of those liberties which yours has and this is perhaps one of the reasons why the italians got the start of us by three or four centuries in this most difficult and most delightful art as i have endeavored to imitate you in tragedy i should be glad to follow your example in other branches of literature for which you are so eminently distinguished i could wish to form my taste by yours in the science of history i do not mean the empty barren knowledge of dates and facts that only informs us at what period of time a man died who perhaps was a useless or a pernicious member of society the science of lexicography that loads the memory without improving the mind i mean that history of the human heart which teaches us men and manners which leads us from error to error and from prejudice to prejudice into the effects of the various passions and affections that agitate mankind which shows us all the evils that ignorance or knowledge misapplied has produced in the world and which above all gives us a clue to the progress of the arts and follows them through the dangers of so many contending powers and the ruin of so many empires it is this which makes history delightful and it becomes still more so to me by the place which you will possess amongst those who have pleased and instructed mankind it will raise the emulation of posterity to hear that your country has bestowed on you the most signal honors that verona has raised a statue with this inscription to the marquis scipio maffei in his lifetime—an inscription as beautiful in its kind as that at montpellier to louis xiv after his death  0 deign sir to accept with the respects of your fellowcitizens those of a stranger who esteems and honors you as much as if he had been born at verona m de la lindelle m de voltaire a letter from m de la lindelle to m de voltaire sir you had the politeness to dedicate your tragedy of mérope to m maffei and have served the cause of literature both in italy and france by pointing out from the perfect knowledge which you have of the theatre the different rules and conduct of the italian and french stages the partial attachment which you have to everything that comes from italy added to your particular regard for m maffei would not permit you to censure the real faults of that excellent writer but as i have myself nothing in view but truth and the advancement of the arts i shall not be afraid to speak the sentiments of the judicious public and which i am satisfied must be yours also the abbé desfontaines had already remarked some palpable errors in the mérope of m maffei but according to his usual manner with more rudeness than justice he has mingled a few good criticisms with many bad ones this satirist so universally decried had neither knowledge enough of the italian tongue nor taste enough to form an equitable judgment this then is the opinion of the most judicious amongst those literati whom i have consulted both in france and on the other side of the alps mérope appears to every one of them past dispute    the most interesting and truly tragic subject that was ever brought on the stage infinitely beyond that of athalie because athalie does not want to assassinate the young king but is deceived by the highpriest who seeks revenge on her for her former crimes whereas in mérope we see a mother who in avenging her son is on the point of murdering that very son himself her only desire and her only hope the interest of mérope therefore affects us in a very different manner from that of athalie but it seems as if m maffei was satisfied with what the subject naturally suggested to him without making use of any theatrical art in the conduct of it   the scenes in many places are not linked together and the stage is left void a fault which in the present age is looked upon as unpardonable even in the lowest class of dramatic writers   the actors frequently come in and go out without reason a fault no less considerable   there is no probability no dignity no decorum no art in the dialogue in the very first scene we see a tyrant reasoning in the calmest manner with mérope whose husband and children he had murdered and making love to her this would have been hissed at paris even by the poorest judges   while the tyrant is thus ridiculously making love to the old queen word is brought that they have found a young man who had committed murder but it does not appear through the whole course of the play who it was he had killed he pretends it was a thief who wanted to steal his clothes how low little and poor is this it would not be borne in a farce at a country fair      the captain of the guard provost or whatever you call him examines the murderer who has a fine ring upon his finger this scene is quite low comedy and the style is agreeable to it and worthy of the scene   the mother immediately supposes that the robber who was killed is her son it is pardonable no doubt in a mother to fear everything but a queen who is a mother should have required better proofs   in the midst of all these fears the tyrant poliphontes reasons with méropes waitingwoman about his pretended passion these cold and indecent scenes which are only brought in to fill up the act would never be suffered on a regular stage you have only sir modestly taken notice of one of these scenes where méropes woman desires the tyrant not to hasten the nuptials because she says her mistress has an attack of a fever but i sir will boldly aver in the name of all the critics that such a conversation and such an answer are only fit for harlequins theatre   i will add moreover that when the queen imagining her son to be dead tells us she longs to pull the heart out of the murderers breast and tear it with her teeth she talks more like a cannibal than an afflicted mother and that decency should be preserved in everything   ægisthus who was brought in as a robber and who had said that he had himself been attacked is taken for a thief a second time and carried before the queen in spite of the king who notwithstanding undertakes to defend him the queen binds him to a pillar is going to kill him with a dart but before she throws it asks him some questions    ægisthus tells her that his father is an old man upon which the queen immediately relents is not this an excellent reason for changing her mind and imagining that ægisthus might be her own son a most indisputable mark to be sure is it so very extraordinary that a young man should have an old father maffei has added this absurdity this deficiency of art and genius to another even more ridiculous which he had made in his first edition ægisthus says to the queen o polydore my father this polydore was the very man to whom mérope had entrusted the care of ægisthus at hearing the name of polydore the queen could no longer doubt that ægisthus was her son thus the piece was entirely at an end this error was removed but removed we see only to make room for a greater  0 while the queen is thus ridiculously and without any reason in suspense occasioned by the mention of an old man the tyrant comes in and takes ægisthus under his protection the young man who should have been represented as a hero thanks the king for his life with a base and mean submission that is disgusting and entirely degrades the character of ægisthus    at length mérope and the tyrant are left together mérope exhausts her resentment in reproaches without end nothing can be more cold and lifeless than these scenes full of declamation that have no plot interest or contrasted passion in them they are schoolboy scenes everything in a play that is without action is useless    there is so little art in this piece that the author is always forced to employ confidants to fill up the stage the fourth act begins with another    cold and useless scene between the tyrant and the queens waitingwoman who a little afterwards lights we know not how on young ægisthus and persuades him to rest himself in the porch merely to give the queen a fair opportunity of despatching him when he falls asleep which he does according to promise an excellent plot this and then the queen comes a second time with an axe in her hand in order to kill the young man who is gone to sleep for that purpose this circumstance twice repeated is surely the height of barrenness as the young mans sleep is the height of ridicule m maffei thinks there is genius and variety in this repetition because the queen comes in the first time with a dart and the second with an axe what a strange effect of fancy    at last old polydore comes in apropos and prevents the queen from striking the blow one would naturally imagine that this happy instant must produce a thousand affecting incidents between the mother and son but we meet with nothing of this kind ægisthus flies off and sees no more of his mother he has not so much as one scene with her this betrays a want of genius that is insupportable mérope asks the old man what recompense he demands and the old fool begs her to make him young again in this manner the queen employs her time which doubtless she should have spent in running after her son all this is low illplaced and ridiculous to the last degree    in the course of this piece the tyrant is always for espousing mérope and to compass his end he bids her agents tell her that he will murder all her servants if she does not consent to give him her hand what a ridiculous idea and how extravagant    a tyrant could not m maffei have found out a more specious pretext to save the honor of a queen who had meanness enough to marry the murderer of her whole family    another childish college trick the tyrant says to his confidant i know the art of reigning ill put the bold and rebellious to death give the reins to all kinds of vice invite my subjects to commit the most atrocious crimes and pardon the most guilty expose the good to the fury of the wicked did ever man pronounce such vile stuff this declamation of a regent of sixteen does it not give us a fine idea of a man who knows how to govern racine was condemned for having made mathan—in his athalie—say too much against himself and yet mathan talks reasonably but here it is to the last degree absurd to pretend that throwing everything into confusion is the art of ruling well it is rather the art of dethroning himself one cannot read anything so ridiculous without laughing at it m maffei is a strange politician in a word sir this work of maffei is a fine subject but a very bad performance everybody at paris agrees that it would not go through one representation and the sensible men in italy have a very poor opinion of it it is in vain the author has taken so much pains in his travels to engage the worst writers he could pick up to translate his tragedy it was much easier for him to pay a translator than to make his piece a good one    m de voltaire m de la lindelle the answer of m de voltaire to m de la lindelle sir the letter which you did me the honor to write to me entitles you to the name of hypercritic which was given to the famous scaliger you are truly a most redoubtable adversary if you treat m maffei in this manner what am i to expect from you i acknowledge that in many points you have too much reason on your side you have taken a great deal of pains to rake together a heap of brambles and briars but why would you not enjoy the pleasure of gathering a few flowers there are certainly many in m maffei and which i dare affirm will flourish forever such are the scenes between the mother and son and the narration of the catastrophe i cant help thinking that these strokes are affecting and pathetic you say the subject alone makes all the beauty but was it not the same subject in other authors who have treated mérope why with the same assistance had they not the same success does not this single argument prove that m maffei owes as much to his genius as to his subject to be plain with you i think m maffei has shown more art than myself in the manner by which he has contrived to make mérope think that her son is the murderer of her son i could not bring myself to make use of the ring as he did because after the royal ring that boilieu laughs at in his satires this circumstance would always appear too trifling on our stage we must conform to the fashions of our own age and nation and for the same reason we ought not lightly to condemn those of foreigners    neither m maffei nor i have sufficiently explained the motives that should so strongly incline poliphontes to espouse the queen this is perhaps a fault inherent in the subject but i must own i think this fault very inconsiderable when the circumstances it produces are so interesting the grand point is to affect and draw tears from the spectators tears were shed both at verona and at paris this is the best answer that can be made to the critics it is impossible to be perfect but how meritorious is it to move an audience in spite of all our imperfections most certain it is that in italy many things are passed over which would not be pardoned in france first because taste decorum and the stage itself are not the same in both secondly because the italians having no city where they represent dramatic pieces every day cannot possibly be so used to things of this kind as ourselves opera that splendid monster has driven melpomene from among them and there are so many of the castrati there that no room is left for roscius and æsopus but if ever the italians should have a regular theatre i believe they would soon get beyond us their stages are more extensive their language more tractable their blank verses easier to be made their nation possessed of more sensibility but they want encouragement peace and plenty       act i scene i ismenia mérope ismenia   let not great queen thy soul forever dwell   on images of horror and despair

my good sword   and i will answer as i ought will show thee   perfidious as thou art which is the slave   and which the master whether poliphontes   was born to rule oer princes or ægisthus   to scourge oppressors poliphontes   impotence and rashness   my kind indulgence makes thee insolent   thou thinkest ill not demean myself so far   to punish an unknown rebellious slave   but mercy thus abused will change to wrath   i give thee but a moment to determine   and shall expect thee at the altar there   to die or to obey guards bring him to me   narbas to you and euricles i leave   the haughty rebel you shall answer for him   i know your hatred of me and i know        your weakness too but trust to your experience   you will advise him for the best meantime   remember whether hes the son of narbas   or mérope he must obey or die scene iii ægisthus narbas euricles ægisthus   ill listen to no counsel but the voice   of vengeance o inspire me hercules   o from thy seat of endless bliss look down   on thy ægisthus animate his soul   and guide his footsteps poliphontes calls   i will attend him let us to the altar narbas   wilt thou then die euricles   we must not follow thee   let us collect our few remaining friends   and strive— ægisthus   away another time my soul   would listen to your kind advice for well   i know ye love me but no counsellors   must now be heard save

must obey and servitude must open   the path to vengeance thou contemnest my weakness   i know thou dost but o the more i love   the more i fear o my dear child— ægisthus   be bold   and follow me mérope   alas what wouldst thou do   why ye just gods why was he made too virtuous ægisthus   seest thou my fathers tomb dost thou not hear   his voice art thou a mother and a queen   o if thou art come on mérope   methinks some god   inspires thy soul and raises thee above        the race of mortals now i see the blood   of great alcides flows through every vein   and animates ægisthus o my son   give me a portion of thy noble fire   and raise this drooping heart ægisthus   hast thou no friends   within this fatal temple mérope   once i had   a crowd of followers when i was a queen   but now their virtue sinks beneath the weight   of my misfortunes and they bend their necks   to this new yoke they hate the tyrant yet   have crowned him love their queen and yet desert her ægisthus   by all art thou abandoned at the altar   waits poliphontes for thee mérope   yes ægisthus   his soldiers   do they attend him mérope   no he is surrounded   by that ungrateful faithless crowd that once   encircled mérope by them upled   to the altar i will force for thee alone   a passage    ægisthus   and alone ill follow thee   there shall i meet my ancestors divine   the gods who punish murderers will be there mérope   alas these fifteen years they have contemned thee ægisthus   they did it but to try me mérope   whats thy purpose ægisthus   no matter what let us begone farewell   my mournful friends at least ye soon shall know   the son of mérope deserved your care   to narbas embracing him   narbas believe me thou shalt never blush   to own me for thy son scene v narbas   what means ægisthus   alas my cares are fruitless all and vain   i hoped the sure slowmoving hand of time   would justify the ways of heaven and place   the wronged ægisthus on messenes throne   but guilt still triumphs and my hopes are vanished   his courage will destroy him death awaits   his disobedience   a noise within    euricles   hark they shout narbas   alas   it is the fatal signal euricles   let us listen narbas   i tremble euricles   doubtless at the very moment   when poliphontes was to wed the queen   she has dissolved the shameful bonds by death   for so her rage had purposed narbas   then ægisthus   must perish too she should have lived for him euricles   the noise increases like the rolling thunder   onward it comes and every moment grows   more dreadful narbas   hark i hear on every side   the trumpets sound the groans of dying men   and clash of swords they force the palace euricles   see   yon bloody squadron look it is dispersed   they fly    narbas   perhaps to serve the tyrants cause euricles   far as my eyes can reach i see them still   engaged in fight narbas   whose blood will there be shed   surely i heard the name of mérope   and of ægisthus euricles   thanks to heaven the ways   are open i will hence and know my fate   he goes out narbas   ill follow thee but not with equal steps   for i am old and feeble o ye gods   restore my strength give to this nerveless arm   its former vigor let me save my king   or yield up the poor remnant of my days   and die in his defence scene vi narbas ismenia a crowd of people narbas   whos there ismenia   bloody and pale o horrid spectacle   art thou indeed ismenia    ismenia   o my voice   my breath is lost let me recover them   and i will tell thee all narbas   my son—   the queen—do they yet live ismenia   im scarce myself   half dead with fear the crowd has borne me hither narbas   how does ægisthus ismenia   o he is indeed   the son of gods a stroke so terrible   so noble never did the unconquered courage   of great alcides with a deed so bold   astonish mortals narbas   o my son my king   the work of my own hands the gallant hero ismenia   crowned with fresh flowers the victim was prepared   and hymens torches round the altar blazed   when poliphontes wrapped in gloomy silence   stretched forth his eager hand the priest pronounced   the solemn words amidst her weeping maids   stood fixed in grief the wretched mérope   slow she advanced and trembling in these arms   instead of hymen called on death the people   were silent all when from the holy threshold        a more than mortal form a youthful hero   stepped forth and sudden darted to the altar   it was ægisthus there undaunted seized   the axe that for the holy festival   had been prepared then with the lightnings speed   he ran and felled the tyrant die he cried   usurper die now take your victim gods   erox the monsters vile accomplice saw   his master weltering in his blood upraised   his hand for vengeance but ægisthus smote   the slave and laid him at the tyrants feet   meantime recovered poliphontes rose   and fought i saw ægisthus wounded saw   the fierce encounter the guards ran to part them   when mérope such power has mighty love   pierced through opposing multitudes and cried   stop ye inhuman murderers tis my son   tis my ægisthus turn your rage on me   and plant your daggers in the breast of her   who bore him of his mother and your queen   her shrieks alarmed the crowd and a firm band   of faithful friends secured her from the rage   of the rude soldiers then might you behold   the broken altars and the sacred ruins   on every side confusion war and slaughter   triumphant reigned brothers on brothers rose   children were butchered in their mothers arms   friends murdered friends the dying and the dead   together lay and oer their bodies trampled   the flying crowd with groans the temple rung   amidst the uproar of contending legions   i lost ægisthus and the queen and fled   in vain i asked each passing stranger whither   they bent their way their answers but increased   my terrors still they cry he falls hes dead        he conquers all is darkness and confusion   i ran i flew and by the timely aid   of these kind friends have reached this place of safety   but still i know not whether yet the queen   and great ægisthus are preserved my heart   is full of terrors narbas   thou great arbiter   of all thats mortal providence divine   complete thy glorious work protect the good   support the innocent reward the wretched   preserve my son and i shall die in peace

priests warriors friends my fellowcitizens   attend and hear me in the name of heaven   once more i swear ægisthus is your king   the scourge of guilt the avenger of his father   and yonder bleeding corpse a hated monster   the foe of gods and men who slew my husband   my dear cresphontes and his helpless children   oppressed messene and usurped my kingdom   yet dared to offer me his savage hand        still reeking with the blood of half my race   meeting ægisthus who enters with the axe in his hand   but here behold messenes royal heir   my only hope your queens illustrious son   who conquered poliphontes see my friends   this good old man   pointing to narbas   who saved him from the tyrant   and brought him here the gods have done the rest narbas   i call those gods to witness tis your king   he fought for them and they protected him ægisthus   o hear a mother pleading for her son   and know me for your king i have avenged   a father i have conquered but for you mérope   if still ye doubt look on his glorious wounds   who but the great descendant of alcides   could save messene thus and scourge a tyrant   he will support his subjects and avenge   an injured people hark the voice of heaven   confirms your choice and speaks to you in thunder   it cries aloud ægisthus is my son scene viii mérope ægisthus ismenia narbas euricles people euricles   o madam show yourself to the pleased people   the kings return has fixed their wavering minds        and every heart is ours the impatient crowd   sheds tears of joy and blesses your noble son   forever will they hold this glorious day   in sweet remembrance ardently they long   to see their youthful sovereign to behold   his faithful narbas and adore their queen   the name of poliphontes is detested   thine and the kings the praise of every tongue   o haste enjoy thy victory and thy fame   enjoy a nobler prize thy peoples love ægisthus   to heaven ascribe the glory not to me   thence comes our happiness and thence our virtue   while mérope survives i will not mount   messenes throne my joy shall be to place   a mother there and thou my dearest narbas   shall be my friend my guide my father still end of

stay in this porch the priestesses today   present olympia to the powers divine   this day in secret she must expiate   sins which are even to herself unknown   this day a better life i shall begin   o dear olympia may you never know   the heinous crime thats hardly yet effaced   to whom your birth you owe what blood ive shed sosthenes   can then my lord a girl in infancy   stolen on euphrates banks and by your sire   condemned to slavery in your royal breast   raise such a conflict— cassander   —sosthenes respect   a slave to whom the world should homage pay   the wrongs of fate i labor to repair   my father had his reasons to conceal   the noble blood to which she owed her birth   what do i say o cruel memory   he set her down amongst the victims doomed   to bleed that he might unmolested reign       although in cruelty and carnage bred   i pitied her and turned my fathers heart   i who the mother stabbed the daughter saved   my frenzy and my crime she never knew   olympia may thy error ever last   though as a benefactor thou dost love   cassander quickly he would have thy hate   wert thou to know what blood his hands have shed  0  sosthenes   i dont into those secrets strive to pry   of your true interest i speak alone   of all the several monarchs who pretend   to alexanders throne antigones   and he alone is to your cause a friend cassander   his friendship i have always held most dear   i will to him be faithful— sosthenes   —he to you   equal fidelity and friendship owes   but since weve seen him enter first these walls   his heart by secret jealousy seems filled   and from your love he seems to be estranged cassander   what matters it oh ever honored shades   of alexander and statira—dust   of a famed hero of a demigod   by my remorse you are enough avenged   olympia from their shades appeased obtain   the peace for which my heart so long has sighed   let your bright virtues all my fears dispel   be my defence and heaven propitiate   but to this porch just opened ere the day   i see antigones the king advance scene ii cassander sosthenes antigones hermas antigones   to hermas behind   i must this secret know it importunes me    0    even in his heart ill read what he conceals   depart but be at hand— cassander   when scarce the sun   darts his first rays what cause can bring you here antigones   your interests cassander since the gods   by penitence you have propitious made   the earth between us we must strive to share   no more wars horrors ephesus dismay   your secret mysteries which awe inspire   have banished discord and calamities   monarchs contentions are awhile composed   but this repose is short and soon our climes   by flames and by the sword will be laid waste   the swords not sheathed nor flames extinguished yet   antipaters no more your courage cares   his undertaking doubtless will complete   the brave antipater had never borne   to see seleucus and the lagides   and treacherous antiochus insult   the tomb of alexander boldly seize   his conquests and his great successors brave cassander   would to the gods that alexander could   from heavens height this daring man behold   would he were still alive— antigones   your words surprise   can you then alexanders loss regret   what can to such a strange remorse give rise   of alexanders death youre innocent  0  cassander   alas i caused his death— antigones   —he justly fell   that victim loudly all the grecians claimed   long was the world of his ambition tired   the poison that he drank from athens came   perdiccas cast it in the sparkling bowl   the bowl your father put into your hand   but never intimated the design   you then were young you at the banquet served   the banquet where the haughty tyrant died cassander   the impious parricide excuse no more antigones   can you then abjectly thus deify   the murderer of clitus whose fell rage   destroyed parmenio and who madly vain   dishonoring his mother durst aspire   to be a god and adoration claimed   tis he deserves the name of parricide   and when at babylon we cut him off   when fate oertook him in the poisoned bowl   we mortals and the gods at once revenged cassander   although he had his faults you still must own   he was a hero and our lawful king antigones   a hero— cassander   —doubtless he deserves the name  0  antigones   it was our valor twas our arms our blood   to which the ungrateful wretch his conquests owed cassander   ye tutelary gods   who could be more ungrateful than our sires   all to that rank exalted strove to rise   but wherefore were his wife and children slain   who can relate the horrors of that day antigones   this late repentance fills me with surprise   jealous and quite suspicious of his friends   he had become a persian and espoused   a daughter of darius we were slaves   do you then wish that furious for revenge   statira had his subjects roused to arms   and to his shade had sacrificed us all   she armed them all antipater himself   that day with difficulty escaped her rage   a fathers life you saved— cassander   —tis true but still   this hand the wife of alexander slew antigones   it is the fate of combats our success   should not be followed by regret and tears cassander   after the fatal stroke i wept i own   and stained with that august but hapless blood   astonished at myself and mad with grief   for what my father forced me to commit   i long have groaned in secret—  0  antigones   —but declare   wherefore today you feel these pangs of grief   a friend should to a friend his heart disclose   you still dissemble— cassander   friend what can i say   depend upon it theres a time the heart   to virtues paths by instincts force returns   and when the memory of former guilt   with terror harrows up the frighted soul— antigones   of murders expiated think no more   but let us to our interests still attend   if your soul must be ruffled by remorse   repent that youve abandoned asias plains   to insolent antiochuss sway   may my brave warriors and your valiant greeks   again with terror shake euphrates shores   of all these upstart kings elate with pride   not one is worthy of the name not one   like us has served darius conqueror   our chiefs are all cut off— cassander   —perhaps the gods   have sacrificed them to their monarchs shade antigones   we who still live should labor to restore   the few who have survived the general wreck   the victor dying to the worthiest left   his host who saves it is the man he meant   my fortune and your own at once secure   the strongest all men must the worthiest own    0    the fallen powers of greece lets raise again   let discord from our councils be removed   lest to these tyrants we should fall a prey   they were not born to vie with men like us   say will you second me— cassander   —my friend i swear   im ready to assert our common cause   unworthy hands have asias sceptre seized   nile and the euphrates both are tyrannized   ill fight for you for greece and for myself antigones   interest your promise dictates both i trust   but much more in your friendship i confide   that secret tie by which we both are bound   but of your friendship i require a proof   do not refuse it cassander   by your doubt im wronged   if what you ask is in my power your will   i as a sacred order shall obey antigones   perhaps you will consider with surprise   the trifle which in friendships name i ask   tis but a slave— cassander   —all mine you may command   theyre prostrate at your feet choose which you will antigones   a foreign damsel suffer me to ask   in babylon made captive by your sire    0    shes yours by lot i claim her as the prize   of labors which for you ive undergone   your father used her hardly i am told   but in my court shell meet with due respect   her names olympia— cassander   olympia antigones   thats the fair ones name cassander   how unexpectedly he wounds my heart   must i resign olympia antigones   hear me friend   i hope i shall cassander grateful find   in trifles a refusal may offend   and sure you do not mean to injure me cassander   no you shall soon the youthful slave behold   you shall yourself decide if twould be fit   that i should give her up at your request   to this shrine none profane can find access   under the inspection of the powers divine   olympia midst the priestesses remains   the gates will open at the proper time   within this porch to which access is free   my coming wait and all complaint suspend   new mysteries may strike you with surprise   you quickly may determine whether kings   can to olympia now have any claim   he enters the temple again and sosthenes goes out   0 scene iii antigones and hermas in the porch hermas   my lord you move my wonder whilst alarms   disturb all asia and a hundred kings   for power supreme in fields of blood contend   when fortune alexanders wide domains   prepares amongst the valiant to divide   whilst greatly you to sovereign sway lay claim   can a slave be the object of your wish antigones   your wonders just but reasons which to none   i dare disclose to this pursuit excite   perhaps this slave may of importance prove   to asias kings to all men who aspire   to him who in his bosom bears a heart   which nobly aims at alexanders throne   strangest conjectures long my soul has framed   upon the slaves adventures and her name   i sought for information oft my eyes   have gazed upon her from these ramparts height   the time and place to which she owes her birth   the great respect which even a master shows her   cassanders sorrow and obscure discourse   with fresh suspicions have my soul inspired   the mystery dark i think i can see through hermas   he loves her i am told and with the care   of a kind father educates her youth     antigones   well know the truth but see the temple opens   and shows the sacred altar decked with flowers   the priestesses are ranged on either side   the high priest sits within the sacred shrine   cassander and olympia now advance scene iv the three doors of the temple are opened the inside of the temple is discovered the priests advance slowly on one side and the priestesses on the other they are all clothed in white raiment with blue girdles the ends of which touch the ground cassander and olympia lay their hands on the altar antigones and hermas stand in the porch cassander   oh god of kings and gods eternal mind   who in these sacred mysteries stand revealed   who dost the wicked punish and the just   support with whom remorse atones for crimes   great god confirm the vows which here i make   olympia heavenly fair those vows receive   to you my throne my life i dedicate   a love as pure as holy as the fire   of vesta which neer dies i promise here   to heaven devoted priestesses august   receive the vows and promises i make   bear them in clouds of incense to the throne   of listening gods and may they still avert   the punishment thats due to crimes like mine     olympia   protect o gods in whom i put my trust   the master who supplied a fathers care   let my kind lover and my husband still   be dear to you and worthy of your care   my heart is to you known his rank his crown   are the least gifts which on me he bestows   tis yours to answer for my ardent flame   who here bear witness to its purity   may i from him to please you learn and may   your justice doom me to the infernal shades   if faithless to your laws i eer forget   my former state and what i owe to him cassander   lets to the shrine return where bliss invites   the solemn pomp you priestesses prepare   the pomp from which my happiness i date   sanctify both my passion and my life   ive at the temple seen the gods in her   i see them may they hate me if i am false   antigones you hear what i have said   sufficient answer have i now returned   acknowledge now that you should cease to claim   cassanders slave know even my throne itself   and all my grandeur are below her worth   whatever friendship may unite our hearts   you cannot such a sacrifice expect   they enter the temple again and the doors are shut     scene v antigones hermas antigones   i doubt no more i have discovered all   he braved me but his ruin is at hand   hes ardent and impetuous and prone   sometimes to serve the gods sometimes offend   the world has many characters like his   made up of passion and religious zeal   with headlong passion tenderness they mix   they oft repent and all things undertake   he says he weds a slave ah never think   that love could make him so debase himself   that slave is of a race himself respects   his secret machinations i surmise   he thinks in virtue of olympias rights   he one day may become supreme of kings   had love alone been master of his breast   he had not from me kept it thus concealed   his friendship weak youll quickly see give place   to rancor and inveterate enmity hermas   perhaps to his infatuated heart   designs too deep for lovers you ascribe   our actions oft even in our great concerns   are but effects which from our passions spring   their power tyrannic we in vain disguise   the weak is oft a politician deemed   cassanders not the first king who has stooped   to love a slave and raise her to his bed         heroes have often by their flames subdued   yielded to women whilst they monarchs braved antigones   what you have said is just you reason right   but all i see suspicion has confirmed   shall i avow the truth olympias charms   have jealousy excited in my soul   my secret sentiments too plain you see   perhaps love mingles with these great concerns   more than i thought their marriage grieves my soul   cassanders not the only man thats weak hermas   but he relied upon you can then kings   never be to the laws of friendship true   nor your alliance nor your fellowship   in arms the dangers which you both have shared   nor oaths redoubled nor united cares   can save you from the woes that discord brings   is then true friendship banished from the earth antigones   i know to friendship greece has temples raised   to interest none though interests there adored   at once with love and with ambition blind   cassander hides from me olympias birth   cassander views me with a jealous eye   hes in the right perhaps this very day   the object of his wishes will be mine   the initiated the priests and the priestesses pass over the stage in procession with garlands of flowers in their hands hermas   he has received her hand the sacred shrine   already sees their nuptial pomp prepared         the initiated followed by the priests   with garlands in their hands attend in crowds   over the rites loves sacred power presides antigones   his conquest may be ravished from him soon   i shall on your fidelity rely   gods laws and people will for me declare   let us a moment fly these odious pomps   and take the measures my designs require   let us pollute this sanctuary oer   not with the blood of bulls but human gore end of the first act act ii scene i the three doors of the temple are opened though this scene and many others are supposed to pass in the innermost part of the temple as theatres are not built in a manner favorable to the voice the performers are obliged to advance forward towards the porch but the three doors of the temple are open to show that they are supposed to be in the temple the hierophants the priests and the priestesses the hierophants   what in these sacred days this shrine august   when god consoles the just and sins forgives   shall one of all the priestesses presume   to interrupt the rites and disobey   must arzane from duty be exempt one of the priestesses   arzane bent on silence in retreat   bathes with her tears the statues of the gods         she hides herself my lord from every eye   a prey to grief and weakened by her woes   and wishes death may end her misery the hierophants   her woes we pity but she must obey   let her a moment at the rites attend   since she has lain concealed in her retreat   first on this day her presence is required   bid her approach the sacred will of heaven   the inferior priestess goes in quest of arzane   calls to the altar and wont brook delay   adorned by her with wreaths of gayest flowers   olympia must before the gods be led   initiated in our sacred rites   cassander must be purified by her   our mysteries soon must be complete and all   the orders of the gods must be obeyed   they never vary are forever fixed   nor like the changeful laws of humankind scene ii the hierophants the priests and priestesses statira the hierophants   to statira   you must not dutys sacred call neglect   nor your most holy ministry decline   since in this blest asylum first you made   the vow which never more can be recalled   upon this day first by the gods youre chosen   their laws to asias victors to declare   be worthy of the god you represent     statira   covered with a veil which does not conceal her features   oh heavens why after fifteen years that here   within deep solitudes and silent walls   remote from mankind fate has buried me   why do you force me from obscurity   why do you bring me to the light and woe   to the hierophants   my lord when to this temple i repaired   twas but to weep and die in secret here   you know that was my purpose— the hierophants   —other laws   the will of heaven prescribes you on this day   and since at nuptials now you first preside   your name your rank no longer must be hid   you must declare them— statira   —sir what matter these   the blood of beggars and the blood of kings   are they not equal in the sight of heaven   by heaven were better known than by

genghis khan emperor of the tartars octar  officers under genghis khan osman  zamti a learned mandarin idame wife of zamti asseli friend to idame etan friend to zamti scene a mandarins palace near the court in the city of cambalu now called pekin this piece was produced in paris      when the author was in exile     m de voltaire to the most noble duke of richelieu marshal and peer of france first gentleman of the chamber to his majesty governor of languedoc and member of the academy of sciences my lord i would have presented you with a piece of fine marble but instead of it can only offer you a few chinese figures this little performance is not indeed worthy of your acceptance there is no hero in this piece who has united all parties in his favor and rendered himself universally agreeable by the force of superior talents or supported a falling kingdom or made the noble attempt to overthrow an english colony with four cannons only i know better than anybody else the insignificance of my own works but everything may be forgiven to an attachment of forty years standing the world indeed will say that retired as i am to the foot of the alps covered with eternal snows and where i ought to be nothing but a philosopher i had still vanity enough to let it be known that frances brightest ornament on the banks of the seine has not forgotten me i have consulted my own heart alone which has always guided me inspired every word and directed every action you know it has sometimes deceived me but not after such long and convincing proofs if this tragedy should survive its author permit it to inform posterity that he who wrote it was honored with your friendship that your uncle laid the foundation of the fine arts in france and that you supported them in their decline i took the first hint of this tragedy some time since     from reading the orphan of tchao a chinese tragedy translated by father bremare an account of which is given in du haldes history this piece was written in the fourteenth century and under the dynasty of genghis khan an additional proof that the tartar conquerors did not change the manners of the conquered nation on the other hand they protected and encouraged all the arts established in china and adopted their laws an extraordinary instance of the natural superiority which reason and genius have over blind force and barbarism twice have the tartars acted in this manner for when they had once more subdued this great empire the beginning of last century they submitted a second time to the wisdom of the conquered and the two nations formed but one people governed by the most ancient laws in the world a most remarkable event the illustration of which was the principal end of this performance the chinese tragedy which they call the orphan was taken out of an immense collection of the theatrical performances of that nation which has cultivated this art for about three thousand years before it was invented by the greeks the art of making living portraits of the actions of men establishing schools of morality and teaching virtue in dialogue and representation for a long time dramatic poetry was held in esteem only in that vast country of china separated from and unknown to the rest of the world and in the city of athens rome was unacquainted with it till above four hundred years afterwards if you look for it among the persians or indians who pass for an inventive people you will not find it there it has never yet reached them asia was contented with the fables     of palpay and lokman which contain all their morality and have instructed by their allegories every age and nation one would have imagined that from making animals speak there was but one step to make men speak also to introduce them on the stage and to form the dramatic art and yet this ingenious people never thought of it from whence we may infer that the chinese greeks and romans are the only ancient nations who were acquainted with the true spirit of society nothing indeed renders men more sociable polishes their manners or improves their reason more than the assembling them together for the mutual enjoyment of intellectual pleasure scarce had peter the great polished russia before theatres were established there the more germany improves the more of our dramatic representations has it adopted those few places where they were not received in the last age are never ranked amongst the civilized countries the orphan of tchao is a valuable monument of antiquity and gives us more insight into the manners of china than all the histories which ever were or ever will be written of that vast empire tis true indeed it is extremely barbarous when compared with the excellent performances of our times but notwithstanding is a masterpiece when placed in competition with the pieces written by our authors in the fourteenth century our troubadours bazoche the company of children without care and the foolish mother all of them fall short of the chinese author it is remarkable also that this piece is written in the language of the mandarins which has never changed whilst we can scarce understand the language that was spoken in the time of louis xii and charles viii     one can only compare the orphan of tchao to the english and spanish tragedies of the sixteenth century which still please beyond sea and on the other side of the pyrenees the action lasts five and twenty years as in some of the monstrous farces of shakespeare and lope de vega which are called tragedies though they are nothing but a heap of incredible stories the enemy of the house of tchao wants to destroy the head of it and for that purpose lets loose on him a great dog whom he imagines endowed with the power of discovering guilt by instinct as james aimar amongst us was said to have found out thieves by his wand at last he forges an order from the emperor and sends his enemy tchao a rope a dagger and some poison tchao sings according to the custom of his country and very deliberately cuts his own throat in consequence of that obedience which every man owes to the divine right of the emperor of china the persecutor puts to death three hundred persons of the family of tchao the princes widow is brought to bed of the orphan the infant is saved from the rage of the tyrant who had exterminated the whole family and would have destroyed the only remaining branch of it the tyrant orders all the children in all the towns round about to be destroyed in hopes that the orphan might perish amongst the rest in the general slaughter we fancy we are reading the arabian nights entertainment put into scenes and yet in spite of all these marvellous and improbable things it is extremely interesting though there is such a multiplicity of events all is clear and simple a merit which must recommend it to every age and nation and which is greatly wanting in our modern performances     the chinese piece is indeed very deficient with regard to all other beauties there is no unity of time or action no picture of the manners no sentiment eloquence reason or passion in it and yet as i said before the work is superior to anything we could produce in former ages how comes it to pass that the chinese who in the fourteenth century and a long time before could boast of better dramatic performances than any european nation still remain as it were in the infancy of this art while we in process of time and by dint of pains and assiduity have been able to produce about a dozen pieces which if they are not absolutely perfect are at least much above anything the rest of the world could ever pretend to of this kind the chinese as well as the rest of the asiatics have stopped at the first elements of poetry eloquence natural philosophy astronomy and painting all practised by them so long before they were known to us they began in everything much sooner than us but made no progress afterwards like the ancient egyptians who first taught the greeks and became at last so ignorant as not even to be capable of receiving instruction from them these people whom we take so much pains and go so far to visit from whom with the utmost difficulty we have obtained permission to carry the riches of europe and to instruct them do not to this day know how much we are their superiors they are not even far enough advanced in knowledge to venture to imitate us and dont so much as know whether we have any history or not the celebrated metastasio has made choice of pretty nearly the same subject as myself for one of his dramatic poems an orphan escaped from the   0 destruction of his family and has drawn his plot from a dynasty nine hundred years before our era the chinese tragedy of the orphan of tchao differs in many respects and i have chosen one that is not much like either of them except in the name as i have confined my plan to the grand epoch of genghis khan i have endeavored to describe the manners of the tartars and chinese the most interesting events are nothing when they do not paint the manners and this painting which is one of the greatest secrets of the art is no more than an idle amusement when it does not tend to inspire notions of honor and virtue i will venture to say that from the henriade to the publication of zaïre and this tragedy be it good or bad such is the principle by which i have always been governed and that in my history of the age of louis xiv i have celebrated both my king and country without flattery to either in labors of this kind i have spent above forty years of my life but observe the following words of a chinese author translated into spanish by the famous navarrete when you compose any work show it only to your friends dread the public and your brother writers for they will play false with you abuse everything you do and impute to you what you never did calumny with her hundred trumpets will sound them all to your destruction whilst truth who is dumb shall remain with you the celebrated ming was accused of hating tien and li and the emperor vang when the old man died they found amongst his papers a panegyric on vang a hymn to tien another to li etc

chief   has stormed the palace this once powerful empire   the mistress of the world is bathed in blood idame   knowest thou my friend that this destructive tyrant   whom now we tremble at who proudly thus   treads on the necks of kings is yet no more   than a wild scythian soldier bred to arms   and practised in the trade of blood who long   had wandered oer the neighboring deserts there   formed a rude band of lawless rioters   and fought his way to glory now successful   and now oppressed at length by fortune led   hither he came for refuge asseli   i think thou must remember him his name

foolish heart had well nigh listened to him   perhaps it soothed the womans vanity   to hold this lion in my toils perhaps   i hoped in time to soften his rude soul   and bend his savage fierceness to the ways   of social life he might have served the state   which now he would destroy our proud refusal   incensed the hero fatal may it prove   to this unhappy kingdom well thou knowest   our pride

thought   alarms me he is fiery and revengeful   a scythian never pardons cruel fate   and will this valiant nation tamely yield   its neck to slavery and be led like sheep   to slaughter asseli   tis

found a place of refuge if the queen         is fallen beneath the tyrants power if yet   they live alas the last surviving pledge   of their unhappy nuptials the dear infant   entrusted to our care i

from us the world received its laws but vain   is human worth when lawless power prevails   i saw the northern hive rush in upon us         and force their passage through a sea of blood   whereer they passed they spread destruction round them   at length they seized the palace where the best   of sovereigns and of men with calm composure   and resignation yielded to his fate   the wretched queen lay fainting in his arms   those of their numerous sons whom lusty manhood   had sent to battle were already slain   the rest who naught could give him but their tears   hung at his knees and

dare not hurt a rival and a slave   even in the husband i respect the wife   is love indeed so great a conqueror   and must i grace his triumphs octar   all i know   and all i wish for is to follow thee   the rattling chariot and the sounding bow   the fiery coursers and the din of arms   these are my passions these the joys of octar   i am a stranger to the sighs of love   and think them far beneath the royal soul   of genghis they debase a character   so great as thine genghis   i know my power i know   that i could make her mine but what avails   the fairest form without the conquered heart   where is the joy to press within our arms   a trembling slave to see her beauteous eyes   forever bathed in tears and her full heart   oppressed with sorrow tis a barbarous triumph   the savage herd that through the forest roam   enjoy more peace and boast a purer love   the fair idame has some secret power   that charms me more than victory and empire   i thought i could have driven her from my heart   but she returns and triumphs     scene v genghis octar osman genghis   well what says she osman   that she will perish with her husband rather   than tell the place where hid from

was more happy scene ii octar genghis genghis   well my friend youve seen   this proud presumptuous mandarin what says he     octar   he is inflexible nor threats alarm   nor promises allure him still he talks   of duty and of virtue as if we   were vanquished slaves and he the conqueror   i blush to think how we demeaned ourselves   by talking to a wretch whom by a word   we might destroy let the ungrateful pair   perish together mutual is their crime   and mutual be their punishment genghis   tis strange   that sentiments like these to us unknown   should rise in mortal breasts without a groan   a murmur or complaint a father breaks   the ties of nature and would sacrifice   his child to please the manes of his sovereign   and the fond wife would die to save her lord   the more i see the more must i admire   this wondrous people great in arts and arms   in learning and in manners great their kings   on wisdoms basis founded all their power   they gave the nations law by virtue reigned   and governed without conquest naught hath heaven   bestowed on us but force our only art   is cruel war our business to destroy   what have i gained by all my victories   by all my guilty laurels stained with blood   the tears the sighs the curses of mankind   perhaps my friend there is a nobler fame   and worthier of our search my heart in secret   is jealous of their virtues i would wish   all conqueror as i am to imitate   the vanquished     octar   can you then admire their weakness   what are their boasted arts the puny offspring   of luxury and vice that cannot save them   from slavery and death the strong and brave   are born to rule the feeble to obey   labor and courage conquer all but you   tamely submit a voluntary slave   and must the brave companions of your toil   behold their honor stained their glory lost   their king dependent on a womans smile   their honest hearts with indignation glow   by me they speak by me reproach thee genghis   excuse a friend a fellow soldier grown   old in thy service one who cannot bear   this amorous sickness of the soul and longs   to guide thy footsteps to the paths of glory genghis   go fetch idame octar   what my

whats victory without her   i have made thousands wretched and am now         myself unhappy midst the venal crowd   of slaves that court my favor is there one   that can relieve the anguish of my soul   or fill my heart with real bliss i wanted   some happy error some delusive joy   to mitigate the sorrows of a king   and lessen the oppressive weight of empire   but octar who should heal hath probed my wounds   too deeply i have none but monsters round me   bloodthirsty slaves unfeeling merciless   and cruel disciplined to blood and slaughter   o for a few soft hours of gentle love   to

woman   and add fresh weight to her calamities genghis   be not alarmed your husband yet may live   my vengeance is suspended for a while   and for thy sake i will be merciful   perhaps it was decreed by heaven idame   should be reserved to captivate her master   to bend the stubborn fierceness of his nature   and soften his rude heart you understand me   my laws permit divorce embrace the offer   and make the sovereign of the world your own         i know you love me not but think what joys   surround a throne think how thy countrys good   her welfare and her happiness depend   on thy resolve i know it moves thy wonder   to see a haughty conqueror at thy feet   forget my power forget my cruelty   weigh your own interest well and speak my fate idame   i am indeed surprised and so perhaps   will genghis be when i shall answer him   there was a time my lord you well remember   when he who holds the subject world in awe   this terror of the nations was no more   than a poor soldier friendless and unknown   he offered me the pure unspotted heart   of temugin and i with pleasure then   would have received it genghis   ha couldst thou have loved me idame   perhaps i might but those to whom i owe   my first obedience doomed me to another   thou knowest the power of parents oer their children   they are the image of that god we serve   and next to them should be obeyed this empire   was founded on paternal right on justice   honor and public faith and holy marriage   and if it be the sacred will of heaven   that it must fall a sacrifice to thee   and thy successful crimes the enlivening spirit   that long supported it shall never perish   your fate has changed idames never can   0 genghis   couldst thou have loved me then idame   i could my lord   and therefore never must hereafter think   on genghis i am bound in sacred bonds   to zamti nay ill tell thee more i love him   prefer him to the splendor of a throne   and all the honors thou canst lavish on me   think not it soothes my vanity to spurn   a conqueror all i wish is to fulfil   my duty and do justice to myself   bestow your favors on some grateful heart   worthier than mine that will with joy receive them   may i implore you to conceal from zamti   these proffered terms twould wound his soul to think   my truth to him had ever thus been questioned genghis   he knows what i expect and will obey   if he desires to live idame   he never will   though cruel torments should extort from him   a feigned submission my firm constancy   would soon recall him to the paths of duty   of honor truth and virtue

expiring rome and make her fall more glorious   his victories cost you dear they thin your ramparts   and weaken your small force no longer then   refuse a peace so needful to your safety   the senate bears a fathers love to rome   so does porsenna to the hapless kings   whom you oppress but tell me you who judge   depending monarchs you who thus determine   the rights of all mankind was it not here   even at these altars at this capitol   you called the gods to witness your allegiance   and bound your faith to your acknowledged king   to tarquin say what power has broken the tie   who snatched the diadem from tarquins head   who can acquit you of your oaths brutus   himself   talk not of ties dissolved by guilt of gods   whom he renounced or rights which he has lost   we paid him homage bound ourselves by oath   oaths of obedience not of slavery   but since thou bidst us call to our remembrance         the senate making vows for tarquins health   and kneeling at his feet remember thou   that on this sacred spot this altar here   before the same attesting gods that tarquin   swore to be just such was the mutual bond   of prince and people and he gave us back   the oath we made when he forgot his own   since to romes laws no more he pays obedience   rome is no longer subject to his power   and tarquin is the rebel not his people aruns   but grant it true that power unlimited   and absolute dominion had misled   the unhappy monarch from the paths of duty   is there a man from human error free   is there a king without some human weakness   or if there were have you a right to punish   you who were born his subjects you whose duty   is to obey the son doth never arm   against the sire but with averted eyes   laments his errors and reveres him still   and not less sacred are the rights of kings   they are our fathers and the gods alone   their judges if in anger heaven sometimes   doth send them down why would you therefore call   for heavier chains and judgments more severe   why violate the laws you would defend   and only change your empire to destroy it   taught by misfortune best of monitors   tarquin henceforth more worthy of his throne   will be more wise and just the legal bonds   of king and people now may be confirmed   by happiest union public liberty   shall flourish then beneath the awful shade   of regal power     brutus   aruns tis now too late   each nation has its laws by nature given   or changed by choice etruria born to serve   hath ever been the slave of kings or priests   loves to obey and happy in her chains   would bind them on the necks of all mankind   greece boasts her freedom soft ionia bends   beneath a shameful bondage rome had once   her kings but they were never absolute   her first great citizen was romulus   with him his people shared the weight of empire   numa was governed by the laws he made   rome fell at last indeed beneath herself   when from etruria she received her kings   or from porsenna tyranny and vice   from your corrupted courts flowed in upon us   forgive us gods the crime of sparing tarquin   so many years at length his murderous hands   dyed with our blood have broke the shameful chain   of our long slavery and the roman people   have through misfortune found the road to virtue   tarquin restores the rights by tarquin lost   and by his crimes has fixed the public safety   weve taught the etruscans how to shake off tyrants   and hope theyll profit by the fair example   the consuls descend towards the altar and the senate rises   o mars thou god of battles and of rome   thou who dost guard these sacred walls and fight   for thy own people on thy altar here   deign to accept our solemn oaths for me   and for the senate for thy worthy sons   if in romes bosom there be found a traitor         who weeps for banished kings and seeks once more   to be a slave in torments shall he die   his guilty ashes scattered to the winds   shall leave behind a more detested name   even than those tyrant kings which rome abhors aruns   stepping towards the altar   and on this altar which you thus profane   i call that god to witness in the name   of him whom you oppress the injured tarquin   and great porsenna his avenger here   i swear eternal war with you o romans   and your posterity—   the senators are going off towards the capitol   a moment stop   ere you depart o senators and hear   what i have more to offer tarquins daughter   must she too fall a sacrifice to rome   with ignommious fetters will ye bind   her royal hands to triumph oer her father   whose treasures you detain ungenerous victors   as if the right of conquest gave them to you   where are his riches was it for the spoil   you robbed him of his throne let brutus speak   and own the plunder brutus   little dost thou know   of rome her manners and her noble nature   but learn mistaken man her great protectors   the friends of truth and justice are grown old   in honest poverty above the pride   of wealth which they disdain it is their boast   to conquer kings who love such tinsel greatness         take back your gold it is beneath our notice   and for the hateful tyrants hapless daughter   though i abhor the wretched race yet know   the senate has consigned her to my care   she hath not tasted here the baneful cup   of flattery that sweet poison of a court   or viewed the pomp and dangerous luxury   of tarquins palace little did her youth   profit by them but all that to her age   and sex was due all her misfortunes claimed   she hath received let her return this day   to tarquin brutus yields her back with joy   naught should the tyrant have within these walls   but romes fixed hatred and the wrath of heaven   you have a day to carry off your treasures   that must suffice meantime the sacred rights   of hospitality await thee here   beneath my roof thou mayest remain in safety   the senate thus by me decrees bear thou   our answer to porsenna and then tell   proud tarquin you have seen a roman senate   turning to the senators   let us my friends adorn the capitol   with laurel wreaths that round the brows of titus   have spread their noble shade the arrows too   and bloody ensigns his victorious hand   hath wrested from the etruscans ever thus   from age to age may the successful race   of brutus still defend their much loved country   thus o ye gods may you protect us ever   guide the sons arm and bless the fathers councils     scene iii aruns albinus supposed to have retired from the hall of audience into an apartment of brutus house aruns   didst thou observe the fierce unbending spirit   of this proud senate which believes itself   invincible and so perhaps it might be   were rome at leisure to confirm her sons   in valor and in wisdom liberty   that liberty my friend which all adore   and i admire though i would wrest it from them   inspires the heart of man with nobler courage   than nature gives and warmth almost divine   beneath the tarquins yoke a slavish court   enfeebled their corrupted hearts and spoiled   their active valor whilst their tyrant kings   busied in conquering their own subjects left   our happier etruscans in the arms of peace   but if the senate should awake their virtues   if rome is free italia soon must fall   these lions whom their keepers made so gentle   will find their strength again and rush upon us   let us then stop this rapid stream of woes   even at its source and free a sinking world   from slavery let us bind these haughty romans   even with the chains which they would throw on us   and all mankind—but will messala come   may i expect him here and will he dare—     albinus   my lord he will attend you every minute   we look for him and titus is our friend aruns   have you conferred may i depend on him albinus   messala if i err not means to change   his own estate rather than that of rome   as firm and fearless as if honor guided   and patriot love inspired him ever secret   and master of himself no passions move   no rage disturbs him in his height of zeal   calm and unruffled aruns   such he seemed to me   when first i saw him at the court of tarquin   his letters since—but see he comes scene iv aruns messala albinus aruns   messala   thou generous friend of an unhappy master   will neither tarquins nor porsennas gold   shake the firm faith of these rough senators   will neither fear nor hope nor pleasure bend   their stubborn hearts these fierce patrician chiefs   that judge mankind are they without or vice   or passion is there aught thats mortal in them   0 messala   their boasts are mighty but their false pretence   to justice and the fierce austerity   of their proud hearts are nothing but the thirst   of empire their pride treads on diadems   yet whilst they break one chain they forge another   these great avengers of our liberty   armed to defend it are its worst oppressors   beneath the name of patrons they assume   the part of monarchs rome but changed her fetters   and for one king hath found a hundred tyrants aruns   is there amongst your citizens a man   honest enough to hate such shameful bondage messala   few very few yet feel their miseries   their spirits still elate with this new change   are mad with joy the meanest wretch among them   because he helped to pull down monarchy   assumes its pride and thinks himself a king   but ive already told you i have friends   who with reluctance bend to this new yoke   who look with scorn on a deluded people   and stem the torrent with unshaken firmness   good men and true whose hands and hearts were made   to change the state of kingdoms or destroy them aruns   what may i hope from these brave romans say   will they serve tarquin     messala   theyll do anything   their lives are thine but think not like blind vassals   they will obey a base ungrateful master   they boast no wild enthusiastic zeal   to fall the victims of despotic power   or madly rush on death to save a tyrant   who will not know them tarquin promises   most nobly but when he shall be their master   perhaps he then may fear perhaps forget them   i know the great too well in their misfortunes   no friends so warm but in prosperity   ungrateful oft they change to bitterest foes   we are the servile tools of their ambition   when useless thrown aside with proud disdain   or broke without remorse when we grow dangerous   our friends expect conditions shall be made   on certain terms you may depend upon them   they only ask a brave and worthy leader   to please their fickle taste a man well known   and well respected one who may have power   to force the king to keep his plighted faith   if we succeed and if we fail endued   with manly courage to avenge our cause aruns   you wrote me word the haughty titus— messala   titus   is romes support the son of brutus yet— aruns   how does he brook the senates base reward         for all his services he saved the city   and merited the consulship which they   i find refuse him messala   and he murmurs at it   i know his proud and fiery soul is full   of the base injury for his noble deeds   naught has he gained but a vain empty triumph   a fleeting shadow of unreal bliss   i am no stranger to his throbbing heart   and strength of passion in the paths of glory   so lately entered twere an easy task   to turn his steps aside for fiery youth   is easily betrayed and yet what bars   to our design a consul and a father   his hate of kings rome pleading for her safety   the dread of shame and all his triumphs past   but i have stole into his heart and know   the secret poison that inflames his soul   he sighs for tullia aruns   ha for tullia messala   yes   scarce could i draw the secret from his breast   he blushed himself at the discovery   ashamed to own his love for midst the tumult   of jarring passions still his zeal prevails   for liberty aruns   thus on a single heart   and its unequal movements must depend   spite of myself the fate of rome but hence         albinus and prepare for tarquins tent   turning to messala   well to the princess i have gained some knowledge   by long experience of the human heart   ill try to read her soul perhaps her hands   may weave a net to catch this roman senate end of the first act act ii scene i the scene represents an apartment in the palace of the consuls titus messala messala   no tis unkind it hurts my tender friendship   he who but half unveils his secrets tells   too little or too much dost thou suspect me titus   do not reproach me my whole heart is thine messala   thou who so lately didst with me detest   the rigorous senate and pour forth thy plaints   in anguish thou who on this faithful bosom   didst shed so many tears couldst thou conceal   griefs far more bitter the keen pangs of love   how could ambition quench the rising flame   and blot out every tender sentiment   dost thou detest the hateful senate more   than thou lovest tullia     titus   o i love with transport   and hate with fury ever in extreme   it is the native weakness of my soul   which much i strive to conquer but in vain messala   but why thus rashly tear thy bleeding wounds   why weep thy injuries yet disguise thy love titus   spite of those injuries spite of all my wrongs   have i not shed my blood for this proud senate   thou knowest i have and didst partake my glory   with joy i told thee of my fair success   it showed methought a nobleness of soul   to fight for the ungrateful and i felt   the pride of conscious virtue the misfortunes   we have oercome with pleasure we impart   but few are anxious to reveal their shame messala   where is the shame the folly or disgrace   and what should titus blush at titus   at myself   at my fond foolish passion that oerpowers   my duty messala   are ambition then and love   passions unworthy of a noble mind titus   ambition love resentment all possess   the soul of titus and by turns inflame it         these consul kings despise my youth deny me   my valors due reward the price of blood   shed in their cause then midst my sorrows seize   all i hold dear and snatch my tullia from me   alas i had no hope and yet my heart   grows jealous now the fire long pent within   bursts forth with inextinguishable rage   i thought it had been oer she parted from me   and i had almost gained the victory   oer my rebellious passion but my race   of glory now is run and heaven has fixed   its period here gods that the son of brutus   the foe of kings should ever be the slave   of tarquins race nay the ungrateful fair   scorns to accept my conquered heart im slighted   disdained on every side and shame oerwhelms me messala   may i with freedom speak to thee titus   thou mayest   thou knowest i ever have revered thy prudence   speak therefore tell me all my faults messala messala   no i approve thy love and thy resentment   shall titus authorize this tyrant senate   these sons of arrogance if thou must blush   blush for thy patience titus not thy love   are these the poor rewards of all thy valor   thy constancy and truth a hopeless lover   a weak and powerless citizen of rome   a poor statevictim by the senate braved   and scorned by tullia sure a heart like thine   might find the means to be revenged on both     titus   why wilt thou flatter my despairing soul   thinkest thou i ever could subdue her hate   or shake her virtue tis impossible   thou seest the fatal barriers to our love   which duty and our fathers place between us   but must she go messala   this day my lord titus   indeed   but i will not complain for heaven is just   to her deservings she was born to reign messala   heaven had perhaps reserved a fairer empire   for beauteous tullia but for this proud senate   but for this cruel war nay but for titus   forgive me sir you know the inheritance   she might have claimed her brother dead the throne   of rome had been her portion—but ive gone   too far—and yet if with my life o titus   i could have served thee if my blood— titus   no more   my duty calls and that shall be obeyed   man may be free if he resolves to be so   i own the dangerous passion for a time   oerpowered my reason but a soldiers heart   braves every danger love owes all his power   to our own weakness     messala   the ambassador   from etruria is here this honor sir— titus   o fatal honor what would he with me   he comes to snatch my tullia from my sight   comes to complete the measure of my woes scene ii titus aruns aruns   after my long and fruitless toils to serve   the state of rome and her ungrateful senate   permit me here to pay the homage due   to generous courage and transcendent virtue   permit me to admire the gallant hero   who saved his country on the brink of ruin   alas thou hast deserved a fairer meed   a cause more noble and another foe   thy valor merited a better fate   kings would rejoice and such i know there are   to trust their empire with an arm like thine   who would not dread the virtues they admire   like jealous rome and her proud senate o   i cannot bear to see the noble titus   serving these haughty tyrants who the more   you have obliged them hate you more to them   your merits a reproach mean vulgar souls   born to obey they lift the oppressive hand   against their great deliverer and usurp         their sovereigns rights from thee they should receive   those orders which they give titus   i thank you sir   for all your cares your kind regard for titus   and guess the cause your subtle policy   would wind me to your secret purposes   and arm my rage against the commonweal   but think not to impose thus on my frankness   my heart is open and abhors design   the senate have misused me and i hate them   i ought to hate them but ill serve them still   when rome engages in the common cause   no private quarrels taint the patriot breast   superior then to party strife we rush   united on against the general foe   such are my thoughts and such they ever will be   thou knowest me now or call it virtue in me   or call it partial fondness what you please   but born a roman i will die for rome   and love this hard unjust suspicious senate   more than the pomp and splendor of a court   beneath a master for i am the son   of brutus and have graved upon my heart   the love of freedom and the hate of kings aruns   but does not titus soothe his flattered heart   with fancied bliss and visionary charms   i too my lord though born within the sway   of regal power am fond of liberty   you languish for her yet enjoy her not   is there on earth with all your boasted freedom         aught more despotic than a commonweal   your laws are tyrants and their barbarous rigor   deaf to the voice of merit to applause   to family and fame throws down distinction   the senate grind you and the people scorn   you must affright them or they will enslave you   a citizen of rome is ever jealous   or insolent he is your equal still   or still your foe because inferior to you   he cannot bear the lustre of high fortune   looks with an eye severe on every action   in all the service you have done him sees   naught but the injury you have power to do   and for the blood which you have shed for him   youll be repaid at last with—banishment   a court i owns a dangerous element   and has its storms but not so frequent smooth   its current glides its surface more serene   that boasted native of another soil   fair liberty here sheds her sweetest flowers   a king can love can recompense your service   and mingles happiness with glory there   cherished beneath the shade of royal favor   long mayest thou flourish only serve a master   and be thyself the lord of all beside   the vulgar ever to their sovereigns will   obedient still respect and honor those   whom he protects nay love his very faults   we never tremble at a haughty senate   or her harsh laws o would that born as thou art   to shine with equal lustre in a court   or in a camp thou wouldst but taste the charms   of tarquins goodness for he loved thee titus   and would have shared his fortunes with thee then   had the proud senate prostrate at thy feet—   0 titus   ive seen the court of tarquin and despise it   i know i might have cringed for his protection   been his first slave and tyrannized beneath him   but thanks to heaven i am not fallen so low   i would be great but not by meanness rise   to grandeur no it never was my fate   to serve ill conquer kings do thou obey them aruns   i must approve thy constancy but think   my lord how tarquin in thy infant years   guided thy tender youth he oft remembers   the pleasing office and but yesterday   lamenting his lost son and sad misfortunes   titus said he was once my best support   he loved us all and he alone deserved   my kingdom and my daughter titus   ha his daughter   ye gods my tullia o unhappy vows aruns   even now i carry her to tarquin him   whom thou hast thus deserted far from thee   and from her country soon must tullia go   ligurias king accepts of her in marriage   meantime thou titus must obey the senate   oppress her father and destroy his kingdom   and may these vaulted roofs these towers in flame   and this proud capitol in ashes laid   like funeral torches shine before your people   to light the roman senate to its grave   or serve to grace our happy tullias nuptials     scene iii titus messala titus   messala in what anguish hath he left me   would tarquin then have given her to my arms   o cruel fate and might i thus—o no   deceitful minister thou camest to search   my foolish heart alas he saw too well   read in my eyes the dear destructive passion   he knows my weakness and returns to tarquin   to smile at titus and insult his love   and might i then have wedded her possessed   that lovely maid and spent a life of bliss   within her arms had heaven allotted me   so fair a fate o i am doubly wretched messala   thou mightest be happy aruns would assist thee   trust me he would and second thy warm wishes titus   no i must bid adieu to my fond hopes   rome calls me to the capitol the people   who raised triumphal arches to my glory   and love me for my labors past expect me   to take with them the inviolable oath   the solemn pledge of sacred liberty messala   go then and serve your tyrants titus   i will serve them   it is my duty and i must fulfil it     messala   and yet you sigh titus   tis a hard victory messala   and bought too dearly titus   therefore tis more glorious   messala do not leave me in affliction   exit titus messala   ill follow him to sharpen his resentment   and strike the envenomed dagger to his heart scene iv brutus messala brutus   messala stop id speak with you messala   with me brutus   with you a deadly poison late hath spread   its secret venom oer my house my son   tiberius is with jealous rage inflamed   against his brother it appears too plain   whilst titus burns with most unjust resentment   against the senate the ambassador   that shrewd etruscan has observed their weakness   and doubtless profits by it he has talked         to both i dread the tongues of subtle statesmen   grown old in the chicanery of a court   tomorrow he returns a days too much   to give a traitor and ofttimes is fatal   go thou messala tell him he must hence   this day ill have it so messala   tis prudent sir   and i obey you brutus   but this is not all   my son the noble titus loves thee well   i know the power that sacred friendship hath   oer minds like his a stranger to distrust   or diffidence he yields his artless soul   to thy experience and the more his heart   relies on thee the more may i expect   that able as thou art to guide his steps   thou wilt not turn them from the paths of virtue   or take advantage of his easy youth   to taint his guiltless heart with fond ambition messala   that was even now the subject of our converse   he strives to imitate his godlike sire   romes safety is the object of his care   blindly he loves his country and his father brutus   and so he ought but above all the laws   to them he should be still a faithful slave   who breaks the laws can never love his country messala   we know his patriot zeal and both have seen it     brutus   he did his duty messala   rome had done hers too   if she had honored more so good a son brutus   messala no it suited not his age   to take the consulship he had not even   the voice of brutus trust me the success   of his ambition would have soon corrupted   his noble mind and the rewards of virtue   had then become hereditary soon   should we have seen the base unworthy son   of a brave father claim superior rank   unmerited in sloth and luxury   as our last tarquin but too plainly proved   how very seldom they deserve a crown   whore born to wear it o preserve us heaven   from such destructive vile abuse of power   the nurse of folly and the grave of virtue   if thou indeed dost love my son and much   i hope thou dost show him a fairer path   to glory root out from his heart the pride   of false ambition he who serves the state   is amply recompensed the son of brutus   should shine a bright example to the world   of every virtue he is romes support   as such i look upon him and the more   he has already done to serve his country   the more i shall require of him hereafter   know then by what i wish the love i bear him   temper the heat of youth to flatter titus   were death to him and injury to rome     messala   my lord i am content to follow titus   to imitate his valor not instruct him   i have but little influence oer your son   but if he deigns to listen to my counsels   rome soon will see how much he loves her glory brutus   go then be careful not to soothe his errors   for i hate tyrants much but flatterers more   exit brutus scene v messala   alone   theres not a tyrant more detestable   more cruel than thy own relentless soul   but i shall tread perhaps beneath my feet   the pride of all thy false insulting virtue   yes thou colossus raised thus high above us   by a vile crowd the thunder is prepared   soon shall it fall and crush thee into ruin end of the second act act iii scene i aruns albinus messala aruns   a letter in his hand   at length my friend a dawn of fair success         breaks in upon us thou hast served me nobly   and all is well this letter my albinus   decides the fate of tarquin and of rome   but tell me have you fixed the important hour   have you watched closely the quirinal gate   if our conspirators tonight should fail   to yield the ramparts up will your assault   be ready is the king well satisfied   thinkest thou albinus we shall bring him back   to rome subjected or to rome in blood albinus   my lord by midnight all will be prepared   tarquin already reaps the promised harvest   from you once more receives the diadem   and owns himself indebted more to aruns   than to porsenna aruns   or the envious gods   foes to our hapless sovereign must destroy   our fair design well worthy of their aid   or by tomorrows dawn rebellious rome   shall own a master rome perhaps in ashes   or bathing in her blood but better is it   a king should rule oer an unhappy people   who are obedient than in plentys lap   oer a proud nation who are still perverse   and obstinate because they are too happy   albinus i attend the princess here   in secret—stay messala     scene ii aruns messala aruns   touching titus   what has thou done couldst thou prevail on him   to serve the cause of tarquin couldst thou bind   his haughty soul messala   no i presumed too far   he is inflexible he loves his country   and has too much of brutus in him murmurs   against the senate but still dotes on tullia   pride and ambition love and jealousy   opened i thought a passage to his soul   and gave my arts some promise of success   but strange infatuation liberty   prevailed oer all his love is desperate   yet rome is stronger even than love in vain   i strove by slow degrees to efface the horror   which rome had taught his foolish heart to feel   even at the name of king in vain opposed   his rooted prejudice the very mention   of tarquin fired his soul he would not hear me   but broke off the discourse i must have gone   too far had i persisted aruns   then messala   there are no hopes of him     messala   much less reluctant   i found his brother one of brutus sons   at least is ours aruns   already hast thou gained   tiberius by what lucky art messala— messala   his own ambition did it all long time   with jealous eye hath he beheld the honors   heaped on his brother that eclipse his own   the wreath of laurel and the pomp of triumph   the waving ensigns with the peoples love   and brutus fondness lavished all on titus   like deepest injuries sunk into his soul   and helped to fill the poisoned cup of envy   whilst titus void of malice or revenge   too much superior to be jealous of him   stretched forth his hand from his triumphal car   as if he wished to give his brother part   of all his glories i embraced with joy   the lucky minute pointed out the paths   of glory promised in the name of tarquin   all the fair honors rome could give the throne   alone excepted i perceived him stagger   and saw him bend by slow degrees before me   hes yours my lord and longs to speak with you aruns   will he deliver the quirinal gate   messala messala   titus is commander there   and he alone can give it us already         his virtues have been fatal to our purpose   he is the guardian deity of rome   the attack is dangerous without his support   success were doubtful with it all is certain aruns   if he solicited the consulship   thinkest thou he would refuse the sovereign power   the sure reversion of a throne with tullia messala   twere an affront to his exalted virtue   to offer him a throne aruns   and tullia with it messala   o he adores her and even loves her more   because he strives to hate detests the father   and rages for the daughter dreads to speak   yet mourns in silence seeks her everywhere   yet shuns her presence and drinks up his tears   in secret anguish all the rage of love   possesses him sometimes in storms like these   a lucky moment turns the wavering mind   titus i know is turbulent and bold   and if we gain him may perhaps go further   even than we wish who knows but fierce ambition   may yet rekindle by the torch of love   his heart would glow with pleasure to behold   the trembling senate prostrate at his feet   yet let me not deceive you with the hopes   that titus ever will be ours once more   however i shall try his stubborn virtue   0 aruns   if still he loves i shall depend on him   one look of tullias one sweet word from her   will soften his reluctant heart much more   than all the arts of aruns or messala   for o believe me we must hope for naught   from men but through their weakness and their follies   titus and tullia must promote our cause   the ones ambition and the others love   these these my friend are the conspirators   that best will serve the king from them i hope   much more than from myself   exit messala scene iii tullia aruns algina aruns   this letter madam   with orders to deliver it to your hands   i have received from tarquin tullia   gracious heaven   preserve my father and reverse his fate   she reads   the throne of rome may from its ashes rise   and he who was the conqueror of his king   be his restorer titus

filled my aged breast   with double vigor i had scized messala   and hoped by tortures to have wrested from him   the names of his associates but behold   surrounded by my lictors on a sudden   he from his bosom drew a poniard forth   designed no doubt for other purposes   and cried if you would know messalas secrets   look for them here within this bleeding breast   he who has courage to conspire against you   can keep the counsel which he gives and die   then as tumultuously they gathered round him   pierced his false heart and like a roman died   though he had lived unworthy of the name         already aruns was beyond the walls   of rome our guards pursued him to the camp   stopped him with tullia and ere long will bring   the traitor here when heaven i trust will soon   unravel all their dark and deadly purpose   valerius will detect them but remember   friends romans countrymen i charge you all   when ye shall know the names of these vile slaves   these parricides

faith twixt man and man   and of their holy ministry the fruit   is grateful peace they are the sacred bonds   that knit the sovereigns of the earth together   and as the friends of all by all revered   ask thy own heart if thou art such thou darest not         but if thy master bade thee learn our laws   our virtues and our treasures we will teach thee   now what rome is and what a roman senate   will teach thee that this people still respects   the law of nations which thou hast dishonored   the only punishment inflicted on thee   shall be to see thy vile associates bleed   and tell thy king

power   and break thy solemn vows didst thou resolve   to do this titus titus   i resolved on nothing   filled with a deadly poison that possessed   my frantic mind i did not know myself    0    nor do i yet and my distempered soul   in its wild rage was for a moment guilty   that moment clothed me with eternal shame   and made me false to what i loved my country   tis past and anguish and

cruel flame   that fired my guilt and still perhaps augments it   completed my destruction to confess it   is double shame to rome of little service    0    and most unworthy of us both i own it   but

have followed thee   and served my country if remorse and anguish   already have oerpaid my crimes o deign   within thy arms once more to hold a wretch   abandoned and forlorn o say at least   my son thy father hates thee not that word   alone my fame and virtue shall restore   and save my memory from the brand of shame   the world will say when titus died a look   from you relieved him from his load of grief   and made him full amends for all his sorrows   spite of his guilt that still esteemed by thee   he bore thy blessing with him to the grave brutus   o rome his pangs oppress me o my

voltaire to frederick of prussia in    0 to the kings great delight the following correspondence has peculiar interest in his life of voltaire james parton says the great lesson of the play is that the founders of false religions at once despise and practise upon the docile credulity of men when i remember that this powerful exhibition of executive force triumphing over credulity and weakness was vividly stamped upon the susceptible brain of frederick by voltaires impassioned declamation at the very time he was revolving his silesian project i am inclined to the conjecture that it may have been the deciding influence upon the kings mind the play was withdrawn after the fourth representation under pressure of church authorities who professed to see in it a bloody satire against the christian religion this letter preserves the original characteristics m de voltaire january  0      rotterdam to his majesty the king of prussia rotterdam january  0      sir i am at present like the pilgrims of mecca turning their eyes perpetually towards that city after leaving it as i do mine towards the court of prussia my heart deeply penetrated with the sense of your majestys goodness knows no grief but that which arises from my incapacity of being always   with you i have taken the liberty to send your majesty a fresh copy of mahomet the sketch of which you have seen some time ago this is a tribute which i pay to the lover of arts the sensible critic and above all to the philosopher much more than to the sovereign your majesty knows by what motive i was inspired in the composition of that work the love of mankind and the hatred of fanaticism two virtues that adorn your throne guided my pen i have ever been of opinion that tragedy should correct as well as move the heart of what consequence or importance to mankind are the passions or misfortunes of any of the heroes of antiquity if they do not convey some instruction to us it is universally acknowledged that the comedy of tartuffe a piece hitherto unequalled did a great deal of good in the world by showing hypocrisy in its proper light and why therefore should we not endeavor in a tragedy to expose that species of imposture which sets to work the hypocrisy of some and the madness of others why may we not go back to the histories of those ancient ruffians the illustrious founders of superstition and fanaticism who first carried the sword to the altar to sacrifice all those who refused to embrace their doctrines they who tell us that these days of wickedness are past that we shall never see any more barcochebas mahomets johns of leyden etc and that the flames of religious war are totally extinguished in my opinion pay too high a compliment to human nature the same poison still subsists though it does not appear so openly—some symptoms of this plague break out from time to time—enough to infect the earth have not we in our own age seen the   prophets of cévennes killing in the name of god those of their sect who were not sufficiently pliant to their purposes the action i have described is terrible i do not know whether horror was ever carried farther on any stage a young man born with virtuous inclinations seduced by fanaticism assassinates an old man who loves him and whilst he imagines he is serving god is without knowing it guilty of parricide the murder is committed by the order of an impostor who promises him a reward which proves to be incest this i acknowledge is full of horror but your majesty is thoroughly sensible that tragedy should not consist merely of love jealousy and marriage even our histories abound in actions much more horrible than that which i have invented seid does not know that the person whom he assassinates is his father and when he has committed the crime feels the deepest remorse for it but mézeray tells us that at milan a father killed his son with his own hand on account of religion and was not in the least sorry for it the story of the two brothers diaz is well known one of them was at rome and the other in germany in the beginning of the commotions raised by luther bartholomew diaz hearing that his brother embraced the opinion of luther at frankfort left rome on purpose to assassinate him and accordingly did so herrera a spanish author tells us that bartholomew diaz ran a great hazard in doing this but nothing intimidates a man of honor guided by honesty herrera we see brought up in that holy religion which is an enemy to cruelty a religion which teaches longsuffering and not revenge was persuaded that honesty might make a man an assassin and a parricide   ought we not to rise up on all sides against such infernal maxims these put the poniard into the hand of that monster who deprived france of henry the great these placed the picture of james clement on the altar and his name amongst the saints these took away the life of william prince of orange founder of the liberty and prosperity of his country salcede shot at and wounded him in the forehead with a pistol and strada tells us that salcede would not dare to undertake that enterprise till he had purified his soul by confession at the feet of a dominican and fortified it by the holy sacrament herrera has something more horrible and more ridiculous concerning it he stood firm says he after the example of our saviour jesus christ and his saints balthasar girard who afterwards took away the life of that great man behaved in the same manner as salcede i have remarked that all those who voluntarily committed such crimes were young men like seid balthasar girard was about twenty years old and the four spaniards who had bound themselves by oath with him to kill the prince were of the same age the monster who killed henry iii was but fourandtwenty and poltrot who assassinated the great duke of guise only twentyfive this is the age of seduction and madness in england i was once a witness to how far the power of fanaticism could work on a weak and youthful imagination a boy of sixteen whose name was shepherd engaged to assassinate king george i your majestys grandfather by the mothers side what could prompt him to such madness the only reason to be assigned was that shepherd was not of the same religion with the king they took pity on his youth offered him his   pardon and for a long time endeavored to bring him to repentance but he always persisted in saying it was better to obey god than man and if they let him go the first use he made of his liberty should be to kill the king so that they were obliged at last to execute him as a monster whom they despaired of bringing to any sense of reason i will venture to affirm that all who have seen anything of mankind must have remarked how easily nature is sometimes sacrificed to superstition how many fathers have detested and disinherited their children how many brothers have persecuted brothers on this destructive principle i have myself seen instances of it in more than one family if superstition does not always signalize itself in those glaring crimes which history transmits to us in society it does every day all the mischief it possibly can disunites friends separates kindred and relations destroys the wise and worthy by the hands of fools and enthusiasts it does not indeed every day poison a socrates but it banishes descartes from a city which ought to be the asylum of liberty and gives jurieu who acted the part of a prophet credit enough to impoverish the wise philosopher bayle it banished the successor of the great leibnitz and deprives a noble assembly of young men that crowded to his lectures of pleasure and improvement and to reestablish him heaven must raise up amongst us a royal philosopher that true miracle which is so rarely to be seen in vain does human reason advance towards perfection by means of that philosophy which of late has made so great a progress in europe in vain do you most noble prince both inspire and practise this humane philosophy whilst in the same age wherein reason  0 raises her throne on one side the most absurd fanaticism adorns her altars on the other it may perhaps be objected to me that out of my too abundant zeal i have made mahomet in this tragedy guilty of a crime which in reality he was not capable of committing the count de boulainvilliers some time since wrote the life of this prophet whom he endeavored to represent as a great man appointed by providence to punish the christian world and change the face of at least onehalf of the globe mr sale likewise who has given us an excellent translation of the koran into english would persuade us to look upon mahomet as a numa or a theseus i will readily acknowledge that we ought to respect him if born a legitimate prince or called to government by the voice of the people he had instituted useful and peaceful laws like numa or like theseus defended his countrymen but for a driver of camels to stir up a faction in his village to associate himself with a set of wretched koreish and persuade them that he had an interview with the angel gabriel to boast that he was carried up to heaven and there received part of that unintelligible book which contradicts common sense in every page that in order to procure respect for this ridiculous performance he should carry fire and sword into his country murder fathers and ravish their daughters and after all give those whom he conquered the choice of his religion or death this is surely what no man will pretend to vindicate unless he was born a turk and superstition had totally extinguished in him the light of nature mahomet i know did not actually commit that particular crime which is the subject of this tragedy    history only informs us that he took away the wife of seid one of his followers and persecuted abusophan whom i call zopir but what is not that man capable of who in the name of god makes war against his country it was not my design merely to represent a real fact but real manners and characters to make men think as they naturally must in their circumstances but above all it was my intention to show the horrid schemes which villainy can invent and fanaticism put in practice mahomet is here no more than tartuffe in arms upon the whole i shall think myself amply rewarded for my labor if any one of those weak mortals who are ever ready to receive the impressions of a madness foreign to their nature should learn from this piece to guard themselves against such fatal delusions if after being shocked at the dreadful consequences of seids obedience he should say to himself why must i blindly follow the blind who cry out to me hate persecute all who are rash enough not to be of the same opinion with ourselves even in things and matters we do not understand what infinite service would it be to mankind to eradicate such false sentiments a spirit of indulgence would make us all brothers a spirit of persecution can create nothing but monsters this i know is your majestys opinion to live with such a prince and such a philosopher would be my greatest happiness my sincere attachment can only be equalled by my regret but if other duties draw me away they can never blot out the respect i owe to a prince who talks and thinks like a man who despises that specious gravity which is always a cover for meanness and ignorance a prince who converses with freedom because he is not afraid of    being known who is still eager to be instructed and at the same time capable himself of instructing the most learned and the most sagacious i shall whilst i have life remain with the most profound respect and deepest sense of gratitude your majestys voltaire m de voltaire august         paris pope benedict xiv a letter from m de voltaire to pope benedict xiv most blessed father— your holiness will pardon the liberty taken by one of the lowest of the faithful though a zealous admirer of virtue of submitting to the head of the true religion this performance written in opposition to the founder of a false and barbarous sect to whom could i with more propriety inscribe a satire on the cruelty and errors of a false prophet than to the vicar and representative of a god of truth and mercy your holiness will therefore give me leave to lay at your feet both the piece and the author of it and humbly to request your protection of the one and your benediction upon the other in hopes of which with the profoundest reverence i kiss your sacred feet paris august         voltaire pope benedict xiv m de voltaire the answer of pope benedict xiv to m de voltaire benedictus p p dilecto filio salutem  apostolicam benedictionem this day sevennight i was favored with your    excellent tragedy of mahomet which i have read with great pleasure cardinal passionei has likewise presented me with your fine poem of fontenoy signor leprotti this day repeated to me your distich made on my retreat yesterday morning cardinal valenti gave me your letter of the   th of august many are the obligations which you have conferred on me for which i am greatly indebted to you for all and every one of them and i assure you that i have the highest esteem for your merit which is so universally acknowledged the distich has been published at rome and objected to by one of the literati who in a public conversation affirmed that there was a mistake in it with regard to the word hic which is made short whereas it ought to be always long to which i replied that it may be either long or short virgil having made it short in this verse solus hic inflexit sensus animumque labantem and long in another hic finis priami fatorum hic exitus illum the answer i think was pretty full and convincing considering that i have not looked into virgil these fifty years the cause however is properly yours to your honor and sincerity therefore of which i have the highest opinion i shall leave it to be defended against your opposers and mine and here give you my apostolical benediction datum romæ apud sanctam mariam majorem die    sept pontificatus nostri anno sexto m de voltaire pope benedict xiv a letter of thanks from m de voltaire to the pope the features of your excellency are not better    expressed on the medal you were so kind as to send me than are the features of your mind in the letter which you honored me with permit me to lay at your feet my sincerest acknowledgments in points of literature as well as in matters of more importance your infallibility is not to be disputed your excellency is much better versed in the latin tongue than the frenchman whom you condescended to correct i am indeed astonished how you could so readily appeal to virgil the popes were always ranked amongst the most learned sovereigns but amongst them i believe there never was one in whom so much learning and taste united agnosco rerum dominos gentemque togatam if the frenchman who found fault with the word hic had known as much of virgil as your excellency he might have recollected a verse where hic is both long and short hic vir hic est tibi quem promitti sæpius audis i cannot help considering this verse as a happy presage of the favors conferred on me by your excellency thus might rome cry out when benedict xiv was raised to the papacy with the utmost respect and gratitude i kiss your sacred feet etc voltaire

called in vain to end my hated being   what have i suffered for my dear palmira   how have i cursed the tardy hours that long   withheld my vengeance my distracted souls   impatience thirsted for the bloody field   that with these hands i might lay waste this seat   of slavery where palmira mourned so long   in sad captivity but thanks to heaven   our holy prophet whose deep purposes   are far beyond the ken of human wisdom   hath hither sent his chosen servant omar   i flew to meet him they required a hostage   i gave my faith and they received it firm   in my resolve to live or die for

motionless i stood   as one deprived of life no succor nigh   no ray of hope was left when seid came   to ease my troubled heart and bring me comfort seid   who could behold unmoved palmiras woes palmira   the cruel zopir not insensible   he seemed to my misfortunes yet at last   unkindly told me i must never hope   to leave these walls for naught should tear me from him seid   tis false for

and to save to fix his power   and hold dominion oer the conquered heart   i spoke the hoary sages smiled applause   and all inclined to favor us but zopir        still resolute and still inflexible   declared the people should be called together   and give their general voice the people met   again i spoke addressed the citizens   exhorted threatened practised every art   to win their favor and at length prevailed   the gates are opened to great mahomet   who after fifteen years of cruel exile   returns to bless once more his native land   with him the gallant ali brave hercides   and ammon the invincible besides   a numerous train of chosen followers   the people throng around him some with looks   of hatred some with smiles of cordial love   some bless the hero and some curse the tyrant   some threaten and blaspheme whilst others fall   beneath his feet embrace and worship him   meantime the names of god of peace and freedom   are echoed through the allbelieving crowd   whilst zopirs dying party bellows forth   in idle threats its impotent revenge   amidst their cries unruffled and serene   in triumph walks the godlike mahomet   bearing the olive in his hand already   peace is proclaimed and see the conqueror comes scene iii mahomet omar hercides seid palmira attendants mahomet   my friends and fellowlaborers valiant ali   morad and ammon and hercides hence   to your great

sway   thou knowest there is a tale which i have spread   and they believe that universal empire   awaits the prophet who to meccas walls   shall lead his conquering bands and bring her peace   tis

that amidst   those few staunch followers who own no god   no faith but thine who love thee as their father   their friend and benefactor none obey   or serve thee with an humbler better mind   they are most faithful mahomet   omar thou art deceived   they are my worst of foes they love each other    omar   and can you blame their tenderness mahomet   my friend   ill tell thee all my weakness omar   how my lord mahomet   thou knowest the reigning passion of my soul   whilst proud ambition and the cares of empire   weighed heavy on me mahomets hard life   has been a conflict with opposing nature   whom i have vanquished by austerity   and selfdenial have banished from me   that baleful poison which unnerves mankind   which only serves to fire them into madness   and brutal follies on the burning sand   or desert rocks i brave the inclement sky   and bear the seasons rough vicissitude   love is my only solace the dear object   of all my toils the idol i adore   the god of mahomet the powerful rival   of my ambition know midst all my queens   palmira reigns sole mistress of my heart   think then what pangs of jealousy thy friend   must feel when she expressed her fatal passion   for seid omar   but thou art revenged mahomet   judge thou   if soon i ought not to take vengeance on them   that thou mayest hate my rival more ill tell thee        who seid and palmira are—the children   of him whom i abhor my deadliest foe omar   ha zopir mahomet   is their father fifteen years   are past since brave hercides to my care   gave up their infant years they know not yet   or who or what they are i brought them up   together i indulged their lawless passion   and added fuel to the guilty flame   methinks it is as if the hand of heaven   had meant in them to centre every crime   but i must—ha their father comes this way   his eyes are full of bitterness and wrath   against me—now be vigilant my omar   hercides must be careful to possess   this most important pass return and tell me   whether tis most expedient to declare   against him or retreat away scene v zopir mahomet zopir   hard fate   unhappy zopir thus compelled to meet   my worst of foes the foe of all mankind mahomet   since tis the will of heaven that mahomet   and zopir should at length unite approach   without a blush and fearless tell thy tale    zopir   i blush for thee alone whose baneful arts   have drawn thy country to the brink of ruin   who in the bosom of fair peace wouldst wage   intestine war loosen the sacred bonds   of friendship and destroy our happiness   beneath the veil of proffered terms thou meanest   but to betray whilst discord stalks before thee   thou vile assemblage of hypocrisy   and insolence abhorred tyrant thus   do the chosen ministers of heaven dispense   its sacred blessings and announce their god mahomet   wert thou not zopir i would answer thee   as thou deservest in thunder by the voice   of that offended being thou deridest   armed with the hallowed koran i would teach thee   to tremble and obey in humble silence   and with the subject world to kneel before me   but i will talk to thee without disguise   as man to man should speak and friend to friend   i have ambition zopir wheres the man   who has it not but never citizen   or chief or priest or king projected aught   so noble as the plan of mahomet   in acts or arms hath every

constantine   splendor is fled the roman empire torn   by discord sees its scattered members spread   on every side inglorious—let us raise   arabia on the ruins of mankind   the blind and tottering universe demands   another worship and another god   crete had her minos egypt her osiris   to asia zoroaster gave his laws   and numa was in italy adored   oer savage nations where nor monarchs ruled   nor manners softened nor religion taught   hath many a sage his fruitless maxims spread   beneath a nobler yoke i mean to bend   the prostrate world and change their feeble laws   abolish their false worship pull down   their powerless gods and on my purer faith   found universal empire say not zopir   that mahomet betrays his country no   i mean but to destroy its weak supports   and

fear all from zopir seid   can he have a heart   so base and so perfidious but this morning        when as a hostage i appeared before him   i thought him noble generous and humane   some power invincible in secret worked   and won me to him whether the respect   due to his name or specious form external   concealed the blackness of his heart i know not   whether thy presence filled my raptured soul   with joy that drove out every painful sense   and would not let me think of aught but thee   whateer the cause methought i was most happy   when nearest him that he should thus seduce   my easy heart makes me detest him more   and yet how hard it is to look on those   with eyes of hatred whom we wish to love palmira   by every bond hath heaven united us   and seid and palmira are the same   were i not bound to thee and to that faith   which mahomet inspires i too had pleaded   the cause of zopir but religion love   and nature all forbid it seid   think no more   of vain

historical truth a duke of brittany in the year      commanded the lord of bavalan to assassinate the constable of clisson bavalan the day after told the duke it was done the duke becoming sensible of the horror of his crime and apprehensive of the fatal consequences of it abandoned himself to the most violent despair bavalan after giving him time to repent at length told him that he had loved him well enough to disobey his orders etc the action is transported to another age and country for particular reasons    act i scene i amelia lisois lisois   permit a soldier in this seat of war   to steal a moment from the battles rage   and greet the fair amelia to the king   thy noble heart is bound i know by ties   of dearest friendship long and faithfully   hath lisois served the valiant duke of foix   who holds thee here a prisoner well i know   the violence of his passion for amelia   foresee the dreadful consequence and come   with all the warmth of friendship to advise   and to consult to lay my heart before thee   perhaps tis not unworthy of thy notice amelia   the seal of truth is ever on thy lips   i know thy firm integrity whateer   thou sayest i shall believe lisois   know then though long   ive served the duke with most unwearied zeal   through years of peril and unnumbered toils   yet could i neer approve the fatal league   that bound him to the moor and took from france   the noblest of her princes in these days    0   of public discord i have ranged myself   beneath no banners but what honor raised   and followed but the dictates of my heart   not that the slave of prejudice my soul   is blind to all the errors of a friend   with grief i see the dukes impatient warmth   the impetuous ardor of his boiling youth   i cannot shut my eyes against his follies   ofttimes the torrent which i strive to stop   mocks my weak power and throws down all before it   but he has virtues that will recompense   his worst of faults if we must follow none   but perfect princes whose unbiassed hearts   are free from every vice and every weakness   whom shall we serve i love the duke and yet   tis with regret i draw the hostile sword   gainst france i wish he could be reconciled amelia   if that could eer be done thy influence best   might reunite them if he loves his glory   sure this misguided prince will listen to thee   how fatal has his error been lisois   in vain   ive tried to bend his haughty spirit oft   have i with harsh unwelcome truths attacked him   and sorely pierced his heart but thou alone   canst bring him to his duty and his king   that was my errand here there was a time   when on the fair amelia i had placed   my hopes of bliss without abasement then   i thought you might have listened to my vows   but heaven reserved thee for a nobler fate        whilst i was absent by the cruel moors   thou wert enslaved the happy conqueror came   the gallant foix and saved thee from their rage   his was the glory his be the reward   his claims are strong his youth his rank and power   his fame and services all plead for him   amelias justice and her gratitude   must bind her to him i have no pretence   and therefore i am silent but if merit   could make thee mine i would dispute the prize   even with the sons of kings nor yield amelia   to any but to him he is my master   my leader and my friend he loves me well   i am not a half proud half virtuous lover   but what i still would litigate with power   i give to friendship nay i can do more   i can subdue the weakness of my heart   and plead a rivals cause point out the path   of glory to thee show thee what is due   to that illustrious hero who preserved thee   by whom thou livest i can behold unmoved   and with unenvying eye thy charms bestowed   on him who best deserves them take my heart   between you and accept my honest service   this arm shall fight for both i sacrifice   my passions to your interest friendship bids me   and i obey my country too commands   remember if the prince is yours he soon   will be the kings amelia   thy virtues noble youth   astonish me thou givest the admiring world   a rare example canst thou be sincere   and sure thou art so thus to conquer love        and give up all to friendship all who know   must wonder at thee thou hast served thy master   and canst not be an enemy to mine   a heart so generous sure must think with me   tis not in souls like thine to hate their king   shall i then ask one favor at thy hands lisois   amelias orders shall be ever sacred   command and i obey amelia   thy generous counsel   hath urged me to accept a noble rank   i looked not for and offered by a prince   the choice i own does honor to amelia   when i reflect that long before he told   his love he saved my liberty and life   foe to his sovereign though the rebel moor   hath drawn him from his duty and allegiance   yet he has poured so many favors on me   i cannot bear to hurt him though in spite   of all his goodness and my gratitude   i must refuse him his unhappy passion   afflicts me tis distressful to my heart   for all his kindness thus to make him wretched   fain would i spare myself the ungrateful task   of saying that i must not hear his vows   it is not for my feeble voice to tell   a prince his duty twere a dangerous power   and i am far from wishing to enjoy it   who can direct him better than thyself   alas my lord tis not a time for love   the royal army at our gates and naught   but war and slaughter all around us blood   on every side himself against my master        against his brother now in arms all these   are powerful reasons o my lord in you   is all my hope forgive me o complete   the generous work restore me to my king   let him do that tis all i ask but add   this effort more to what thoust done already   thou hast the strongest influence oer his heart   a firm and manly soul a friend like thee   respected and beloved will make the voice   of duty heard his counsels will be laws lisois   alas those counsels will have little weight   against the passions that possess his soul   his fiery temper gives me too much cause   to fear him hes inclined to jealousy   and if he hears i had a thought of thee   twill drive his soul to madness and perhaps   undo us all he must be soothed by art   leave him to me and try to reconcile   your jarring interests weigh his offers well   henceforth ill think no more of love and thee   but get me to the field the soldiers duty   shall there engross me if thou lovest thy country   if france be dear to thee restore her hero   and she will bless thee for the deed farewell scene ii amelia thais amelia   restore him said he what at the dear price   of all my happiness it cannot be   twere infamous and base the worst of crimes    thais   but wherefore is the prince thus hateful to you   why in these days of discord war and tumult   whilst faction reigns and of our royal race   brother gainst brother arms and every hour   brings new afflictions wherefore should amelia   whose gentler stars for other purposes   had formed her soul to love and to be loved   why should amelia with such sentiments   of scorn and hatred meet a heros vows   who had avenged her cause the prince thou knowest   amongst his ancestors can boast the blood   of our first kings and is himself a lord   of rich domains and wideextended power   he loves you offers you his hand can rank   and title objects that are envied still   by all mankind pursued with eagerness   and gained with rapture can these only fill   thy heart with sorrow and thy eyes with tears amelia   because he saved me once has he a right   now to oppress me must amelia fall   a victim to his fatal aid i know   im much indebted to him would i were not thais   nay thats ungrateful amelia   thou shalt know my heart   my miseries my duty and my fate   i will no longer keep the secret from thee   twere cruel to distrust thee when thou knowest   my story thou mayst justify thy friend        i must not listen to the princes vows   for know my heart is given to his brother thais   ha to the noble vamir amelia   yes my friend   with mutual oaths we sealed our mutual faith   and at leucate i expected him   there to confirm it at the holy altar   when by the cruel moors that rushed upon us   i was surprised and made a captive then   the prince to these unconquered savages   in firm alliance bound appeared and saved me   theres my distress the life another saved   must be devoted to the faithful vamir thais   but why then thus conceal thy passion why   nourish a hopeless flame thou shouldst extinguish   he would respect this sacred tie and check   his fruitless passion amelia   o i must not tell him   the brothers to complete my sorrows armed   against each other have taken different parties   in this destructive war the faithful vamir   fights for his king thou knowest the violence   of his proud rival all i can oppose   to his fierce rage is melancholy silence   even yet he knows not that in happier times   the gallant vamir had engaged my heart   to tell it him would fire his jealous soul   and only make amelia more unhappy        tis time to quit this fatal place the king   with pleasure will receive me let us hence   the prisoners thais from these walls even now   are breaking forth and meditate their flight   they will conduct us i defy all danger   will hazard all for freedom and repose thais   behold the duke amelia   i cannot speak to him   the starting tear would soon betray me what   would i not give forever to avoid

that linked your hearts   in earlier years he may assist us now   and be the means of making wishedfor peace   my cares— duke   away i would not be obliged   thus to a brother shall i sue for peace   and ask forgiveness yet it hurts my soul   to think that vamir is my foe i still   remember our past friendship and the love   i bore him once but since he will oppose me   since hes no longer ours why let him go   and serve his king lisois   thy fiery temper braves   too far the patience of an easy monarch duke   a monarch the mere phantom of a king   unworthy of his race a royal slave   in golden chains and seated on a throne   subjected to a petty officer   im not afraid of pepin their archtyrant   i hate a subject that would frighten me        and i despise a king who cant command

i condemn ill follow thee   tis a friends duty to point out the faults   of him he loves to counsel to exhort   to save him from the dangerous precipice   this i have done for thee but thou wilt fall   and i must perish with thee duke   o my friend   what hast thou said lisois   but what i ought to say   and would to heaven that thou hadst listened to me   what dost thou purpose duke   when my ardent hopes   shall be fulfilled when the ungrateful maid   shall give sweet peace to my distracted mind   then will i hear the counsels of my friend   what can i purpose now or what design   till i

still turn from me still insult the heart   that dotes upon thee cruel tyrant thus   to blast the laurels planted on my brow   o if amelias hand had placed them there   they might have flourished but she has forgot   her plighted faith and broke her flattering promise amelia   thou never hadst my faith i never gave   thee promise gratitude is all i owe thee  0  duke   did i not offer thee my hand amelia   thou didst   it was an honor which i could not merit   and which i never sought but i received it   with due respect you thought no doubt a rank   so glorious must have dazzled poor amelia   at length my lord tis time to undeceive you   i do it with regret because i know   it will offend you but i must be plain   in short my lord i love my king too well   to think of wedding with his foe thy blood   i know is noble mine is spotless yet   nor will be stained with foul disloyalty   and i inherit from my ancestors   the fixed abhorrence of my countrys foes   nor will i eer acknowledge for a master   the friend of tyrants be he eer so great   such is my firm resolve perhaps my lord   it may seem harsh but you obliged me to it duke   this is a language madam which i own   i looked not for i never could have thought   that angry heaven to make me doubly wretched   would choose amelia for its instrument   of vengeance you have studied long in secret   the arts of black ingratitude of scorn   and insult and now open all your heart   i was a stranger to this patriot zeal   this most heroic ardor for thy country   this fetch of policy but tell me madam   whom have you here but this insulted lover   the injured foix to succor and support you    0    thou hast reproached me with my new alliance   those faithful friends on whom i here rely   for all my safety and for all my power   without their aid thou hadst been still a captive   to them you owed your liberty and life   and am i thus rewarded amelia   you prolonged   my wretched days but are they therefore yours   and may i not dispose them as i please   did you preserve me but to make me wretched   to be a tyrant oer the life you saved duke   ungrateful woman thou deservest the name   of tyrant most for now i read thy soul   see through the thin disguise behold too plainly   my own dishonor and thy treacherous falsehood   i know thou lovest another but whoeer   he be that thus hath robbed me of thy heart   fear thou my love and tremble at my rage   for if he be on earth ill find the traitor   and tear him from thee if amidst its horrors   my soul could feel one momentary joy   twould be to make thee wretched amelia   no my lord   indeed it would not reason will forbid it   thy souls too noble to oppress with woe   a life which thou hadst saved but if thy heart   should ever stoop so low thy virtues still   thy goodness in my memory shall live   and only thy unkindness be forgotten   i pity and forgive thee thou wilt blush    0    hereafter at the thought of injuring me   spite of thy threats my soul is yet unmoved   nor dreads thy anger nor defies thy power duke   forgive the transports of a mind disturbed   the rage of love embittered by despair   lisois i find holds secret conference with you   abets you falsehood and defends your conduct   leans to the royal party and combines   in vain with you to make a convert of me   it seems im to be governed by your will   and not my own your converse is the same   the same your purpose but why use these arms   against me to persuade my easy heart   why must amelia seek a strangers aid   a word will win me if tis spoke by love amelia   my heart i own hath opened to thy friend   its hopes and fears but he hath done much more   than he had promised pity then my tears   pity my sorrows be thyself again   subdue a passion which amelia must not   cannot return accept my gratitude   tis all i have to give thee duke   lisois then   and he alone enjoys thy confidence   thy friendship more perhaps i see it now amelia   you may perhaps hereafter but at present   you have no right sir to control my thoughts   my actions or my words no right to blame me    0    or to complain i sought thy friends assistance   and he has given it me i wish my lord   that you would learn to act and think like him scene iii the duke   alone   tis well this base ungrateful perjured woman   without a blush confesses all her falsehood   the mystery is unfolded now one friend   one only friend i had and he destroys me   friendship vain phantom unsubstantial shade   so often sought for and so seldom found   thou ever hadst some wholesome draught to pour   into my cup of sorrow but at last   thou too like love hast cruelly deceived me   for the reward of all my errors past   i have but this that no allurements now   no flattering pleasures henceforth shall betray me   for from this hour i will be fond—of nothing   but lo the traitor comes with cruel hand   to tear my wounds and make them bleed afresh scene iv the duke lisois lisois   my lord i come obedient to thy orders   but why that frown those eyes of discontent   that scowl upon me has thy soul long time   the sport of passion weighed in reasons scale   thy interest and thy happiness  0  duke   it has lisois   and what was the result duke   my eyes are opened   to falsehood and deceit ive learned to find   a rival and a traitor in my friend lisois   hows that duke   it is enough lisois   too much my lord   who is the traitor duke   canst thou ask me who   who but thyself was privy to the wrongs   i have received who else must answer for them   i know amelia hath conversed with thee   here in the palace when i mentioned thee   she trembled this affected silence speaks   your guilt more plainly and i know not which   most to abhor amelia or—my friend lisois   canst thou yet listen to that friend duke   i can lisois   thinkest thou i still am anxious for my fame   dost thou esteem and canst thou yet believe me  0  duke   i will for till this hour i thought thee virtuous   and held thee for my friend lisois   those noble titles   have hitherto conducted me through life   but wherefore justify myself to thee   thoust not deserved it know amelias charms   long since had touched my heart before thy hand   had set her free and saved her precious life   but by the ties of gratitude shes thine   thou hast deserved her by thy services   for me im more the soldier than the soft   and tender lover i despise the art   of base seduction fit for courts alone   and flatterys smooth perfidiousness my soul   is made of firmer stuff i talked indeed   of marriage to her and that sacred tie   knit by esteem and fair equality   of fortune and condition might have made her   more happy far than rank and titles could   that stand upon a dangerous precipice   but yesternight you know i visited   your ramparts when your jealous soul alarmed   discovered all its passion i observed it   today i saw the object of your grief   your loved amelia and beheld her charms   with eyes of cold indifference oer myself   i gained an easy conquest i did more   pleaded for thee for an ungrateful friend   and urged a passion which i cant approve   recalled the memory of thy bounties past   thy glory and thy rank acknowledged faults   i knew you had and numbered all your virtues    0    all this against myself i did for thee   for my friends happiness gave up my own   and if the sacrifice is still imperfect   show me the rival that still dares to oppose thee   and i will stake my life to do thee justice duke   my friend thou soarest above me i am fallen   abashed confounded who could see amelia   and not adore her but to conquer thus   thy passion o thou never couldst have loved her lisois   i did but love like other passions acts   with different force on different minds duke   i love   too well my friend and cannot imitate   the virtue i admire my foolish heart— lisois   i ask not for thy praises but thy love   and if thou thinkest that i have merited   aught at thy hands o do but serve thyself   thy happiness is lisois best reward   thou seest with what determined hate thy brother   pursues the moor i dread the consequence   the people groan beneath this foreign yoke   soon i foresee the empire will unite   their scattered powers new enemies still rise   against us the pure blood of clovis still   is worshipped by the crowd and soon or late   the branches of this sacred tree that long   have bent beneath the storm again shall rise   spring with fresh verdure and overshade the land   placed by thy rank and fortunes near the throne    0    long time thou wert thy king and countrys friend   but in the days of public discord fate   attached thee to another cause perhaps   new interests now may call for new connections   and what united may dissolve the tie   the power of these despotic governors   may be restrained and weakened by thy hand— duke   i wish it were so thinkest thou then amelia   would listen to me if i should embrace   the royal party might she still be mine lisois   i am a stranger to amelias heart   but what are her designs her views to thee   must love alone decide the nations fate   in touraines field when gallant clovis fought   and oer the haughty conquerors of rome   victorious stopped the bloody arians hand   that dealt destruction round us did he save   his country thinkest thou but to please a mistress   this arm against a rival is prepared   to serve my friend but i would serve him more   would cure him of this fond destructive passion   this love deceives us were too fearful of him   we wound ourselves and lay the blame on him   the cowards tyrant and the heros slave   he may be conquered lisois has subdued him   and shall he triumph oer the blood of kings   who never yet submitted to a foe   awake my friend and be our great example   in every virtue duke   yes i will do all   all for amelia she must yield at last     0   her laws her king her master shall be mine   i have no will but her and in her eyes   will read my duty and my fate possessed   of the dear treasure will be reconciled   to every foe o how my heart enjoys   the pleasing hope i had no cause to fear   i have no rival if thou art not loved   i can have none who in this court would dare   to cast one look towards amelia now   her vain pretexts are vanished

virtue bids and beauty has commanded   on this blest day will i confirm the oaths   i made to love away my friend i leave   my interest and my fortunes to thy care lisois   permit me then my lord to

single arm so long suspended   the doubtful victory i grow jealous of him   where is he what became of him     lisois   surrounded   by slaughtered friends alone long time he stood   and braved opposing legions but what most   surprised us when at length he had escaped   from every danger wondrous to relate   he yielded up himself a prisoner to us   conceals his rank and name accuses heaven   and begs for instant death one friend alone   attends him and partakes his sorrows duke   lisois   who can this bold this fearless soldier be   he wore his beaver down some secret charm   oerpowered my trembling soul when i opposed him   whether this fatal passion that enslaves me   hath spread its weakness oer each faculty   and left the soft impression on my soul   or that my bleeding countrys voice alarmed   this conscious heart and silently reproached me lisois   as for the weakness of thy soul advice   i know were vain but sure thy countrys voice   may still be heard now is the time to show   the greatness of thy soul and give us peace   fortune that smiled on us today perhaps   may frown tomorrow and thy pride be forced   to sue for pardon to a haughty foe   since thou art happy

kneel   before thee can my life alone content   thy cruel heart take it ungrateful woman   i wished but to preserve it for thy sake   for thee alone i lived for thee will die amelia   i am astonished and my faltering voice   will scarce give utterance to my words—my lord   if thy great soul laments thy countrys fate   and feels for her distress thy generous care   must spring from nobler motives than the wish   to serve amelia thou hast heard the voice   of powerful nature what hath love to do   where only honor hath a right to dictate     duke   tis thy own work amelia all thy own   oer every interest every passion love   superior reigns reproach me cover me   with shame no matter i must force thy heart   come to the altar vamir   darest thou— amelia   no my lord   id sooner die my

rival bring him here before me   and i will yield him up the worthless prize   for know i have contempt enough for both   to wish you were united that alone   should be your punishment amelia   perhaps my lord   twere fittest for amelia to retire         in silence but i hold my honor dear   and must defend it i have been accused   before thy brother and must answer thee   know then im

restored me to prolong   a wretched life he said no more my soul   distracted saw the melancholy truth   was still concealed and therefore heaven perhaps   concealed the murderer too perhaps accomplished   its own eternal will and made us guilty   that it might punish soon the sphinx appeared   and laid our country waste then hapless thebes   attentive to her safety could not think   on

philoctetes pointed out to thee   the paths of glory do not then disgrace   their names and taint thy own by calumny   but keep their bright examples still before thee œdipus   all that i wish is but to save my country   and if i can be useful to mankind   this is the ambition i would satisfy   and this the lesson which those heroes taught   whom thou hast followed and whom i admire   i meant not to accuse thee had i chose   the peoples victim it had been myself   i think it but the duty of a king   to perish for his country tis an honor   too great for common men then had i saved   once more

 to be believed perhaps thou dost suspect   i murdered laius it becomes not thee   of all men to accuse me to thy hand   devolved his sceptre and his queen who reaped   the fruits of laiuss death but œdipus   who took the spoils who filled his throne not i   that object never tempted philoctetes   alcides never would accept a crown   we knew no master and desired no subjects   i have made kings

truly hath foretold my fate   could i do this and was it possible jocaste   are then these holy instruments of heaven   infallible their ministry indeed   binds them to the altar they approach the gods   but they are mortals still and thinkest thou then   truth is dependent on the flight of birds   thinkest thou expiring by the sacred knife   the groaning heifer shall for them alone   remove the veil of dark futurity   or the gay victims crowned with flowery garlands   within their entrails bear the fates of men   o no to search for truth by ways like these   is to usurp the rights of

sacrilegious   incestuous parricide shall i go on     œdipus   well very well— jocaste   in short it then foretold me   this son this monster should pollute my bed   that i his mother should embrace

him to involuntary crimes   i thought to triumph oer the oracle   and in compassion gave him up to death   cruel compassion and destructive too   deceitful darkness of a false prediction   what did i reap from my inhuman care   did it prolong my wretched husbands life   alas cut off in full prosperity   he fell by the unknown hands of base assassins   not by his son thus were they both torn from

invisible   threw back my offerings and in thunder thus   a horrid voice addressed me come not here   stain not the holy threshold with thy feet   the gods have from the living cut thee off   indignant nor will eer accept thy gifts   go take thy offerings to the furies seek   the serpents that stand ready to devour thee   these are thy gods begone and worship them   while terror seized me at these dreadful words   again the voice alarmed me and foretold   all those sad crimes which heaven to thee denounced   against thy son said i should slay my father   o gods and be the husband of my

œdipus   if he had fallen with glory in the field   and by his death prevented all his woes   i was reserved to be a parricide   the hand of heaven so long suspended oer me   hath from my eyes at

hath fashioned to destroy her   thou mayest remember well the fatal time   that blasted all our hopes when antony   subdued augustus took the reins of empire         each eastern monarch trembled on his throne   amongst the rest my hapless brother feared   with his protector he had lost his crown   resistance now was vain and naught remained   but to address the conqueror of the world   in lowliest terms and ask forgiveness of him   call back that dreadful day when herod driven   even to despair beheld proud mariamne   spurn at his offered love and kind farewell   heard her with anguish heap reproaches on him   call for a fathers and a brothers blood   shed by her tyrant husband herod flew   to me and told his griefs i seized the moment   propitious to my vengeance and regained   a sisters power oer his distressed heart   inflamed his rage and sharpened his despair   dipped in fresh poison the envenomed dart   that pierced his soul then desperate in his wrath   thou heardest him swear to exterminate the race   of hebrews and destroy its poor remains   condemn the mother and cut off her sons   from their inheritance but soon to rage   succeeded love one look from her disarmed   his vengeance i with double eagerness   pressed his departure and at length prevailed   he left her from that hour i was successful   my frequent letters kept up his resentment   and absent from her all his rage returned   he blushed in secret for his weakness past   and by degrees as i removed the veil   his eyes were opened zares caught with me   the favorable hour and painted her   in blackest colors told him of her power   her interest friends and the seditious faction   the partisans of the asmonæan race         but i did more i raised his jealousy   he trembled for his glory and his life   continual treasons had alarmed his soul   and left it ever open to suspicion   whateer he fears still ready to believe   he is not able to distinguish guilt   from innocence in short i fixed his soul   guided his hand and made him sign the mandate mazael   twas nobly done but what will varus say   the haughty prætor will he see unmoved   a deed so daring hes thy master here   and unconfirmed by rome thy power is nothing   from varus hand thy brother must receive   his crown nor can he act as sovereign here   till the proud prætor shall restore it to him   will varus thinkest thou eer permit a queen   left to his care to fall a sacrifice   i know the romans well they neer forgive   such rude contempt of their authority   thou wilt bring down the storm on herods head   their thunders always ready those proud conquerors   are jealous of their rights and take thou knowest   peculiar pleasure in the fall of kings salome   fear not for herod cæsar is his friend   and varus knows it therefore will respect him   perhaps this roman means to manage all   but be it as it may my aim is vengeance   im on the verge of glory or of shame   tomorrow nay today may change the scene   who knows if eer hereafter i shall find   an hour propitious to me who can tell         if herod will be steady to his purpose   i know his weakness and i must prevent it   nor give him time to say it shall not be   when it is done let varus rage and rome   pour forth her threats it shall not damp my joys   the romans are not here my worst of foes   no i have more to fear from mariamne   i must subdue her rival powers or perish   but varus comes this way we must avoid him   zares ere now should have been here ill hence   and meet him fare thee well—if there be need   my soldiers at the least alarm are ready   and will defend us scene ii varus albinus mazael attendants on varus varus   salome and mazael—   they seem to shun us in their eyes i read   their terrors guilt hath reason to be fearful   and dread my presence—mazael stay go tell   thy cruel master his designs are known   his wicked instrument is now in chains   and should have met the death he merited   but my regard for herod bids me hope   that he will soon behold the snare they laid   punish the traitors and revenge the cause   of injured virtue if thou lovest thy king   if thou regardest his honor or his peace   calm his wild rage embitter not his soul   with vile suspicions and remember slave   rome is the scourge of villainy remember         that varus knows thee that hes master here   and that his eyes are open to detect thee   away let mariamne be obeyed   and treated like a queen observe her well   and if thy life be dear to thee respect her mazael   my lord— varus   begone you know my last commands   reply not but obey them scene iii varus albinus varus   without thee   and thy welltimed advice thou seest my friend   the beautous mariamne had been lost albinus   zares return raised my suspicions of him   his most officious care to avoid thy presence   and troubled features i must own alarmed me varus   how much i owe thee for the important service   by thee she lives by thee my heart once more   shall taste its noble happiness the best   and fairest treasure of the virtuous mind   the happiness to succor the oppressed albinus   such generous cares befit the soul of varus   thy arm was ever stretched to help the wretched         still hast thou born romes thunder through the world   and only conquered but to bless mankind   would i might say thy pity dictates here   and not thy love varus   must love then be the cause   who would not cherish innocence like hers   what heart howeer indifferent would not plead   so fair a cause who would not die to save her albinus   thus the deceitful passion hides itself   in virtues garb and steals into the heart   thy hapless flame— varus   albinus i confess it   the wretched varus dotes on mariamne   thou seest my naked heart which fears not thee   because thou art my friend judge then albinus   how must her dangers have alarmed my soul   her safety and her welfare are my own   death in its ugliest form were welcome to me   if it could make my mariamne happy albinus   how altered is the noble heart of varus   love has avenged himself of all thy flights   no longer do i see the virtuous roman   severe and unimpassioned midst the crowd   of rival beauties who solicited   his wandering eyes regardless of their charms varus   to virtue then thou knowest and her alone   i paid my vows in vain corrupted rome     0   offered her venal beauties to my eyes   their pride disgusted and their arts displeased   false in their vows and in their vengeance cruel   i saw their shameless fronts all covered oer   with foul dishonor vanity ambition   caprice and folly bore the name of love   such conquests were unworthy of thy friend   at length the power i had so long contemned   indignant saw me from his eastern throne   and soon subdued it was my fate to rule   oer syrias melancholy plains when heaven   had to augustus given the vanquished world   and herod midst a crowd of kneeling kings   fell at his feet and sued for his protection   hither i came and fatal to my peace   was palestine for there i first beheld her   the melancholy theme of every tongue   was mariamnes woes all wept her fate   doomed to the arms of an inhuman husband   who slew the father of his lovely bride   thou knowest what miseries she had suffered since   her sorrows only equalled by her virtue   truth ever banished from the courts of kings   dwells on her lips and all the art she knows   is but the generous care to serve the wretched   her duty is her law her innocence   calm and serene contemns the tyrants power   and pardons her oppressor even solicits   my aid to save the man who would destroy her   her virtues her misfortunes and her charms   united are too powerful for my soul   i love her my albinus but my love   is not a passion which one day creates   and in another is forgotten no   the heart she has subdued is not the slave         of loose desire but by her virtue fired   means to revenge but never to betray her albinus   but if the king my lord has gained from rome   permission to return varus   ay that i fear   alas myself did move the senate for him   perhaps already he returns to empire   and this abhorred mandate is his own   the first sad proof of his authority   it may be fatal to him varus power   may soon be lost but o his love remains   yes i will die in mariamnes cause   the world shall weep her fate and i avenge it end of the first act act ii scene i salome mazael salome   thou seest we are ruined mariamne triumphs   and salomes undone that lingering zares   how tedious was his voyage as if the sea   unwillingly transported him whilst herod   flies with the winds to empire and to love   but sea and land the elements the heavens   all all conspire with varus to destroy me   ambition thou hast plunged me deep in woe   why did i listen to thy fatal voice   i knew his foolish heart would soon relent         even now i fear he has revoked the mandate   and all the harvest of my toil is grief   and danger that still wait on high condition   stripped of its power already fawning crowds   adore my rival and insult my fall   my feeble glories all eclipsed by her   shall shine no more for this new deity   must now be worshipped but this is not all   my death i know must crown the triumph she   can never reign whilst salome survives   she will not spare a life so fatal to her   and yet o shame o infamous submission   my pride must stoop to vile dissimulation   to soothe her vanity with feigned respect   and give her joy of—salomes destruction mazael   despair not madam arms may yet be found   to conquer this proud queen i ever feared   her powerful charms and herods weakness for her   but if i may depend on zares still   in the kings bosom dwells determined hate   and he has sworn that she shall die the blow   is but suspended till he comes himself   to execute his vengeance but meantime   whether his heart be sharpened by resentment   or moved by love it is enough his hand   once signed the mandate mariamne soon   will swell the tempest and eternal discord   shall rankle in their hearts i know them well   soon will she light again the torch of hatred   revive his doubts and work her own destruction   with new disdain will irritate his soul   rely upon herself and mark her ruin     salome   o tis uncertain i can never wait   such tardy vengeance i have surer means   danger has taught me wisdom this loud rage   these violent transports of the impassioned varus   if i observe aright can never flow   from generosity alone and pity   is seldom known by marks like these the queen   has charms and varus may have charms for her   i know the power of mariamnes beauty   nor envy her the crowd of gazing fools   who throw their flattering incense at her feet   the dangerous happiness may cost her dear   whether she listens to the romans vows   or with the conquest only means to soothe   her fickle pride it is enough for me   if it preserves that power i must not lose   oer herods heart take care my faithful spies   perform their office let them be rewarded   and sell me precious secrets—ha she comes   must i then see her scene ii

conceive   to what excess— herod   sister ill hear no more   let mariamne threaten let her take   this loathesome life for i am weary of it   so shall i perish by the hand i love salome   it would be cruel to deceive you longer   by guilty silence or conceal her crimes   i know the dangerous hazard that i run   by serving you but i must speak though death   were my reward poor blind deluded husband   enslaved by love for a vile worthless woman   know mariamne now and know thy shame   tis not her pride her hatred and disdain   should make thee loathe her but that—she is false   she loves

murder her the children bathed in tears   fall at his feet and offer their own lives   to save their mothers canst thou wish for more   or hast thou aught to fear salome   i fear the king   i fear those fatal charms which he adores   that arm which oft uplifted falls as oft   inactive down that anger which soon kindled   is soon extinct which doubtful still and blind   exhausts its feeble

ere this day is past well be revenged   yes she shall suffer for her fatal power   oer herods heart that sighed for her alone   o how have i adored and how detested   the faithless mariamne and thou varus   shalt feel my wrath thou art a roman therefore   thy life is safe but i can punish thee   in blood more precious and a dearer self   thou shalt behold the object of thy love   who has preferred thee to her hated lord   thou shalt behold her soon expire in torment   before thy eyes dost thou not think augustus   will praise my just severity   0 salome   no doubt   he will my lord and would himself advise it   on the same altar where his friends adore him   he sheds the blood of foes he teaches kings   to rule and to be feared let herod mark   and follow his example thus alone   thy life can be secure the queen must stand   condemned by all and thou be justified mazael   but make good use of this important moment   whilst varus is yet absent and his forces   far from our

happened at the mysteries of ceres but he is aglaes tutor her father agathon they tell me has left her a great fortune in short aglae is a charming girl i love her and i will marry her and as to socrates i shall take care of him drixa do what you please with socrates so i can but get my dear sophronimus but how could that fool agathon leave his daughter in the hands of this old flatnosed socrates that intolerable reasoner who corrupts all our young men and keeps them away from courtesans and the mysteries anitus agathon himself was tainted with the same vile principles he was one of your sober serious fools whose manners differed in every respect from ours a man in short of another age one of our sworn and inveterate enemies who think they have fulfilled every duty when they worship god assist man cultivate friendships and study philosophy one of those ridiculous creatures who insolently deny that     the gods prognosticate future events by the liver of an ox those merciless reasoners who find fault with priests for sacrificing young girls or passing a night with them on occasion these you see drixa are a kind of people not fit to live as to socrates i should have been glad to have him strangled long ago however i have agreed to meet him here in the portico and talk with him about the marriage drixa here he comes you do him too much honor but i must leave you and talk to xantippe about my young man anitus the gods conduct you my dear drixa remember to serve them and dont forget my two fine persian carpets scene iii anitus socrates anitus good morning my dear socrates thou favorite of the gods and wisest of men methinks every time i see you i am raised above myself in you i look up with admiration to the dignity of human nature socrates o my lord i am a plain simple man as void of knowledge and as full of weakness as any of my fellowcreatures it is enough for me if you can bear with me     anitus bear with i admire you and would it were possible i could resemble you to convince you of it and that i may oftener be a witness to your virtues and improve by your instructions i am willing to espouse your fair pupil aglae whom i find you have the entire disposal of socrates it is true indeed that her father agathon who was my friend the dearest of all relations bequeathed to my care by his last will this amiable and virtuous orphan anitus with a considerable fortune no doubt for i hear she is one of the best matches in all athens socrates with regard to that i can give you no information her father my dearest friend whose will is ever sacred to me forbade me to divulge the situation of her affairs in that point anitus this respect and discreet veneration for the last will of your friend are worthy of your noble soul but it is well enough known that agathon was rich socrates he deserved to be so if riches are a mark of the divine favor anitus they tell me a young coxcomb named sophronimus makes love to her on account of her fortune but i am persuaded you will not give encouragement to such a fellow and that anitus will have no rival     socrates i know in what light i ought to consider a person like you but it is not for me to thwart the inclinations of aglae i would supply the place of a father to her but i am not her master she has a right to dispose of her own heart i look upon restraint in this case as a crime talk to her if she hearkens to your proposal with all my heart i have no objection anitus i have your wifes consent already without doubt she is acquainted with aglaes sentiments and therefore i look upon the affair as good as concluded socrates but i never look upon things as done till they are really so scene iv socrates anitus aglae socrates come hither aglae and determine for yourself here is a person of considerable rank who offers himself to you for a husband you are at liberty to explain yourself to him my presence might perhaps be a restraint upon you whatever choice you make i shall approve xantippe will prepare everything for your nuptials aglae generous socrates i am sorry you leave me     anitus you seem charming aglae to place great confidence in the good socrates aglae it is my duty sir he has been a father to me he has educated and instructed me anitus and pray my dear as he has instructed you tell me what is your opinion of ceres cybele and venus aglae of them sir i will think just as you please anitus tis well said and you will do as i please too then i hope aglae no sir that is quite another affair anitus you see the wise socrates consents to our marriage and xantippe above all things wishes for it you know my passion for you and are no stranger to my rank and fortune my happiness perhaps your own too depends on one word therefore determine aglae i will answer you sir with that truth and sincerity which the great man who just now left us taught me never to depart from i respect your dignity know but little of your person and in a word can never be yours     anitus never cruel aglae are you not free you will not then aglae no sir i cannot anitus what an affront what an indignity is this but tis to socrates i am obliged for it he dictated your answer i know he did he prefers sophronimus to me that unworthy rival that impious— aglae sophronimus is not impious not unworthy socrates has loved him from his infancy he has been a father to us both sophronimus is all beauty and all virtue i love and am beloved by him it is in my power to marry him if i think proper but i shall no more be his than yours anitus you astonish me what own you love sophronimus aglae yes sir i own it because it is true anitus and yet when it is in your power to make yourself happy with him refuse him you hand aglae that sir is no less true anitus then i suppose your fear of displeasing me prevents your engaging with him     aglae no such thing i assure you for having never wished to please i have no fear of displeasing you anitus you dread then perhaps the displeasure of the gods at seeing you prefer a profane wretch like sophronimus to a highpriest aglae not in the least i am persuaded it is matter of very little concern to the supreme being whether i marry you or not anitus the supreme being my dear child you should not talk in this manner you should say the gods and goddesses take care for i see you entertain some very dangerous opinions but i know too well from whom they came learn then that ceres whose priest i am may punish you for thus despising her worship and her minister aglae i despise neither the one nor the other i have been told that ceres presides over the harvest and i believe it but she has nothing to do with my marriage anitus she has to do with everything you know it but i hope i shall be able to convert you are you indeed resolved not to marry sophronimus aglae yes i am resolved and am very sorry for it   0 anitus i cannot understand a word of all these contradictions but observe me i love you would have made you happy and advanced you to rank and dignity be advised and reject not the offers which kind fortune thus courts you to accept remember that everything should be sacrificed to our real interest that youth will pass away but riches remain that wealth and honors should be your first concern and that i speak to you on the part of the gods i beg you will reflect seriously on what i have said farewell my dear girl i shall pray to ceres that she would inspire you and still flatter myself she will touch your heart once more adieu remember you have promised me never to marry sophronimus aglae i promised myself but not you exit anitus aglae alone this man but makes me more unhappy i know not why it is but i never see him without shuddering but here comes sophronimus alas whilst his rival fills my heart with terror he increases my tenderness and doubles my disquietude scene v aglae sophronimus sophronimus my dear aglae i met anitus the priest of ceres that worst of men the sworn enemy of socrates     just coming from you your eyes seem bathed in tears aglae is he the enemy of our benefactor too then indeed i wonder not at my aversion to him even before he spoke sophronimus and is he the cause of your tears my aglae aglae no sophronimus he can inspire nothing but hatred and disgust my tears can flow for you alone sophronimus for me o gods for me who would repay them with my blood for me who adore you who hope to be beloved by aglae who only live for and would die for you shall i reproach myself with having embittered one moment of your life aglae weeps and sophronimus is the cause what have i done what crime have i committed aglae none my sophronimus you could not do it tis not in your nature i wept because you merit all my tenderness because you have it and because i must renounce you sophronimus what dreadful sentence have you pronounced against me i cannot believe you you love me you said you did and aglae can never change you have promised to be mine you cannot wish my death aglae no i would have thee live and be happy but     alas i cannot make you so i hoped i could but fortune has deceived me i swear to you sophronimus since i cannot be yours i never will be anothers i have declared so to anitus who courts me and whom i despise and here i declare the same to you with a heart full of grief tenderness and love sophronimus since you love me i must live but if you refuse me your hand it will be death to sophronimus therefore my dearest aglae in the name of love of all your charms and all your virtues explain to me this dreadful mystery scene vi socrates sophronimus aglae sophronimus o my honored master my father and my friend behold in sophronimus the most unfortunate of men though in the presence of the only two beings upon earth who could make me happy socrates first taught me wisdom and from aglae i learned to love you consented to our marriage and this beauteous fair one who seemed so desirous of it now refuses me and whilst she says she loves plunges a dagger in my heart she has broke off the match without assigning any cause of her cruel caprice o socrates prevent my misery or teach me if possible how to bear it socrates aglae is mistress of herself her father made me her tutor but not her tyrant to see you united     would have made me happy if she has changed her mind i am surprised and sorry for it but let us hear her reasons if they are good we must submit to them sophronimus it is impossible they should aglae to me however they appear so but you shall hear them when you first opened my fathers will most noble socrates you told me he had left me a sufficient competency from that moment i resolved to bestow my fortune on the good sophronimus who has no support but you no riches but his virtue you applauded my resolution how great was my happiness in promoting that of him whom you have so long regarded as your own son full of this pleasing hope i laid open the situation of my heart to xantippe who at once undeceived me she treated me as an idle visionary showed me the will of my father who died a beggar and left me nothing but your friendship to depend on awakened from my dream of promised happiness nothing remained for me but the melancholy reflection that it was no longer in my power to make the fortune of sophronimus i would not oppress him with the weight of my misfortunes sophronimus i told you socrates her reasons were poor and insufficient if she loves me am i not rich enough hitherto it is true i have subsisted from your bounty but there is no employment however irksome which i would not undertake to provide for my dearest aglae i ought indeed to make her a     sacrifice of my passion to find out some richer happier lover for her but i own my weakness i cannot do it there i am indeed unworthy of her but if she could content herself with my low estate if she could stoop to my humble condition but i dare not hope so much i sink beneath a misfortune which her fortitude is able to bear socrates my dear children it was very indiscreet in xantippe to show you the will but believe me aglae she deceived you aglae indeed she has not i saw it with my own eyes i know my fathers hand too well to have the least doubt of it but be assured socrates i shall be able to bear poverty as i ought these hands will support me if i can but live it is enough for me but it is not for sophronimus sophronimus it is too much a thousand times too much for me thou tender noble soul worthy of thy illustrious master a virtuous and laborious poverty is the natural state of man i wish i could have offered you a throne but if you will condescend to live with sophronimus our respectable poverty will be superior to the throne of crœsus socrates your generous sentiments at once delight and distress me i behold with transport those virtues budding forth in your heart which i myself had sown never were my hopes better fulfilled than in aglae and sophronimus but once more believe me     aglae my wife has misinformed you you are richer than you think you are it was not to her but to me your father entrusted you may he not have left you a fortune which xantippe knows nothing of aglae no socrates he says expressly in his will that he has left me poor socrates and i tell you that you are deceived that he has left you a sufficient competency to enable you to live happily with the virtuous sophronimus and that i desire therefore you would come and sign the contract immediately scene vii socrates xantippe aglae sophronimus xantippe come come child dont stand amusing yourself there with my husbands visions and nonsense philosophy to be sure is a mighty pretty thing when folks have nothing else to do but you are a beggar child and must study how to live first and philosophize afterwards i have concluded your marriage with anitus a worthy priest and a man of fortune come child follow me let me have no delays nor contradiction i love to be obeyed quick quick my dear tis for your good therefore let me have none of your reasonings but follow me sophronimus o heaven my dear aglae     socrates let her talk and trust to me for your happiness xantippe let me talk indeed i shall talk and do too i assure you you are a pretty one to be sure with your wisdom your familiar demon your irony and all your nonsense that signifies nothing to trouble yourself about matrimony you are a good sort of a man but you really know nothing of the world happy is it for you that i am able to govern you come aglae i must settle you as soon as possible and you sir there that seem as if you were thunderstruck i have taken care of you too drixa is the woman for you you will both of you thank me by and by i shall have done it all in a minute i am very expeditious let us lose no time therefore by rights it should have been all over before this socrates my children dont thwart or provoke her but pay her all kind of deference we must comply with since we cant mend her it is the triumph of reason to live well with those who have none end of the first act act ii scene i socrates sophronimus sophronimus divine socrates i know not how to believe my own happiness how can aglae whose father died in     extreme poverty be possessed of so considerable a fortune socrates i told you before she had more than she thought she had i knew her fathers affairs better than herself let it suffice that you both enjoy a fortune which you deserve the secrets of the dead should be preserved as religiously as those of the living sophronimus i am only afraid the priest of ceres to whom you have preferred sophronimus will endeavor to avenge aglaes refusal upon you he is a man whom we have reason to dread socrates what has he to fear who does his duty i know the malice of my enemies i know all their calumnies but when we take care never to offend god and endeavor to do all the good we can to mankind then is it that we are afraid of nothing or whilst we live or when we die sophronimus i know it well yet i should die with grief if the happiness you bestowed on me should induce your enemies to put your virtue to the trial scene ii socrates sophronimus aglae aglae o my benefactor my father let me fall at your feet thou more than man join me sophronimus in mutual acknowledgments tis he tis socrates     who marries us at his own expense and gives us best part of his own fortune to support us but we must not suffer him we must not be rich on these conditions no if our hearts have any gratitude let them imitate his generosity sophronimus o socrates with her i throw myself at thy feet like her i am charmed astonished and confounded at thy goodness we will not must not abuse it look on us as your children but do not let those children be a burden to their kind parent thy friendship is fortune sufficient tis all that we desire you are not rich and yet you do more than all the great ones of the earth but were we to accept thy bounties we should be unworthy of them socrates rise my children you affect me too deeply are we not bound to respect the will of the dead did not your father aglae whom i always considered as part of myself did he not enjoin me to treat you as my daughter had i not done so i had betrayed the confidence of friendship i took upon me the performance of his will and i have executed it the little i bestow on you would have been useless to my old age which has not many wants to supply if it was my duty to obey my friend it is yours to obey your father i am that father now and by that sacred name command you not to make me unhappy by your refusal but retire i see xantippe coming this way i have reasons for desiring you to avoid her at present aglae your commands are cruel but they must be obeyed     scene iii socrates xantippe xantippe a fine piece of work you have made here upon my word my dear husband i must put a stop to your proceedings here had i promised aglae to anitus the highpriest a man of interest amongst the great and sophronimus to the rich drixa who has extensive influence in the whole nation and you marry your two fools together and make me break my word to both not content with this you must needs give them best part of your fortune too twenty thousand drachms good gods twenty thousand drachms are you not ashamed of yourself at the age of threescore and ten too whos to pay your physicians when you are sick or your lawyers when you have a lawsuit what am i to do when that villainous wrynecked fellow anitus whom you might have had on your side if he should join his party to persecute you as they have done so often already confusion to all philosophy and philosophers i say and to my own foolish regard for you you pretend to direct others and want leadingstrings yourself always reasoning without a grain of common sense if you were not one of the best men in the world you would be the most ridiculous and the most insupportable but mind me you have only one way left break off this foolish match and do what your wife bids you   0 socrates you talk well my dear xantippe and with great moderation but hear what i have to say in return i did not propose this marriage myself but aglae and sophronimus love and are worthy of each other i have already made over everything to you that the laws will allow me and have given almost all that remained to the daughter of my friend the little which i keep is enough for me i have no physician to pay because i live sober no lawyers because i have neither debts nor reversions and with regard to that philosophy you reproach me with it will teach me to bear the malice of anitus and your treatment of me nay even to love you in spite of your illhumor exit scene iv xantippe alone the old fool and yet spite of myself i cant help esteeming him for after all there is something great even in his follies but his coolness and indifference make me mad to scold him is but lost labor for these thirty years past i have been perpetually pecking at him and when i have tired myself with it he bids me go on and i am dumbfounded surely there must be something in that soul of his superior to mine     scene v xantippe drixa drixa so madam xantippe i see you are mistress at home fie fie how mean it is to be governed by a husband this vile socrates to prevent my making a young fellows fortune but ill be revenged xantippe my dear madam drixa dont be so angry with my husband i am angry enough with him myself hes a poor weak man i confess but i verily believe has one of the best hearts in the world has not the least degree of malice and does a thousand foolish things without designing and with so much honesty that one cant help forgiving him then indeed he is as obstinate as a mule i have done nothing but tease and torment him my whole life nay i have even beat him sometimes and yet i have never been able to mend him nay not so much as to put him into a passion what can i do with him drixa i tell you ill be revenged under yonder portico i perceive his good friend anitus and some more of our party let me alone with him xantippe my god i am dreadfully afraid these folks all together will do my poor husband some mischief i must go and tell him of it for after all one cant help loving him     scene vi anitus drixa terpander acros drixa most noble anitus we have all been wronged you are tricked as well as myself this vile socrates has given away three parts of his fortune on purpose to spite you you must take ample revenge of him anitus i design it heaven itself requires it of me this man treats me with contempt and of course must despise the gods already we have had several accusations against him we must repeat them you will all assist me we will put him in danger of his life then will i offer him my protection on condition that he resigns aglae to me and to you the beautiful sophronimus thus we shall all gain our several points he will be sufficiently punished by the fright we shall put him into i shall get my mistress and you your lover drixa wisdom herself speaks in anitus sure some divinity inspires you but tell us how are we to proceed anitus this is about the time when the judges go to the tribunal with melitus at the head of them drixa that melitus is a little pedant a sad fellow and your enemy     anitus he is so but he is still a greater enemy to socrates tis a rascally hypocrite who supports the rights of the areopagus against me but we always hold together when our mutual interest and business is to destroy these pretended wise men who want to open the eyes of people on our conduct hearken my dear drixa you are a devotee drixa certainly my lord i love money and i love pleasure with all my soul but in matters of devotion i yield to none anitus go then immediately and get together as many bawling enthusiasts as you can and cry out impiety impiety terpander is there anything to be got by it if there is we are all ready acros ay ay that we are but what sort of impiety anitus o every kind however we had best accuse him at once of not believing in the gods thats the shortest way drixa o let me alone then anitus you shall be well supported go and stir up your friends under the portico ill inform meantime some of my newsloving friends of it who come     frequently to dine with me a parcel of contemptible fellows they are to be sure but such as if properly directed can do a good deal of mischief on occasion we must make use of every expedient to promote a good cause away my friends recommend yourselves to ceres and be ready to cry out when i give you the signal tis the only way for you to live happy here and gain heaven hereafter scene vii anitus graphius chomus bertillus anitus most indefatigable graphius profound chomus and delicate bertillus have you finished those little works as i commanded you against the impious socrates graphius my lord i have labored hell never hold up his head again chomus i have proved the fact against him struck him dumb bertillus i have only mentioned him in my journal and it has done for him anitus graphius beware you know i forbade your prolixity you are naturally tedious and that may wear out the patience of the court     graphius my lord tis all in one leaf wherein i have proved that the soul is an infused quintessence that tails were given to animals to drive away flies that ceres works miracles and consequently that socrates is an enemy to the state and ought to be exterminated anitus a most excellent conclusion remember to carry your accusation to the second judge who is a complete philosopher ill answer for it youll soon get rid of your enemy socrates graphius my lord i am not his enemy i am only vexed that he has so great a reputation all that i do is for the glory of ceres and the good of my country anitus well well make haste and be gone and you learned chomus what have you done chomus my lord finding nothing reprehensible in the writings of socrates i shall accuse him pointblank of thinking directly opposite to what he says and shall show the poison he intends to spread in everything he is to say hereafter anitus wonderful indeed carry your piece to the fourth judge he has not common sense and therefore will understand you perfectly now for you bertillus bertillus my lord here is my last journal upon the chaos i have proved by a regular series from the chaos     to the olympics that socrates perverts the youth of athens anitus admirable go you from me to the seventh judge and tell him i desire hed take care of socrates so here comes melitus already the first of the eleven theres no necessity of practising any art with him we know each other too well scene viii anitus melitus anitus mr judge one word with you this socrates must be destroyed melitus indeed mr high priest i have long thought so let us agree in this point we may quarrel you know notwithstanding about everything else anitus i know we hate each other most cordially but at the same time we may lay our heads together to govern the commonwealth melitus with all my heart nobody can overhear us therefore to speak freely i know you are a rogue and you dont look upon me as a very honest man i cant hurt you because you are high priest nor you me because i am first judge but socrates may do us both a mischief by exposing us to the world     our first business therefore is to destroy him and then we may be at leisure to fall upon each other the first opportunity anitus aside tis well observed how i could rejoice now to see this rascally judge upon an altar his arms hanging on one side and his legs on the other whilst i with my golden knife was ripping up his guts and consulting his liver at leisure melitus aside shall i never be able to send this villainous high priest to jail and make him swallow a pint of hemlock by my command anitus o my friend here come our noble assistants i have taken care to prepare the populace melitus very well my dear friend you may depend upon me in this affair not forgetting old scores scene ix anitus melitus some of the judges of athens passing along under the portico anitus whispers melitus drixa terpander and acros together justice justice scandal impiety justice justice irreligion impiety justice     anitus whats the matter my friends whats your complaint drixa terpander and acros justice in the name of the people melitus against whom drixa terpander and acros against socrates melitus ha ha against socrates that fellow has been often accused what has he done now acros i dont know what terpander they say he gives money to young girls in marriage acros ay he corrupts our youth drixa o hes a wicked wretch he has offered up no cakes to ceres he says there is a great deal of useless gold and silver in the temple acros ay and he says the priests of ceres get drunk sometimes thats true hes a wicked wretch indeed drixa hes a heretic he denies the plurality of gods hes a deist he believes only in one god hes an atheist     all three together yes hes a heretic a deist and an atheist melitus dreadful accusations indeed and all extremely probable i have heard as much before anitus the state is in danger if we leave such crimes unpunished minerva will withdraw her protection from us drixa ay that she will i have heard him laugh at minervas owl melitus at minervas owl o heaven gentlemen is not it your opinion he ought to be sent to prison immediately the judges all together to prison with him to prison melitus guards carry socrates to prison this instant drixa and afterwards let him be burned without a hearing one of the judges no no we must hear him we must not go against the law anitus no no thats what the good woman meant we must hear him but not let what he says have too much effect on us you know these philosophers are  00 devilish subtle tis they who have disturbed all those nations which we have endeavored to render peaceable and quiet melitus to prison with him to prison scene x xantippe sophronimus aglae socrates in chains entering xantippe o mercy mercy my poor husband is going to prison arent you ashamed mr judges to treat a man of his years in this manner what harm could he do alas it is not in his power he is more fool than knave god knows have pity on him good gentlemen o my dear i told you you would draw yourself into some bad affair this comes of portioning young girls what an unhappy creature i am sophronimus o my lords respect his age respect his virtue give me his chains i am ready to yield up my liberty my life for his aglae yes we will go to prison in his stead we will die for him do not destroy the noblest best of men take us rather for your victims melitus you see how he corrupts our youth  0  socrates no more my wife no more my children do not oppose the will of heaven which speaks by the laws he who resists the law is no longer a citizen god wills that i should be put in bondage i submit to his divine decree without murmur or repining in my own house in athens or in a prison i am equally free and whilst i behold in you so much gratitude and so much friendship i am happy what matters it whether socrates sleeps in his own chamber or in a prison everything is as the supreme will ordains and my will should submit to it melitus take away this reasoner anitus gentlemen what he says i must own has affected me the man seems to have a good disposition i flatter myself i should be able to convert him let me have a little private conversation with him please to order his wife and these young folks to retire one of the judges most venerable anitus you have our consent to parley with him before he appears at the tribunal scene xi anitus socrates anitus most virtuous socrates my heart bleeds to see you in this condition  0  socrates and have you a heart anitus i have and one that feels for you i am ready to do everything for you socrates i think you have done enough already anitus hark ye socrates your situation is worse than you think it is let me tell you your life is in danger socrates that is of very little consequence anitus to your noble soul it may appear so but it is otherwise in the eyes of all those who like me admire your virtue believe me however you may be armed by philosophy it is dreadful to die a death of ignominy but that is not all your reputation which should be dear to you will be sullied in after ages the religious of both sexes will laugh at your fall and insult you if you are burned theyll light the pile if youre strangled theyll tie the cord if youre poisoned theyll pound the hemlock and not only that but theyll make your memory execrable to all posterity now it is in your own power to prevent all this i will promise not only to save your life but even to persuade your judges to say with the oracle that you are the wisest of men you have nothing to do but to give me up your young pupil aglae with the portion you understand me as to her marriage with sophronimus we shall find  0  means to set it aside thus you will enjoy a peaceful and honorable old age and the gods and goddesses will bless you socrates soldiers conduct me to prison immediately he is carried off anitus this fellow is incorrigible but its not my fault i have done my duty and have nothing to reproach myself with he must be abandoned as a reprobate and left to die in his sins end of the second act act iii scene i the judges seated on the tribunal socrates below judge to anitus you should not sit here you are priest of ceres anitus i am only here for edification melitus silence there socrates you are accused of being a bad citizen of corrupting youth of denying a plurality of gods of being a heretic deist and atheist answer to the charge socrates judges of athens i exhort you all to be as good citizens as i have always myself endeavored to be to shed your blood for your country as i have done in many a battle with regard to youth guide  0  them by your counsels and above all direct them by your example teach them to love true virtue and to avoid the miserable philosophy of the schools the article concerning a plurality of gods is a little more difficult to discuss but hear what i have to say upon it know then ye judges of athens there is but one god melitus and another judge o the impious wretch socrates i say there is but one god in his nature infinite nor can any being partake of his infinity turn your eyes towards the celestial globes to the earth and seas all correspond together all are made one for the other each being is intimately connected with other beings all formed with one design by one great architect one sole master and preserver perhaps he hath deigned to create genii and demons more powerful and more wise than men if such exist they are creatures like you his first subjects not gods but nothing in nature proves to us that they do exist whilst all nature speaks one god and one father this god hath no need of mercury and iris to deliver his commands to us he hath only to will and that is enough if by minerva you understand no more than the wisdom of god if by neptune you only mean his immutable laws which raise or depress the sea you may still reverence neptune and minerva provided that under these emblems you adore none but the supreme being and that the people are not deceived by you into false opinions be careful above all not to turn religion into metaphysics its essence is morality dispute not  0  but worship if our ancestors believed that the supreme god came down into the arms of alcmene danæ and semele and had children by them our ancestors imagined dangerous and idle fables tis an insult on the divinity to conceive that he could possibly in any manner whatsoever commit with woman the crime which we call adultery it is a discouragement to the rest of mankind to say that to be a great man it is necessary to be produced from the mysterious union of jupiter and one of our own wives and daughters miltiades cimon themistocles and aristides whom you persecuted were perhaps much greater than perseus hercules or bacchus the only way to become the children of god is to endeavor to please him deserve therefore that title by never passing an unjust sentence melitus what insolence what blasphemy another judge what absurdities one cant tell what he means melitus socrates you are always too fond of argument answer briefly and with precision did you or did you not laugh at minervas owl socrates judges of athens take care of your owls when you propose ridiculous things as objects of belief too many are apt to resolve that they will believe nothing they have sense enough to find out that your doctrine is absurd though they have not elevation of mind sufficient to discover the law of truth they know how to laugh at your little deceits but not to adore the first of beings the one incomprehensible  0  incommunicable being the eternal alljust and allpowerful god melitus o the blasphemer the monster he has said too much already i condemn him to death many of the judges and so do we one of the judges several of us are of another opinion socrates has spoken wisely we believe men would be more wise and just if they thought like him for my part far from condemning him i think he ought to be rewarded many of the judges we think so too melitus the opinions seem to be divided anitus gentlemen of the areopagus permit me to interrogate him a little do you believe socrates that the sun turns round and that the areopagus acts by divine right socrates you have no authority to ask any questions but i have authority to teach you what you are ignorant of it is of little importance to society whether the sun or the earth turns round but it is of the utmost consequence whether the men who turn with them be just or unjust virtue only acts from the right divine and you and the areopagus have no rights but those which your country has bestowed on you  0  anitus illustrious and most equitable judges let socrates retire melitus makes a sign socrates is carried out anitus proceeds most august areopagus instituted by heaven you hear what he says this dangerous fellow denies that the sun turns round and that you act by right divine if these opinions prevail adieu to magistracy and adieu to the sun you are no longer judges appointed by minerva you will become accountable for your proceedings you must no longer determine but according to the laws and if you once depend on the laws you are undone punish rebellion therefore revenge earth and heaven i am going dread you the anger of the gods if socrates is permitted to live anitus goes out and the judges demur one of the judges i dont care to quarrel with anitus he is a dangerous man to offend if he troubled himself with the gods only it would not signify another judge to his brother sitting near him between you and me socrates is in the right but then he should not be in the right so publicly i care no more for ceres and neptune than he does but he should not speak out to the whole areopagus what he ought to have whispered yet after all what is there in poisoning a philosopher especially when he is old and ugly  0  another judge if there be any injustice in condemning socrates it is anitus business and not mine i lay it all upon his conscience besides it grows late we lose our time let us talk no more about it to death with him another ay ay they say hes a heretic and an atheist to death with him melitus call socrates he is brought in blessed be the gods the plurality of voices is for death socrates the gods by us condemn you to drink hemlock socrates we are all mortal nature condemns you also to death in a short time probably you may meet with a more unhappy end than mine the distempers which bring on death are much more painful than a cup of hemlock i thank those amongst my judges who pleaded in favor of innocence for the rest they have my pity one of the judges going out certainly this man deserved a pension from the state rather than a cup of poison another judge i think so too but why would he quarrel with a priest of ceres another after all it is best to get rid of a philosopher  0  those fellows have always a certain fierceness of spirit which should be damped a little another one word with you gentlemen would not it be right whilst our hand is in to make an end of all the geometricians who pretend that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones they are a mighty scandal to the foolish people that read their works another ay ay well hang them all the next session lets go to dinner scene ii socrates alone i have been long prepared for death all i fear at present is that my wife xantippe will be troubling me in my last moments and interrupt me in the sweet employment of recollecting my soul and preparing myself for eternity i ought to busy myself only in the contemplation of that supreme being before whom i am soon to appear but here she comes i must be resigned to all things scene iii socrates xantippe with the disciples of socrates xantippe well my poor man what have these gentlemen   0 of the law concluded have they fined you are you banished or acquitted my god how uneasy have i been about you pray take care this dont happen a second time socrates no my dear this will not happen a second time ill answer for it give yourself no uneasiness about anything my dear disciples my friends welcome crito at the head of his disciples you see us beloved socrates no less concerned for you than xantippe we have gained permission of the judges to visit you just heaven must we behold socrates in chains permit us to kiss those bonds which reflect shame on athens how could anitus and his friends reduce you to this condition socrates let us think no more of these trifles my friends but continue the examination we were making yesterday into the souls immortality we observed i remember that nothing could be more probable or at the same time more full of comfort and satisfaction than this sweet idea in fact matter we know changes but perishes not why then should the soul perish can it be that raised as we are to the knowledge of a god through the veil of this mortal body we should cease to know him when that veil is removed no as we think now we must always think thought is the very essence of man and this being must appear before a just god who will recompense virtue punish vice and pardon weakness and error     xantippe nobly said but what does this fellow here with his cup enter the jailer or executioner of the eleven carrying a cup of hemlock jailer here socrates the senate have sent you this xantippe thou vile poisoner of the commonwealth would you kill my husband before my face monster ill tear you to pieces socrates my dear friend i ask your pardon for my wifes rude behavior she has scolded me all her life she only treats you as she does her husband excuse her impertinence give me the cup he takes the cup one of the disciples o divine socrates why may not we take that poison for you horrible injustice shall the guilty thus condemn the innocent and fools destroy the wise you go then to death socrates no my friends to life this is the cup of immortality it is not this perishable body that has loved and instructed you it is my soul alone that has lived with you and that shall love you forever he is going to drink jailer i must take off your fetters first tis always done     socrates do it then i beg you he scratches his leg one of the disciples you smile socrates i smile at the reflection that pleasure should arise from pain thus it is that eternal felicity shall spring from the miseries of this life drinks the poison crito alas what have you done xantippe ay for a thousand ridiculous discourses of this kind the poor man has lost his life indeed my dear you will break my heart i could strangle all the judges with my own hands i did use to scold you indeed but i always loved you notwithstanding these polite wellbred gentlemen have put you to death o my dear dear husband socrates be calm my good xantippe weep not my friends it becomes not the disciples of socrates to shed tears crito how can we avoid it on so dreadful an occasion this legal murder socrates thus it is that men will often behave to the worshippers of one true god and the enemies of superstition     crito and must socrates be one of those unhappy victims socrates tis noble to be the victim of the deity i die contented i wish indeed that to the satisfaction of seeing you my friends i could have added the happiness of embracing sophronimus and aglae i wonder they are not here they would have made my last moments more welcome crito alas they know not that you have already undergone the judges dreadful sentence they have been talking to the people and praising those magistrates who would have acquitted you aglae has laid open the guilt of anitus and published his shame and dishonor they perhaps might have saved your life o dear socrates why would you thus precipitate your fate scene the last aglae sophronimus aglae entering divine socrates be not afraid be comforted xantippe worthy disciples of socrates do not weep sophronimus your enemies are confounded the people rise in your defence aglae we have been talking to them we have laid open     the intrigues and jealousy of the wicked anitus it was my duty to demand justice for his crime as i was the cause of it sophronimus anitus hath saved himself by flight from the rage of the people he and his accomplices are pursued solemn thanks have been given to those judges who appeared in your favor the people are now at the gates of the prison and wait to conduct you home in triumph xantippe alas tis lost labor one of the disciples o socrates why would you so hastily obey aglae live dear socrates the benefactor of your country the model of future ages o live for the general happiness of mankind crito ye noble pair my virtuous friends it is too late xantippe you stayed too long aglae alas too late what mean you just heaven sophronimus has he then already drunk the fatal draught socrates sweet aglae and dear sophronimus the law ordained that i should take the poison i obeyed     the law unjust as it is because it oppressed myself alone had the injustice been done to another i would have resisted it i go to death but the example of friendship which you give the world and your nobleness of soul shall never perish your virtue is greater much greater than the guilt of those who accused me i bless that fate which the world may call misfortune because it hath set in the fairest light the goodness of your hearts my dear xantippe be happy and remember that to be so you must curb your impetuous temper my beloved disciples listen always to the voice of that philosophy which will teach you to despise your persecutors and pity human weakness and you my daughter aglae and my son sophronimus be always what you now are aglae how wretched are we that we cannot die for you socrates your lives are valuable mine would have been useless take my tender last farewell the doors of eternity are opened to receive me xantippe he was a great man o i will rouse up the whole nation sophronimus may we raise up temples to socrates if ever mortal man deserved it crito at least may his wisdom teach mankind that temples should be raised to god alone end of the third and last act † the hierophants the priests and the priestesses all show their astonishment and consternation
