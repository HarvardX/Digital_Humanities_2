a brief state of the question between the printed and painted callicoes and the woollen and silk manufacture as far as it relates to the wearing and using of printed and painted callicoes in great britain  london printed for w boreham at the angel in paternoster row       introduction when men mistake in one thing it is very usual to have the world think they mistake in every thing and it is an easy thing to find a stone to throw at a dog  had the poor weavers who i am now to speak of brought their complaints against the exorbitant wearing of callicoes in a regular and justifiable manner and before the proper judges of those things as their conduct could not have been reproached so the grievance which now suffers by their mistake would perhaps have met with more friends  but wise and impartial men will learn to distinguish between the justice of a cause and the mistakes of the managers of it between the reason of the complaint and the disor derly manner of complaining and this is all we shall have occasion to say of the poor mistaken tumultuous weavers leaving them to the clemency and compassion of the government whom they have offended but recommending the grievance under which they groan to the serious consideration of those in whose power it is to redress it  that the weavers suffer under the general calamity of trade that they and even the whole manufacturing part of the nation are oppressed by the exorbitant growth of clandestine trade and the unreasonable pouring in of east india wrought goods upon us this will admit of no debate at least none that can be supported by reason what little can be said for it is so easily confuted and exposed and has so often been fully answered that little will be wanting now but according to my title to state the case clearly and impartially between woollen and silk goods made at home and the callicoes and wrought silks printed here or clandestinely imported from abroad  in order to enter upon this affair with all possible clearness and plainness and if we can to strike at the root of the mischiefs we complain of i shall first lay down some general propositions as fundamentals in this question of trade obliging my self to give such evidence for the proof of them as shall take away all possible pretenses to deny the fact and this i do at first that we may have no stum bling at the threshold no cavelling at the terms or shuffling off the question from one thing to another but that as i may talk to men of business i may talk likewise to their understanding and conviction my propositions are    that the woollen and silk manufactures of this kingdom being the staple of our trade and the most considerable and assential part of our wealth the fund for our exportation the support of our navigation and the only means we have for the employing and sunsisting our poor it is therefore the common interest of the whole kingdom to discourage every other manufacture whether foreign or assumed so far as those manufactures are ruinous to and inconsistent with the prosperity of the said british manufactures of wool and silk    that the wearing and using printed or painted callicoes as they are now almost universally worn and used in great britain is ruinous to and inconsistent with the prosperity of our english manufactures as well those of wool as those of silk    that the total prohibiting the wearing and using of printed and painted callicoes in great britain is not ruinous to or inconsistent with the prosperity of the east india trade or to put it into an affirmative that may be more capable of evidence the east india trade may and would remain in a very thriving and flourishing condition and be carried on to the profit and advantage of the adventurers tho all the subjects of great britain and of ireland were effectually limited from and prohibited the wearing and using of printed and painted callicoes    that the printed and painted callicoes now worn and used in great britain come under four denominaitons all pernicious and destructive to our trade  viz such as being inported by the dutch are either printed in the indies or in holland and clandestinely run on shore here in spite of former prohibitions or such as being imported here by our own east india company and prohibited to be worn because printed in india are pretended to be exported but are privately run on shore again and sold or such as being printed here are entered and shipped for exportatian in order to dram back the duties on the stamps but are re landed and sold here and lastly such as are printed here and legally worn and used and under the color of which all the other frauds are practis d and concealed    that this clandestine importation and relanding of printed and painted callicoes is no way to be prevented neither is it in the reach of the wit and power of man to put a stop to it by any other means but by effectually preventing and prohibiting the wearing and use of them  i have some other essential propositions in trade which will come in course to be laid down for the carrying on this argument as we proceed in the consideration of these but i shall reserve them in petto till i see whether the age is weak enough to struggle with things so selfevident as these and till i see what it is can be offered if any thing shall be mustred up against these five  a brief state of the question between the printed and painted callicoes and the woollen and silk manufacture etc that the importation of wrought silks and printed callicoes from the east indies and allowing the use of them here when imported has all along been found prejudicial to the home consumption of our woollen and silk manufactures in greatbritan needs no other proof than the late acts of parliament which were obtained in consequence of the general application of the manufacturers as well masters as workmen through the whole kingdom to prohibit and limit their consumption  in doing this the parliament whose wisdom and justice was very conspicuous in that very case entered into the true merits of the cause searched it to the bottom and weighed the allegations on every side the members were neither clamoured into it by the weavers byafsd to it by parties or hurried into it by the multitude of petitions from the counties and corporations they represented but the weight of the cause supported it self the nature of the thing pleaded it and their own wellweighd reason importuned them to it the thing was selfevident the humor of the people as too often is the fate of nations seemed at that time possessed against their interest and being hurried down the stream of their fancy they ran headlong into the greatest neglect and contempt of the growth and manufactures of their own country and people and embraced with a violence in their temper not to be resisted the silks and callicoes of india in a manner even ridiculous to themselves as well as fatal to their interest  the extravagance of that time cannot be so entirely forgot as that we should not reflect how the ladies converted their carpets and quilts into gowns and petticoats and made the broad and uncouth bordures of the former serve instead of the rich laces and embroideries they were used to wear and dress more like the merryandrews of bartholomew fair than like the ladies and wives of a trading people  the consequence was what any one might thave foreseen would be  viz the ruin of our manufactures the stagnating of our trade the stop of employment and the starving our poor the cry was universal not the spittlefields weavers only selt it the calamity was general and the complaint came from every corner of the nation  as all mischiefs in their exorbitance tend naturally to their own cure so it was hear seeing the thing was fatal in it self to our trade it was our felicity that it run on to such extremes as alarmed the whole kingdom for this awakened the parliament to its redress such we cannot but hope will be the case again for like causes generally produce like effects  the proceedings of the legislature might pass with us all for reason in a case of much more consequence than this but we have yet more powerful auxiliaries to bring in aid of the case before us i will insist upon two only   st the pattern of our neighbors   dly the success of our own prohibitions i begin with the last  what the parliament did in the cafe i just now mentioned was abundantly justified in the success what can be more encouraging to apply the same way seeing the cafe is the same  no sooner was the flux of foreign manufactures stopped and the east india goods prohibited but the trade revived the face of things changed business and plenty succeeded to want of employment and want of bread the numbers of poor flocking to the manufactures for employment and the increase of the consumption of our manufactures revived the whole nation nothing could be a stronger and more convincing evidence of what had been alleged  viz that the so general wearing and using east india printed callicoes etc had been the ruin of our trade had put a stop to the employment of the weavers and in a word had starved our poor i shall come to this again in its place  i come in the next place to the example of our neighbors and particularly the french a nation but too wife in the most proper methods for erecting and encouraging manufactures of which there are such testimonies given in the administration of monsieur colbert who was justly called the father of the french manufactures as we have felt the consequences of in trade for many years past  the french east india company was established by the enterprising genius of the said monsieur colbert in the year      and the edict passed the th of august      settling all their privileges for  0 years and they begun with great advantages though they had not success occasioned by their own mismanagement however the king of france finding the using and wearing of india wrought silks cottons and callicoes painted and printed whether in india or at home began to encroach upon the manufactures of his subjects as well silk as wool and foreseeing that it would be the ruin of both for which he thought himself obliged to preserve the utmost concern as being the fundamental of the riches of his kingdom he effectually prohibited the wearing and use of them whether printed at home or abroad among his subjects by an edict in the year      and under very severe penalties and the late king of france being moved by his council of trade from time to time by several subsequent edicts confirmed those prohibitions adding farther penalties more severe than before for enforcing the execution by all which it appears of what consequence this matter was thought to be for the preserving the manufactures of his own dominions  the government of france proceeding still upon the same maxims of a just policy in trade continue as tenacious of their former care for their own manufactures as ever and this appears by the provision made by subsequent edicts to continue the same prohibitions in the strictest manner of all such east india goods as are hurtful to their manufactures of which the following is a flaming instance  viz we all know that the present government has united their old east india company to their new west india company and what great advances of credit that union has made in france yet so far is the present government from neglecting their own manufactures by forgetting to prohibit the use of the callicoes etc which the said company may import and so far are they from imagining that the said company should not flourish and thrive notwithstanding the prohibition of those goods though so considerable a branch of their importation that those prohibitions are all expressly renewed repeated and confirmed by the edict of reunion as appears by the ixth and xth articles of the grant to the said new established company as follows  artic ix we permit the said company to import from the countries within their grant all sorts of stuffs of pure silk and of silk and cotton mixed with gold and silver bark of trees and callicoes died painted and stripped we require that the said merchandises prohibited in this kingdom may not be sold but on express conditions of being exported to foreign parts and that for this end they may be laid up in the warehouses of our farmergenerals under two keys of which the farmergeneral or his deputies shall keep one and the directors of the company or their substitutes the other and that all other necessary precautions be taken to hinder the sale of the said merchandise for domestic consumption  artic x the said company may also import from the countries within their grant all forts of white callicoes raw silks coffee drugs spices metals and other things except those prohibited by the preceding article paying the duties which are actually paid by the india company according to the edicts declarations arrets and regulations of the kings our predecessors  here we see the very thing done in france which we want here and for the very same reasons for which we stand so much in need of it here which reasons we cannot doubt will subsist with the same force here as there the foundations of foreign import and home manufactures being the same and especially because he cannot doubt but that a british parliament will appear inspired with all the just principles of care and concern for the good of our people and the prosperity of our trade as the councils of the late king of france could be for his subjects  but i cannot forbear taking notice here how much stronger the argument is on our side for the doing this now than it ever was before even for this particular reason  viz because the french have upon their new establishment continued their prohibitions i explain my self thus  the french have not only reestablished the trade of india but they have put it into hands which are not like to neglect it run in debt in the indies or sell the liberty of trade to others but they who are now entrusted with the privilege know very well how to make use of it and want no stock to carry it on and as they are capable both in knowledge of the business and stock for the managing of it so they appear resolute to proceed immediately upon it and we are told they have already taken up four large ships for the carrying on the trade and that they talk of taking up several more the flemmings under the inperial commission or charter are not only doing the same but are actually embarked in the east india trade have several ships now abroad and one great ship just arrived from india at ostend being the second that they have received since their entering upon that trade and we are likewise told that the government of the austrian netherlands has already resolved on the prohibiting the consumption of printed and painted callicoes among them and that they will be publicly prohibited there as they are in france  let any impartial person then judge whether we have not just reason to be alarmed at these measures while we lie open to a smuggling trade so generally carried on through this whole kingdom and so impossible now to be prevented whither must the vast quantities of callicoes which these two new east india companies will import i say whither must they go whither but to england and scotland and ireland where the people are so fond of them and where it is so easy to get them on shore  our east india company has already showed themselves apprehensive of success of the new established imperial company in flanders nor can they be justly unconcerned at the setting up a company in france upon so potent a stock as that of  0 millions but what then have we not to fear for our woollen and silk manufactures which are so oppressed already with clandestine importations of silks and callicoes from abroad as well as printing them at home and when the french will not fail to bring in quantities equal to the opportunities which they have to ind them  we may appeal for this to any one that is acquainted on those shores of england which lie nearest to france are not french brandies french wines and french silks to be had almost in as great plenty in our porttowns on that side of the country as in some parts of france it self and will it not be the same thing with india goods can rumney marsh want french callicoes where all french goods are as it were as familiar to them as in france can those people that know how to carry off whole freights of wool the most bulky of all merchandise be ignorant to take on shore french callicoes french wrought silks french east india goods of all kinds it cannot be doubted but when the french come to have a quantity of callicoes always by them and no consumption for them at home they will find ways and means to crowd them in upon us with much more ease than they do now their wines and brandies what the consequence of this will be to our woollen and silk manufactures is very plain they must be destroyed nothing can prevent it  these things serve to let us see that the present debate is not the concern of a few people in spittlefields only though their poverty and distress happens to be nearest our view at this time as their complaints have been loudest but in a word the whole body is effected the whole interest of our woollen and silk manufactures throughout the kingdom is concerned in it i mean as to those goods which concern our wearing apparel and furniture which is the bulk of our manufactures nay the east india company themselves are concerned in it and i believe it might be very easy to prove by a just calculation that if these companies now set up in france and flanders prosper and thrive as it is more than probable they will the east india company of great britain will suffer more by their importing their callicoes here and thereby sharing the trade with them or rather taking it from them then they will by the general putting a stop upon the consumption and thereby checking the foreigners in their beginning so that upon the whole of the two the prohibition seems to me to be no evil at all but rather an advantage to them  it was without question an unaccountable mistake in those who solicited the first prohibition of india printed callicoes that they contented themselves with prohibiting the use of callicoes printed abroad but did not insist upon prohibiting the wearing and use of those printed at home as things in themselves equally ruinous to our manufactures they had not then left the door open to the printing and painting them in england a trade then scarce known under color of which all sorts of callicoes wheresoever printed have been worn here and foreigners thereby encouraged to pour them in upon us by the arts of clandestine trade and our people impose upon us by relanding their own in which by the way the known and wilful perjury that attends it is one of the least things in our consideration  but now the work is to be done over again with this difficulty in the difference  viz that now we have the pretenses of the callicoe printers to struggle with their calling the callicoes a manufacture because painted and printed here though these are in themselves mere trifles like that of the numbers of families employed in printing etc i say trifles when compared with the manufactures themselves which we plead for and the numbers of families and people maintained by and employed in them of which i believe i am not arrogant when i say it is ridiculous to talk of any proportion  the work has also another difficulty in its way or rather a pretended difficulty that is to say i foresee that some people intend to call this a difficulty i mean the fund formed upon the stamps on callicoes appropriated perhaps to such or such uses or as security for such and such loans but as all those funds are to our great satisfaction made redeemable by parliament we have no more to do but to convince our representatives of the necessity of redeeming them and leave the house which is the in exhaustible fund of funds to their own methods for finding an equivalent security to the satisfaction of the lenders and yet even in this point when the house shall legitimate such an attempt something may be said farther  difficulties therefore are no discouragement where absolute neccessity is the motive the thing carries an apparent necessity in it it must be remedied or our trade must be ruined our manufactures be at an end and our poor not sent a begging only but indeed be starved and here were it any thing to the purpose i could spend some time in exclamation at the preposterous unthinking humor of our people who upon all occasions run directly counter to their interest as a trading nation in so visible and so evident a manner as this of wearing printed callicoes or at least wearing them so as to make it an universal mode we often see clothiers druggetmakers sergemakers stuffmakers etc dress themselves and their families in the cloth or druggets or serges or stuffs they make and though they may not be so very like their neighbors they will give this ready answer  viz  it is my own trade it is my own manufacture and the answer is allowed to be very rersonable why should it not be a national answer as well as a family answer why should not an english man or an english lady reject foreign and destructive gewgaws and choosing to wear the woollen and silk of our own product and manufacture give this for a reason for it it is our own trade it is our own manufacture  let us go to the indians and the chinese for instruction as solamon sends the sluggard to the ant are they prevaild with to lay by their own manufactures for any of ours no it is evident we are so far from being able to place any of our manufactures among them that they despise the proposal and refuse to sell those goods which we have so little need of but for that ready money which we have so little need to part with  but this is a large field i refer it to the time when the battle shall be more closely joined then we may find time to talk more feelingly of the folly of carrying money to the indies to buy that which we ought rather to give money to be without  but i return to the indians who as incapable as they may be to judge of their national interests are yet wiser in this part by the strength of mere nature than we are who pretend to so much knowledge for they wear their own manufactures not can we bring them to alter the manner of their clothing any more than the matter of it  some have alleged for a reason of this the climate in the indies being suited to the manufactures they make and that nothing can be so light so clean so pleasant in such hot countries as the callicoes and silks of their own making but we might very well answer this by giving the patterns of our fine stuffs some of which as well as the manner of wearing them in hot countries are much cooler and much more suited to the heat of the warmest climate than the uncouth fassions great sleeves and pleated gowns of the indians who even load themselves rather than dress themselves with their callicoes and other manufactures of their own make any traveller might be left to judge of this who has seen the spaniards at peru at lima at panama carthagena and suchlike hot places where they dress much cooler and lighter in british and french stuffs and cloth nay even in english black bays than the indians on the coast of malabar and coromandel or in the bay of bengale do in their silks and callicoes but nature dictates to these nations to cultivate their own produce to consume their own manufacture and encourage their own commerce and nature would dictate the same thing to us if we did not obstinately put out natures eyes and act against nature in the pursuit of the most untractable part of our faculties i mean humor and fancy  certainly if we were free from this tradefrenzy and were to act by the dictates of common sense we should reflect that the woollen manufacture is the staple of our ginal fountain of our wealth and as i said in my introduction it is the most essential part of the riches of the rich and the principal means we have for the employing our poor many things might be said to prove and some to illustrate whatever is contained in these generals concerning our woollenmanufacture but i am loath to suppose my self talking to any people so ignorant as not to know it or so partial as not to acknowledge it if i can meet with any englishman so weak as to dispute it i undertake at demand to expose them and prove my proposition both at once  the premises then being granted my inference is as just namely that it is the common interest of the whole kingdom to discourage every other manufacture so far as those manufactures ruinous to and inconsistent with the prosperity of our own  the late king of france who so well understood the interest of his subjects in trade is a standing authority for this very thing all the edicts published in france on this subject such as in the year      and in      and in      prohibiting the printing and painting of callicoes in france and the selling callicoes printed or painted in india when imported into france are fortified with this reason as sufficient to justify their government in the said prohibition viz that they were prejudicial to the manufactures of wool and silk already establisbed in france  and there are two things in those edicts of the king of france which are very remarkable and which i reserve for farther explanation if i find occasion to speak in this cause hereaster i say two things are very remarkable in the king of frances prohibitions and limitation of his east india companys trade which stand as precedents for our practice the same reasons being much more strong and forcible at this time in our circumstances than they could then be in france  first that in the edict or arret prohibiting or forbidding the painting and printing of callicoes in france is also included a strict prohibition of the painting and printing any kind of linen cloth of hemp or flax though such linen was the growth and manufacture of his own kingdom  secondly that in his limitation of the importations of the east india company there is this clause that whereas the company were allowed to import some certain wrought silks named in the edict to the value of   0000 livers a year so first they were obliged to bring in no more and secondly they were obliged in consideration of that liberty only i say they were obliged to export to the indies the value of  00000 livers a year in goods of the growth and manufactures of france  and even this condition did not continue long for the council of trade there considering that the consumption of the manufactures was by no means an equivalent for the injury those silks etc though but to the value of   0000 livers a year did to the manufactures of france that grant was also revoked and the goods entirely prohibited under the most rigorous penalties as they continue to be this day  these two clauses are of such moment in the case before us and dictate so clearly not only what we have to seek and what to complain of with respect to our maunfactures and to our east india company but also the reasons of it that i cannot but think it very much for the public service to publish the sevral edicts in which these clauses and the reason and causes given for them are contained accordingly they are placed in the close of this work  thus i have touched at the heads of this matter and have passed them over without other enlargments then such as the present occasion makes necessary this essay for it is no more is but a specimen of the controversy every one of these heads having necessary explanations attending them and long debated points of commerce to speak to in order to set the whole affair in a clear light all which it may be to the purpose to enlarge upon hereaster  conclusion in the mean time i cannot dismiss this affair without turning a little to the trading part of mankind and especially the dealers in the woollen manufactures in this nation it is not a little strange to observe how unconcerned we sit and seem to enjoy our selves in a perfect composure of mind and a most inimitable tranquillity when our general commerce by which we all subsist langushes and as it were expires in our sight at home foreign manufactures encroach upon us abroad they are preparing new projects to attack us and as they seem united to undo us so i must say we seem unanimous in the resolution of being undone  how can we sit still and see the bread thus taken out of our laboring peoples mouths even by those very men who ought to be equally concerned with us to prevent it the wearing and use of callicoes is evidently the ruin of our manufactures if we can distinguish between the manufactures and the manufacturers if the empolyment can be lost and the workmen not suffer if the trade can die and the tradesmen live then i have no foundation for my discourse no reason for this expostulation  nay if this was a particular article of trade only if a few families were to be ruined of this or that particular employment only and the main of our people not be effected with it we might be silent and the opposers might say we made more noise of it than there was occasion for  but since the evil is general and the mischiefs which attend it are so spreading that the whole nation is more or less effected from the gentleman of the greatest quality and estate to the meanest woolcumber and that we are inevitably to feel the consequences of it how can we i say sit unconcerned and see out families impoverished and the foundation laid for the ruin of our posterity and yet take no notice of it it is certainly our concern in a more particular manner to appear not in arms not in mobs and tumults that neither is a lawful way of appearing nor would it give the least aid in the matter trade is the daughter of peace and draws its principal nourishment from the public tranquillity no men in their senses can propose raising tumults and riots for the promoting trade neither is it the way to engage the government the parliament or the ministry to redress our grievances in trade such violent ways only arm power against us and engage governors to be our enemies my arguments all run another way and if i mistake not have ten times more force in them with wise governments than all the clamours of a rabble can suppose to have  i move you first to see the mischief to that end i set it in a clear light prove the fact show you the slow degrees by which the poison works how insensibly it grows upon you and yet how sensibly some parts of trade feel it already and how certainly all other parts will be effected by it  i move you then to put your hands to all legal preventions i aim at no other i move you to join in all just representations both of the mischief and the remedy to those in whose power it is to relieve you i mean your parliament men your representatives who as they are most of them chosen by the several trading corporations of england may be more particularly called the representatives of the tradingpart of the nation  these are the professed physicians of all our trading maladies i may say it is their business to heal you and i am sure it is in their power represent it to them in parliament and represent it to them out of parliament let them come up to parliament fairly apprisd of the case fully convined of the justice of your complaints and the absolute necessity there is of relieving you let them see it make them witnesses in the countries where they live of the decay of the manufactures of the abatement made upon the poor in their wages of the numbers of poor that desert and run from one work to another for want of employment show them the rolls of your parishes which i am satisfied will discover how many families more than ever are listed among your pensioners for whom parish provision is necessarily made for want of their getting bread by the works they were wont to be employed in show them the languishing circumstances of the people as the effect and then lay before them the languishing circumstances of the trade as the cause then they will come up to parliament convinced of your distresses fully prepared to receive your petitions and filled with compassionate thoughts for your redress  i must consess this seems to me to be the most proper method to spirit the approaching assembly of parliament with sentiments of pity for their county and with a just knowledge of the reallity of and reason for the complaints you make and if i might be allowed to suppose that these sheets shall any where come to the hands of the particular members in the manufacturing counties and corporations for which they serve i would with all possible humility but also with the utmost importunity petition them to look a little into the state of the manufactures in their respective countries where they live  it is without doubt the just concern of our representatives to study the interest and the circumstances of the people who they represent if these gentlemen please but to look round them they must of necessity see that the manufactures decline that trade languishes and the poor stretch our their hands to them for help they must needs also see the causes of it even at their own doors while they cannot but see a wilfullypossessd nation dressed up in the manufactures of foreigners and despising the workmanship of their own people madly sending their money to india and china to feed and support heathens and savages and neglecting nay i may say rejecting the manufactures of their own country though they see the poor families starving for want of work  i press the people in the countries to lay open their case before their representatives and convince them of the melancholy circumstances they are in by the decay of trade and the stop of their manufactures and give them a clear view of the nature of the grievance and whence it proceeds and there is no room to doubt but the members would be affected with it as well as other men  it is from the same principle that i move the gentlemen themselves to enquire into the case and make themselves fully masters of both the fact and the reason of it after which i would not suffer it to be named as a doubt but that the natural concern every member of parliament must have for the prosperity of the people he represents will move him effectually to apply himself in parliament to the remedy  it is a great mistake to suggest that spittlefields alone complains or has cause to complain though as i said before the manufacturers there feel the burden sooner but all the country and almost all the branches of the woollen and silk manufactures feel it and it is easy to show why the town workmen feel the stop of trade sooner than the country workmen the case is this  the clothiers and drugget or stuffmakers in the country who are the head managers of the woollen manufactures are generally men of substance and good stocks they have often whole towns and villages employed in their particular works and though they do feel a stop of the trade at markets they do not so immediately put a stop to their works but they must keep their markets and make their circuits to take in the yarn and put out the wool or their neighbors will break in upon them their spinners will seek work in other hands and perhaps not be gotten again when they may want them  thus they go on a great while though the goods when made do not sell till blackwellhall lies piled up to the roof with goods and the wholesalemen and factors warehouses are thronged with them nay even then they go on and are forced to draw upon the factors and wholesale dealers for the money whether the goods sell or no the factors again are sometimes forced to sell them to monydmen under the price and perhaps to loss nay and even sometimes to pawn or pledge them for money in hopes of a market to come and still with the money answered by those bills the clothier in the country goes on as long as he can get credit for a bag of wool to work or a penny of money to pay his workmen and this causes the country poor not to feel the check and decays of their trade so soon as the town workmen but then we must take this with us as we go  viz that when the trade droops so long together and the country manufacturer or clothier is forced to stop it is more fatal to the poor as above for then as they are long before they stop so they are longer before they recover and the poor are as it were entirely destitute for a great while  but in spittlefields the case alters here the manufacturers i mean the masters are near the market they do not put out the wool to spinning but generally buy it in the yarn as soon is the market stops they stop if they cannot sell their work they immediately knock off their looms and the journeymen as immediately starve and want work thus as distempers near the heart or in the vital parts are sooner and more sensibly felt than in the less noble parts of the body so the disease of trade the decay and stop of sale is most sensibly and sooner felt here than in the country and therefore here the complaint is first made and loudest  but this on the other hand testifies to us that if it be not provided for forwith if some present remedy be not applied to it the spreading malignity will soon extend it self and the most extreme part will then feel it and what is the consequence but that then the complaint will come up louder and be more uneasy to us  all these things urge us if possible to apply some speedy some immediate remedy to the evil what that remedy is and what alone can cure us i refer to the season of it the present business is to lay down the fundamental  viz show the disease awaken the nation open their eyes to the consequences of it and guide them in their applications to the proper persons who alone can take it in hand and that is as above the parliament  certainly if the members of parliament in the several countries would but enquire a little into the particulars now they are at leisure they would come up big with a desire to set their helping hand to it they would come up filled with resentment at those who have been instruments to ruin the flourishing trade of their country and nothing could influence them against the humble proposals that may be made to them for restoring the trade and prosperity of the kingdom  it is suggested that all applications of this king will meet with a powerful opposition and that the manufacturers however numerous they are will not find friends enough to carry their point against the wearing and using the printed callicoes  for my part i cannot be of this opinion it is true i have not told noses as they call it or cast up the strength on either side or examined who shall be the friends or who the enemnies of the weavers petitions but this i venture to say that as i have proved the grievance is national this i think will follow that none of the nations friends can be enemies to the proposals for a remedy it is our satisfaction that this is no party cause unless any one should vilely insinuate that there is a party that would not have the manufactures thrive or would have the poor starved and perish and i cannot have such ill notions of any man as to think party can carry them that length trade is a perfect neuter in all our unhappy strife spinning and weaving are neither whig or tory but the great articles by which we live by which the consumption of our produce is carried on and by which the poor are subsisted who without it would in a word eat us up all  if this cause meets with enemies if any one man can be found in britan who would not have us leave off painted feathers and stick to our own manufactures i say if one man can be found so prepossessed it must be either a man perfectly ignorant in matters of trade and so not worth talking to or it must be some callicoe printer or his employer and dependant who finding his account in the mischief acts upon the corrupt principle of being willing to get money though at the expense of the ruin of his country something like the wretched sexton of cripplegate in the year      who being employed at the pestbouse near oldstreet would have had the plague continue that his fees might not abate but that he might have people enough to bury  but let us not fright our selves with the imaginary notion of enemies and a strong opposition nil desperandum let us take but true measures setting the fact in a clear light and convincing our representatives in a peaceable but effectual manner of the weight of the case and how justly they are concerned as representatives to espouse the trading interest of their country i can never imagine that any cabals of drapers eastindiamen brokers and jobbers shall be able to bias the members of a british parliament against it or to blind their eyes in a case so clear as this that wearing a foreign manufacture and despising our own is the most preposterous though the most certain method of straving us all that can possibly be invented  here follows the two clauses in two several arrets of the french kings council mentioned in this work  in the arret of   december      after other clauses as follows   his majesty ordains that the arret and regulations formerly made prohibiting the consumption and wearing of painted callicoes aforesaid shall be executed according to theit full tenor and form and according to the aforesaid arret of the   th of may      and has prohibited and does hereby prohibit all persons of what quality or condition soever to print or paint or cause to be printed or painted any silks or all callicoes whatsoever and all linen cloth or cloth made of flax or hemp new or old or to sell or expose the same to sale on pain of confiscation and  000 livres fine and his majesty likewise ordains that the moulds or other instruments made use of for the printing or painting the said linen shall be broken and defaced and to this purpose there shall be an exact search made through all places in the city of paris by the lieutenant general of the polity and in other provinces by the intendants and commissaries respectively whom his majesty hereby requires to put the said arret in execution  the other clause is from an arret of july      00 whereas after other clauses it is expressly said thus  his majesty has permitted and does hereby permit the east india company according to an arret of council of jan         to bring from the indies every year painted callicoes and stuffs to the value of   0000 livres on condition the said company shall export to the indies every year as is likewise ordained by the said arret the value of  00000 livres every year in goods of the growth and manufacture of france which said callicoes nevertheless shall be sent into foreign parts on account of the company and not sold to any of the merchants of france and if the company brings any greater quantity than is limited as above they shall be confiscated and burnt his majesty also strictly forbidding all persons of quality or condition soever to make any garments or household stuff of the said painted callicoes or stuffs and to all tailors and upholders to have any thing made of the same in their keeping on the pain of  000 livres fine etc    errata page    line first read original page      ult for king read kind  finis
