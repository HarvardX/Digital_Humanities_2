that will do that is quite enough good people it is really a tormenting thing to be a man of such consequence i dont wonder now that the eastern monarchs suffer themselves to be seen so seldom for in good truth the homage that attends greatness is very troublesome to men of indolent habits   diego i am glad to see your honor look so well today   lopez thank you  thank you   diego i hope that your honor likes these parts and that you be not displeased with the folk hereabout   lopez why as to these parts honest diego they are pleasant enough valencia is a pretty province but for the

his most catholic majestys sober dominions and in full sight of the habitation of an inquisitor no no diego englishmen are the only people who never consider change of place but are just the same harumscarum madcaps in all parts of the world as they are at home quite as ready to make an uproar in the court of the great mogul as to break a lamp within the liberties of westminster   diego i did not understand that these strangers were both from the same country   lopez you did not understand  my dear diego you should only listen and let other people understand for you mark me  you are of the kingdom of valencia i of castille  yet we are both spaniards  so one of these strangers is of england the other of ireland which though different islands yet the natives of both own one country  one king  and this in your ear diego will with one heart defend their country and king against all the rest of the world  here come two miserablelooking hidalgos  fellows that live in dirt and poverty from the fear of debasing their noble descent by honestly earning a whole coat and a good meal   two hidalgos enter with great stateliness and the appearance of extreme poverty lopez save you save you they return no answer but look at him with great contempt and exeunt these are precious vermin the most wretched paupers with the pride of princes  how soon must the nation go to ruin where it is reckoned dishonorable to be industrious they have a different method of considering matters in the country i was just talking of instead of seeing as we do here nobility made ridiculous by its entailing on future generations laziness and poverty in england you will find some of its most stately branches raised from the stock of honest industry   diego what is coming yonder   lopez hey  oh it is one of the strangers   diego he seems hurt or sick  his servants are wheeling him along in a chair   lopez that is only one of his mad whims he fancies himself in a consumption and went to lisbon for the recovery of his health  there he fell in love and is now searching through spain for his mistress whose relations suddenly conveyed her from portugal disappointment has increased his nervous fancies and with stamina to last a century he believes that he shant exist a month this is the one from ireland  he is called sir sturdy otremor   diego well signor lopez time presses  i must

bottle   sir stur starting up in a rage and seizing him you unfeeling brute to make a joke of your masters infirmities  i will shake you to atoms you dog he shakes him and then sits down again   pat by saint patrick you have a pretty tight grip for a corpse walking away angrily   lopez if that be an irishman in a consumption heaven keep me from the clutches of one in full health and strength   sir stur seeing lopez there is a stranger he can have no interest in deceiving me  step this way my good fellow i suppose you can read in my looks that i am not a man long for this world   lopez aside

stur why then it will surprise you to be told that i was once  a stout ablebodied man   lopez i assure you sir i am very much inclined to believe it   sir stur yes indeed and instead of this little bit of a pipe i once had a voice like thunder   lopez that i can readily imagine for to say the truth it still conveys no faint idea of that sound   sir stur oh yes  i am all faint all feeble   dash

sink to the earth   dash ha ha while a man can sink others to the earth with such ease he is not in much danger of sinking there himself   sir stur ah my dear dashington you dont know my complaints   dash very true and what is still better you dont know them yourself  but to my story i saw at a distance moving along at the solemn stately pace accordant with spanish dignity an old lumbering vehicle that looked as if it had been a present from the city of london of one of their castoff lordmayors coaches the coachman was very comfortably enjoying his siesta on the box well on it paced for some time as orderly and slowly as if it had been in a procession when unluckily a bed of clover on the roadside tempting the steeds to deviate from the beaten track down went the carriage into an ugly kind of a hollow i heard the screams of women and flew to their assistance those fellows were passing whose aid i required to raise the carriage the beggarly rascals considering such employment a degradation insolently refused i however effected my purpose without their help and fortune throwing them again in my way i was determined to pay them what i thought they deserved   sir stur oh the vagabonds i wish i had been with you  not that in my feeble state i could have rendered any service   dash yes i think you could   sir stur no no  it is all over with me   dash really   sir stur yes

so   sir stur a mile or so not there paces if it were to gain me the wealth of both indies   dash perhaps so i know you are not covetous but beauty angelic beauty might allure you   sir stur oh i am in a pretty state for beauty to have any effect on me   dash then your case is hopeless indeed i am heartily sorry for it and i will tell jaquelina   sir stur eh what did you say of jaquelina turning toward dashington very actively   dash i said i should tell jaquelina   sir stur ah you mean if you should happen to see that dear creature after i am dead   dash if i dont see her till after you are dead your consumption must be a galloping one   sir stur hey   dash i only mean that you must die in a devil of a hurry for i am to see jaquelina in a few hours   sir stur what see jaquelina in a few hours starting up   dash bless my soul you are on your legs again but be composed  sit down my dear fellow you will do yourself harm  good bye  i will tell you all another time   sir stur what do you mean by another time walking after him impatiently   dash my dear friend you will fatigue yourself to death you know you could not walk three paces for the wealth of both indies   sir stur i would walk to both indies to see jaquelina where is she my dear friend   dash here  here in this very place   sir stur tol lol singing and dancing in great ecstasy   dash dont agitate your feeble frame   sir stur feeble i am as stout as a lion   dash i knew i should work a miracle now learn that jaquelina who was so suddenly removed from your sight at lisbon was in the very carriage which overturned this morning i had her in my arms   sir stur and let me take you in my arms my dear friend for you have raised me from the grave   dash but calm your ecstasy she is confined by bolts and bars   sir stur where   dash in a convent  and what is worse she fears that she is soon to take the veil   sir stur i will set fire first to every convent in spain in defiance of the inquisition   dash i think you may obtain her by less violent means   sir stur how how my dear friend   dash that you shall know with all expedition the ladies who were in the carriage with her were so terrified at the accident that they were a long time before they recovered their senses so while they obligingly continued fainting we had opportunity to lay plans for her escape   sir stur but when   dash this very night   sir stur delightful   dash and i am to be a reverend friar for the occasion come along and you shall know all but sir sturdy you forget your invalid chair  you will not be so rash as to walk   sir stur walk why i could fly if that were the only way to get a sight of her allons mon cher mi exeunt   scene ii a wood with a cottage lopez enters surely my master don miguel de lara is the last man in the world that i should have suspected of accepting a post in the holy office he used to be the most friendly goodhumoured old fellow in all spain what then could induce him to become an inquisitor he is mightily altered and yet somehow the change is only superficial he frowns at every body and hardly speaks a kind word but i have reason to think his heart is as humane as ever he has sent me to seek out a melancholy being who as he understands chooses to live in this lonely place a man cannot be void of tenderness who courts the society of the unfortunate  this must be the person i am sent to  i will observe him a little before i accost him  enter alphonso from the cottage alph now to my painful task of seeking commerce with that hated being man to purchase means of eking out a life of wretchedness were i not forced by natures wants to the detested intercourse i might be sheltered in this friendly solitude from the sight my eyes abhor and my heart sickens at  a human face lopez comes forward  ha what hunted to my very den no beast of prey is chased by man with such unwearied ardour as he pursues his fellow   lopez my master sent me sir good heavens i surely know that face my lord alphonso   alph what my hated name have i then fled to this secluded spot seeking to shun the sight of man but most of all to hide me from their view who knew me in my days of happiness and must i still meet eyes that in this wretched being trace alphonso  but to your errand your master sent you who is he   lopez chief of the inquisition of valencia   alph what is that tribunal grown impolitic in cruelty to seek a wretch like me to wreak its vengeance on those who delight in human misery should single out the happy and force the groan of anguish from the heart that never knew aught but rapture i am so preeminent in wretchedness that i can look with tranquil eye on all the horrors of the infernal court  misnamed the holy can its gloomy caverns terrify the man who loathes the sight of day can eternal silence be a punishment to him to whom all converse with mankind is hateful or can the flames which fold around the victim of its wrath equal the fire which burns within my bosom no no the flames which kindle at the stake possess the mercy too to counteract the vengeance that employs them and soon consign the sufferer to eternal peace while here here in this tortured heart a fire more painful rages and yet will not destroy   lopez i mourn the cause of your distress my lord whatever it be but i was sent to you to bear the greetings of my master and express his wish for your society  knowing you only by report as one who seemed of noble bearing and unhappy but when he shall find it is the count alphonso    alph peace peace that name no more the sound is hateful to me and who are you that know me thus sequestered and disguised   lopez my lord i was once your servant and honored by your notice you may perhaps remember lopez de mel   alph yes yes i do remember you you quitted me to travel with my brother   lopez i did my lord just before your marriage   alph silence tormentor   lopez my lord   alph what demon that delights to press with horrid touch upon the tremling nerve most sensitive to mortal agony has sent thee to perform his functions begone thou agent of a fiends malignity   lopez my lord heaven knows i meant not to offend you   alph why then unfeelingly proclaim the event to which i owe my misery but perhaps i wrong you you may still be ignorant of my shame   lopez your shame my lord   alph ay marriage was my shame my torment oh heaven her lovely face seemed to proclaim that every virtue dwelt within her brea her beauty while it filled the eye with admiration enf rced homage from the heart for it appeared the loveliness of goodness i fancied poor deluded wretch that her whole soul was mine that unworthy as i was in me she fixed her heaven of happiness  ha ha ha vain weak man and false false deceitful woman a few weeks absence lost me this treasure and to a stranger the acquaintance of a day she gave her heart but he does not live to triumph in my pangs no thank heaven vengeance still was left me   lopez your cause of grief indeed my lord is weighty but solitude will only cherish what the business and the pleasures of the world in time might dissipae   alph talk not thus idly the world  she was the world to me and now she is lost the link is snapped that bound me to creation the various passions which possess the human heart and point to different objects were in mine directed all to her did i court honors twas to lavish them on angelina did wealth seem worth possessing t was that angelina might command whatever wealth could purchase did i seek the circles of the gay it was that she might not know a pause from pleasure for all to me was irksome that compelled one thought or look to be withdrawn from her  leave me and by the regard which you profess report me to your master not as alphonso but as a wretched nameless being to whom man can do no kindness but in shunning him as he shuns all mankind exeunt   scene iii dashington disguised as a friar and sir sturdy otremor enter sir stur upon my soul and you

at madrid when i was visiting my sister is the only man that shall ever have me for his wife   vil but pardon me if i say you seem to be constant without reason   leo women you know will have their whims many are inconstant without reason my whim is at any rate the most harmless   vil but consider he failed in his appointment when you had consented to elope with him he broke his word   leo that was very shocking to be sure but as i was the person wronged i conceive i have a right to forgive if i please besides i will never believe that he intended to deceive me no he is of a country too generous to abuse its conquests the vanquished in war the briton treats with humanity will he then fail in tenderness to the heart that love has made his captive   vil ay ay a woman in love can always make good excuses for her passion   leo that is extremely fortunate for there are very few disposed to make excuses for her  well i am determined to cherish the dear idea of enjoying happiness with

you are well withdraw come along viletta exeunt   mig poor things they are sadly balked well let me hear what this proceeding has been where is the chief evidence    st friar evidence my lord we presumed that every thing of which the holy inquisition took cognizance was enveloped in secresy   mig you did did you then let me tell you that if you come to me for justice you shall see her in open daylight for though she is blind herself she is not ashamed of being viewed by the whole world and those who pretend that she likes darkness best are desirous to palm off some base counterfeit in her place so let the witnesses stand forward and bring in the accused   dashington enters guarded by officers of the inquisition dash well and who are you   mig who am i my friend you seem to have changed places with me that may be a very proper question from the judge to the prisoner but i never heard of its being put by the prisoner to the judge so be so kind as to tell me who are you   dash does nt my habit speak for me   mig not very intelligibly it is one that commands respect from all when worn by him who himself respects it but a stain on that habit is more offensive than on any other the purer the garment the fouler do spots appear on it   dash very true but dont look so devilish sour you frown most ferociously   mig frown most ferociously why if i do you dont seem much terrified at it but i admit your censure mildness alone becomes the seat of justice the judge and the executioner should never look alike but what is the prisoner charged with who accuses him   all the friars i i i   mig i i i why what a volley of is is poured all at once you are as eager as a shoal of porpoises to devour your wounded fellow    st friar no fellow of ours we disclaim him he is a wolf in sheeps clothing   mig and what are you if you are one of the flock i am sure you are a fierce old ram and look a great deal more mischievous than the wolf as you call him but who is he and what has he done   juan i will tell your lordship all   dash i will save you the trouble brother florist and tell his lordship myself  you must know then my lord that i have no more pretensions to this cowl than i have to the popes tiara i put it on to deceive old cerberus there who by the by is a very honest mastiff and contrive to get the garden of the convent opened   mig oh only to get the garden of the convent opened a very innocent device upon my soul   dash was nt it i knew you would think so you are a liberal man my lord that can make allowances those fellows seem to consider the grounds of a nunnery as their own manor and want to punish as poachers all gentlemen who go there in pursuit of their own game   mig a mighty hard case indeed that a gentleman cannot pursue his own game for you   dash ay there now ant you ashamed of yourselves but my lord i did not go on sport of my own but merely to aid a friend   mig there you see the gentleman did not go on his own account but merely to assist a friend well so you and your friend between you have contrived to carry away a few young ladies from the convent   dash a few only one my lord upon my honor   mig only one how moderate   dash and that one was a lady he doated on a lady whose heart was devoted to him as his to her and without whom existence would have been worse than death   mig bless my soul and so they want to punish you merely for saving your friends life how shocking   dash ay my lord you see things in a proper light   mig yes yes and now    dash i suppose i may go   mig no not yet i am a little puzzled   dash about what my lord   mig your case it does not appear quite clear to me   dash what my case not appear quite clear   mig no it does not appear quite clear to me whether the holy office will sentence you for this little friendly transaction   dash holy office my lord sentence me   mig yes whether it will sentence you to be broke on the wheel or to die at the stake   dash broke on the wheel  die at the stake   mig yes i declare i have not a notion which   dash oh you are joking ha ha ha it is devilish droll of you broke on the wheel die at the stake ha ha how comical   mig no not very though i am uncertain which it will be one or the other i am positive   dash lord you should not mention such horrible things even in jest i declare i feel hot and aching all over at the bare idea   mig upon my life i dont

sorrows i conceive akin to mine immortal powers has madness mastered my poor tortured brain and do my eyes act as the vassals of distempered fancy or has just heaven thus by a miracle directed the guilty angelina to her wronged husband to enforce the vengeance due to her crime pauses all surrounding objects are reflected to my sense with truths distinctness  can i err only here no no it is she and sent that death death by his hand she has wronged may expiate her perfidy why does my heart shrink from an act of justice how misery disarms resentment yes yes it is that unnerves me did i behold her in the hall of splendor decked in the robes of gaiety her eyes sparkling with bliss then should i rush eager for vengeance and exult to lay triumphant guilt in ruin but here i view a wretched creature whom heavens hand has humbled is that pale cheek where sufferance is marked with cares sure traces  is that a stimulant to vengeance poor illfated girl thy heart has played thee treacherously  it wanted firmness to prevent thy falsehood and yet has not been slack to upbraid thee with it i did not think to have wept for thee frail angelina but thus thus fallen even i can pity thee alphonso

charge me with an act however trivial or one word or look that spoke my heart wandering from thee may heaven withhold from me its mercy and let the fiercest pangs that dying sinners tremble at be my eternal lot oh my alphonso spurn not as faithless her whose dearest only joy has been thy love her who if all the world combined to load thee with its hate would still cling to thee with increasing fondness and who if miseries pressed on thy brain too great for reason to support would tend thee in the cell of madness and even there derive more ecstasy from one kind look given in the transient

servants he will conduct you to your mistress while this lady may command from me whatever service she requires so without ceremony fly as fast as your wornout frame will suffer you  exit sir stur ang sir do not let me tax your kindness nor dull your joy with my misfortunes   dash madam happiness never found entrance in that breast which was not open to the sorrows of a lovely woman   ang you are truly generous but indeed it grieves me much to trespass thus you are burdened with a being whose mind is rent with agony and whose frame is enfeebled with fatigue and anguish   dash take comfort madam and hope for happiness lean on my arm and let me conduct you to safety and repose   ang i am bound to you for ever she leans on him and as they are going alphonso enters   alph horror it is he such a sight would brace the arm of palsied cowardice and in the breast of mercys self infuse a tigers fury matchless extent of womans perfidy a few hours past with all the seeming of unshaken constancy were thou not kneeling at my feet adjuring heaven to witness for thy innocence and now my eyes behold thee in the arms of thy cursed paramour villain i thought my sword had long since paid the debt i owed thee i will now make justice certain  and first to deal it here  false woman die rushes at angelina who faints and is supported by dashington he defending her with his sword sir sturdy enters and runs between them he is followed by leonora and jaquelina   sir stur i thought this wildlooking gentleman would be falling foul of somebody sir if you dont curb your passions you may depend on it they will injure your health   leo heavens my sister   ang my dearest leonora   leo but whence this fury and distraction how altered are your husbands looks   ang altered indeed my sister some dreadful error has possession of his mind   alph error oh shameless woman can it be error now there stands the author and proclaimer of your infamy   dash sir   ang heaven can witness for me that till this hour i never beheld his face   dash give me leave sir to say that you are a most incomprehensible gentleman i am ready to admit that on a certain stormy day when you and i were weatherbound i was more communicative than i ought to have been to a stranger but may devils fly away with me in reality if i ever mentioned to you that ladys name which even yet i have not the honor of knowing i only named to you the lady angelina desparza   alph and who but she is owner of that name   dash why that lady is nt she pointing to leonora pray maam is nt your name angelina desparza   leo no that is my sisters name the wife of don alphonso   dash whew here is a business am i really awake or is this all a dream did i or did i not see you at madrid   leo you did while i was on a visit to my sister during don alphonsos absence   dash and  lord i begin to find that i have made a cursed deal of mischief the house madam where you did me the honor to receive me and allow me to express my passion was    leo my sisters and to my shame i own from apprehension that she would disapprove my conduct it was without her knowledge i received you   dash to angelina my dear maam i beg you a million of pardons and my dear sir notwithstanding you made a lunge clean through me i confess you have great reason to be offended but you see it was all a mistake   alph but whence could this mistake arise leonora would never surely in her sisters name receive the visits of a lover   dash no sir she admitted my visits under no name at all and obliged me too to promise not to make inquiries her commands i punctually obeyed but at our last interview as i was quitting the house i heard a passerby exclaim there lives the beauteous angelina desparza i therefore naturally concluded that the beauteous angelina was this lady to leonora   sir stur what a blunder and it is most extraordinary that though there is an irishman among you he has had no hand in it   ang alphonso   alph oh forgive me dearest angelina   dash although i confess myself horribly to blame i must say maam to angelina that husband of yours is as hasty a gentleman as ever jerked a sword out of its scabbard the moment i mentioned the name out came that damned long toledo and in three seconds it was through me upon my soul the greatest blame is due to your rashness   leo no to your tattling   sir stur ah that is a devil of a fault never kiss and tell   don miguel enters mig so i have found you out at last and i am happy to tell you that those desperate ruffians whom you to dashington hindered from cutting our throats are all in safe custody but what do you stay here so long for there is a devilish good dinner ready so come in and be jolly   leo we have discovered the error sir which led us to suppose that this gentleman had encountered your son   mig why i was sure it must turn out a mistake for i have it under my sons own hand that he is at lima and intends to remain there and i am not sorry to find that he has taken himself a wife since you wish to take another man for your husband   dash and may i hope sir that you will consent to my marriage with your ward   mig i consent with all my soul she is to be married not i and therefore i dont see that my inclination has any thing to do but to follow hers   sir stur ah my sweet jaquelina if your father would think in this manner it would be the saving of my life   jaq and of mine too   mig would it why then i have the satisfaction of telling you that her father is now perfectly disposed to let her please herself he only placed her in a convent till he had informed himself thoroughly of your character and fortune with both which he is now perfectly satisfied   sir stur then i am the happiest man living   dash what with such a catalogue of maladies   sir stur love has cured them all and i feel at this moment that i am as stout a man as ever   mig if you are not  hercules must have been a shrimp to you   leo now my dear guardy i have but one favor to ask which is that you will relinquish your office and cease to be an inquisitor   mig to that i cannot consent for i am not sure that any other person holding my office would do so little mischief as myself   dash yours is the system of true philanthropy  not to be contented with simply doing good but also to labor to prevent the evil designs of others  not only to practice virtue but to preserve the helpless from virtues foes   finale from sorrow and perils tormenting since now we are happily free our pleasure in harmony venting let us pour forth the numbers of glee so merrily merrily singing let joys sprightly sound be wafted around while the bells are so merrily ringing what transport misfortunes ideal and springing from error to find and those transports will all become real if you to our errors prove kind then merrily merrily etc the end books lately published by w miller   masons costume of china  to illustrated with  0 engravings english and french price  l  s
