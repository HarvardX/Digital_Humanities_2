is all the art i know  to make men happy and to keep them so plain truth dear murray need no flowers of speech so take it in the very words of creech   this vault of air this congregated ball selfcentred sun and stars that rise and fall there are my friend whose philosophic eyes look through and trust the ruler with his skies to him commit the hour the day the year and view   this dreadful all without a fear admire we then what   earths low entrails hold arabian shores or indian seas infold all the mad trade of   fools and slaves for gold or   popularity or stars and strings the mobs applauses or the gifts of kings say with what   eyes we ought at courts to gaze and pay the great our homage of amaze if weak the   pleasure that from these can spring the fear to want them is as weak a thing whether we dread or whether we desire in either case believe me we admire whether we   joy or grieve the same the curse surpised at better or surpised at worse thus good or bad to one extreme betray the unbalancd mind and snatch the man away for  0 virtues self may too much zeal be had the worst of madmen is a saint run mad    go then and if you can admire the state of beaming diamonds and reflected plate procure a taste to double the surprise and gaze on    parian charms with learned eyes be struck with bright    brocade or tyrian dye our birthday nobles splendid livery if not so pleased at    council board rejoice to see their judgments hang upon thy voice from    morn to night at senate rolls and hall plead much read more dine late or not at all but wherefore all this labor all this strife for    fame for riches for a noble wife shall    one whom nature learning birth conspired to form not to admire but be admired sigh while his chloe blind to wit and worth weds the rich dullness of some son of earth yet    time ennobles or degrades each line it brightened cragss and may darken thine and what is fame the meanest have their day the greatest can but blaze and pass away graced as thou art    with all the power of words so known so honored at the house of lords conspicuous scene another yet is nigh more silent far where kings and poets lie where murray long enough his countrys pride shall be no more than tully or than hyde    racked with sciatics martyred with the stone will any mortal let himself alone rather than so see ward invited over and desperate misery lays hold on dover the case is easier in the minds disease there all men may be cured whenever they please would ye be    blessed despise low joys low gains disdain whatever cornbury disdains be virtuous and be happy for your pains    but art thou one whom new opinions sway one who believes as tindal leads the way who virtue and a church alike disowns thinks that but words and this but brick and stones fly    then on all the wings of wild desire admire whatever the maddest can admire is wealth thy passion hence from pole to pole where winds can carry or where waves can roll for indian spices for peruvian gold prevent the greedy and outbid the bold    advance thy golden mountain to the skies on the broad base of fifty thousand rise add one round hundred and if that is not fair add fifty more and bring it to a square for mark the advantage just so many score will gain a    wife with half as many more procure her beauty make that beauty chaste and then such    friends  as cannot fail to last a    man of wealth is dubbed a man of worth venus shall give him form and anstis birth believe me many a    german prince is worse who proud of pedigree is poor of purse his wealth brave  0 timon gloriously confounds asked for a great he gives a hundred pounds or if three ladies like a luckless play takes the whole house upon the poets day    now in such exigencies not to need upon my word you must be rich indeed a noble superfluity it craves not for your self but for your fools and knaves something which for your honor they may cheat and which it much becomes you to forget    if wealth alone then make and keep us blessed still still be getting never never rest    but if to power and place your passion lie if in the pomp of life consist the joy then    hire a slave or if you will a lord to do the honors and to give the word tell at your levee as the crowds approach to whom    to nod whom take into your coach whom honor with your hand to make remarks who    rules in cornwall or who rules in berks  this may be troublesome is near the chair  that makes three members this can choose a mayr instructed thus you bow embrace protest adopt him    son or cozen at the least then turn about and    laugh at your own jest or if our life be one continued treat if    to live well means nothing but to eat up up cries gluttony it is break of day go drive the deer and drag the finnyprey with hounds and horns go hunt an appetite  so  0 russel did but could not eat at night called happy dog the beggar at his door and envied thirst and hunger to the poor or shall we    every decency confound through taverns stews and bagnios take our round go dine with charters in each vice outdo    ks lewd cargo or tyys crew from latian sirens french circaean feasts return well traveled and transformed to beasts or for a titled punk or foreign flame renounce our    country and degrade our name if after all we must with    wilmot own the cordial drop of life is love alone and swift cry wisely vive la bagatelle the man that love and laughs must sure do well    adieu  if this advice appear the worst even take the counsel which i gave you first or better precepts if you can impart why do i will follow them with all my heart finis
