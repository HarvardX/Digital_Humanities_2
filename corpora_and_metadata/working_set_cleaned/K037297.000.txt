obliged humble servant h more  prologue written by the author and spoken by mr hull our modern poets scarce know how to choose a subject worthy of the tragic muse for bards so well have gleaned the historic field that scarce one sheaf the exhausted ancients yield and these our timid author leaves to men for classic themes demand a classic pen yet still the wilds of fiction open lie a flowery prospect and a boundless sky but hard the task the sober path to choose and wandering fancys treacherous baits refuse  she dares not touch the dramas nobler strings the fate of nations and the fall of kings the humbler scenes of private life she shows a simple story of domestic woes the weight of crowns a kingdoms weal or woe how few can judge because how few can know but here you all may boast the critics art here all are judges  who possess a heart to govern empires is the lot of few but all who live have passions to subdue and even by patriots let it be confessed these rebel subjects ought to

game and screen my heart with easy looks and undesigning smiles and while my actions spring from sober thought they still appear the effect of wild caprice and i the thoughtless slave of giddy chance what but this frankness has engaged the promise of young orlando to confide to me that secret grief which preys upon his heart it is dangerous indiscreet hypocrisy to seem too good i am the careless bertrand the honest undesigning plain blunt man the follies i avow cloak those i hide for who will search where nothing seems concealed it is rogues of solid prudent grave demeanor excite suspicion

temperate age  guildford well be it so  youth has a privilege and i should be ashamed could i forget i have myself been young and harshly chide the not ungraceful levity of youth prudence becomes moroseness when it makes a rigid inquisition of the fault not of the man perhaps but of his youth foibles that shame the head on which old time has showerd his snow are then most pardonable and age has many a weakness of its own  bertrand your gentleness my lord and mild reproof correct the wanderings of misguided youth more than rebuke and shame it into virtue  guildford saw you my beauteous ward the lady julia   bertrand she past this way and with her your fair daughter your emmelina  guildford call them both my daughters for scarce is emmelina dearer to me than julia the loved child of my adoption the hour approaches too and bless it heaven with thy benignest kindliest influence when julia shall indeed become my daughter shall in obedience to her fathers will crown the impatient vows of my brave son and richly pay him for his dangers past  bertrand often have i wondered how the gallant rivers youthful and ardent doting to excess could dare the dangers of uncertain war ever marriage had confirmed his claim to julia  guildford twas the condition of her fathers will my brave old fellowsoldier and my friend he wished to see our ancient houses joined by this our childrens union but the veteran so highly valued military prowess that he bequeathed his fortunes and his daughter to my young rivers on these terms alone that he should early seek renown in arms and if he from the field returned a conqueror that sun which saw him come victorious home should witness their espousals yet he comes not the event of war is to the brave uncertain nor can desert in arms ensure success  bertrand yet fame speaks loudly of his early valor   guildford ever since the italian count the young orlando my rivers bosom friend has been my guest the glory of my son is all his theme oh he recounts his virtues with such joy dwells on his merit with a zeal so warm as to his generous heart pays back again the praises he bestows  bertrand orlandos noble he is of a tender brave and gallant nature of honor most romantic with such graces as charm all womankind  guildford and here comes one to whom the story of orlandos praise sounds like sweet music  bertrand what yourcharming

think you of this accomplished stranger  emmelina confused sir your pardon  but as my fathers guest my brothers friend i do esteem the count  guildford nay he has merit might justify thy friendship if he wanted the claims thou mentionst yet i mean to blame him  emmelina what has he done that could offend my father for you are just and are not angry lightly and he is mild unapt to give offense as you to be offended  guildford nay it is not much why does orlando shun of late my presence why lose that cheerful and becoming spirit which lately charmed us all rivers will chide us should he return and find his friend unhappy he is not what he was what says my child  emmelina my lord when first my brothers friend arrived  be still my heart aside  bertrand she dares not use his name her brothers friend aside  emmelina when first your noble guest came from that voyage he kindly undertook to ease our terrors for my rivers safety when we believed him dead he seemed most happy and shared the universal joy he gave of late he is less gay my brothers absence or i mistake disturbs his friends repose nor is it strange one mind informs them both each is the very soul that warms the other and both are wretched or are blessed together  bertrand why trembles my fair cousin   emmelina can i think that my loved brothers life has been in danger nor feel a strong emotion  bertrand ironically generous pity but when that danger has so long been past you should forget your terrors  emmelina i shall never for when i think that danger sprung from friendship that rivers to preserve anothers life incurred this peril still my wonder rises  bertrand and why anothers life why not orlandos such caution more betrays than honest freedom  guildford he is still the same the gibing thoughtless bertrand severe of speech but ignorant of malice  exit guildford emmelina going bertrand stay my fair cousin still with adverse eyes you view me say had i orlandos form i mean were i like him your

trust not orlandos truth the citron groves have heard his amorous vows breathed out to many a beauteous maid of florence bred in those soster climes his roving heart never learned to think fidelity a virtue but laughs at tales of british constancy but see orlando comes  perhaps to seek you with eyes bent downwards and with folded arms disordered looks and negligent attire and all the careless equipage of love he bends this way why does the mounting blood thus crimson your fair cheek he does not see us i will venture to disturb his meditations and instantly return  exit bertrand emmelina no more but leave me he is talkative but harmless rude but honest fuller of mirth than mischief see they meet  this way they come why am i thus alarmed oh for a little portion of that art ungenerous men

made for chiding but he bade me he says no more you rise at early dawn with him to chase the boar i pleaded for you told him twas savage sport  orlando what was his answer   emmelina he said twas sport for heroes and made heroes that hunting was the very school of war taught our brave youth to shine in nobler fields preserved em from the rust of dull inaction trained em for arms and fitted them for conquest  orlando o my fair advocate scarce can i grieve to have done wrong since my offense has gained so sweet a pleader  bertrand aside so i like this well full of respect but cold

how shall i speak my resolution sickens all virtuous men will shun me thou wiltscorn me and fly the foul contagion of my crime  bertrand my bosom is not steeled with that harsh prudence which would reproach thy failings tell me all the proudest heart loves to repose its faults upon a breast that has itself a tincture of human weakness i have frailties too frailties that teach me how to pity thine what silent still thou love my beauteous cousin have i not guessed  orlando i own that she has charms might warm a frozen stoic into love tempt hermits back again to that bad world they had renounced and make religious men forgetful of their holy vows to heaven yet bertrand  come i will tell thee all my weakness thou have a tender sympathising heart and art not rigid to a friends defects that heavenly form i view with eyes as cold as marble images of lifeless saints i see and know the workmanship divine my judgment owns her exquisite perfections but my rebellious heart denies her

horror that i may see the evils which await me nor pull such fatal mischiefs on my head as with my ruin must involve the fate of all i love on earth  bertrand just as i wish aside   orlando thou know i left my native italy directed hither by the noble rivers to ease his fathers fears who thought he fell in that engagement where we both were wounded his was a glorious wound gained in the cause of generous friendship for an hostile spear aimed at my breast rivers in his received saved my devoted life and won my soul  bertrand so far i knew but what of emmelina   orlando whether her gentle beauties first allured me or whether peaceful scenes and rural shades or leisure or the want of other objects or solitude apt to engender love engaged my soul i know not but i loved her we were together always till the habit grew into something like necessity when emmelina left me i was sad nor knew a joy till emmelina came her soft society amused my mind filled up my vacant heart and touched my soul twas gratitude twas friendship twas esteem twas reason twas persuasion nay twas love  bertrand but where was julia   orlando oh too soon she came for when i saw that wondrous form of beauty i stood entranced like some astronomer who as he views the bright expanse of heaven finds a new star i gazed and was undone gazed and forgot the tender emmelina gazed and forgot the generous trusting rivers forgot my faith my friendship and my honor  bertrand does julia know your love   orlando forbid it heaven what think thou i am so far gone in guilt as boldly to avow it bertrand no for all the kingdoms of the spacious earth i would not wrong my friend or damn my honor  bertrand trust me you judge too hardly of yourself   orlando think i have lodged a secret in thy breast on which my peace my fame my all depends long have i struggled with the fatal truth and scarce have dared to breathe it to myself for oh too surely the first downward step the treacherous path that leads to guilty deeds is to make vice familiar to the mind  exit bertrand am i awake no it is delusion all my wildest wishes never soared to this fortune anticipates my plot he loves her not emmelina but the lady julia orlando yes i will play thee at my will poor puppet thou have trusted to my hand the strings by which i will move thee to thy ruin and make thee too the instrument of vengeance of glorious vengeance on the man i hate  exit end of the first act act the second enter julia and emmelina julia how many cares perplex the maid who loves cares which the vacant heart can never know you fondly tremble for a brothers life orlando mourns the absence of a friend guildford is anxious for a sons renown in my poor heart your various terrors meet with added fears and fonder apprehensions they all unite in me i feel for all his life his fame his absence and his love for he may live to bless a sisters hopes may live to gratify impatient friendship may live to crown a fathers house with honor may live to glory and be dead to love  emmelina forbear these fears they wound my brothers honor julia a brave man must be ever faithful cowards alone dare venture to be false cowards alone dare injure trusting innocence and with bold perjuries affront high heaven  julia i know his faith and venerate his virtues i know his heart is tender as it is brave that all his fathers worth his sisters softness meet in his generous breast  and yet i fear  whoever loved like me and did not fear  enter guildford guildford where are my friends my daughter where is julia how shall i speak the fullness of my heart my son my rivers will this day return  emmelina my dearest brother   julia ha my rivers comes propitious heaven  emmelina and yet my julia trembles   julia have i not cause my rivers comes but how i dread to ask and yet i die to hear my lord  you know the terms   guildford he comes a conqueror he comes as guildfords son should ever come the battles over the english arms successful and rivers like an english warrior hastens to lay his laurels at the feet of beauty  exit julia my joy oppresses me   emmelina and see orlando how will the welcome news transport his soul and raise his drooping heart with caution tell him lest the oerwhelming rapture be too much for his dejected mind  enter orlando and bertrand julia my lord orlando wherefore that troubled air no more you dwell on your once darling theme you speak no more the praises of your rivers is he changed is he not still the gallant friend you loved as virtuous and as valiant  orlando still the same he must be ever virtuous ever valiant  emmelina if rivers is the same then must i think orlando greatly changed you speak not of him nor long for his return as you were wont how did you use to spend the livelong day in telling some new wonders of your friend till night broke in upon the unfinished tale and when twas over you would begin again and we again would listen with delight with fresh delight as if we had not heard it does rivers less deserve or you less love  orlando have i not loved him was my friendship cold when any praised his glories in the field my raptured heart has bounded at the tale methought i grew illustrious from his glory and rich from his renown to hear him praised more proud than if i had achieved his deeds and reaped the fullblown harvest of his fame how have i trembled for a life so dear when his too ardent soul despising caution has plunged him in the foremost ranks of war as if in love with danger  julia valiant rivers how does thy greatness justify my love  bertrand he is distant far so i may sasely praise him aside i claim some merit in my love of rivers since i admire the virtues that eclipse me with pleasure i survey those dazzling heights my gay inactive temper cannot reach  emmelina spoke like my honest cousin then orlando since such the love you bear your noble friend how will your heart sustain the mighty joy the news i tell will give you yes orlando restrain the transports of your grateful friendship and hear with moderation hear me tell you that rivers will return   orlando how when   emmelina this day   orlando impossible   bertrand then all my schemes are air   aside emmelina today i shall embrace my valiant brother   julia you droop my lord did you not hear her right she told you that your rivers would return to bless your friendship and to crown our hopes  orlando he is most welcome is he not my friend you say my rivers comes  thy arm good bertrand  bertrand joy to us all joy to the count orlando weak man take care

enough  julia my lord my rivers   rivers it is my julias self my life  julia my hero do i then behold thee   rivers oh my full heart expect not words my julia   emmelina rivers   rivers my sister what an hour is this my own orlando too  orlando my noble friend   rivers this is such prodigality of bliss i scarce can think it real honest bertrand your hand yours my orlando yours my father and as a hand i have a heart for all love has enlarged it from excess of love i am become more capable of friendship my dearest julia  guildford she is thine my son thou have deserved her nobly thou have won her fulfilled the terms   rivers therefore i dare not ask her i would not claim my julia as a debt but take her as a gift and oh i swear the dearest richest choicest noblest gift the bounty of indulgent heaven bestows  guildford joins their hand julia spare me my lord you scarcely are returned  confusion stops my tongue  yet i will own if there be truth or faith in womans vows then you have still been present to this heart and not a thought has wandered from its duty  exeunt julia and emmelina rivers looking after julia oh generous julia   orlando aside to bertrand mark how much she loves him   bertrand aside to orlando mere words which the fond sex have always ready   rivers forgive me good orlando best of friends how my soul joys to meet thee on this shore thus to embrace thee in my much loved england  guildford england the native soil the land of heroes where great elizabeth the scepter sways over a free glorious rich and happy people philosophy not cloistered up in schools the speculative dream of idle monks attired in attic robe here roams at large wisdom is wealth and science is renown here sacred laws protect the meanest subject the bread that toil procures fair freedom sweetens and every peasant eats his homely meal content and free lord of his small domain  rivers past are those gothic days and grant kind heaven they be forever past when english subjects were born the vassals of some tyrant lord when freesould men were basely handed down to the next heir transmitted with their lands the shameful legacy from sire to son  guildford but while thy generous soul my noble boy justly abhors oppression yet revere the plain stern virtues of our rough forefathers o never may the gallant sons of england lose their plain manly native character forego the glorious charter nature gaveem beyond what kings can give or laws bestow of candor courage constancy and truth  exeunt guildford and rivers orlando stay bertrand stay  oh pity my distraction this heart was never made to hide its feelings i had near betrayed myself  bertrand i trembled for you remember that the eye of love is piercing and emmelina marked you  orlando it is too much my artless nature cannot bear disguise think what i felt when unsuspecting rivers pressed me with generous rapture to his bosom professed an honest joy and called me friend i felt myself a traitor yet i swear yes by that power who sees the thoughts of men i swear i love the gallant rivers more than light or life i love but yet i fear him i shrunk before the luster of his virtue  i felt as i had wronged him  felt abashed i cannot bear this conflict in my soul and therefore have resolved   bertrand on what   orlando to fly   bertrand to fly from julia   orlando yes to fly from all from every thing i love to fly from rivers from emmelina from myself from thee from julia no  that were impossible for i shall bear her image in my soul it is a part of me the dearest part so closely interwoven with my being that i can never lose the dear remembrance till i am robbed of life and her together  bertrand it is cowardly to fly   orlando to stay is base   bertrand where would you go how lost in thought he stands aside a vulgar villain now would use persuasion and by his very earnestness betray the thing he meant to hide i will coolly wait till the occasion shows me how to act then turn it to my purpose ho orlando where would you go  orlando to everlasting solitude yes i will shroud my youth in some dark cell where disappointment steals devotions name to cheat the wretched votary into ruin there will i live in love with misery never shall the sight of mirth profane my grief the sound of joy shall never charm my ear nor music reach it save when the slow bell wakes the dull brotherhood to lifeless prayer then when the slowretreating world recedes desires are dead and burning passions cold and all things but my julia are forgotten one thought of her shall fire my languid soul warm the faint orison and feed despair  bertrand what with monastic lazy drones retire and chaunt cold hymns with holy hypocrites first perish all the sex forbid it manhood where is your nobler self for shame orlando renounce this superstitious whining weakness or i shall blush to think i called you friend  orlando what can i do   bertrand after a pause beg she will defer the marriage but for one single day do this and leave the rest to me she shall be thine  orlando how say thou what wrong her virtue  bertrand still this cant of virtue this pompous show of words without a meaning i grant that honors something manly honor i would fight i would burn i would bleed i would die for honor but what is this virtue  orlando ask you what it is why it is what libertines themselves adore it is the celestial coloring of beauty which wakens gallantry and fans desire beyond the rosy lip or starry eye nay she who ministers to guilty pleasures puts on its semblance when she most would please it is heavens own energy thaetherial flame which animates cold beauty into spirit  exit manet bertrand curse on his principles yet i shall shake them and bend his pliant spirit to my will now while it is warm with passion and will take whatever mould my forming hand will give it it is worthy of my genius then i love this emmelina  true she loves not me  but should young rivers die his fathers lands on me devolve  is rivers then immortal come  guildfords lands and his proud daughters hand are worth some thought why what sharp spurs to genius are mischief poverty revenge and love  exit bertrand enter emmelina and rivers talking emmelina yet do not blame orlando good my brother he is still the same that brave frank heart you loved only his tempers changed he is grown sad but that is no fault i only am to blame fond foolish heart to give itself away to one who gives me nothing in return  rivers how is this my father said orlando loved thee   emmelina indeed i thought so  he was kinder once nay still he loves or my poor heart deceives me  rivers if he has wronged thee yet i know he could not his gallant soul is all made up of virtues and i would rather doubt myself than him yet tell me all the story of your loves and let a brothers fondness sooth thy cares  emmelina when to this castle first orlando came a welcome guest to all to me most welcome yes spite of maiden shame and burning blushes let me confess he was most welcome to me at first my foolish heart so much deceived me i thought i loved him for my brothers sake but when i closely searched this bosom traitor i found alas i loved him for his own  rivers blush not to own it twas a well placed flame i glory in the merit of my friend and love my sister more for loving him  emmelina he talked of you i listened with delight and thought it was the subject only charmed me but when orlando chose another theme forgive me rivers but i listened still with undiminishd joy  he talked of love nor was that theme less grateful than the former i seemed the very idol of his soul rivers he said would thank me for the friendship i bore to his orlando i believed him julia was absent then  but what of julia  rivers aye what of her indeed why named you julia you could not surely think no that were wild why did you mention julia  emmelina nay twas nothing twas accident nor had my words a meaning if i did name her twas to note the time to mark the period of orlandos coldness the circumstance was casual and but meant to date the time it aimed at nothing farther  rivers it is very like no more i am satisfied you talk as i had doubts i have no doubts why do you labor to destroy suspicions which never had a birth is she not mine mine by the fondest ties of dear affection but did orlando change at her return did he grow cold it could not be for that and yet you say twas at that time it happened was it just then i have no cause for asking but for the love i bear my dearest sister  emmelina twas as i said   rivers he loves thee emmelina these starts of passion this unquiet temper betray how much he loves thee yes my sister he fears to lose thee fears his fathers will may dash his rising hopes nor give thee to him  emmelina oh flatterer thus to sooth my easy nature with tales of possible though doubtful bliss because it may be true my credulous heart whispers it is and fondly loves to cherish the feeble glimmering of a sickly hope  rivers this precious moment worth a tedious age of vulgar time i have stolen from love and jusia she waits my coming and a longer stay were treason to her beauty and my love  exeunt end of the second act act the third scene a garden emmelina why do my feet unbidden seek this grove why do i trace his steps i thought him here this is his hour of walking and these shades his daily haunt often have they heard his vows ah fatal vows which stole my peace away but now he shuns my presence yet who knows he may not be ungrateful but unhappy yes he will come to clear his past offenses with such prevailing eloquence will plead so mourn his former coldness and neglect and by ten thousand graceful ways repair them that i shall think i never was offended he comes and every doubts at once dispelled twas fancy all he never meant to wrong me  enter orlando orlando why at this hour of universal joy when every heart beats high with grateful rapture and pleasure dances her enchanting round o tell me why at this auspicious hour you quit the joyful circle of your friends rob social pleasures of its sweetest charm and leave a void even in the happiest hearts an aching void which only you can fill why seek alone these unfrequented shades these gloomy haunts unfit for blooming beauty but made for meditation and misfortune  emmelina i might retort the charge my lord orlando and ask you how the bosomfriend of rivers whom he has held deeprooted in his heart beyond a brothers dearness saved his life and cherished it when saved beyond his own i might enquire why when this rivers comes after long tedious months of expectation alive victorious and as firm in friendship as fondness could have wished or fncy feigned i might enquire why thus orlando shuns him why thus he courts this melancholy gloom as if he were at variance with delight and scorned to mingle in the general joy  orlando oh my fair monitress i have deseryd your gentle censure  emmelina you will then grow cheerful nor give your friends who love you room for blame julia complains too of you  orlando ah does julia if julia chides me i have erred indeed for harshness is a stranger to her nature but why does she complain o tell me wherefore that i may soon repair the unwilling crime and prove my heart was guiltless of the offense  emmelina why so alarmed   orlando alarmed   emmelina indeed you seemed so   orlando sure you mistake alarmed oh no i was not there was no cause  i could not be alarmed upon so slight a ground something you said but what i know not of your friend  emmelina did i   orlando that julia was displeased  was it not so twas that or something like it  emmelina she complains that you avoid her  orlando how that i avoid her did julia say so ah you have forgot  it could not be  emmelina why are you terrified   orlando no not terrified  i am not  but were those her very words you might mistake her meaning did julia say orlando shunned her presence oh did she could she say so  emmelina if she did why this disorder there is no cause  orlando no cause o there is a cause of dearer worth than empire quick let me fly and find the fair upbraider tell her she wrongs me tell her i would die rather than meet her anger emmelina faints ah you faint what have i said curse my imprudent tongue look up sweet innocence my emmelina  my gentle friend awake look up fair creature it is your orlando calls  emmelina orlandos voice methought he talked of love  nay do not mock me my heart is but a weak a very weak one i am not weil  perhaps i have been to blame spare my confusion  exit emmelina orlando so i have betrayed my secret and struck a poisoned dagger to her heart her innocent heart why what a wretch am i ruin approaches shall i tamely meet it and  with destruction till it blast me no i will sly thee julia fly for ever he sly what then becomes of emmelina shah i abandon her it must be so better escape with this poor wreck of honor than hazard all by staying  rivers here  enter rivers rivers the same my other self my own orlando i came to seek thee twas in thy kind bosom my suffering soul reposed its secret cares when doubts and difficulties stood before me and now now when my prosperous fortune shines and gilds the smiling hour with her bright beams shall i become a niggard of my bliss defraud thee of thy portion of my joys and rob thee of thy wellearnd claim to share them  orlando that i have ever loved thee witness heaven that i have thought thy friendship the best blessing that marked the fortune of my happier days i here attest the sovereign judge of hearts then think o think what anguish i endure when i declare in bitterness of spirit that we must part   rivers what does orlando mean   orlando that i must leave thee rivers must renounce thy loved society  rivers thou have been wronged thy merit has been slighted sure my father who knew how dear i held thee  but he could not   orlando he is all goodness no  there is a cause  seek not to know it  rivers now by holy friendship i swear thou shall not leave me what just now when i have safely passed so many perils escaped so many threatening deaths returned to the kind arms of long desiring friendship and now when i expected such a welcome as happy souls in paradise bestow upon a new inhabitant who comes to taste their blessedness you coldly tell me you will depart it must not be orlando  orlando it must it must   rivers ah must then tell me wherefore   orlando i would not dim thy dawn of happiness nor shade the brighter beams of thy good fortune with the dark sullen cloud that hangs over mine  rivers is this the heart of him i called my friend full of the graceful weakness of affection how have i known it bend at my request
