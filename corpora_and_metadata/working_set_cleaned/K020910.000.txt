creusa queen of athens  a tragedy  as it is acted at the theater royal in drury lane by his majestys servants  written by mr william whitehead  london printed for r and j dodsley in pall mall and sold by m cooper in peternosterrow       prologue spoken by mr ross prologues of old the learned in language say were merely introductions to the play spoken by gods or ghosts or men who knew whatever was previous to the scenes in view and complaisantly came to lay before ye the several heads and windings of the story but modern times and british rules are such our bards beforehand must not tell too much nor dare we like the neighboring french admit even confidantes who might instruct the pit by asking questions of the leading few and hearing secrets which before they knew yet what we can to help this antique piece we will attempt  our scene tonight is greece and by the magic of the poets rod this stage the temple of the delphic god where kings and chiefs and sages came of old like modern fools to have their fortunes told and monarchs were enthroned or nations freed as an old priest or withered maid decreed yet think not all were equally deceived some knew more doubted many more believed in short these oracles and witching rhimes were but the pious frauds of ancient times wisely contrived to keep mankind in awe when faith was wonder and religion law thus much premised to every feeling breast we leave the scenes themselves to tell the rest  yet something sure was to the critics said which i forget  some invocation made ye critic bands like jealous guardians placed to watch the encroachments on the realms of taste from you our author would two boons obtain not wholly diffident nor wholly vain two things he asks it is modest sure from you who can do all things to request but two first to his scenes a kind attention pay then judge  with candor judge  and we obey  persons represented xuthus king of athens mr berry ilyssus an unknown youth attendant on the temple

the right honorable george bussy lord visc villiers the following tragedy is inscribed by his lordships most obliged and most affectionate humble servant  w whitehead  advertisement the subject of the following scenes is so ancient so slightly mentioned by historians and so fabulously treated by euripides in his tragedy of ion that the author thought himself at liberty to make the story his own some glaring circumstances he was obliged to adhere to which he has endeavored to render probable  crusa queen of athens a tragedy act i the vestibule of the temple ilyssus and virgins ilyssus haste haste ye virgins round the columns twine your flowery chaplets and with streams freshdrawn of castaly bedew the sacred porch of the great god of day already see his orient beam has reached the double top of high parnassus and begins to shed a gleamy luster over the laurel grove haste haste ye virgins from the vale beneath i hear the noise of chariots and of steeds which hither bend their course for every sound seems nearer than the former  and behold a reverend stranger who perhaps proclaims the approach of some great monarch to consult allseeing phoebus or implore his aid haste haste ye virgins  enter phorbas phorbas tell me gentle maids and thou fair youth who seem to lead the train is this the temple of the delphic god  ilyssus it is and on the middle point of earth its firm foundations by immortal hands stand fixed  but break we off the folded gates unbar and lo the priestess self appears  the pythia speaks as she descends from the temple pythia hence ye profane nor with unhallowed step pollute the threshold of the delian king who slew the python  say from whence thou art and what thy business stranger  phorbas sacred maid from athens am i come the harbinger of great creusa mine and athens queen  pythia comes she on pious purpose to adore the mystic shrine oracular  phorbas she does and with her comes the partner of her bed aeolian xuthus he whose powerful arm saved athens from her fate and in return from good erectheus bounteous hand received his daughter and his crown  half aside would he had found some other recompense  pythia overhearing him would he had found old age is talkative and i may learn somewhat of moment from him  wherefore come they does famine threaten or widewasting plague infest the land  phorbas thank heaven our crowded streets have felt no dire disease and plenty still laughs in our blooming fields alas i fear the childless goddess who presides over athens has found a surer method to declare how ill she brooks that any stranger hand should wield the athenian scepter  pythia does from her the vengeance come  phorbas i know not whence it comes but this i know full fifteen years have rolled since first their hands were joined and rolled in vain for still the royal pair in silence mourn cursed with a barren bed for this they come texplore the latent cause and beg of heaven to grant an heir or teach them where to fix on what selected head the athenian crown  pythia and heaven no doubt will hear and grant their prayer ilssus haste and bid the priests prepare for sacrifice you nysa and your sisters amid the laurel grove with speed perform the mornings due lustration then hither all return  myself mean while aside will tempt the vice of age and try to draw aside some useful secrets from him aside the good king of whom you spoke erectheus did his people esteem and love him as they ought for fame talked largely of his worth he was a king   phorbas he was my good old master such a king as heaven but rarely sends did we esteem and love him do thou ask o we adored him he was our father not our king  these tears at least may speak my heart  we must not hope in these degenerate times to see him equaled he never did an unkind act but once and then he thought the public good required it though much i fear the evils we lament from thence derive their origin  pythia what act what unkind act  phorbas o maid twere long to tell the whole unhappy story yet in part hear what to me appears too closely joined with these our present ills there was a youth athenian born but not of royal blood his name nicander him unlucky fate had made the lover of our present queen while yet a maid what will not love attempt in young ambitious minds he told his pain and won the fair in secret to admit and to return his passion the good king was for a time deceived but found at last the audacious fraud and drove the guilty youth to banishment perpetual some say twas by his means he fell though that my heart consents not to believe thus much is sure nicander wandered forth a wretched exile and ere few days had past upon the road were found his wellknown garments stained with blood sure sign of murder and as sure a sign no needy robber was the instrument  pythia how bore creusa this  phorbas at first her sorrows were loud and frantic time at length subdued her rage to silent grief the good old king to sooth her woes consented she should raise a tomb to her nicander and perform a kind of annual rites to parted love  pythia but that not long continued for we find she married xuthus  phorbas twas a match of state he saved her country and she gave her hand because that country asked it but her heart is buried with nicander still to him and xuthus self permits it she performs her yearly oftrings and adorns with flowers an empty tomb  would he had lived and reigned her wedded lord we had not wanted then the assistance of a stranger arm to guard the athenian state nor had we then been driven to search for heirs at delphi  pythia stop thy tongue or speak with reverence of the sacred shrine  thy words were hasty but thy silence now makes just atonement for them  then perhaps thou think this want of heirs a curse entailed by heaven on athens for nicanders death and xuthus reign  phorbas i am athenian born nor love aeolian kings however great and good they may be  pythia the imperial xuthus is much renowned  phorbas is virtuous brave and pious perhaps too pious  pythia how  phorbas forgive me maid i speak my thoughts with freedom  pythia what thou speak to me is sacred then perchance thou rankst his journey hither to address the god among those acts which thou would call too pious  phorbas for me the gods of athens would suffice  yet do i pay just reverence holy maid to thee and to thy shrine  pythia thy zeal for athens is too intemperate  but the train returns and interrupts our converse say ilyssus are they prepared  enter ilyssus and virgins ilyssus they are and only wait the approaching victims  pythia by you train the queen is now on her arrival thou ilyssus receive her here while i as custom wills deep in the temples inmost gloom retire and wait the inspiring god  ilyssus hear when thou have paid due honors to the queen haste to aletes in the laurel grove impatient i expect him tell him youth things of uncommon import do demand his instant presence  but the crowd approaches stranger farewell  i feel i feel within an heavenborn impulse and the seeds of truth are laboring in my breast  stranger farewell  the pythia returns to the temple and the gates shut enter creusa and attendants creusa no farther need we conduct bid the guards return and wait the king  phorbas does ought of moment detain him on the road  creusa he stops a while  great trophonius cave that he may leave  duty unperformd heaven grant his zeal may meet with just success  ilyssus please you great queen in yon pavilion to repose and taste some light refection  creusa ha  lycea  phorbas what youth is this there is something in his eyes his shape his voice  what may we call thee youth  ilyssus the servant of the god who guards this fane  creusa bear thou no name  ilyssus ilyssus gracious queen the priests and virgins call me  creusa ha ilyssus that names athenian tell me gentle youth art thou of athens then  ilyssus i have no country nor know i whence i am  creusa who where thy parents thy father mother  ilyssus ever honored queen i never knew a mothers tender cares nor heard the instructions of a fathers tongue  creusa how came thou hither  ilyssus eighteen years are past since in the temples portal i was found a sleeping infant  creusa eighteen years good heaven that fatal time recalls a scene of woe  let me not think  were there no marks to show from whom or whence thou were  ilyssus i have been told an osier basket such as shepherds weave and a few scattered leaves were all the bed and cradle i could boast  creusa unhappy child but more o ten times more unhappy they who lost perhaps in thee their only offspring what pangs what anguish must the mother feel compelled no doubt by some disastrous fate   but this is all conjecture   ilyssus o great queen had those from whom i sprung been formed like thee had they ever felt the secret pangs of nature they had not left me to the desert world so totally exposed i rather fear i am the child of lowliness and vice and happy only in my ignorance  why should she weep o if her tears can fall for even a strangers but suspected woes how is that people blessed where she presides as mother and as queen  please you retire  creusa no stay thy sentiments at least bespeak a generous education tell me youth how has thy mind been formed  ilyssus in that great queen i never wanted parents the good priests and pious priestess who with care sustained my helpless infancy left not my youth without instruction but o more than all the kindest best good man a neighboring sage who has known better days though now retired to a small cottage on the mountains brow he deals his blessings to the simple swains in balms and powerful herbs he taught me things which my soul treasures as its dearest wealth and will remember ever the good priests it is true had taught the same but not with half that force and energy convictions self dwelt on aletes tongue  creusa aletes said thou was that the good mans name  ilyssus it is great queen for yet he lives and guides me by his counsels  creusa what did he teach thee  ilyssus to adore high heaven and venerate on earth heavens image truth to feel for others woes and bear my own with manly resignation  yet i own some things he taught me which but ill agree with my condition here  creusa what things were those  ilyssus they were for exercise and to confirm my growing strength and yet i often told him the exercise he taught resembled much what i had heard of war he was himself a warrior once  creusa and did those sports delight thee  ilyssus great queen i do confess my soul mixed with them whenever i grasped the osierplatted shield or sent the mimic javelin to its mark i felt i know not what of manhood in me but then i knew my duty and repressed the swelling ardor it is to shades i cried the servant of the temple must confine his less ambitious not less virtuous cares  creusa did the good man observe and blame thy ardor  ilyssus he only smiled at my too forward zeal nay seemed to think such sports were necessary to soften what he called more rigrous studies  creusa  why should she weep o if her tears can fall for even a strangers but suspected woes how is that people blessed where she presides as mother and as queen  please you retire  creusa no stay thy sentiments at least bespeak a generous education tell me youth how has thy mind been formed  ilyssus in that great queen i never wanted parents the good priests and pious priestess who with care sustained my helpless infancy left not my youth without instruction but o more than all the kindest best good man a neighboring sage who has known better days though now retired to a small cottage on the mountains brow he deals his blessings to the simple swains in balms and powerful herbs he taught me things which my soul treasures as its dearest wealth and will remember ever the good priests it is true had taught the same but not with half that force and energy convictions self dwelt on aletes tongue  creusa aletes said thou was that the good mans name  ilyssus it is great queen for yet he lives and guides me by his counsels  creusa what did he teach thee  ilyssus to adore high heaven and venerate on earth heavens image truth to feel for others woes and bear my own with manly resignation  yet i own some things he taught me which but ill agree with my condition here  creusa what things were those  ilyssus they were for exercise and to confirm my growing strength and yet i often told him the exercise he taught resembled much what i had heard of war he was himself a

creusa did the good man observe and blame thy ardor  ilyssus he only smiled at my too forward zeal nay seemed to think such sports were necessary to soften what he called more rigrous studies  creusa  suppose when i return to athens youth thou should attend me thither would thou trust to me thy future fortunes  ilyssus o most gladly  but then to leave these shades where i was nursed the servant of the god how might that seem and good aletes too the kind old man of whom i spoke  but wherefore talk i thus you only throw these tempting lures to try the ambition of my youth  please you retire  creusa ilyssus we will find a time to speak more largely on this subject for the present let all withdraw and leave us youth farewell i see the place and will retire at leisure lycea phorbas stay  ilyssus aside how my heart beats she must mean something sure though good aletes has told me polished courts abound in falsehood but i will bear the priestess message to him and open all my doubts  exit phorbas great queen why standst thou silent something seems to labor in thy breast  creusa alas good phorbas did thou observe that youth when first my eye glanced on his beauteous form methought i saw the person of nicander  phorbas gracious queen your heart misleads your eyes the image there too deeply sixd makes every pleasing object bear some resemblance to itself  creusa lycea and yet though thou wast there i well believe thy youth can scarce remember how he looked when from the fight triumphant he returned graced with the victor laurel such a wreath as now ilyssus wears indeed lycea thy mother had she lived had thought as i do nay when he spoke the voice too was nicanders i know not what to think perhaps twas fancy perhaps twas something more  phorbas illustrious queen you do abuse your noble mind and lend to mere illusions of the brain the force and power to make you wretched grant there were some slight resemblance of nicanders form in young ilyssus though my eyes perceive not even the most distant likeness grant there were yet wherefore should the sight so nearly touch thee casual similitude we know too well nicander left no heir she seems disturbed i say not this great queen to heighten but relieve your sorrows and banish from your breast each vain surmise which fancy might suggest  creusa too well indeed o phorbas much too well indeed we know nicander left no heir to his perfections no image of himself  and yet good phorbas blame not my folly nor demand a reason if i entreat thee to examine strictly the fortunes of this young unknown the priests or priestess may know more than they entrust to his unwary youth the sage he spoke of could thou not search him out it is somewhere near he dwells i think upon the mountains brow thou wonderst at me call it if thou please a womans weakness but obey me phorbas  phorbas you say i wonder it is indeed to see my honored queen employ her thoughts thus idly on griefs long past when things of dear concern to her and athens should alarm her nearly  creusa what things of near concern  phorbas see thou not queen thy crown erectheus crown the crown of athens wavering in fortunes power  creusa the gods will fix it  phorbas the gods ah great creusa may my fears be vain and groundless but i fear the gods have left us to ourselves when we resigned the athenian scepter to a stranger hand we did reject their guidance wherefore come we to delphi now but that the offended gods have turned too long an inattentive ear to our illjudgd petitions  creusa why illjudgd we asked for heirs  phorbas we did for xuthus heirs the race of aeolus  i know great queen they were to spring from thee but heaven permits not the native pureness of the athenian soil should mix with foreign clay i wish we find not more alien kings at delphi  creusa think thou xuthus deceives us then his worth his piety forbid the thought besides the sacred place admits not of deceit  phorbas credulity is not the vice of age forgive me queen if i suspect that piety which brings us to search for kings at delphi might not athens have chosen her own monarch her brave youth her bearded sages are they not the flower and pride of greece nay might not thou creusa with liberal hand bestow the imperial wreath and who has better right  creusa the gods who gave it to me and my great ancestors  phorbas whatever the gods bestow can never be resumed though we repent the pious populace will reverence kings from heaven  creusa and wherefore not  phorbas o queen perhaps my fears are too officious but let thy servant beg   creusa i know thy zeal for me and for thy country rest assured creusa never will consent to ought which can endanger athens  phorbas my heart thanks thee  creusa mean while the youth ilyssus   phorbas should the king confirmed by oracles presume to fix a stranger on the throne   creusa he will not do it  phorbas i hope he will not yet   creusa the youth i spoke of will thou enquire   phorbas should xuthus lay aside his usual mildness and assume at once the monarch and the husband could thou then   creusa in athens cause i could resist them all but cease these vain suspicions a few hours will prove thy fears were groundless meanwhile phorbas thou will find methods to inform thyself touching this unknown youth  phorbas by yonder guards the king should be at hand  creusa i will retire to the pavilion and expect him there yet hear me phorbas let not xuthus know why thou inquire  phorbas xuthus has other cares  creusa the priestess too i would confer with her though that lycea may perform farewell and prosper in thy task  alas lycea exit phorbas there is a secret labors in my breast but fate forbids that i should give it utterance this boding heart was early taught to feel too sensibly each distant doubt alarms it it starts at shadows  but retire we maid grief is the unhappy charter of our sex the gods who gave us readier tears to shed gave us more cause to shed them  exeunt the end of the first act act ii the laurel grove aletes and ilyssus aletes seemed she disturbed when she beheld thee  ilyssus much and when i gave her the slight hints i knew relating to my fortunes she dissolved in silent tears such soft humanity sure never dwelt in any breast but hers nor did i think till now that i had cause of discontent but since she wept my fate i seem to find a reason in her grief and feel myself unhappy  aletes why unhappy  ilyssus i know not why and yet to be confined thus to a single spot to draw in air to take in nourishment to live to die for this was man designed ah good aletes sure thou have taught me godlike man was made for nobler purposes of general good for action not for rest  the queen proposed i should attend her to the athenian state would thou advise it do thou think aletes she meant i should attend her  aletes doubtless youth if she proposed she meant it  ilyssus and would thou advise i should attend her  aletes wherefore not  ilyssus may i desert these shades or can i leave thee thee my good aletes  aletes o ilyssus strive not to hide thy heart from me thou can not i formed it and i know it delphis shades have now no peace for thee thy bosom feels ambitions active unrelenting fires thou wishest and thou hopst thou know not what it is glory thou would have go then brave youth where virtue calls thee be the means but noble thou can not soar too high  ilyssus my more than father thy words inspire me and i feel a warmth unknown before  but then my birth   aletes thy birth did i not early teach thee to despise a casual good thou art thyself ilyssus inform me youth would thou be what thou art thus fair thus brave thus sensibly alive to glorys finest feel or give up all to be descended from a line of kings the tenth perhaps from jove  i see thy cheek glows a repentant blush  our greatest heroes those gods on earth those friends of human kind whose great examples i would set before thee were once unknown like thee and yet if birth concern thee know prophetic is my speech thy fate is now at work and a few hours may show thee what thou art  my words alarm thee  ilyssus they do indeed o tell me   aletes it is in vain thou would enquire from me what heaven conceals till its fit time did thou not say ilyssus thy pythia would be here  ilyssus she comes  aletes retire and leave us to ourselves  ilyssus i will  and yet might i not know   aletes from me thou can know nothing  ilyssus a few hours said you  aletes hence and beg of heaven to prosper the event retire and leave us  exit ilyssus enter pythia pythia now good aletes if thy pregnant mind deep judging of events has ever framed such artful truths as won believing man to think them born of heaven and made my name renowned in greece o now exert thy power no common cause demands it kings and states are our solicitors and athens fate hangs on my lips  aletes i know it well and now if as thou say my secret kind advice and worn experience in the ways of men have gained thy altars credit and with gifts loaded thy shrines now by one grateful act thou may repay me all  pythia what act o speak and gladly i obey  aletes an act my pythia which though at first it may seem bold and dangerous shall in the end add luster to thy shades and make even kings protectors of thy fane  o pythia twas the hand of heaven itself which brought these royal suppliants to thy shrine i could unfold a tale  but let it rest thou shall ere night know all and bless with me the indulgent powers above only in this obey me blindly pythia  pythia say in what  aletes declare ilyssus heir to athens crown  pythia ilyssus heir what mean thou it is a fraud too palpable  aletes i knew twould startle thee but it is because thou know the fraud my pythia that it alarms thee did thou really think this youth were heir to the athenian crown would thou not seize the happy gift of chance and to the world proclaim it  pythia true i should and bless my fate that in these sacred shades i had nursed up unknowingly a king for my protector but what then might seem the consequence now seems the cause aletes will they not say i made the king to gain the kind protector  aletes so to thee it seems but who will say it the believing many will bow with reverence and implicit faith to what thy shrine ordains and for the few who may suspect the cheat true policy will keep them silent should they dare detect a fraud like this and spurn at right divine where were their power the manyheaded beast would feel the slackened rein and from his back shake off the lordly rider nay should athens be blind to her own good the states of greece thou know it well would arm in thy defense and force her to receive the king thou gavst her his form his unknown birth his winning softness his education here in heavens own eye all plead in his behalf and as he tells me the queen already with unusual marks of favor has beheld him for the king a pious awe and reverence for the gods is his distinguished attribute thou seem to weigh my words to clear thy doubts at once know many days have past since first i knew of their approach thou think i should have told thee it needed not i have myself prepared each previous circumstance and found due means to forward the event thy part is easy behold the oracle  pythia reads a banished youth is athens cause of woe how know thou that  looking earnestly at him aletes demand not but read on  pythia reads for that youth banished athens must receive another youth and on the young unknown who tends my shrine and whom i call my son bestow the imperial wreath the god declare no more  aletes thou seem amazed  pythia i am indeed to find thee thus instructed on a theme i came prepared to mention the queens passion her lover banished   aletes what thou see i know may tell thee i know more but say from whence thou gainedst thy intelligence  pythia from one whose zeal may thwart thy schemes a warm old man and firm in athens cause who came today before the rest and led by my enquiries gave me those hints on which i thought to build prophetic doubtful answers but i find my best instructor here  aletes perhaps thou do of this rest well assured i never had asked of pythia ought but what i knew with safety she might comply with  pythia tell me what thou know  aletes not yet it is better thou remain in ignorance till all be finished but pronounce the oracle and leave the rest to me do thou distrust me  pythia i do not  yet if on slight hints alone thou formst this weighty fraud consider well what may or may not follow  by thy looks there should be something hid  thy coming hither was much upon the time we found this child and since with what almost paternal care thou have instructed him though that indeed might spring from thy benevolence of heart which i have known is boundless say aletes what should i think thou smilst  aletes will thou obey me  pythia i must and yet if it is a fraud aletes the warm old man of whom i spoke detests a stranger king even xuthus self whose worth he does acknowledge great he views with pain upon the athenian throne  aletes i know him well it is phorbas do not wonder at my words but find a means that i may see the queen in secret unobserved by prying eyes and all that old mans fears and rage shall vanish he shall with joy receive a stranger king will thou devise the means  pythia i now begin to hope indeed there is some secret hid of most important weight but does the queen   aletes i will not answer thee my times too precious only devise some means that i may see her quite unobserved by all  pythia you cannot see her till all be past will that suffice  aletes it will  pythia here in the laurel grove  aletes no place more fit but o be careful pythia that the king observe us not for it is of mighty moment he should believe this substituted youth of race aeolian to which end my pythia i have among the priests these few days past when they suspected not the approach of xuthus dropped doubtful hints as if i had discovered some antique marks amid the osier twigs which formed ilyssus cradle that denote he sprang from aeolus and at the cave of great trophonius have i taken due care such answers should be given as would induce one of less faith than xuthus to expect an heir of his own family  pythia the boy knows he of thy intentions  aletes no nor must till ripening time permit his fate depends upon his ignorance  soft who comes here  pythia it is the warm old man and as i think some fair attendant of the queen retire i would know more but  wherefore do thou gaze so ardently upon them  aletes hence away we must not now be seen  exeunt pythia and aletes enter lycea and phorbas lycea this place seems quite retired here if thou wait i will inform the queen and her impatience will bring her on the instant surely phorbas something mysterious lurks beneath her tears her strange anxieties since thou were absent this unknown youth alone has filled her thoughts of him alone she talks recounts his words describes his looks his gestures loves to dwell on each particular ere thou were gone she wished and even expected thy return dispatched me often though she knew twas vain to watch for thy arrival when the king approached she smoothed her brow as if to hide the strugglings of her mind nay seemed afraid he should suspect her sorrows  phorbas then to him she mentioned not this youth  lycea her conduct there was most mysterious with a voice of fear she slightly dropped that she had seen a youth whom she could wish to bear with her to athens the king consented and with smiles proposed they should adopt him  phorbas ha adopt him said thou  lycea in sport he spoke but at his words a glow of sudden joy spread over her face her tongue forgot restraint and in his praise grew lavish then stopped again and hesitating strove to check its zeal as fearful to betray some hidden transport  phorbas whatsoever it be i soon shall damp her joy this youth lycea must not to athens  but behold the queen  lycea o how impatient ere i could return to tell her thou were here she comes herself eager to learn thy tidings  enter creusa creusa now my phorbas say what thou know at once the king already consents he should attend us  phorbas never never shall athens see that youth  creusa what mean thou phorbas  phorbas too much already of aeolian blood has hapless athens known  creusa aeolian blood  phorbas the king consents i doubt not his consent  yes twas my word great queen aeolian blood this youth descends from aeolus  creusa be dumb or bring me better tidings  phorbas worse i cannot but what i speak is truth  creusa peace monster peace thou know not truth it is thy affected zeal for athens for thy country that suggests this horrid falsehood it is thy hate of xuthus  phorbas what means my queen or how have i deserved such harsh expressions does my honest love for athens and creusa subject me to such unkind suspicions  creusa gracious gods it cannot be  alas forgive me phorbas i know not what i say thy words strike through me they pierce my very soul o i had hoped  but tell me all though i believe thee honest thy zeal for athens and for me may make thee too hasty of belief why art thou silent  phorbas amazement stops my tongue these starts of passion this violence of grief must have a cause  creusa perhaps they have perhaps to thee good phorbas this bursting heart may open all its sorrows but tell me first what are thy proofs from whence gaindst thou this cursed intelligence  phorbas o queen thy looks thy words  i know not how to answer yet if there be offense in what i speak my ignorance offends not i offend know then creusa from the priests who tend this delphic shrine by your command i learnt my first intelligence  creusa and did they say this youth was of aeolian race  phorbas they did at least their words imported little less they judged me xuthus friend not enemy as would thy rage suggest and as a friend dropped hints they thought would please me  creusa then perhaps it was not truth they spoke they but deceived thy ear with welljudgd flattery  phorbas what followed confirmed it truth has the king mentioned to thee what promises were given him at the shrine of sage trophonius  creusa general promises of sure success no more  phorbas know then great queen as i returned from converse with the priests i met his friend and bosom favorite lycon joy sparkled in his eyes and his vain tongue oerflowd with transport i observed it well and gave the torrent passage nay with art even led it blindly forward till at length he opened his whole soul and under seal of firmest secrecy told me the king would find an heir at delphi such an heir as would rejoice the unapparent shades of his great ancestors at that i started he found his error then and told me glozing that great trophonius had almost proclaimed though not expressly xuthus here should find an heir of his own race  creusa of his own race  phorbas so said he whether great trophonius spoke this oracle i know not but i know too well whose oracle to me declared it  creusa think thou this youth   phorbas grant it were only done to try my zeal why should they try it now unless some close design required that trial yes mighty queen i do believe this youth is our intended king but by yon heaven if it be he or any other he of xuthus race he shall not reign in athens this poinard first shall drink his blood  creusa forbear that thought distracts me  though perhaps it is just  o phorbas twas my hope my wish my prayer that youth might reign in athens but thy words strike deadly damps like baleful aconite and poison all within  phorbas what means my queen  creusa o phorbas o lycea  but first swear by nemesis and the tremendous powers who punish broken faith no word no hint shallscape your lips of all your queen declares  both we swear  creusa know then o pain to memory i had a son  phorbas a son  lycea good heaven  phorbas a son  creusa o my full heart thy mother my lycea knew all the fatal process of my woes and was their only solace phorbas yes i had a son but witness every god whose genial power presides over nuptial leagues nicander was my wedded lord that night that fatal night which drove him forth from athens forced from my swelling womb ere yet mature its precious burden to thy mothers cares i owed my life in secret she assuagd my piercing pangs and to nicanders arms in secret she conveyed the wretched infant what followed well thou know nicander fell and with him doubtless fell the dear dear charge consigned to his protection yet good phorbas when i beheld this youth his looks his voice his age his unknown birth all all conspired to cheat me into hopes alas how fallen how blasted all  phorbas great queen my tears confess an old mans tears which rarely fall confess how much i share your anguish had i known nicander was your lord by earth and heaven i would have raised all athens in his cause nay been a rebel to the best of masters ere the dear pledge of your unspotted loves should thus have fallen untimely now alas i have not even one flattering hope to give thee till now i often have wondered why so far their rage pursued nicander it is too plain they knew the precious burden which he bore and for the hapless child the father died  creusa o god i feel the truth of what thou utterst and my heart dies within me o lycea who who would be a mother  phorbas be a queen and turn thy grief to rage shall aliens sport with thy misfortunes shall insulting spoilers smile over the ruins of thy hapless state while all the golden harvest is their own shall xuthus triumph shall his race succeed while thine i mean not to provoke thy tears thy tender blossoms are torn rudely off almost or ere they bloom  creusa it shall not be no ye immortal powers  yet let us wait till the dire truth glare on us one short hour and doubt shall be no more then phorbas then should he presume to place on athens throne his alien race nay though this beauteous youth this dear resemblance of my murdered lord should be the fatal choice by that dear shade which perished as it reached the gates of life i will i think i will assist thy vengeance  soft who comes here it is he how innocent how winning soft he looks whatever it be he knows not the deceit look on him phorbas nay thou shall question him  phorbas not i great queen resume yourself nor let this fond persuasion betray you to a weakness you should blush at  creusa if possible i will  enter ilyssus ilyssus illustrious queen the altar stands prepared and all things wait your royal presence from the king i come his messenger  creusa we will attend his pleasure be near me phorbas i may want thy counsel  ilyssus she looks not on me sure as she was wont i will speak to her permit me gracious queen to pay my humblest thanks for by your means the king is kind as you are  creusa rise ilyssus perhaps you needed there no advocate phorbas lead on my resolution melts and all my sex returns one look from him outweighs a thousand proofs phorbas lead on or i am lost in weakness  exeunt creusa and phorbas ilyssus stopping lycea gentle maid stay yet a moment wherefore does the queen look coldly on me know thou if in ought i have offended  lycea things of mightiest import at present fill her mind nor leave they room for less affairs my duty calls me hence  exit ilyssus i hope it is no more yet each appearance alarms me now aletes thou have raised such conflicts here such hopes such fears such doubts that apprehension sinks beneath their weight well might thou say these solitary shades have now no peace for me yet once thou taughtst me that the pure mind was its own source of peace but that philosophy i find belongs to private life for where ambition enters i feel it is not true  exit the end of the second act act iii the vestibule of the temple aletes alone why should i doubt it will it must succeed yet i could wish that i had seen creusa before twas undertaken for perhaps  it is better as it is her part had then been difficult to act now what she does assisting or opposing the design will all seem natural  the pythia sure will act as i directed  hark the rites should be ere this performed why stay they then  that noise proclaims them finished and the crowd will soon be here  they come i must not yet be seen the pythia in the laurel grove may tell me what has passed  exit creusa descends hastily from the temple in great disorder lycea following lycea stay mighty queen you know not what you do your rage transports you you leave the rites unfinished and the crowd in wild amazement gaze on your departure  creusa i will not stay nor will i tamely bear my disappointed hopes o honest phorbas o good old man thy penetrating mind saw early their designs it is to supply nicanders loss o never to be supplied that we must call in strangers to the throne and yield our scepters to aeolian hands  yes ye great shades of my progenitors i hear ye call ye shall ye shall have vengeance  lycea whatever you design conceal at least this transport of your rage  creusa why loiters phorbas he saw my anguish wherefore comes he not to its relief they fool me past endurance rely they on the weakness of my sex lycea they shall find this feeble arm in such a cause can lay the distaff by and grasp the unerring thunderbolt of jove o phorbas art thou come  enter phorbas from the temple phorbas now mighty queen are my suspicions just is phorbas honest  creusa as light as truth itself my counselor my bosom friend  phorbas now shall a casual likeness if such there be a semblant cast of features the sport of nature in a human form shall trisles light as these weigh down conviction o queen from first to last the apparent scheme glares on us now why were we brought to delphi but that this youth has long been nurtured here in secret from the world perhaps the son of xuthus self placed here at first to hide the guilt and shame of some dishonest mother though now applied to more pernicious ends  creusa it may be so  phorbas and why say why today while xuthus stays behind for oracles he wanted not is young ilyssus bid to meet your eyes and win with artful tales your easy heart  creusa bid was he bid to do it  phorbas i saw the priestess whisper something to him then loud she bade him wait for thy approach she must forsooth retire to sacred glooms and wait for inspiration xuthus gold was what inspired the traitress yet good heaven when from the shrine she gave the fraudful words with what strange art the holy hypocrite in mimic trances died  a banished youth is athens cause of woe too truly said though for a wicked purpose to allure thy easy faith and lead thee to admit the fraud which followed  creusa never never phorbas will i that fraud admit how readily did xuthus when my foolish fondness asked it consent to my request to lycoa thou heardst him say we should adopt this youth in seeming sport he spoke it but even then the insulting tyrant couched fatal truths beneath the ambiguous phrase  phorbas why should a youth designed for solitude be taught the arts of war he saw himself the impropriety who is this sage that has instructed him and why should lycon overflow with sudden joy but that he found from thy apparent fondness for the boy their schemes grew practicable nay today when to the priestess self my honest love for athens and dislike of stranger kings burst freely forth she chid my hasty zeal commended xuthus talked of piety and reverence to the gods twas to their priests she meant their meddling priests who dare presume to sport with thrones to sell their gods for gold and stamp rank falsehoods with the seal of heaven  lycea forbear you are too loud so near the temple xuthus himself will hear  creusa we would be heard instruct me phorbas by what means to crush this impious combination  phorbas athens yet has honest hearts yes phorbas yet has friends who dare be patriots and prefer their country to xuthus kindest smile some such are here even now at delphi but illustrious queen we must with caution act the name of heaven however usurped adds vigor to their cause and weakens ours we might in secret find a sure revenge  creusa what  phorbas death  creusa of xuthus  phorbas his might follow but the more immediate cause should earliest be removed the boy  creusa the boy why should he die believe me honest phorbas he knows not of the fraud his every look proclaims his innocence if impious men make him their instrument of evil deeds can he be blamed bred up in shades poor youth he never knew the arts of base mankind nor should he share their punishment  phorbas o queen they have too well succeeded this fond passion which their insidious cunning first inspired clings close about your heart and may at last undo us all  but hark that noise declares the finished rites retire we to the grove and there will i enforce   creusa no let us stay i will confront this artful politician and show him i am yet a queen  phorbas perhaps twere better to retire till our full scheme were ripe for vengeance   aside yet if we remain high words must rise which will alarm her pride and fit her for my purpose  enter xuthus ilyssus priests virgins guards etc from the temple xuthus  coming up to creusa thy looks creusa thy abrupt departure affronting to the god himself and these his sacred ministers too plainly show irreverent rage resisting heavens high will nor do thou want i see unthinking woman inflamers of thy folly  but of this enough behold the youth whom heaven designs thy heir and mine  creusa my heir  xuthus thy heir creusa what means that haughty look why with contempt do thou behold him is he changed creusa have a few hours so totally transformed him is all that winning grace of which thou spakst almost with rapture is that native charm of innocence all vanished hear him speak hear if he talks less sensibly than when thy pleased attention hung upon his words and lent each syllable an added grace what have thou found or thy grave monitor what has he found which can so suddenly have wrought this wondrous change is it because the gods have thought with thee that he deserves a crown or is it that my will consents and therefore thine proud queen perversely strives to combat thy affections  creusa we methinks have changed affections the calm steady xuthus whose equal mind never knew the stormy gusts of discomposing passion now can feel indecent warmth when touched by pious zeal nay he to whom the tendrer sentiments seemed but the weakness of the human frame now wakes inspired with some unusual softness have oracles the power to raise at once the kind affections or did he conceal the smothered flame till authorized by heaven it might burst out unquestioned  xuthus haughty queen i understand thee well thou think this youth a substitute of mine and dare affront yon awful shrine the fountain of pure truth but by that god who bears the vengeful bow and whose large eye  yet wherefore should i strive by oaths to undeceive thee breasts like mine can scorn the imputed falsehood they detest nor am i now to learn from what vile source thy vain suspicions rise but know proud queen this youth shall reign in athens and yet more to punish thy vain pride since thou provokst it i do believe him of aeolian race  creusa thou do  xuthus i do a race as glorious queen as cecrops boasted lineage for the youth were i to beg the choicest boon of heaven from my own loins to rise i could not hope a nobler offspring  phorbas aside to creusa hearst thou that  creusa i do and will revenge the insult  ilyssus kneeling gracious queen what have i done which should estrange thee to me am i the unhappy cause of these dissentions  creusa kneel not to me ilyssus  xuthus kneel not to her it is i am thy protector and thy friend nay now thy father  ilyssus yet o mighty king permit me at her royal feet to pay my humblest duty if i call thee father she sure must be a mother  she turns away disordered xuthus rise ilyssus thou see she stands unmoved  ilyssus no now she softens i see it in her eyes  creusa i will i will be mistress of my soul  why kneelst thou youth i blame not thee  xuthus men then thou blamst creusa i am the object of thy rage it is xuthus thou think unworthy of the athenian throne  creusa athens might well have spared a foreign luster secure of fame had xuthus never been born  xuthus ungrateful queen had xuthus never been born what now had athens been  creusa perhaps in ruins and better so than to become the prey of needy wandering strangers  xuthus earth and heaven this the return  i knew thou never lovedst me yet witness heaven i ravished not thy hand thou gavdst it sullenly but yet thou gavdst it and i well hoped thy female sense of honor of duty to thy lord might have secured at least my future peace thy tendrer thoughts the wifes best ornament i knew were buried in a plebeian grave  creusa plebeian grave  xuthus fool that i was i flattered thy vain sorrows indulged their weak excess and raised i find imaginary rivals in the tomb but never more creusa never more shall thou affront my illrequited fondness i will destroy that pageant of thy passion tear from that idol shrine the insulting wreaths and cancel thy mock worship  ilyssus gracious queen retire a while  creusa be gone  insulting tyrant touch but a wreath that is sacred to nicander and by pale hecates awful rites i swear thy life shall pay the forfeit nay the lives of thy whole dastard race  plebeian grave had that plebeian lived imperial xuthus had crouchd beneath his feet  xuthus o would to heaven this sceptered arm could raise him from the earth that thou might see how infamous a slave thou dare prefer to xuthus  come ilyssus we leave her to her follies look not on her she merits not thy tenderness away if reason should again resume its seat we may expect her at the banquet come all here must be our guests  exeunt xuthus ilyssus etc creusa phorbas and lycea stay phorbas curb not thy passion give it vent great queen and let it burst in thunder on thy foes  creusa it shall by heaven it shall  i thought till now my griefs were sacred but this monster dares insult even misery itself  o phorbas forgive me if my tears will force a passage  now they are gone and i will weep no more come faithful counselor of vengeance come instruct me how to act steel all my soul let not remorse or pitys coward voice the bane of noble deeds intrude to cross us nicanders injured ghost shall aid our counsels say shall he die  phorbas not yet first be his schemes abortive all his politic designs then let him die despised  creusa agreed but how  phorbas now at the banquet may we crush at once his full blown hopes the fatal cause removed the effect of course must cease  creusa what cause  phorbas the boy i see thou shudderst at it but great queen hear but the cogent reasons i shall offer and thou will think as i do for the boy heaven knows i wish to spare him but no means no earthly means but this can curse completely this politic designer doubtless long this favorite scheme to place on athens throne his hated race has labored in his breast and all his hours employed on this alone he builds the firm foundation of his peace his happiness to come his death were nothing he knows his friends the minions of his fortune he knows all greece such is their dread and awe of delphis shrine will join in the support of this deceitful claim and that firm hope will make him triumph even in death and laugh at our too shallow vengeance  creusa laugh he shall not no i will punish home  phorbas you cannot punish by any means but this and know great queen i have a poison of such subtle force why do thou start of such amazing strength yet so peculiar in its operation that it shall seem the surfeit of the feast not we have done the deed at least shall seem so to all but xuthus self for he methinks should know the truth at least suspect it strongly and yet not dare revenge  creusa i cannot bear it however we fail in our revenge my phorbas the boy must live  phorbas good heaven is this creusa is this the vengeful queen who would not hear remorse or pitys voice  farewell then athens yes my poor country thou must sink enslaved to foreign tyrants she who should defend thy rights thy liberties stands tamely by and sees the yoke imposed nay smiles to see it thy queen the last of her illustrious line consents to thy destruction  creusa never phorbas do what thou will with this last parting pang i give him to thy rage  yet oh beware i see him not again one look from him would baffle all thy schemes  phorbas now at the banquet will we infuse the draught even in the cup which the kings self presents to his young heir in token of election  creusa stay good phorbas  phorbas already have i for the just design suborned a faithful slave nay should it fail i have a trusty band a chosen few athenian souls who scorn to bow the knee to any foreign lord these will i place at the pavilion doors if need require to second our attempt  creusa yet stay good pherbas how kindly did he seem to sympathize with my distress nay almost chid the king when his loud rage   phorbas he had been taught his lesson twas all design all artifice to work upon a womans weakness  creusa think thou so  phorbas i do but o my queen be more than woman conquer this foible of thy sex  creusa heaven knows how much it costs to do it  go then phorbas i cannot bid thee prosper  exit phorbas o lycea thou know not what i feel  haste call him back  no stay  i think the bitterness is past and i can bear it now lend me thy arm i would retire lycea  yet from what should i retire i cannot from myself  o boy thou art revenged whatever thou sufferst is light to what thy murdress feels  exeunt the end of the third act act iv the laurel grove phorbas and athenians phorbas this way my friends at the pavilion doors stand ready armed that if we need your aid you may observe the sign and crush at once these vile usurpers on the rights of athens i hope we want ye not  i must be hid a while lest xuthus should suspect my presence the queen too may repent i will therefore shun her aside till the deeds done irrevocably done aside  but stir not till i come  what noise is that retire my friends the temples postern door grates on its hinge  be secret and we prosper  exeunt severally enter aletes and pythia aletes this quarrel was unlucky a slight breach had lent my purpose strength but wrought thus high it may defeat our hopes she cannot now with ease recede from her too rash resolves at least not unsuspected did she say thou reject thy message  pythia scarcely did she pay the decent dues my sacred office claims and when i pressed her more with sullen pride she silently withdrew  aletes see her i must where went she  pythia to the shades which overhang the aonian fount  aletes i will pursue her thither  pythia it may not be for now i know thy secret it is my turn to be prudent know thou not thou should be cautious nor expose thyself to prying eyes i heard her as she passed in broken whispers bid lycea haste to phorbas and inform that trusty friend that she would wait him in the laurel grove here then thou may surprise them both and crown at once thy whole design  aletes thou counsellst well and i will guide me by thy kind advice o pythia how did every thing conspire to give me hopes that i should place the boy secure on athens throne unknown to all but those whom fate had made his firmest friends the very means i used to make it sure have been most adverse to the cause i labored had i relied on xuthus piety nor mentioned aeolus success were mine and let me hope it still what most i fear is the queens warmth of passion to which end i must proceed with tenderness and hide for some short time ilyssus from her knowledge i have unnumberd cautions to premise which her overflowing joy may happily ruin the banquet is it ready  pythia it has long in vain expected its illustrious guests the king already has forgot his rage and hopes returning thought may move the queen to equal amity he therefore finds continual causes to delay the feast  aletes retire perhaps it is she i hear the steps of some who move this way exit pythia what means he here why art thou absent from the banquet youth  enter ilyssus ilyssus it has no joys for me i fear aletes thou and the pythia have most foully played for my advancement  aletes ha  ilyssus where are the parents whom thou did promise to my hopes alas i find no parents here no kind regards no inexpressive fondness stern debate and foul dissension kindle here their torch to usher in my greatness even creusa whose tenderness i know not how alarmed my throbbing heart with hopes and doubts and fears unfelt before even she has taught her eyes to look with strangeness on me the good king who yet withdraws not his protection from me seems lost in anxious thought  unkind aletes art thou the cause of this say am i sprung of race aeolian for by heaven i swear by that pure fountain of immortal truth i will not brook deceit i will again however the glittering mischief tempt my youth become that humble unknown thing i was rather than wear a crown by falsehood gained speak then and give me ease  aletes my dearest boy  his virtue charms me though it may prevent aside his own success o happy happy athens aside to gain a king like him whose honest soul aside starts at imagined fraud aside  ilyssus speak on aletes and do not by that look of tenderness and murmuring to thyself alarm me more  aletes what should i speak this very morn ilyssus this very morn i told thee a few hours would show thee what thou were but thy impatience brooks not that short delay it seems aletes has lost his usual credit with ilyssus even with the youth his anxious care has formed think thou the man who taught thy feeling heart to start at falsehood would himself commit the fraud thou shudderst at what have i done which should induce thee to a thought so base did ever my precepts contradict my heart did i ever teach a virtue i not practiced  i see thou art confounded know then youth i blame not thy impatience nay i praise that modesty which can so soon resume its seat when all things round are big with wonder ere night thou shall know all till then ilyssus behave as athens king  ilyssus o good aletes forgive my rashness yes i know thee honest as truth itself and know the wondrous debt i owe thy goodness yet if thou confess that i have reason for these anxious cares thou will permit me still to question thee nay look upon me whilst i speak to thee perhaps thou have some secret cause aletes for all that kind attention thou have shown me from infancy till now why do thou turn thy eyes to earth it is plain thou have a cause thou know from whom i spring how can thou else with confidence assert that yet ere night i shall know all  say this at least aletes shall the queens anger cease  aletes it shall ilyssus even now i wait her here on what design i must not yet inform thee the next time thou shall behold her thou will find a change incredible indeed from rage to fondness from cold reserve to tears of bursting joy  ilyssus is going to speak eagerly  ask me no more  yet something did thou say relating to the cause which fixed me here thy guardian thy instructor and  the time will come when thou shall know it all ilyssus and bless my memory  ilyssus thou weepst aletes my tears will mingle too  aletes forbear and leave me yet stay a while for now perhaps we part to meet no more  ilyssus no more thou will not leave me when most i want thy care twas my first thought twas the first boon i asked of the good king that thou might be my kind instructor still he praised my gratitude and i had promised to bring him to thy cottage he himself shall be a suitor to thee  aletes thou have asked thou know not what it cannot be ilyssus that xuthus and aletes ever should meet on terms of amity the smiles of greatness to me have lost their value for thy love i could do much and to be severed from thee pulls at my heart strings but resistless fate has fixed its seal and we must part for ever how hard soever it seem thy youth will soon amidst the busy scenes of active greatness forget its monitor but i must bear in hopeless solitude the pangs of absence till thought shall be no more  ilyssus o heavenly powers then there is something dreadful yet concealed i cannot part from thee in ignorance tell me aletes  aletes would i could but now it must not be  haste to the banquet youth thy duty calls thee thither  ilyssus go i cannot till thou assurst me we shall meet again  aletes if possible we will if not remember when thou shall know thyself that on thyself thy fate depends that virtue glory happiness are close connected and their sad reverse is vice is pain is infamy  alas these were the lessons of thy private life this i have told thee often but my fond tongue runs over its former precepts and forgets thou now must mount a throne a larger scene of duty opens  ilyssus yet the tender friend who should direct me leaves me to myself can thou abandon me  aletes would fate permit i would attend thee still but oh ilyssus whatever becomes of me when thou shall reach that envied pinnacle of earthly greatness where faithful monitors but rarely follow even there amidst the kindest smiles of fortune forget not thou were once distressed and friendless be strictly just but yet like heaven with mercy temper thy justice from thy purged ear banish base flattery and spurn the wretch who would persuade thee thou art more than man weak erring selfish man endued with power to be the minister of public good if conquest charm thee and the pride of war blaze on thy sight remember thou art placed the guardian of mankind nor build thy fame on rapines and on murders should soft peace invite to luxury the pleasing bane of happy kingdoms know from thy example the bliss or woe of nameless millions springs their virtue or their vice nor think by laws to curb licentious man those laws alone can bend the headstrong many to their yoke which make it present interest to obey them o boy   enter pythia hastily pythia ilyssus wherefore art thou here the king expects thee and the banquet waits  ilyssus i cannot go  aletes thou must thy fate depends upon thy absence now the queen approaches after the banquet i again will see thee and thou shall know the whole i will by heaven exit ilyssus pythia away and wait me in the temple exit pythia she saw them not on her contracted brow sits brooding care she speaks my heart beats thick and my tongue trembles to perform its office now fate attend and perfect thine own work  enter creusa creusa to what have i consented  ha who art thou that thus intrudst on sacred privacy when the oerburthend mind unloads its griefs its hoarded miseries  aletes thy better genius  creusa that voice is sure familiar to my ear who art thou speak  aletes one whom adversity has taught to know himself i bring thee tidings of an unhappy man who wronged thee much but much repented of the wrongs he did thee of thy nicander queen  creusa nicander say thou o then thou art indeed my better genius  aletes now arm thy soul for wonders yet to come perhaps he lives  creusa he lives  looking on him with amazement aletes after great irresolution and struggles with himself behold him here she faints  what has my rashness done  the blush of life has left her cheek the pulse forgets to move where shall i turn i cannot call for aid nor can i leave her thus  she breathes she stirs  yes yes creusa thy nicander lives and he will catch at least this dear embrace though now thou art anothers  creusa gracious gods it is it is nicander it is my lord o i am only thine no power on earth shall ever divide us more  it cannot be my senses all deceive me  and yet it is  o let me gaze upon thee recall each trace which marks thee for my own and gives me back the image of my heart how time and grief have changed thee but my love can know no change my lord my life my husband where have thou wandered how have thou been hid from loves allpiercing sight the bloody ruffians how did thou scape their rage or did they wreak upon the helpless innocent alone their impious vengeance  nicander nor on me nor him did vengeance fall  creusa does he too live  nicander he does  creusa aside o honest phorbas murder now is virtue  nicander the fabled murder was all stratagem contrived for thy dear sake no impious ruffians pursued our steps i found that i had wronged thee beyond redress nor knew another means but by my death to save thee from dishonor despair i thought might conquer love and thou once more be athens pride the precious charge forbad a real death i therefore stained with blood my wellknown garments which produced   creusa a curstd effect  but i have nearer fears how came thou hither wherefore to these shades the boy where is he  nicander far from hence   creusa thank heaven  nicander he lives in peace and safety  what disturbs thee  creusa nothing  i dare not tell him what i feared his honest breast might shudder at the guilt though now it be more needful  the dear boy say is he brave  nicander as woman could desire  creusa and formed like thee  nicander his person far exceeds what my most vigorous youth could boast creusa and his firm mind is wisdoms aged strength with all youths graces softened  creusa it is too much o happy mother callst thou him nicander  nicander no ion twas the name the matron chose who gave him to my care  creusa then ion be it ion shall reign in athens know thou love the cursed design which this aeolian here and the vile maid   nicander the priestess it should seem with xuthus has conspired to fix his race on athens throne  creusa but never shall his race that scepter wield  nicander it never shall creusa i have a means   creusa aside my means thank heaven is surer  nicander but i will tell thee all from first to last hear then and weigh my words for fate is in them xuthus the athenian king   creusa i think not of him  nicander beware of that whatever thou think creusa xuthus must still reign on thy lord and husband  creusa xuthus my lord then what art thou nicander do thou despise me for a crime thyself have forced me to commit my soul was thine even when i gave my hand and still remains untainted undefiled  nicander i know it well thou dearest best of women  my torn heart drops blood while i propose it yet we must we must for ever part  forbear creusa that killing look strikes through me  think o think what in this age of absence i have borne how combated each tender thought and lived for thy dear sake a victim to despair but now if thou consentst all all is mine and i forgive my fate  the dear dear boy i have a means to place him on the throne secure as we could wish  creusa secure he shall be i will proclaim him to the world as mine and athens shall with joy receive its sovereign the tyrant xuthus shall be taught to fear a masters frown  nicander thy rashness my creusa may ruin all  creusa i will be rash if this be rashness to declare to earth to heaven a mothers heartfelt joy whose only child snatched from the grave unhopd for comes to claim with every grace and every virtue crowned the imperial seat of his great ancestors and shall we wait a means  nicander we need not wait for by my care the important means is found already and no human power but thine can hinder our success i would have hid the secret from thee till thy wished consent had given my purpose strength but thou defeatst my utmost caution and wilt force me tell thee ilyssus is young ion  ha creusa thou art not mad good heaven how her eye fixes what have i done what said which could attack the seats of sense with this amazing force my wife my

at my return creusas self despair was in her eyes with hasty steps she shot impatie by me nor listened when i spoke i followed wondering and entered the pavilion  phorbas the pavilion why went she to the banquet  lycea eager went despair and anguish mixing on her look but o good heaven how changed was that despair to inexpressive joy when from the crowd she learnt ilyssus had delayed the feast and won the king once more to ask her presence where is he let me clasp him to my breast she cried i now no longer will resist heavens high command imperial xuthus rose with transport to receive her and loud shouts proclaimed the peoples joy when death to sight eternal pain to memory the slave presents the goblets fill she cried a third i too will hail ilyssus king of athens but first all swear swear by immortal jove by the fardarting god who here presides and the chaste guardian of our native fanes swear here swear all and binding be the oath ilyssus only shall be athens king  phorbas what could she mean  lycea attentive xuthus caught with joy the happy omen and all swore ilyssus only should be athens king this done i saw her from ilyssus hand snatch the dire goblet and to him resign her own untouched the slave who mixed the draught turned oale and trembled i with eager zeal pressed forward but in vain she firmly grasped the bowl and smiling drank it to the dregs  phorbas the poison ha  i knew her foolish fondness would start at murders name but wherefore die why turn upon herself her impious rage twas madness all or else some new contrivance some fresh aeolian fraud  i care not what i yet will blast their schemes  yes let her die by her own folly perish athens still survives and shall survive  i must be sudden she doubtless will betray me to the king and cut off even this last resource lycea be secret and thy country shall be free  lycea were it not better phorbas first to see her perhaps some secret unreveald may lurk beneath this show of unexampled rashness she left the banquet soon and with the pythia entered the temple  phorbas with the pythia say thou then there is mischief toward  lycea yet now alone we may surprise her for i saw the maid quick from the fane return with hasty steps as if dispatched on some important message perhaps to find thee out sure thou should see her  phorbas and perish ha  no no my sacred country too much already have i been deceived i will not leave thee in a womans power  yet hold lycea may inform her of them and my designs prove yet abortive maid thy presence may be needful  lycea mine good heaven in what creusa will require my aid at least my tears are due to my poor queen in her last moments  phorbas stay she wants them not i know the poisons force too well lycea to fear a death so sudden this way maid nay thou must go i shall have business for thee some secret message to the queen lycea which thou alone can bear  exeunt enter pythia and nicander pythia twas he i saw him and lycea with him sure he should be informed  thou hearst me not  nicander this action of the queen sits near my heart  pythia she bade me tell thee  but why waste we time thou now may enter at the postern gate unseen by all  nicander why did thou not rush in and stop the feast thy speedy presence there had saved us all  pythia what could i do the queen was there already and all seemed peace and joy could i suspect that poison lurked beneath so fair a seeming  nicander she breaks through my designs  unhappy woman my soul bleeds for her and confusion hangs on every rising thought  the dear dear boy  where is he at the banquet still  pythia he is  nicander and where creusa  pythia i already told thee but thou regardst not in the temples gloom retired she sits expecting thy approach we there may settle all  nicander i fear her much thou see her passions are too near concerned to be of use to us thy cooler sense must here direct us does the poisons power affect her yet  pythia not yet i would have tried some powerful antidote to quell its force but she refuses life and only begs to see her son and thee  nicander i will attend upon the instant but first hear me pythia thou see on what a precipice we stand it were in vain to hope we could conceal the truth from xuthus from the rest we may it is thy task therefore   pythias what to own the fraud and publish to the king that delphis shrine is not oracular ha  nicander to the king twere better sure to publish the deceit than to the world and where is the means but this to hide it by creusas art thou say he is already bound in solemn oaths to leave ilyssus heir to athens throne can thou not add still stronger oaths or ere thou do reveal the secret of our fate then who shall dare to break them shall the king thou know his scruplous piety extends almost to weakness what should tempt him to it creusa dead can frame no schemes against him the boy to him alone must owe his greatness and for nicander never more shall greece hear his forgotten name  pythia it must be so and yet   nicander what yet to phorbas thou with ease may own the truth he will not start at fraud in sacred things  but see the queen approaches impatient of our stay she changes not the bloom of health is still upon her cheek fain would i hope  but hopes alas are vain  what have thou done creusa  creusa entering saved ilyssus  nicander thou might have lived with honor  creusa lived good heaven i start i tremble at the thoughts of life can thou reflect on what i had designed on what i am on what alas i have been and not perceive death was my only refuge  am i not xuthus wife and what art thou o had thou seen the torments of my soul when in one hasty moment it ran over the business of an age weighed all events saw xuthus thee ilyssus athens bleed in one promiscuous carnage  light at length burst through the gloom and heavens own voice proclaimed one victim might suffice  for xuthus honor strove and mightier love assumed nicanders cause who then could fall could xuthus could nicander  no creusa  nicander would thou had been less kind  but o my queen to blame thee now were vain   creusa to blame it is praise it is triumph i demand he lives he reigns young ion lives young ion reigns in athens o bring him pythia bring him to my arms let me but pour a last sad blessing over him and death has lost its terrors how now lycea  enter lycea hastily lycea mighty queen i know not if thy command would authorize the attempt but phorbas with an armed athenian band now enters the pavilion to destroy the king and young ilyssus  nicander earth and heaven what say thou maid  creusa o let me fly to save him here shall their poinards   nicander rest thou there creusa thy embaffies today have proved too fatal my life for his i save him from the stroke and on the instant send him to thy arms now fate be doubly mine  exit creusa off let me go i will not be restrained they tear him piecemeal  pythia patience mighty queen what man can do nicander will perform  creusa he is a father only to my child he cannot tell them what a mother feels  phorbas was born the curse of me and mine i might have known to what his impious rage would urge him on and should have first informed him  gods must i never know sweet peace again not even in death have rest  pythia behold who comes to bless thee ere thou die and cease to murmur at heavens high will  enter ilyssus creusa it is it is ilyssus  my son my son  ilyssus good heavens and do i live to see a parent melt in fondness over me  aletes saved me from the soldiers arms and bade me fly to find a mother here art thou indeed that mother mighty queen and may i call thee so thou art thy looks thy tears thy kind embrace all all proclaim the truth  o let me thus thus on my knees   creusa rise rise my child i am i am thy mother  ilyssus o sacred sound ilyssus is no more that outcast youth a mother and a queen he finds at once  creusa but art thou safe my child have thou no wound  ilyssus the old greyheaded man who brought this morn the news of thy arrival had raised against my breast his eager sword defenseless i when good aletes came and snatched me from the stroke i would have staid unarmed with him have staid but his command was absolute that i should fly to find what i have found a mother embracing her yet o queen why am i thus encompassed round with wonder may i not know this riddle of my fate why first condemned to pass my infant days in this obscure retreat if i am thine thy son illustrious queen sure i was born to thrones and empires  creusa thou art born to thrones and shall in athens reign  ilyssus as xuthus heir is xuthus then my sire forgive me queen i have a thousand and a thousand doubts can xuthus be my sire  pythia forbear ilyssus nor press thy fate too far when time permits thou shall know all  creusa shall know it now ilyssus not xuthus is thy sire but that brave man who but this instant snatched thee from thy fate and by that act proclaimed himself a father  ilyssus aletes  creusa not aletes but nicander my wedded lord thy sire  and see he comes to bless thee and confirm the sacred truth  good heaven he bleeds  enter nicander nicander to death to death creusa amid the fray i met the fate i sought for all else is safe and xuthus now pursues a scattered few who fall beneath his sword  where is my boy  ye guards of innocence how has he been beset and how escaped  where is my boy for i may own him now and clasp him to my breast no more aletes the sage instructor of a youth unknown but the dear father weeping over his child  ilyssus o sir what gratitude before inspired let duty pay  nicander i have no time to waste in fondness now hear my last words ilyssus and bind them to thy heart thou still must live the son of xuthus the good pythia here will tell thee all the story of thy fate and may thou prosper as thou do obey her sacred counsel xuthus too must know the fatal tale but to the world beside it must be hid in darkness  pythia phorbas sure should be informed  nicander phorbas has breathed his last and the bribed slave who mixed the poisonous draught fell by this hand  ilyssus o farewell i will not bid adieu to thee creusa thy color changes and the lamp of life fades in thy eye we soon shall meet again  ilyssus oh   ilyssus how hard he grasps my hand my lord my father have i learned so late to call thee by that name and must i lose for ever lose  good heaven she grasps me too what means it pythia the cold damps of death are on her  creusa o my child enquire no farther it is fitting we should part lycea pythia entreat of xuthus  yet i need not fear his goodness though i wronged him foully wronged him he yet will prove a father to my child and from the world conceal the fatal truth o i am cold  what bolts of ice shoot through me how my limbs shiver  nearer yet my child my sight grows dim and i could wish to gaze for ever on thee  oh it will not be  even thou art lost ilyssus  oh  farewell  dies ilyssus she dies she dies was i then only mocked with a vain dream of bliss to be plunged back in deeper misery did i but hear the tender name of child breathed fondly over me to make me feel what it is to lose that name o i am ten times more an orphan now than when i knew no parents  enter xuthus etc xuthus where is this murdress who with vile deceit seemed to consent to ours and heavens designs only to make us a more easy prey to her assassins  ha creusa dead and the brave stranger who preserved us all is he too dead  the boy   pythia ilyssus lives and thou have sworn great king that he shall reign supreme in athens say do thou confirm that oath  xuthus i do by heaven  pythia ask here no more the fatal tale is for thy private ear retire and learn it all for poor creusa she wronged not thee upon herself alone she drew heavens vengeance and too surely proves that murder but intentional not wrought to horrid act before the eternal throne stands forth the first of crimes who dare assume unwarranted heavens high prerogative oer life and death with double force shall find turned on themselves the mischiefs they designed  the end of the fifth act epilogue spoken by miss haughton who acted the pythia at length i am freed from tragical parade no more a pythian priestess  though a maid at once resigning with my sacred dwelling my wreaths my wand my arts of fortunetelling yet superstitious folks no doubt are here who still regard me with a kind of fear lest to their secret thoughts these prying eyes should boldly pass and take them by surprise nay though i disavow the whole deceit and fairly own my science all a cheat should i declare in spite of ears and eyes the beaus were handsome or the critics wise they would all believe it and with dear delight say to themselves at least the girl has taste the womans in the right or should i tell the ladies so disposed they would get good matches ere the season closed they would smile perhaps with seeming discontent and sneering wonder what the creature meant but whisper to their friends with beating heart suppose there should be something in her art grave statesmen too would chuckle should i say on such a motion and by such a day they would be summoned from their own affairs to tend the nations more important cares well if i must  however i dread the load i will undergo it  for my countrys good all men are bubbles in a skilful hand the ruling passion is the conjurers wand whether we praise foretell persuade advise it is that alone confirms us fools or wise the devil without may spread the tempting sin but the sure conqueror is  the devil within  a second epilogue spoken by mrs pritchard stay ladies  though i am almost tired to death with this long part  and am so out of breath  yet such a lucky thought kind heaven has sent that

well force them to obey unless we let them when their spirits flag piddle with us ye know at quinze and brag i hope my dearest says some wellbred spouse when such a bill shall come before your house that you will consider men are men  at least that you will not speak my dear  not speak  the beast what would you wound my honor  wrongs like these  for this sir i shall bring you on your knees  or if
