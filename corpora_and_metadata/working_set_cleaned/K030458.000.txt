non defict alter     almeyda queen of granada  a tragedy in five acts  by sophia lee  as performed at the theater royal drury lane  he chose a mournful muse soft pity to infuse  dryden dublin printed by brett smith for messrs p wogan p byrne c brown and g folingsby        to mrs siddons dear madam the high admiration i ever felt for the superior talents you have so eminently displayed in almeyda could alone have induced me to venture a second dramatick production to that admiration a more intimate knowledge of you has added an esteem which is i flatter myself reciprocal not all the various charms you dignify the drama with can equal those of your sympathizing mind and unassuming manners  when thus united they form a character it would be vanity to praise though virtue to delight in with true gratitude  i remain dear madam your faithfully devoted humble servant sophia lee june        advertisement it was with no less awe than deference i ventured in the present day to bring a tragedy before the public how great then must be my gratitude for the liberal acceptance it has met and the tears with which it has been honored i must have wanted taste and feeling not to have been animated by the exquisite talents of mrs siddons into an exertion of such as i possess that i have been the means of displaying in a new point of view her various powers is a most flattering recompense  the story of almeyda is wholly a fiction and the incident which produces the catastrophe the only one not my own  the deep impression made on me long since by a similar denouement in an old play of james shirleys determined me to apply it  the stage requires a compression and brevity which seldom improves a play to the reader i have therefore printed almeyda at length marking by inverted commas the parts omitted in representation  prologue the muses long through many a varying age with truth and fiction mixed have graced the stage when weeping constancy devoted stood or patriot honor sealed his faith with blood they bade the deeptoned lyre responsive flow sublimed the suffering and diffused the woe applauding greece the numbers loved to hear and her stern warriors gave the graceful tear at length her venal train corruption led and with the virtues linked the muses fled over albions happy land they paused awhile and shed the favoring influence of their smile her henrys hotspurs trod the martial scene and sird to heroes whom they found but men bold shakespeare poured the invigorating strain and row and sweeter otway filled the train what if the modern bard no more aspire to rival otways sweetness shakespeares fire what if no laurel meed his altar claim his censer boast no heavnenkindled flame yet if beneath the smouldring vapor shine but one faint glimmering of the spark divine ah gently fan the flame lest fashions breath over the pale promise send the blast of death nor let the wreath thalia only wear her sister muse deserves so well to share it is here is the generous feeling to impart that mends the morals while it fills the heart here is are the energies that best inform the sighs that animate and tears that warm within the magic sunshine of her eye truth honor loyalty and valor lie all the lord virtues that our sires approved and all that britons boast or britons loved  thn against the charm no more your bosom steel but own the manly privilege to feel olly and vice may often in smiles appear but bashful virtue veils her in a tear the bread loud laugh the mirthinspiring jest humours wild frolic and gay fancys feast like brilliant bubbles sparkle over the mind but burst and leave no radiant gleam behind while the bright pencil of the tragic muse her sacred rainbow draws over chilling dews and though to air the transient glories run they give the promise of a golden sun  the prologue and epilogue were written by miss harriet lee characters ramirez king of castile mr aickin abdallah regent of granada mr palmer alonzo son of ramirez mr kemble orasmyn son of abdallah and general of the moors mr wroughton hamet captain of the moorish guard mr c kemble nourassin a lord of the council mr caulfield officers guards etc almeyda queen of granada mrs siddons victoria princess of castile mrs powel abra sister to hamet and attending on the queen miss heard scene  a moorish castle on a bold rock which overhangs the guadalquiver  time from the dawning of one morning to the dawning of the next  almeyda a tragedy act i scene i a hall in the castle of moorish architecture with window of painted glass in the recesses of the arches low sofas are placed with cushions piled on one of these victoria slumbers while ramirez walks in the hall making notes in his tablets bright fleecy clouds rise behind the painted glass representing the dawn of day ramirez remove those lights  the day once more returns and nature springs into renewed existence collects the fragrance breathing over her bosom and offers up the incense to the morn slow over the mazes of the guadalquiver curl the soft mists that quicken every odor  all animated beings gladly rise to their diurnal task  man only man that froward favorite of indulgent heaven drops from his weary eye the ungrateful tear to blight the coming blessing  dear victoria thy watching has oerpowerd thee  soft my child like this be all thy slumbers  victoria have i slept i pray you pardon the unconscious fault and bless to me the morn half kneeling  ramirez may each to come breathe only peace upon thee and restore those roses with ring on the shrine of friendship  victoria alas my father bless too my almeyda that soitary sovereign born to weep the greatness thousands covet through the night sleepless and tearful she has still entreated that i would win you ever to retain her a moor in name alone granadas throne charms not her heart  possessed and alienate  ramirez i cannot choose but blame even thee my child if thou have sought to win her from her duty  victoria nay rather blame the parents who resigned her  ramirez forbear these rash conclusions  monarchs often i ust sacrifice each feeling to their duty  victoria alas that aught should break the tie of nature the ductile heart as reason dawns still takes a soft impression of the nearest object  thus did almeydas  yet an infant hostage she waked to knowledge on a foes kind bosom her lips first falterd our castilian tongue and with becoming gratitude she found in those who fondly trained her up to honor each dear each sacred tie of love and nature nor did she mourn her sires or brothers death as she does now to leave us  ramirez nor have i my daughter illdeservd this generous fondness since with my children she has shared my heart  no though to death i hate the moorish race vindictive and insatiate  though my sword even yet could flame amid my countrys foes with energy unbroken never knew i to view a tender babe with abhorrence  ah sweet almeyda in this very hall thy cries unconscious of thy fate assailed a heart alive to nature and humanity when with the error of soft innocence thy little arms clung round thy fathers foe  victoria was this the castle where almanzor chose to lodge his queen for safety  ramirez ay  and wife had proved his choice if heaven their arms had prosperd  thou see  it is solid as the rock that bears it its proud towers shadow our castilian plains though severed from them by the guadalquiver  they since have awed their owner  for that day heaven blessed the holy valor it inspired that memorable day gave to our arms an host almost unnumberd but by slain  flushed with our conquest we assailed this castle which the intimidated queen threw open and as an hostage gave us up her daughter  victoria oh mother illdeserving my almeyda  ramirez erroneous youth still takes the first impression nor looks beyond the surface be more wise learn to pierce through the veil of policy undazzled by its colors  so thy friend shall better meet the future  victoria i attend with reverence so profound each other sense is lost in hearing   ramirez know the queen thy censure condemns unheard should rather claim thy pity matched to a monarch weak vain cold of heart yet restless though inactive  her short life passed in disquiet from the hour that called her almanzors crafty brother gained the power and in the kings name sheltered every baseness two rising princes scorned their uncles sway alas perhaps too boldly  heaven alone can judge the malady that nippd their bloom  certain it is abdallah never offered a due equivlent for our royal hostage until she heird granada  victoria sweet almeyda is this the savage trusted with thy welfare  thou too perhaps art doomed by his ambition  ramirez not so my daughter  politicians ever present a puppet to the public eye while they unseen delight to guide its motions  almeyda thus is needful to her uncle who hopes to find in her a weak vain woman  victoria heaven for his punishment then formed an angel  who like almeyda ever knew to blend the eccentric noble wildness of the moor with every polished grace of our castile  ramirez she is too frank incautious and ungoverned more rude than cataracts her passions rage  victoria yet still like those profusely pour upon us rich ore for ever else beyond our reach  ramirez she must conceal those passions to be great subdue them to be happy in the mind all sovreignty begins and ends  who rules impartially the frailties of his nature rises almost beyond it and extends far as his name is known a willing empire teach thy fair friend my child this useful lesson and next thy brother   victoria ah alike he needs it  i dread the wild concussion of his passions when he shall learn you choose the very hour in which he bravely fights his countrys battles to yield the fair who gives his life a value  ramirez i therefore choose it well i know his temper is like almeydas own warm and ungoverned misjudging boy to fix thy idle heart on her forever placed beyond thy reach why saw i not in childhood this fond love which like a blight clings to my lifes best blossom  yet could my son ere hope to wed almeyda  victoria alas my father when their love commenced almeyda had two brothers and my mother still fondly fancied by this union peace might one day bless the long contesting nations  ramirez romantic dream of youth and idle passion what power can reconcile the cross and crescent  victoria frown not my father if i further add endeared to christian laws and christian manners almeyda were to both an easy convert  ramirez sternly victoria if thou would atone thy fault in cherishing this weakness join to soothe thy brothers disappointment  tell alonzo my love for him  my justice  nay my prudence constrain me to resign his hearts sole object  knows he not hardly we maintain our ground against these treacherous neighbors and must still whatever the sacrifice defend our country  no news from murcia yet  oh how i long to hear the issue of the impending battle  the rising sun gleams on the moorish helms and gives a trembling luster to yon fields  the appointed moment comes to sign the treaty i see almeyda too but dare not meet her far be it from me to offend her feelings or sacrifice my own  bid her adieu exit ramirez almeyda entering on the other side during this trying interval victoria i had prepared myself to meet the king and now with breathless fear impatient sought him ah wherefore flies he then still he relents not  thou or i greatly err have sued in vain  have sued a sovereign might remain in bonds and yield dominion for implicit duty  well then i bow disdainful to my fate  yet have a care ramirez thy proud heart may one day feel the pang that pierces mine  victoria what means my dear almeyda  almeyda ah alonzo thou will not thus resign  thou will not scorn me  amid the rage of arms  the din of battle almeydas sighs shall still be heard still felt and counteract all policy  alas  may err and even alonzo may bid the eagle glory chase the dove and see the victim flutter to the ground  alonzo leads the war and quite forgets me  victoria gentle almeyda  govern these wild transports which ever warp your judgment   almeyda do not hope it  nor venture to decide a lovers conduct   tranquil blood flows equal through thy veins like the clear rivlet through the grassy vale while mine impetuous as the bounding billows swells to my heart thence rapidly returns and in the tumult swallows up wrecked reason  had thou like me been bosomed among strangers and given thy soul in recompense for love when found thyself torn from this happy home to waste a gaudy life in cold indifference like mine thy aching sense would swell to anguish like mine in tears would drown thee  victoria yet believe alonzos love unblemished as his honor and rather praise than blame his sense of duty  almeyda why will thou shame my cheek  alas victoria had i remembred mine never had i shed these burning drops  even at this awful hour when from the grave my ancestors demand me to all the pride and power of purple empire my heart flies back to hover near my love and envies every slave who daily sees him  victoria this is alike erroneous  darling friend with steadier eye survey the past and future  so shall your mind extract repose from reason  almeyda away with eason melancholy hermit who idle eyes the storm then vainly active collects and treasures every wreck of passion  i shall have hopeless years enough for reason and give this hour to love  oh say victoria  and yet i dread to hear  is the king fixed to ratify the peace  victoria he has no choice  the rights of nations and his countrys welfare oblige him to restore you   almeyda rather say he has no heart  nor feels for my affliction   ah if the rights of nations were his rule why did he subjugate a monarchs daughter why win her easy heart by gracious treatment until secure of silent anxious duty he gave the moors a queen  himself a slave   victoria wherefore reproach my father with his virtues he conquered for his country  that loved cause induced him first to keep and now to yield you  rather admire the impartiality which ranked you with his children in his heart  perhaps even deeper motives swayed his conduct  perhaps he stood between you and an uncle who views with jealous eyes your right of empire  almeyda nay now ramirez speaks from prejudice whom should i trust if not my fathers brother  victoria in heaven and your integrity but never in this vindictive subtle savage moor  without he is as specious as the mountain whose rich fertility delights each gazer but oh volcanos rage within and gathering each noisome vapor of the oerchargd earth forth unsuspected bursts the flaming deluge felt soon as seen  even to annihilation  almeyda alas and is it thus to such a wretch must i be rendered up in ignorance to learn the science of hypocrisy  with worldly art to arrange each little sentence and preconcert each action  never more shall i enjoy the sweets of confidence or find in love a pleasure  never more shall thy harmonious voice alonzo charm me or thine dear rigid friend reproving soothe  victoria  taking her hand yet shall the vows that bound our youthful hearts remain inviolate  almeyda and shall alonzos ah no for nature here makes a distinction forms mans large heart for many a various duty and blends his passion into a republic  while woman born for love and softness only delights to feel loves absolute dominion  then tell thy brother  confused shouts heard  victoria look up dear almeyda revive and speak thy purpose  almeyda  leaning on her and fluttered tell thy brother almeyda will not bind him by one vow nor claim one sacrifice  pleased to have loved pleased to have been beloved  to that remembrance she consecrates each future throb of passion and if she dares imagine yet a joy twould be to know him blessed she might have made so  victoria my father comes  oh now my best almeyda now be yourself and dignify the moment  almeyda faintly it is not in dying we must show our courage ah no it is in the fearful preparation  enter ramirez attended health to my benefactor glorious title more dear than that of father  he but gives a vulgar being while the man who rears our virtues to existence is next heaven the worshipped of our reason  ramirez rise almeyda queen of granada rise we gladly hail thee thy kinsman comes to invest thee with dominion and give thee to an eager nations eyes  i glory thus accomplished to return thee  almeyda ah reconcile me to my fate by coldness  know all the danger of this tender flattery  ramirez in the poor word adieu i sum each wish affection ever formed in blessing virtue farewell at once  i yield thee to thy duty  call into action every latent power reign over thyself  so shall thou bless thy people  almeyda  flying toward them tear out this heart but do not do not quit me oh do not snap at once each link in life and leave me solitary in creation  ramirez afflict us not with such a vain request even now our troops evacuate the castle and thine assume each post  abdallah waits to pass one gate until i quit the other  farewell almeyda grace thy glorious fortune  almeyda sinks under the regal canopy in tears  the moorish music sounds and a long train entering do her homage and arrange on each side last comes abdallah with the diadem borne before him abdallah  doing homage fair daughter of almanzor thus his brother hails thy return to freedom and dominion  thus tenders thee thy rich inheritance and thus the formal task of duty ended clasps thee with kindred sympathising love bids those bright eyes shake off the lucid drops and beam with all their own unequalled luster  almeyda alas already he begins to flatter aside  i were not worthy of your tendered love my princely uncle could i thus forget at once the friends who reared me   abdallah  with a fierce irony friends do you call them you are too young thus nicely to distinguish give not the crafty foe such undue honor call those indeed your friends who now surround you call the fierce soldiers too your friends who spread in proud array over yonder pleasant plain  nor think him less your friend whose policy fomented the rebellion which obliged ramirez to restore you  almeyda oh my heart alonzos absence then i owe to you  aside noble abdallah be but gentle with me and i will meekly bear even reprehension  all are my friends who only wish to serve me yet let me add i hardly owe those more who give my crown than he who formed me for it  abdallah curse on his polished arts they have made thee subtle and i must deeply probe thy natures weakness ere yet thou charmst each hearer  aside fair almeyda emancipate thy soul from this fond bondage live to granada and forget castile  no more repeat with cherished latent love names we were born to hate but seek to win by partial kindness those who ever dread the empire of a woman  almeyda have i empire ah no for in the hour that ought to give it i first experience bondage stay ramirez king of castile oh hear me and return again receive  protect me bind these hands but give my heart its freedom dear victoria fix not thy tearful eyes upon these walls lest i renounce all duties and all ties to dwell with thee and friendship noble lords pardon i pray frank natures ebullition and see even virtue in the eager transport  the love i thus avow was fairly won by equal love and everlibral treatment be like castile indulgent and this heart alike will glow with gratitude to you will proudly cherish every regal virtue shut out regret for all which it resigns nor own even to itself it wants a joy while yet a duty claims it  abdallah this is reason  there spoke the royal heiress of almanzor and no castilian slave  almeyda still must i struggle  aside  abdallah why do those beauteous eyes still seek the ground oh raise them and survey the golden future thou know not yet the pleasures of dominion  be willing to be happy and each means indulgent heaven in plenitude of power ever gave humanity is thine  for thee rich nature crowns this land with varying beauty and laboring art here fixes his perfection the sea wafts hither every foreign treasure and paleeyed science waits to tell their value  for thee the poets light hand sweeps the lyre with melody unequalled happy thousands but wait to view thee and to want a wish while those inured to misery in thy coming find an uncertain hope that soothes each pain  oh new to life accept enjoy its blessings come forth and he adored my son awaits thee thy fathers vetrans under his command impatiently require their blooming queen  almeyda  giving him her hand conduct me wheresoeer my duty calls and oh may no unbidden pang intrude to dim with tears these gildings of my fortune  exeunt the music sounding act ii scene i a court in the castle enter abdallah and orasmyn abdallah when will thou learn my son to guard thy heart which speaks but too expressively by glances  i would not wish the council to discern they but propose our pleasure   orasmyn pray you pardon if ardent nature stifles feebler reason  could i behold almeyda and restrain this glow of transport never could i deserve the bliss our prophet promises the faithful  no not himself though heaven inspired ere fancied so exquisite a beauty yet that charm natures prime gift to woman in almeyda is lost  absorpt in mind   abdallah check not thy transport for though to others i would have thee silent to me be wholly frank and thus reward me for all my anxious fond solicitude through many a long long year i own i feared that haughtiness illsuited to her years would strike thee with displeasure  orasmyn call not thus the sacred consciousness that waits on beauty and awes the wishes it awakes i ever disdained our narrow laws which make the sex domestic artificial beings merely   no it is a character refined decided that greatly charms the soul and charms for ever  why knew i not before she was unequalled  abdallah  smiling scarcastically perchance even now i know it not yet hear these youthful flights well pleased for thus each lover adorns his fancys choice  orasmyn but who can boast a choice like mine nor did even i suspect indulgent heaven in prodigality had centered all perfections in one woman  i came prepared by rigid rules to judge her  her before whom all rules all modes must vanish  for oh when first my eyes beheld the queen my heart avowed her empire ere my tongue i wondering gazed and gazing more more wondered ethereal loveliness informs her frame and beams in living glory from her eyes yet over these charms sublime meek modesty draws a transparent veil of wandering graces as fleecy clouds flit over the noon day sun and leave us opportunity to gaze upon an orb too bright else for beholding  abdallah i could grow once again a boy to hear thee  graces i could perceive  not perfect beauty   orasmyn beautys an indeterminate idea till fixed by love  whose everpowrful magic awakens a new being  love when heaven leaves to the vulgar sense its work imperfect illumes our sight to trace the angel there  through love we share our makers great prerogative creating every charm and then approving  yet when she spoke i half forgot her beauty  oh with what melting harmony she won the very air to silence no rude breath dared blend with here is but natures self stood hushed awestruck even as orasmyn   abdallah be warned in time against a reverence so profound for women capricious still and wayward often scorn who grasps with trembling hand the fancied setter while with distinguishing regard they view the bolder man who wears it as an ornament  orasmyn disdainfully how should this general censure touch almeyda  abdallah nay then thou love indeed if thou have found already she is peerless  i have done  even win her thy own way but win her quickly to match thee with almeyda and exalt thee to empire in her right has been i own the object of my life  nor should i think that life itself too dear to crown my purpose  in the bold outline of my policy i heeded not it is true the glowing colors fond fancy gives her favorites  yet those tints complete lifes picture well  to see thee great was all i asked but to behold thee happy leaves me without a wish  orasmyn still in this as in each incident of various life i owe much to my father yet for once this heart asserts a right to guide itself  nor would obtrude too early on almeyda passion she might doubt   abdallah again thou errst  but could thou win my judgment to approve this idle scruple it were now too late  the council know my thoughts and have ere this proposed thee to the queen  orasmyn presumptuous  rash   abdallah judicious rather  see thou not the prudence to bind her to compliance ever she knows the power the pride the pleasure of dominion  orasmyn but what can bind the heart save its own choice i would have wooed her with watchful eyes such unremitting tender prompt affection as might have won her of herself and crowned the future days of both with happiness  oh never let ambition tie the knot pure love alone can hallow  abdallah would twere tied though all this wooing followed  son i tell thee essential is the difference of her state immured within this castle where i reign  while thou without maintainst a like control and an obsequious council speak our will to the elation of unbounded power the sweets of flattery and the charm of fondness the glowing grace of popularity  almeyda wants not shrewdness soon to learn if she would see granada she must wed thee  orasmyn turning sorrwfully from him more changeable than are the vernal clouds which borrow heavens own hues one hour to charm us and ever the next burst in a gloomy deluge is the fond happiness a lover fancies  oh i do fear me mine is gone already did she not bear an elevated mind she might unconscious share a common fate and so perhaps might i  content to lose our lives in apathy and call it duty  but well almeyda knows the rights of sex of rank and all the hearts refined distinctions nor did she meet in mine one uncongenial  pardon my lord those vain regrets  i will quell them and once more wait thee exit  abdallah it is ever so still in fruition are our wishes punished  orasmyn i would have thee wed thy cousin but why this adoration  when i see her the spirits of the dead arise before me and wither all my projects all my powers  wherefore should man invent a hell hereafter alas guilt makes one here and he who sins though never mortal eye or voice reprove him finds in his bosom every fiend that peoples the dark profound  in her i see her brothers  yet must she be orasmyns bride or  nothing exit  scene ii the apartment of the queen enter almeyda followed by abra almeyda are these the charms of empire have we power to give that happiness we never must know   the meanest slave attending on our person makes her hearts free election and adorns with lifes first charm a poor and vulgar home   while rank that splendid misery to woman enchains us to the car of victor man and bartered now by policy now honor we buy an enemy or we fix a friend  marry orasmyn  no ambitious uncle nor he nor thou shall thus control my will nor even your instrument the servile council  i was devoted thus  allotted  wedded  given like the mere encumbrance of my crown er yet i wore it  tell me gentle maid for all can tell me of my wayward fate more than i know myself was i not given long since to this young prince  abra gracious lady so much your people tender prince orasmyn they much desire the union   almeyda then orasmyn and his more crafty father have seduced my people from their duty   abra dare i add since youths fair promise ripened into manhood orasmyn still has risen in fame in virtue your friends all love  your enemies all fear him  almeyda sighing and so ever long may i   abra oh do not wrong him  never has the prince disgraced your own great lineage by one invidious sordid selfish action he feels a brave contempt of mortal praise even with a mighty avarice of desert  to him the faulty fly secure to find the indulgence he requires not  while the wretched freely demand his pity and protection   his gitfs forerun his promise  almeyda disdainfully well thou speak it   abra believe me madam when you better know him i shall be but your echo in my eyes and can i give the prince a nobler praise in character as features he is like you   almeyda indeed i own i see not the resemblance and but for vanity should call thee partial  abra yet am i merely just  though were i more in me it would be gratitude my brother owes to orasmyn a distinguished fortune   almeyda he meanly therefore placed thee near our person a busy advocate  retire and leave me exit abra i am environed by such sycophants  and unobserved can scarcely breathe a sigh thinks he by little arts like these to win me  no were my heart not wholly thine alonzo the aspiring selfish lover never should gain it  yet much i dread abdallah on his brow lives a black penetration which deeppierces through virtues thin and variable complexion extracting often in blushes the souls meaning  ah wherefore breaks he on me  enter abdallah abdallah sweet almeyda swift are the feet of those who bear glad tidings already has the councils wise proposal  already has thy gracious silence reached me   blessed beyond fathers in a son it is thou thou only who can bless me with a daughter  almeyda silence my lord implies not a decision  rn in affliction and in slavery nurtured  the world and all its ways to me unknown i must have time to learn the needful science  abdallah thou shall escape the deep laborious study enjoy the sweets of life with care unmixed become at once the idol of orasmyn and of a joyful people  almeyda i want fancy to tinge the picture with so rich a color  raised on a sudden to a fearful height i view uncertain which to choose the paths that wind around me in the worlds vast maze  abdallah orasmyns hand will guide  his heart sustain thee   would i were not his sire for then almeyda i might unblushing dwell upon his merits number the virtues that from reaons dawn found in his heart their home while true to glory he with unequalled fame has fought  has conquered  almeyda  orasmyns merits time my lord will teach me  seek not at once to snatch me from myself  were i to wed while hardly yet enfranchised twould mark a latent weakness in my nature or a determined selfishness in thine  abdallah ay were thy spouse ignoble  unbelovd but with my son dishonor never was named he was thy fathers choice  his eyes last object when life receded fast he called orasmyn then with parental fondness wrung his hand and charged him to entender his almeyda   me he conjured to see his will obeyed and guard you both   almeyda alas so well to guard us as may complete thy will no less than his aside kings can give crowns my lord and sires commands yet nature sometimes gives the heart a power to rest selfpoizd even as the globe we tread on dependant on no breath but our creators  abdallah  fiercely yet man incensed on this wide globe can spread a ruin nature shrinks from stain her blooms with human blood and load the vernal gales with groans but mocked by winters rudest howlings nay start not princess it is thyself has taught me to threat by implication  almeyda savage tyrant victoria oh victoria well thou spokst him aside  abdallah but see thy lover and at his approach my swelling heart overflows with tenderness how could i cherish worship love almeyda would she but deign alike to bend her nature  orasmyn  entering kneels say will my sovereign pardon if i press unlicensd on her leisure break through forms cold hearts imposed to level with themselves more generous natures thus again to tender a homage circles never knew to pay  a vow imprinted here  almeyda orasmyn rise the pageants over and this devotion mockry  orasmyn if to behold almeyda and adore her to see in fancys eye the world created and in herself the first the only woman in each new glance to find a nameless charm and in each sigh to breathe a new infection if this offend ah who shall gain her favor  almeyda a flame at once so prudent and so sudden confided to the council ere its object may well surprise   orasmyn forgive the interruption  and know almeyda hardly would thou scorn such intervention more than would orasmyn  yet by thy own pure nature deign to judge of his before thee sanction but his service allow him time to win upon thy favor and by the holy warmth that prompts the vow thy will shall guide him  almeyda wherefore trust to time this moment stamps the passion and its motive  i would like you be guarded prudent selfish preserve a silence might ensure my safety and rest upon the future  but my soul disdains the mean the temporising wisdom nor knows to tremble in the cause of truth  vie with me princes in sincerity hence with inflated phrase and plainly say it is my diadem not me you woo  abdallah were that orasmyns object he might wear it who shall oppose his will a feeble woman of little estimation in society and less in empire   orasmyn spare me sir oh spare me the deep disgrace of this ungoverned passion  almeyda even in his insolence i praise his candor and most despise who makes the most professions  to orasmyn abdallah yet hear me princess nor incense a nature that deigns once more to struggle with its fierceness his only fault orasmyn owes to thee a fond a foolish passion chills his powers and leaves him but the semblance of himself had he thus trembled in the battles front applauding nations never had thronged to see him nor had thou worn the crown thou vauntst so bravely  droop not my son beneath a womans frown tomorrow and perhaps the fair one sues such is their weak their fluctuating natures even now this proud one shrinks upon her cheek the rose of youth is blanched princess farewell remember i or hate or love with ardour it is yet within thy power to fix the feeling exit  almeyda alas what power can change it lost almeyda  orasmyn irresolutely how shall a heart illunderstood abhorred win on thy confidence or guide thy councils by heaven i melt in womanish lamentings thus innocently to excite thy hatred yet hear me be advised disguise thy feelings thy safety rests in quitting this lone fortress and every hour thou stayst in it distracts me  almeyda who shall endue thee with the grace of truth or give me faith to trust thee well i see one is to terrify and one to soothe me   though had indulgent nature crowned thy youth with every charm and virtue given to man yet left thee still the son of fierce abdallah even though the earth i stand on yawnd a grave that grave should be my choice rather than thee  have i for this renounced each tender tie of bleeding love and ever faithful friendship  not thus alonzo wooed  victoria won me no sighs no tears no honors no despair no threat of misery no dread of bondage no sound of death ever mingled with his passion  his polished heart felt and inspired a love which far outswelling this worlds narrow bound both may delight to bear into a better  orasmyn the unwary flight expounds a mystery my shallow sense oerlookd oh well i see why thou would not do justice to orasmyn  yet oh i pity far more than i blame thee hide from all eyes but chiefly from my fathers the unsanctiond prepossession ruin  murder a thousand ills i will not shock thy sense with lurk in the thought of love and of alonzo  born to adore to follow to protect thee think not orasmyn will desert himself to force a heart upon thee  oh farewell i cannot coin in words my souls soft meaning exit  almeyda there is a glowing grandeur in this prince worthy a better sire but oh alonzo never shall thou know the shadow of a rival even though alone i breast the beating storm and fall the single object of its rage  act iii scene i a court in the castle enter abdallah followed by an officer abdallah command a council without my concurrence already dares she queen it haste and say you found me indisposed and wave the meeting  while to the lords you urge  not my excuse but frame one from almeyda  should thou suggest an intellectual wandering which makes her say and unsay it were apt thou art discerning and do understand me  she is too young to follow her own guidance while that of others wrings her exit officer have i waded through many an artifice and many an horror seen time and circumstance mature my views to let a haughty foolish woman cross me  hah  might i not improve my own suggestion and work her highwrought passions into phrenzy  enter hamet hamet my lord even now a young castilian presses importunately to address the queen  i heeded well your wish and studious sought to learn his embassy but or prepared by those who sent him or his own discretion he foiled my

haste and lead me to him   hamet you must rule  yet much i dread this needless enterprise  oh sister you have destroyed me exit  almeyda heed him not never will thy queen desert who truly serves her  oh abra in the hour of mortal peril should thou be born to suffer like almeyda may one as generous as thyself arise to save thee from a pang more keen than dying  act iv scene i a dark vault irregularly hewn in the rock extending out of sight on one side in a vista of rude imperfect pillars  a small gate leads on the other side through an enormous crag of the rock  alonzo discovered chained to a pillar against which he leans alonzo why lingers thus the tyrant exquisite in ill perhaps he thinks mere death indulgence and therefore leaves me leisure for reflection  an awful pause twixt life and immortality  is this the murcian victor this the heir of great ramirez that castilian sun which rose to light a nation on to virtue or early set amid a crimson glory  eclipsed at once the victim of his passions he aids his murderers and but hopes oblivion   long will my father wonder where i vanished  almeyda poor almeydas not so happy   the guards unbar the gate and light in abdallah then fixing their torches in clefts of the rock they retire abdallah ere i pronounce my last resolve i ask has soitude restored thy better reason  alonzo has recollection humanizd thy heart why should not virtue bear as fixed a tenor as vice can beast  abdallah yet dare thou vaunt it thus rash youth if thou would view the light of heaven or breath untainted air   alonzo where are thy ruffians   thou not see i less abhor to die than poorly to condition with abdallah why urge this parley  abdallah thou were born alonzo thy enemies must own to grace the name transmitted thee from a long line of heroes  can thou then rashly fix thy fate and perish in flower of youth  in ignominy  bondage  alonzo ay  with a firmness thou can never know who livst in guilt and therefore findst in living only a daily respite from damnation  abdallaeh what is the mighty sacrifice enjoined why but to yield what thou can never enjoy and bend almeydas will to meet her duty then will these chains drop off and our glad arms in friendship fold thee  alonzo by the light of heaven forever vanished from these eyes i swear i would not yield one chaste sigh of almeyda to be the worshipped of an host of traitors  abdallah thou have not weighed the agonizing pangs my power can make thee suffer ere i grant thee the comfort of expiring  alonzo i have weighed thy character and therefore am prepared for all thy threats imply   abdallah stamps and guards enter with torches and leavers employ your leavers  raise yon enormous stone  beneath that chasm through jagged rocks  imperious  horrible  a stream oblivious as the fabled lethe washes to many an undiscovered hollow the victims of my will   alonzo thy mercy then spares the soulharrowing pomp of preparation and all the pangs of nature and of love  abdallah hark hearst thou not in the deep sullen roar the knell of death  of those who have gone before thee methinks the shrieks resound  a breath of mine will add alonzo to the untold many  then vainly shall almeyda weep thy loss ramirez shall in vain demand his son for though he shook this fortress to the center razed its enormous towers and solid bastions their ruins would but form the tomb he sought  alonzo i have not lived so ill that i have now to learn to die  and of abdallah too no white as angels if thou stoodst before me denouncing thus my doom i could not fear thee how should i now  abdallah because you are in my power and i dare use it  yet again reflect but know when next we meet my voice is mortal  alonzo be it so now  even now  why this display to the firm soul that never shrunk from danger  by heaven i feel an infant once again when thus insulted with an infants terrors  ye higharchd rocks to groans alone resounding witness one wretch has never tried your echo   and you oh most adored who over these dens rend heaven and earth with vain and fond lamenting for him thus strangely vanished  never know your feet unconscious trod alonzos grave  orasmyn descends with a torch dark labyrinth for murder fitly wrought at length i have reached your limit  or er or this dim light gleams on the hapless stranger  his mien bespeaks a deep disdain of death with princely graces blended  youth unknown dare thou reveal at once thy rank and name with the dark embassy that thus entombs thee  alonzo orasmyn for i need not ask thy title so well thy port bespeaks the prince and lover why would thou know a name like thine renowned but oh unlike thin never stained with murder  orasmyn prince thou art bound by chains and i by feeling  the sun that ripens in a moors warm heart even virtue into passion ripens there those glowing frailties that oerrun he soil and poison its pure product  i would forget if possible the arts that charmed almeyda   alonzo can thou forbid the bud to blow the zephyr to wake the bird of spring  as well do this as chill the souls soft breathings disunite hearts which but new to life like infant plants entwined unconscious  lived but by each other alonzo never knew a guilty thought or pland a guilty union  if almeyda gave him oh gift beyond all price her heart who would not think it cheaply bought with life  orasmyn fain would i hate alonzo like a rival fain would i hear thy words survey thy actions but my pure nature does thee noble justice why will thou not view me with equal candor thou have almeydas heart  oh blessed preeminence outstrip me not too in the race of honor  to her repose i sacrifice a passion strong as thine own  oh join with me to save her  alonzo ah can thou love with so sublime a virtue she lives but to thy senses  thou never knewst the chaste perfection of that generous nature never mingled souls with her in love as pure as the intelligence that angels hold  that bliss  that agony was mine  mine only to thee almeyda seems impetuous rash touch but her heart and it overflows with softness  orasmyn if thou love it is thine to prove it  a fearful crisis is at hand  when over oh soothe support console the sorrowing angel protect her from thy fierce obdurate sire i dare implore thee from thyself protect her  so shall that mortal hour no being yet encountered with indifference be met by me with fortitude the long hereafter so shall thou less regret  and even almeyda at length perhaps forget me   orasmyn never  never when the soft fibers of the heart expand and thus enclasp another time or space in vain would break the hold or make us single  i see no more in thee a hated rival virtues own awful form appears before me  bids me behold a monarchs glorious heir the gallant leader of victorious armies the idol of whole nations  more oh more her own devoted pupil  shall i then leave thee to die and sin against society  oh my proud soul how it disdains the thought yet for my fathers sake ere yet i free thee assure me   alonzo spare thy generous cheek the blush of asking that unworthy thine own honor nor less unworthy mine  orasmyn away with bonds  for even were vows unknown a noble soul would feel untold a fellowsuffrers sorrows and blend selflove with social  why oh why were we born enemies  alonzo  snatching his hand ere yet we were our finer tones of mind some guardian spirit touched into harmony and when we met the according strings struck forth a sound so sweet that heaven itself might listen love even love that brand of discord burns within our bosoms pale  cold  before the steady flame of virtue  orasmyn the camp alone is mine once in its districts no human power can reach thee it were wise to wait the hour that wafts thee over the river  orasmyn takes the torch and guides alonzo out hamet after a proper interval descends as lighting onward almeyda hamet we have been fortunate to scape those slaves   tread careful madam here the stones are loose  almeyda  descending thus on the soul breaks loves celestial light and chears with many a lengthning ray misfortune  hamet  stopping as shocked  these chains  this silence  oh unhappy moment  they were the assassins then who even now passed us   for your souls sake and as you value reason return at once sweet princess  almeyda  waving him away with scorn hence rude man were thou abdallahs self thou shouldst not say me thus near alonzo  prithee love reprove him  hamet alas  almeyda faintly and alarmed have thou deceived me  or within is there some yet more deep  more dreary den  hamet in a broken voice there is indeed a deeper  where almeyda shall never hear her lover   almeyda never said thou recall that fearful word nor at this crisis pluck from my soul the last prop that sustains it  hamet in agony  oh that i could beguile myself or thee   these are the very chains with which i bound him and this the chasm from whence the mass of stone by leavers has been raised where through the rocks full many a victim to the fears of state precipitated in the rushing torrent has sought an unknown grave   almeyda pressing the chains to her bosom murdered  lost  wisdom  nor strength  nor valor then availed thee  hamet oh prophet should she die infernal tyrant  to choose my only absence for the murder   how is it madam  almeyda in a deep tone of despair even as i would have it  for that thy kindness meant to aid thy queen take this  she has no recompense to give loosens the jewel ramirez gave her from her bosom kisses it  wipes her eyes  surveys and gives it hamet  nor ever now will have  begone and leave me  nor let one human eye pervade a sorrow too mighty for complaint  hamet soothing her you will return  almeyda return you mean me well nor will i chide  but hence at once and leave me to an anguish which would not waste itself in words or tears but swell within and wash away remembrance  hamet oh madam pardon him who dares not leave you imagine the conjectures of the world if here you should be found   almeyda my world is vanished  it was concentered in the spot he lived on and if it yet exists  it is in his grave  hamet think of abdallah  can you fail to dread him  almeyda who has naught to hope has little sure to fear   add not a feather to the weight that presses upon this brain and turns it into chaos  go  shield thyself  and leave me to my fortune  why will thou urge the parley  and awake the pride the passion  lost extinct  in horror  hamet  yet be advised  sweet princess quit this place  almeyda pressing her forehead vaguely will thou then kill me  hamet rather would i save   time will dry up these tears  restore your peace and make you joy in safety   almeyda turning with horror to the chasm look there  look there then talk to me of peace of joy of safety   hamet the savage who dares wound his sovreigns heart would lacerate each vein of wretched hamets  for my sake then if not thine own sweet queen fly hence   almeyda with increasing delirium say thou to heaven  hamet alas alas her reason surely wanders hark i hear him  by all the nameless agonies you feel oh pity him destroyed by pitying you  almeyda hence  hence  whoever you are  i will not go but reign for ever here  supreme in sorrow  the sun no more shall visit these sad eyes nor the wan moon present one soft reflection  winter no more shall chill  or summer warm me nor innocence nor heaven itself supply one moment of delight  but damp cold drops thus petrify my heart and night eternal shivering and looking up make vain the sense of sight  now come abdallah behold in me alonzos monument  hamet abdallah comes indeed  his voice resounds  it grows upon my ear  one chance is mine   could i regain the cleft that lately hid us he might pass on  and i in flight find safety  he treads on the torch and flies hastily almeyda in frenzy how suddenly the night falls  oh my heart will no one knit thy loosened strings and staunch the vital blood yet flowing  yes one hand   ah no  ramirez will to death abhor almeydas fatal name  guards light in and follow abdallah abdallah are ye all in now close the gate that no obtrusive eye no foot unbidden press upon my secret  so in the gulf with him at once shall sink all knowledge of his fate  almeyda majestically who pierces through the graves deep silence with a voice so loud disturbing my repose  abdallah can it be her amazement and alonzo gone  ah vain is every guard against that subtle sex  she has found some ready villain to assist her and given the prince his freedom   almeyda in a low anxious voice comes ramirez  he comes to seek his son  ah hapless monarch that name to him is nothing  yet i will hide these traces from his sight   she advances wildly and fearfully looking back abdallah how now almeyda this can be only frenzy  where is thy lover  almeyda laying her hand on his arm why do thou ask ramirez  he is in murcia  did not thy policy dispose him there when fixed upon my ruin wretched sire draws him aside fly from this den of death  here broods a serpent fatal to thee and to thy race  even now dozing upon this flinty floor i dreamt   oh such a dream i shudder but to name it  abdallah what dream almeyda i must soothe this transport if i would learn the truth   almeyda nay never frown i spoke it unawares  but strange strange visions still swim before these eyes  yet not alonzo   though him alone i sought came to save  too late alas i came now thou will weep or is thy brain like mine seared up in lead  she leans on the shoulder of a guard abdallah this is an incident so singular as outruns fancy and perplexes reason  natures exhausted in her some dire truth lurks under all this mystery and frenzy  guard my lord behold the chains that bound the stranger  abdallah and who durst take them off almeyda only  yet where then is he vanished ah if grief at witnessing this woe should have impelled him at once to plunge into this yawning gulf how is it almeyda  almeyda  turning fondly to him heavy  strangely heavy guide of my youth sole partner in its sorrows  kissing his hand abdallah astonishing delusion where is alonzo  almeyda did i not tell you of my horrid dream  sleeping just now upon this flinty floor even from its solid base i heard alonzo amid the rush of torrents  me he called and shook the deep profound my fond heart it answered too  oh with such eager throbs the long vibrations spread beyond this frame almost into eternity   abdallah  exultingly even so  thus have i the advantage and not guilt  almeyda soft or abdallah comes not even you warned as you were of all his selfish views can guess at his barbarity an uncle  yet these dim eyes take pleasure to behold thee the ravenous vulture  bloodincited wolf prey not when disappointed on their species that pitch of cruelty was left for man  nature convulses at the bare idea nor dares to snap the tie herself has formed  he thinks i will take this tamely no abdallah i will have such revenge  from thy black heart at once i will pluck away its worldly veil and punish thee in mere sincerity  abdallah  fiercely thou shall not live to do it subtle traitress i will be warned in time  for in these flights the souls deep sense full often may be discovered he surveys wistfully almeyda the guards and the chasm   one moment might effect it and that moment inter with her all traces of the deed   further i will try her  will thou not forgive the involuntary wrong  almeyda whenever i do may heaven forget the wretch it now chastises  abdallah nay then thou die nor prayers nor tears shall save thee that word decides thy doom seize on her strait precipitate her instant down the gulf and live the favored objects of my bounty  almeyda oh that tremendous voice  where fled my senses that they acknowledged not yon ruthless savage   him before whom i was born but to tremble slaves drag me not ye will not murder me   am i not reft of every good but being  a chearless being spare thy own remorse nor crown the pile of thy enormous sins with such a helpless victim  abdallah vain are prayers i have not ventured thus far to recede naught but thy death can now assure my safety   who is at the gate unbar it not i charge you guard opening the gate the prince orasmyn only enter orasmyn almeyda flies to him oh protect me guard  save me  hide me in thy very heart  orasmyn ay while it beats sweet fluttrer good my lord what mean these haggard slaves and this confusion  how comes almeyda here why thus afflicted  abdallah born to make vain my cares and cross thy fortune why art thou here she as thou see is frantic  orasmyn alla forbid speak dear one  calm my fears ah tremble not  but speak   almeyda alonzo surely i hear thee love but dare not dare not look   orasmyn of the vast host of mental ills ordained to punish hapless man the worst has seized her alas by my omission dear almeyda calm thy perturbed soul and look around thy friends alone are near thee  almeyda glancing around she buries her face in orasmyns robe oh no  no i see a fiend who turns me into marble  but i am safe with thee thou never wilt leave me my own alonzo  abdallah thus she still has raved  even now she took me for ramirez yet thou might improve this blindness  if you are wise avail thyself of her fond fancys error and wed her strait  orasmyn wed her forbid it alla   were reason perfect in her this fond clasp i should pronounce a bliss more exquisite than all in cold futurity  but now my heart recoils from her soft touch  sweet suffrer raise thine eyes within this circle give thy woes respite for from this sad hour never shall thou know another  if this heart this arm has power to save thee  abdallah as thou will  thou know my mind  now be the choice thine own exit guards follow  orasmyn oh most unguarded  ere i saved alonzo i should have warned this dear one of my purpose  how shall i now convince her oh those eyes more beauteous for their wildness how they wander  hear me almeyda by the unsullied soul within this bleeding breast thy lover lives   alonzo lives  almeyda ay so i knew you would tell me but spare the specious tale i know already  i heard it from himself nay nay no more  orasmyn oh agony for human sense too touching yet how to wake again her recollection almeyda do thou know me  almeyda gazing vaguely on him i know one one only in the circle of creation and he is strangely vanished  orasmyn yet he lives in safety lives  almeyda within this heart do you say ay there he lives indeed and shall for ever  orasmyn never can i forgive my own neglect for oh this ight is dreadful yet almeyda thy own alonzo lives  like me to weep  almeyda yes i have heard strange tales  ye all have told me and seen such dismal sights i dare not speak them  no matter  time will clear all up  i am weary  orasmyn oh let me lead you hence   almeyda even where you will and by that voice of comfort you should guide me to my alonzos heaven  orasmyn touching charmer i dare not listen more lest i like thee grow out of love with reason and delight only to hear thy rhapsodies  starting and looking through the pillars almeyda  more dungeons perhaps more murdrers too now should they come exhausted as i am no power could save me oh they have strength to wrest ones very being look at this arm  baring he  orasmyn the savage gripe has purpled the purest white pulsation ever throbd in he starts and wistfully surveys almeyda and the chasm it cannot be the fear is too tremendous abhorrent nature from a deed so black would shrink till these high rocks oerarchd by art sink to the center  oh forgive the thought thy own ambitious nature prompts my father  rest on me dear almeyda near your chamber faithful i will watch the livelong night and pray it may breathe peace upon you prythee lean  almeyda soft have a care we tread not on his grave somebody showed it me  we are very near it  orasmyn oh that superior mind is gone for ever  yet still thus ruined like a broken mirror it gives a perfect image in each fragment exeunt  act v scene i the magnificent hall with which the play opens and similar clouds showing again the dawn of morning abdallah enters finding orasmyn musing abdallah have thou thus watched the night away my son regardless of the common dues of nature  the day will come when thou wilt regret in vain this lavish waste alike of health and feeling and why thus strictlyguard a maniac  who will assail almeyda  orasmyn who will soothe her  it is among the fatal rights of rank to want all common blessings never more alas shall this sweet visionary find them  abdallah has then her frenzy known no interval and the long night elapsed in restless ravings  orasmyn the inventive evil took such various forms as fancy scarce could follow  pausing often in vacant silence or in speechless anguish  anon more musical than the lone bird who pours her sorrows to the midnight moon she waked the drowsy night often the wild strain soared even to heaven  as often it died away  like the uncertain sweetness of that harp the light breeze softly touches  abdallah thoughts like these will undermine the firmness of thy nature  orasmyn as thou love me shake them off thou art the better part of my existence and when thou droopst i sink  orasmyn at once to see the flower of nature in the morning wither even while my senses ached at its perfection   abdallah how wise  how generous were those lavish tears could sympathy restore the hapless suffrer but other duties call thee into action  time will not with thee watch almeydas frenzy nor the great wheel of empire cease its motion  thy hand must guide it  orasmyn empire said my father  shall i usurp almeydas royal seat grow great by her misfortune rather bid me dig at her feet the grave she wildly calls for and fill it undishonord oh no more i would not understand you  abdallah say thou will not and i am answered  weak romantic boy loiter thy life away upon her threshold renounce thy sire thy rank thy name in arms the golden wreath already hovering over thee and live a lover only  orasmyn live to honor to that quick sense which striking at the heart damns even on earth the guilty oh beware and dread in time to know the dire pulsation  abdallah dare thou suppose it  orasmyn the mere thought was treason  yet a calamity so sudden speaks some known yet latent cause   abdallah i heed thee well  and feel ungrateful son through every fiber the yet unspoken censure but yet remember had i more crimes than thoughts it is thou have caused them  judge then what passes here when thus i learn thou dare despise my views my power  my person  exit into the queens apartment orasmyn stay leave me not in wrath  forgive my father a heart even bursting with conflicting passions  if i have injured  it is alas too much to shock his nature with the black suspicion enter abdallah again  my father i have erred  oh deign to pity him who thus agonizd with doubt and fear finds no power perfect but unshaken honor and that pure pride he will cherish unto death  no vain  no selfish  no ambitious thought shall ever tempt me even in thought to wrong that hapless sovereign i have sworn to guard the vow yet lives unchilld upon your lips and oh her misery doubly should enforce it  recall your honor  love me in almeyda exit  abdallah it is well this black ingratitude has steeled me  cherish thy insolence of pride  thou wilt need it have i then lived for thee in vain orasmyn  a girl by one soft glance annihilates those rights a life of fondness should have gained me  have thou forgot thy fathers heir granada regardless of thy scruples or thy choice  even now the golden circlet binds my brow and in abdallah henceforth know thy king  i have disposd the council to believe her frenzy constitutional this hour her hand unconscious might resign her crown then never never need she see granada  enter nourassin nourassin the council waits my lord your wished for presence  how fares our hapless sovereign  abdallah lost in frenzy  with vacant eye even now she gazed upon me but knew nor voice nor feature   nourassin it is too plain  the maladys habitual those starts even as we hailed her glad return bespoke a strange distraction or some buried passion  castile with matchless policy has kept the mournful secret till the advantage gained with pomp he gave us back the gorgeous casket nor owned the gem was vanished   abdallah are the council so satisfied  nourassin not one dissents my lord  abdallah why then should we delay the abdication a form alone is wanting and her hand unfit to govern may with ease be led to delegate that power our laws deny her  perchance in the next transport of her frenzy no human power may move her   nourassin it were wise since to the nation we must vouch this truth to lead her forth and summon in the council  abdallah haste then my friend conduct almeyda hither exit nourassin  scene ii the council assemble round the canopy of state almeyda is led on veiled she draws the veil at length aside and looking majestically around speaks almeyda when late i closed these lips i fully purposed never again to break the awful silence or view the light of heaven or face of man  why then am i dragged forth a spectacle what cruel eye would dive into this heart  this broken heart to mark the early ravage  i wither in the sun  chill in the breeze yet the sun runs his wonted course in glory the vernal breeze invigorates the world and all the change is here pressing her heart  abdallah soothingly lamenting still alas that such a beauteous form should prove only the souls sad sepulcher yet often in woman mutable in all beside love fixes even to frenzy  almeyda replying to an imaginary question idle question why did i love as well might you demand why i saw light  why waked my soul to knowledge  like light  like knowledge in my infant sense sunk imperceptible the tender impulse   alonzo first partook each little care and doubled every joy ah dear were both while crowns and sceptres yet were idle playthings  abdallah inventive malady which wounds yet charms us  aside there is too much of method in this frenzy would i had never trusted the event  almeyda appearing to listen and trembling hold  hide me save me from this inward horror   hark hear ye not the murdrers feet approaching   that deathdevoting voice even now they come  they rush upon my love  oh spare him spare him   dare thou inhuman  he is a monarchs heir off ruffians nor profane that gallant form  oh for a giants arm to wrest him from you   now now the steep rocks echo with his fall and the rude surge entombs him  oh alonzo  abdallah ever alonzo he is all her cry   nourassin recall your erring sense unhappy princess nor dwell for ever on these gloomy fictions   almeyda away away  nor venture to console me    thou have not known to blend thy heart with his in faith indissoluble and true passion   i was that wretch  the visited of heaven  but oh the dire proportion of my misery    still must i seek him on the rivers brink of seasons  time  of heat  of cold regardless   or do i err or does the surge return him swollen  maimed defaced no charm  no grace is left of all fond fancy worshipped  scarce my heart in this disfigured corse can know alonzo   turn hapless father turn thine eyes away nor  the dreadful secret oh that i like you could hope a little while his coming   start at his fancied footstep  hear his voice and die at last in blessed blessed ignorance  abdallah mark how this wildness shakes her  in such transport she cannot yield the crown  nourassin yet will we try her  those faithful subjects who but prayed to pass beneath almeydas sway their years in peace behold with grief the malady that shakes her nobler faculties they supplicate that she to abler hands resign her power and in retirement soothe her souls soft sorrows  almeyda  soft give me time to breathe  a moments thought  they tender her the regalia the imperial wreath with which in one short day these throbbing temples have been overweighd i unregretting yield  thou gaudy emblem laying her hand on the crown of natures ample round in thy small circle lies all that man desires and oh much more than man can ever enjoy unless he finds heavens own supreme delight the bliss of blessing how have thou marked my fate with endless horror  hence from my dim eyes take the brilliant evil and gives the promised solitude  nourassin our laws with your own hand require you to resign it to this your heir   almeyda to him oh horrible  kill me but show not to my eyes that monster  shakes not the earth beneath his bloody feet and sleeps in peace the thunder  abdallah alas alas you see she knows me not  almeyda oh would i did not is there no help alas i am at his mercy his mercy said i it is a word he knows not  but pray you call no murdrers  i will die without one struggle  only have a grave may decently receive me when my heart completes his crimes and bursts with this convulsion  abdallah the strong necessity oerrules all form  i must assume that crown she neither knows duly to wear or yield   nourassin yet stay my lord this is mere malady  she may be won  almeyda oh memory thou returnst in all thy horrors   alas i am not mad but miserable  pity this anguish  pause oh pause one moment and from the fearful height where reason totters ready to plunge into the bright obscure yet give me leisure slowly to recall her  awful supreme support me thou who know al i have suffered all i yet must suffer suspend this cruel sense of my misfortunes  expunge the woman from this bleeding bosom oh fill it wholly with those nobler duties which supercede even self and awe at once each human grief to silence  abdallah wherefore gaze ye  this is a frenzy equals even her own   like the wild fires of the conflicting elements these flashes of the soul often break the night the long long night which falls thus on a maniac  nourassin yet hear the queen abdallah  her discourse sounds not like frenzy  almeyda rather truth and reason   my dismal fates accomplished  man nor heaven can mitigate its horrors  yet for you for you unversd in suffering still i feel  nor dare i delegate the power i hold to him i know incapable of pity   to him who would perpetuate and extend the miseries i ever must groan under  abdallah in a transport of rage fooled  fooled at last it is well  i have deserved it in trusting to a woman   almeyda ye who hear me know all the merit of this painful effort  for you i yet will live  for you will reign  and though my secret soul shall seek the grave even to the hour that gives me to alonzo yet shall the lingering interval be marked by many an act of equity and honor   i here deliberately impeach abdallah of blackest treason to his lawful sovereign  to crown his sins a nobler victim fell oh deed too horrible for thought  oh deed which ear has never heard nor voice yet uttered  abdallah spare all thy eloquence and this recital  the evil thoust escaped now seizes me and makes my brain like my wild soul one chaos  i do avow the intent even of that deed though of the fact i am guiltless  yet i will try thus to deserve thy charge   nourassin seize on his sword  he is disarmed orasmyn enters and draws to guard his father how now presumptuous man  almeyda ah he too here for me there is nor justice then nor hope  abdallah gasping on the shoulder of his son orasmyn thou had nearly lost a father  no proud almeyda for thee alone i lived not had thou seen no more than i intended for thy knowledge thou had been happy  happy with orasmyn i would have given thee him  my lifes best hope in whom i center all my pride  my glory  yet at this awful crisis of existence no more will i dissemble my true motive  to crown his youthful brow with that bright wreath injurious fortune bade him only look on has been the single object of my life  orasmyn he scorns the gift  nor thinks he hears a father  recall your better self and calm this transport  almeyda this artifice orasmyn is too late   rather act like him  own the glorious sin and still preserve one merit in thy candor  orasmyn how how have i deserved the bitter taunt how wronged my sovereign even in secret thought or dared obtrude one selfish view before her   if in this hour of wildness and confusion i joy to see her renovated reason proud to confirm her power to guard her person   if this be treason purify my heart    to thee i render gladly up the sword upon whose point no blood ere yet congealed save of thy foes  almeyda long long with glory wear it    i blush to have aspersed a soul so noble  abdallah scornfully surveying him thou traitor to thyself  my soul disclaims thee thou have foredoomd thy sire by basely bowing thus to thy hearts fond minion  hence and leave me  orasmyn never can he err whose monitor is virtue revere her awful power which saves at once thy life my father  sweet almeydas reason and even orasmyns honor  fly to the gate and guide alonzo hither  oh recall the last fond hope that beat within thy heart ere yet its darling object vanished from thee  gives a ring to an attendant who departs almeyda faint and trembling dread to awake the thought  lost lost and murdered  orasmyn the grave itself has rendered up ere now a guiltless inmate   almeyda does my sense deceive me  is he not dead  repeat that little sentence  let my soul live one moment on the hope and take each envied ensign of dominion   for could i crown thee with the radiant gems that sprinkle over the blue expanse above twere recompense too poor  but oh i fear i fear thou trifled with my hearts fond anguish  drawn a gay meteor over my gloomy fate which only shows its blackness  orasmyn   to appearance   almeyda appearance said thou  think ere yet again one breath escape thee on the verge of being my soul now hovers and a single word may make her quite immortal  orasmyn if to know alonzo lives can crown thy days with pleasure be happy ever happy  for i saved the only lover i was born to envy  she looks doubtfully then sinks fainting in his arms abdallah this is a folly that transcends example  oh for a pang at once to pierce them both  orasmyn her life seems gone  soft  bend her gently forward  abdallah and hopst thou then ungrateful boy to save her  orasmyn wake not within my soul a thought so killing  call every aid   abdallah forbear the useless trouble  it is not in medicine to prolong her being  a subtle poison sleeps in every pore and steals her from herself  no human art can bid her breathe one hour  orasmyn throwing himself in an agony at her feet thou injured angel could the lifeblood congealing in these veins extend thy years and give thee all thy wishes even with the fierceness of that fatal savage i dare not call my father would i gash each purple artery and urge the current   thou gavst me being  though my soul abhors the tainted blessing yet to thee i turn in this tremendous moment  hear and pity blot not at once thy honor nor defame ere yet he soar to glory that loved son who never till now offended   abdallah needst thou learn i do not easily fix my decrees but never know to change them   almeyda why orasmyn will thou thus plead for the poor life i heed not  life the frail blossom of eternity which shrinks and shivers in the vernal breeze and sheds its purple bloom with every shower  until the embryo fruit arrived at fullness shakes its soft shelter to the dust  most happy who ripen first and quit this mortal coil unblighted and unbroken  orasmyn is it thus celestial spirit thus thou would give me comfort oh more we need thy example than thy precepts my father have i then no influence with thee long have thou studied natures baleful secrets and well thou know their antidotes   abdallah with bitterness but thou again perhaps would scorn the tainted gift again despise the giver  orasmyn oh my father to this how little were the life i owe you  abdallah i have not been accustomed to deny thee   gives a ring to an attendant who goes out orasmyn turning with softness to almeyda how often did i tell thee i had saved him even when thy reason like a frighted bird forsook the home round which it fondly fluttered   yet oh almeyda not in vain thoust suffered that fatal passion which thy beauty caused by all these miseries chastized to friendship retains its essence only and appears like the cold luster of a winter sun when all its glow and purple vapors faded  abdallah to her devoted he nor hears nor sees me  ah should he dare despise  oh mahomet to be the scorn of those for whom we sin   this this is disappointments consummation attendant brings him a goblet orasmyn from the memorable hour thy voice first hailed me sire even unto this i have granted all thy prayers the good i wish myself be thine almeyda i taste the draught that thou may fearless share it  orasmyn presenting the bowl oh do not hesitate a single moment hardly can i respire with apprehension   almeyda fainting if this be death how falsely do we fear it care pain and sorrow fade before the calm the holy calm oershadowing every sense   methinks without a crime at once to scape the dreadful past and all the doubtful future were to accomplish early lifes great purpose  orasmyn oh spare me all the guilt the grief  the horror live sweet almeyda live though for another  almeyda oh that this potent essence were compounded of herbs might purify alike the soul and lull it to a deep a long repose  drinks the antidote  abdallah oh transport glory oh tremendous triumph sons may forget but mahomet remembers he has not scorned my prayer nor quite renounced me  prophetic was thy voice for thou shall find a long repose indeed this was the poison which i with an indignant pleasure shared   i had alas no other means to die nor would i fall inglorious  unlamented   almeyda proud almeyda even thy love in all the plenitude of rank and beauty shall grace my obsequies and thou ungrateful attend us a true mourner  orasmyn speech is lost   a deed like this bursts the great chord of nature and makes this gorgeous world but one vast ruin  abdallah already do i feel the subtle essence  it rages onward like the fires of etna and nature withers ere it yet approaches   ah she too sinks upon the lip of beauty mortality now lays his livid finger  this  this is glorious mischief and i joy to die the moment life has lost its value  orasmyn but thus to blend me in so black a deed   make me the minister of my own destruction oh i have guiltless cropped creations rose and shook its crimson glories to the dust  list not those gracious eyes again to me thou soft perfection i no more dare meet them  no never dare i hope thou should forgive the unparalled credulity  and he  yet nature yet thou wringst me  abdallah fiercely shaking him off hence begone  awn on thy minion but no more approach the sire thou have disgraced  betrayed  abandoned  even as i loved thee once so now i loathe thee oh how i long to shut out life itself since i with life can shut out thy remembrance  bear me i pray you to the guadalquiver  turns to the attendants plunge plunge me in at once my livers calcined  oh find some sudden means to quench this fire ere yet my eyestrings crack  away away  abdallah is borne off almeyda yet yet he comes not  oh no more these eyes shall dwell delighted on their only object nor this fond heart pronounce its last adieu turns and sees orasmyns bitter grief take comfort prince  though small is my own portion yet will i share it with thee for thy sire may heaven like me forgive him  orasmyn spotless victim his vices have cut short his being here  but oh thy virtues speak his future fate  almeyda growing more weak among the many wandrers on this earth few are allowed to reach the mortal term and of those few scarce one expires content   the minds deep agonies exhaust each power and early fit the frame for dissolution  i only feel a numbness hark i hear him  orasmyn it is thy love ah happy he to know the pangs of sorrow only  alonzo entering blessed be heaven which gives me once again to see almeyda  and blessed be too orasmyn  almeyda leaning fondly over him it is thyself  my own alonzo  all my souls fond treasure thus on the dying eyes of ome lone hermit oerhanging angels pour a flood of glory even till his soul exhales in ecstasy  alonzo ah why this mournful sweetness in thine eye the living luster fades and on thy cheek each charm grows wan and hollow  orasmyn wringing his hand oh alonzo no more must we contend for this rich prize heaven claims its own  and we alike must mourn  alonzo shaking him off prince if thoust done this deed   almeyda oh never think it  orasmyns generous heart is virtues temple alonzo dear alonzo honor  love him much will thou owe him for my mean injustice  i only strove for life till thou were near  it now evaporates hardly speech is left me   i charge ye never with blood defile the tomb which the true tears of both may nobly hallow  and now indeed farewell  a hand for each this gives away my crown and this oh this the faithful heart that is in it  i am cold and these dim eyes seek vainly for alonzo  speak to me love  oh speak to me once more while yet i know that voice   alonzo lost in a chaos of killing anguish without one expression may ease this laboring heart how shall i soothe thee how mitigate thy pain  almeyda tell me you love me   lays her head on his hand and dies alonzo love you  oh god   orasmyn kissing and resigning her hand words  vows  weak vain indulgence never  oh never shall my soul forget you  both lovers remain mourning near her hamet advancing tremendous moment awful pause of being  when viewing thus the abdicated frame where the fond soul had treasured all her wishes how does recoiling nature feel at once her imperfection yet such scenes alone can show the danger of those cherished passions which thus can antedate the hour of death  make existence agony  epilogue to be spoken in a criers gown and with a bell oyez oyez oyez whereas on demand it does plainly
