liberty asserted a tragedy as it is acted at the new theater in little lincolnsinnfields  written by mr dennis  london printed for george strahan at the golden ball against the royal exchange in cornhill and bernard lintott at the middletemplegate in fleetstreet   0  price   s   d  liberty asserted  a tragedy  to anthony henley esquire sir this play of liberty asserted is by the right of nature yours not only as you are a zealous lover of your country and a generous assertor of liberty but as it owes its birth and its very being to you for it was you sir who gave the happy hint upon which this poem was formed from you  from a source of noble sentiments it descended to me and it is from me that with a just ambition it ascends to you  if i had had the happiness to be nearer to you during the time that i was writing this tragedy if as i at first received the hint from you i could have received your instructions about the design and the working of the scenes the faults in this poem had then been fewer and the present more worthy you but i know that the nobleness of your english principles will oblige you to excuse its faults on consideration of the just intention with the which it was writ and that was no less than to do good to your country to open the eyes of deluded men to inspire them with the love of liberty and unite and animate them against the common foe of europe but yet if at last i did not flatter my self that this play had many more beauties than faults you should be the very last person to whom i would choose to address it if you appear to be of the same opinion i have gained the chief ends which i propose to my self in writing and that is to do a little good to distinguish my self by what i write and by those to whom i address my self i shall look upon your approbation as a glorious earnest of fame for truth will be sure at last to prevail and that which we call taste in writing is nothing but a fine discernment of truth but as truth must be always one and always the same to all who have eyes to discern it he who pleases one of a true taste at first is sure of pleasing all the world at last but i who have sometimes had the honor to hear you talk of criticism have been a long time thoroughly convinced that from an intimacy with the ancients and a just knowledge of the moderns you have formed that fine and admirable taste which is so rarely found among us but i ought to consider that while i commend it i may perhaps displease it and ought in discretion to say no more i am  sir your most humble and most obedient servant john dennis  preface as the entertainments of our theaters are public and supported by public authority it is but just that the instruction which is the ultimate end of them should tend to the public advantage it is true indeed the stage by correcting particular persons has a natural tendency to the improving the public but when i say that the public ought to receive advantage from the entertainments of our theaters i mean that it ought to do so immediately and that the instructions which we receive from the stage ought to be for the benefit of the lawful established government  that this was the case among the athenians appears plain to me and the reason why they settled so vast a fund upon the tragic stage was because they regarded it as the very barrier of liberty which it supported by exposing the misfortunes of tyrants and the calamities that attended upon arbitrary power and it seems to me to be for this reason that they had that high esteem for oedipus and were at so uncommon an expense in the decoration of it because both the crimes and the calamities of oedipus were the consequences of his assuming unlimited power it is true he killed his father before he came to be king but it was by ascending the throne that he committed incest and that he came to the knowledge of what he had done and had he continued a private man he had neither known the guilt of his actions nor had he felt the punishment of them  as the athenians had liberty with a commonwealth the english enjoy the very same liberty under the government of the best of queens and in so doing are the happiest people in the world i thought therefore that i could not do a thing that would be more acceptable to all true englishmen than to cas in my mite toward the defending and supporting of that liberty  that the liberties of europe and of this island particularly are in no small danger at present from the growing power of france will be easily granted by all but such who are either fools or knaves too incorrigible to be talked too but this is plain that they are not so much in danger from what some call the greatness of the french as from the baseness of the rest of europe if we were but as true to liberty as the french are to tyranny they would soon be as despicable in their circumstances as they are now in their principles it is the want of public spirit that ruins us and the design of this tragedy is to inculcate that this being its important moral that the want of public spirit in the members of any community makes not only the public but very often those private persons who want it very unhappy that whoeven sells or betrays his country either to a foreign tyrant as some of the confederates or to a homebred one as the whole body of the french do whoever does this upon the account of advancing his family which is the general motive to such public treasons is sure to have himself and his family suffer with the rest and perhaps with the foremost and this moral is proved by the dramatick action both ways it shows a man who makes a treaty with the french upon private interest made by that treaty the most wretched of mankind of the happiest that he was before and it shows the very frenchman who breaks it about to be plunged by the breach of it in the most deplorable calamity and it shows something farther too that the french who are the instruments of promoting tyranny upon a private interest are so only because they are so far blinded by their passions that they know not what they do that is they know not that they are sacrificing to their tyrant their very children and families for whose support they pretend to act that if their other passions did not conccal this from them all of them who have any thing of natural affection would be so far from being guilty of so unnatural a villainy that they would immediately declare for liberty  some people may perhaps admire that i who have been accused of repeating the same thing in the play the prologue and epilogue should yet appear to be farther guilty of that very fault in the preface to whom i answer that since after all the care i had taken in the play the prologue and epilogue to assure the world that this was an english and not a party play there were some malicious enough to affirm that this was a play writ purposely to oblige the whigs i thought it lay upon me to prove what i had affirmed before that this was not a whig but an english play which i shall manifestly i believe make out unless they will urge that because it is an english therefore it is a whiggish play  if this play is writ for a party why then it must be writ against a party now it will be pretty plain from what has been said above considered with the play it self that the design of this tragedy is to make men in love with liberty by showing them that nothing can be more according to nature and by showing this not by such forcible and extraordinary arguments as require more than ordinary penetration to be understood for that has been already done so incomparably by mr lock that nothing need or can be added to it but by something so plain that every understanding is capable of it and that is by the most tender of all sentiments which nature has implanted in the minds of men and that is the love of their children the party therefore that this play was writ to oblige are all those who have any concern for their country their religion their relations their friends and their children and the party it was writ against are all those who care not one farthing for any or all of these now i would give a good deal to behold so abominable a wretch as to own himself of such a party  he who writes for a party writes for interest now i would fain ask any one where can be my interest in writing for the party for which it is supposed that i write the first thing that i wrote which had relation to the public was a poem called the court of death in which i lamented the death of the late queen of happy and glorious memory and though both the design and spirit of that poem were thought by some of the best judges to be above the common level of poetry yet i was almost the only person of all the writers who appeared upon that subject of whom the court took no notice my friends can bear me witness that i was so far from being mortified at it that i was resolved to persevere in what i thought my duty and of all the foresaid writers i was afterward the only person who bewailed the death of the late king in the same public manner that i had before lamented that of his royal consort i had almost the same fortune with that poem that i had with the former it brought me indeed a little more reputation but just as much advantage  he who after this could be induced to expect any thing from those whom they call the whigs must be of a more sanguine temper than i am i know indeed that there are a great many people whom they call whigs who are really englishmen and to oblige englishmen i shall be always proud by what names soever they may be distinguished by a real englishman i mean one who is for the present establishment and the protestant succession upon the view of the good of his country and his own no farther than as it depends on the other  but upon the first acting this tragedy there were not wanting some worthy persons who made it their business to report about the town that it was a republican play now to give them an answer to which nothing can be replied i have ordered the last scene of the play to be printed which on the account of length was left out in acting though it yet remains in the playhousecopy at the same time i desire the reader to believe that i am not such a fool to contend for names but for things that liberty is liberty under a limited monarchy as much as under a commonwealth that we enjoy enough under the present queen to make us the happiest of people that i have as high a veneration for her as any subject she has and would venture as much to serve her because i am perfectly convinced that all that she aims at by her perpetual care and the wisdom of her conduct is to support and defend these liberties which her glorious predecessor delivered to us and which it is the business of this play to assert and vindicate so that the design of this tragedy being only to promote the good intentions of the queen it is more her interest than it is any persons in england that it should make the impression which it was designed to make though i believe it at the same time to be the interest of every person in england excepting those who are wishing for a french government or contriving to bring it in  this is not the first time that since her majestys happy accession to her throne i have endeavored to serve her and all the world knows that it is not my fault that i have not done her a most important service proposal for putting a speedy end to the war etc sold by mrs baldwin had that been done there had been no need of writing the following tragedy there had been no need of firing people with the love of liberty or animating them against the common foe had that been done the liberties of europe and our own had been sufficiently secured  i know very well that the foregoing declaration is not over politic that to declare for the public against parties is to make no friends i am perfectly convinced that if i could be brought to espouse any party warmly that party might be brought to espouse me but that till i make that step i must be left to my self of this i say i am perfectly convinced and yet notwithstanding that conviction i hope in god i shall not change my conduct  the success of this play has been so favorable notwithstanding malice and ill accidents it has had the felicity of having so many illustrious voices for it that i may spare my self the trouble of answering objections however since good manners appear to be concerned in two of them i shall say a word to those  the first is that there are in this play national reflections which ought not to be made to which i answer that i plainly perceive that the art of the following tragedy is by no means all understood that part of it consists in this that what some mistake for a national satyr is only a satyr upon arbitrary power a satyr upon the government of the french and not upon their manners as they proceed from their climate the french are in themselves a brave and a gallant nation but the submission which they fondly pay to unlimited power has plunged them in vices which their natures abhor and rendered them odious and despicable to show this i have introduced the characters of two frenchmen frontenac and miramont who are both of them men of honor but the difference between them is this that miramont who declares against arbitrary power is altogether without blemish and the faults and defects in frontenacs character are plainly derived from his zeal for their present government  the other objection is this that the satyr in the ambassadors scene is too course for delicate ears i know it very well and in complaisance to some gentlemen whom i esteem i ordered it to be left out after the first night but i have printed it with the rest because they who do not like it may turn over it and because it is likely to be subservient to the end for which this poem was writ and that is to animate our english against the french for i believe it may not be unacceptable to some honest downright englishmen who while we and the french are cutting one another throats will not take it ill that we do it without ceremony  the scene of this tragedy lies at agnie in canada which for the sake of the better sound i call angie canada is a vast tract of land in northern america on the back of new england and new york as new england and new york and the country about them belong to the english a considerable part of canada is possessed by the french and as the english and french divide the country they divide the natives the most considerable nation of canada next to the iroquois are the hurons who are friends to the french but the five warlike nations of the iroquois are our confederates of those five nations agnies or angies is one and the chief place of the nation is agnie or angie and thus much i thought fit to premise for the sake of those who have never read either hennepin or la hontan  but now it will be convenient to say a word concerning the scenes as they are marked in the printed play and here by the word scene i do not mean so much the place as the number of persons who are in action upon that place at a time i have therefore distinguished the scenes in the following play as they have been always distinguished by the ancients and by the moderns of other countries and by our own ben johnson any person who comes upon the place of action or leaves it makes a different scene and that new scene is marked by the figure of its respective number and the names of the persons who are upon the place of action i thought that agreeable delusion into which the reader willingly and gladly enters for the sake of his pleasure would be both greater and easier if he were not put in mind of a stage by entrances and exits which are nothing but direrections that are given to a play house prompter  the design of this play was much improved by the remonstrances which i received from my valued friend mr southern who besides his zeal to do good to his friends and a noble sincerity uncommon among the writers of this age by the ex tempore remarks which he made upon my reading this play to him in a very hasty manner showed at once so much penetrating quickness as well as so much solidity and so much sureness as could belong to no man but one who has a thorough understanding of nature and who has that admirable talent for touching the passions which he has shown in his tragedies i must own the obligation too which i have to mr betterton for the hints i received from him as well as for his excellent action  this play indeed received all the grace and ornament of action in most of the principal parts and in all the womens but that of sakia by mrs barry was acted so admirably and inimitably as that no stage in europe can boast of any thing that comes near to her performance or if the foreign stages can show any thing like it they are at least prodigiously improved since i was upon the continent that incomparable actress changing like nature which she represents from passion to passion from extreme to extreme with piercing force and with  grace changes the hearts of all who see her with irresistible pleasure  errata page    for commends read commands p    for the glorious spears r that glorious sphere p    for more at variance r never at variance p    for again is an r again in an  prologue spoke by mr betterton this of deep tragedies is sure the age when mars each day displays with swelling rage his bloody scenes upon the worlds great stage ye brittons from your thamess silver flood turn turn your eyes to streams distained with blood and to discover scenes of mortal woe survey the rhine the danube and the poe no fancied tragedies are acting there there the distracted native rends his hair and shrieks and wrings his hands in true despair while no vexatious griefs to you are known but here you meet to attend our pleasing moan and gently figh with sorrow not your own by grateful turns with fear and pity seized and when most terrified are then most pleased but tragic scenes may come where this delight shall yield to horror and to mortal fright when impious mars shall with a dreadful roar descend to visit pale britannias shore already treason whispers come away and clamorous discord cries make no delay that hour would show a tragedy indeed whose sad spectators would not weep but bleed which to prevent all patriots should contend these scenes were wrought to serve so just an end to show our inbred foes ere it is too late that they and theirs must share the common fate for france its blood exhausts its wealth expends tobtain its own and not our plotters ends they who their country for themselves enthrall will see themselves and children with it fall would they reflect on this while yet they may themselves and children they would never betray as in the following scenes we show to day for what remains  to please and to instruct we have done our best then boldly let us make this just request with silent care to the first act attend then you with pleasure may perhaps unbend epilogue thus have we shown what we proposed to show all would fall off from tyrants did they know that with their wretched country they betray themselves and children to tyrannick sway they who placed haughty lewis on the throne would have declared against him had they known that their souls darlings by his dire commands in torments should expire by bloody hands or live a banished race in foreign lands the fiercest creatures that the woods contain what they bring forth with pleasing love maintain that love the lion softens and the bear the worlds supported by that tender care all savages but men their offspring spare but man grown blind by lust of power or pelf will sell his darling offspring and himself to reclaim such our author bad me say he wrote this english and no party play he minds not who is of whig or tory clan but who for lewis is or who for ann for the same friends have lawless rage and he as ann has the same foes with liberty oh may she long command these happy isles where she with freedom empire reconciles long over your hearts may yon bright circle reign oh may you never feel a ruder chain and of no other tyranny complain but beauties reign on liberty depends when the french reign begins the reign of beauty ends the french are slaves to mans despotick sway but with profaneness acted every day they force celestial beauty to obey dramatis personae men frontenac governor of new france by mr

on thy looks seem big with something that is important  okim then briefly thus beaufort that jointly with your valiant son led forth his english and our iroquois to stop the incursions of the french and hurons is just from our confederate troops arrived  sak alas how fares my ulamar  okim before the sun which now declines is set you may expect to hear it from himself for beaufort left him just prepared to follow  sak now the great mind be praised my son has lost then and the french are victors  okim no my sakia the ruler of the world is not so partial nor are the guardian spirits so remiss which hover with their golden wings over canada your lovely son the auspicious ulamar no less the darling is of heaven than ours a thousand french and hurons pale and breathless extended on yon plain proclaim him victor and in the bloody business of the day no single arm dealt fate so much as ulamars  sak ah wretched me thou have rowzd all my griefs  okim how my sabia is your sons triumph then become your grief his death had been your joy then  sak ah no thou know i dote upon my ulamar and when the graces of his mind and person with reasons eye severely i survey reason severely judging yet assures me that i have cause for all the mothers fondness yet know my okima his death and victory i feared alike  okim you utter mysteries beyond my reach  sak thou know my son that with the generous beaufort now leads the bloody iroquois to battle no iroquois by birth no native is of angie  okim i know you both indeed by birth are hurons  sak hurons we once were called and once were thought to be descended from no vulgar stock but now alas are sunk to wretched slaves  okim to slaves sakia your son at least has other sentiments  sak however alas my son may be deceived i am a slave a miserable slave who far removed from my sweet native soil far from the dearer partner of my heart have for twelve tedious years been now confined to drag the galling yoke of loathsome life in this accursed place a burden which i never could support but that i had some glimpse of hope remaining that cruel fortune might at length relent and might at length restore me with my ulamar to the dear partner of my faithful heart those hopes have lately been revived and animated by the prophetic visions of the night and expectation of this fatal action but this relation has overthrown them all my sons mistaken valor has undone us and thou o miramont art lost for ever  okim forget your hurons and become an angian  sak o may the whole accursed race by fate be rooted even from human memory perish their very names too with their persons excepting thine for thou art wondrous good  okim sakia you forget to curse your benefactors thus is impious  sak to curse our mortal enemies is just  okim the angians are your friends and your defenders  sak my countrys mortal enemies are mine  okim iroquian angie is your country now  sak my prison never can be called my country  okim the angians gave you liberty at first the hour that made you captives saw you free  sak why am i then with my unhappy son detained ever since in this detested clime enjoying nothing but the name of liberty which hourly brings the thing to my remembrance and makes the yoke of slavery wring me more know that i am not deluded by a word and even this shadow of the angians favor is due to the request of generous beaufort for he the fatal expedition led to which i owe this long captivity to which i owe a twelve years mortal woe confined by barbarous iroquois to angie which may just heaven by sharpest plagues revenge  okim you curse the victors heaven has cursed the vanquished  sak now they are conquerors i will hate them more  okim think that our conquest to your son we owe then curse us if you can  sak therefore the barbarous iroquois i curse  okim upon your sons account you ought to bless us think on our bounties heaped upon his head  sak think on the trophies by his valor won with which tenfold your bounty he repays  okim it is to our favor that he owes his glory which though he scarce has reached his twentieth year surpasses that of all our ancient warriors  sak it is by his glory you exist but he to fortune and himself his glory owes and the instructions of the generous beaufort  okim leading our forces he acquired his fame  sak yes against the hurons our obligations there indeed are great for causing him to turn his fatal sword upon the bleeding bowels of his country and its confederate friends the warlike french who for strong reasons ought to be most dear to him  okim poorly your partial mind affects the french while he detests the false perfidious race and threatens to extirpate all those gay but rank and filthy weeds from canada which lately crept usurping through the corn toppress the genuine and the noble seed  sak tho know him not he is ignorant of himself and both are blind alike but one day fate will dissipate the impenetrable cloud that now obscures his sight and then too late his fond and fatal error he will detest  okim but why for he who does his duty first must know it  sak but this he knows at present that the french are strictly to his countrymen allied  okim he owns no country but iroquian angie who to the french must prove eternal foes  sak time will instruct him better  okim yes for our angie will become to morrow his country by a stricter dearer tie  sak what meanest thou  okim a tie that will for ever fix him ours  sak explain thy self  okim to morrows sun will see that beauty his for whom the loveliest of our indian swains have sighed and sighed in vain  sak thou mean the blooming daughter of zephario head of the iroquian tribes  okim who can be meant but blessed irene whom divided canada consents to adore and they who come from distant climes admire the adoration of two worlds the english to whom uncommon beauty is familiar astonished gaze at her amazing form as at a wonder never seen before  sak yes the brave beaufort too admires irene and to her lays an equal claim with ulamar and for that reason thou art wrong informed for angie dares not disoblige the english  okim but when the rival friends went out to battle thus said the wise zephario ye matchless friends thou beaufort and thou ulamar ye great and fair supports of liberty and canada against a faithless race who have perfidiously surpised our angians and in full peace with sword and fire attacked them lead forth our arms against the perjured foe and know that he who for the common cause against that foe performs the noblest deeds at his return shall call irene his the father said the charming daughter blushed and to the just decree the friends consented  sak my ulamar is not returned from fight how can that difference be determined then  okim by the relation of impartial beaufort by which he owns that your unequalled son by his wise conduct and his brave example saved both his english and our iroquois  sak that was the modesty of generous beaufort but when he owned this was irene present  okim yes and in spite of all her shy demureness joy lightened on a sudden from her eyes which struggling she suppressed and blushing frowned or i am mistaken or she loves your ulamar  sak confusion  okim come she is worthy of the first of men  sak it is true so fair a creature i never saw even i whom powerful reasons force to hate her even i with pleasure gaze upon her face and viewing grow insensibly her friend but may she perish ever she weds my ulamar nay may they perish both  okim to both youre cruel  sak no for if once their hands are joined he is lost to me and to the best of fathers lost who loved him as the darling of his soul and to restore him to whose tender arms i have endured to live thus long a slave  okim but see the noble beaufort comes to attend you  scene ii sakia okima beaufort sak youre welcome worthy beaufort  okim they who bring victory are always welcome  sak had he been vanquished he had been more welcome is ulamar arrived  beauf each minute he is expected  sak well you have conquered then  beauf yes impartial heaven has heard our just appeal and has supported innocence and faith against injustice treason violence against oppression perjury and fraud and all the crimes of the perfidious french  sak they needs must conquer for whom heaven declares in spite of all the valor of their foes  beauf madam their valor much you over rate they know themselves and to themselves are just while they are false to all the world beside they feel themselves too guilty to be brave it is a shrewd sign their valor they mistrust who still on treason or on odds depend but against odds and treasons both we conquered such force derived we from the just disdain that honor innocence and heavenly truth should yield to falsehood and to hellborn crimes that thought alone sustained our sinking troops that thought inflamed them in extreme distress when one of them cried suddenly aloud lifting his wounded wearied arms to heaven thou maker of the world to whom we bow if it be thou and not blind chance that governs to thee we appeal here manifest thy justice  okim now by that power thou have set my soul on fire what followed  beauf not the last trumpet that must rowse the dead to them more sudden vigor shall convey than did to ours that animating voice all thought that heaven declared it self aloud strange sights were seen and wondrous sounds were heard it is said a flame descended upon ulamar and round his temples spread its lambent glory but this is sure his deeds were more than human and conquest lightning in his eyes and thundering in his arm roused all our vigor in our fainting troops and struck a fatal damp upon the foe  sak beaufort thou art too partial to thy friend  beauf i am not partial i am barely just  sak he who is so magnanimously just must have done greater wonders of his own do justice to thy self then  beauf what i performed i did not in the dark but earth and conscious heaven were both spectators i therefore need not speak  sak remember the reward think on irene  beauf she is always in my thoughts  sak and do you love her  beauf have i my sight to see her is to love her  sak and can you poorly quit her to another  beauf no nor would i basely win her  sak yet you exalt your rival to the skies  beauf that rival is your son and is my friend and still is partial when he mentions me  sak think of what love requires  beauf there is a duty due to friendship too a thousand lovers worship fair irene but who but i has such a friend as ulamar  sak the greatest friendship you can show my son is to deprive him of this fatal beauty i had rather see him in the arms of death than of zepharios daughter  beauf but he had rather die than not possess her  sak then let him die no let him live ye powers but let him live without her you love irene tell me would you win her  beauf i would by heaven but would not loose my ulamar  sak then let us jointly urge him to desist  beauf on what pretense  sak on that of gratitude the strongest in the world to a brave spirit can he be said to bear a grateful mind who strives against his benefactors bliss remind him of his obligations  beauf what obligations  sak he well remembers them though you forget too generous beaufort who snatched the dagger from his infant breast in that accursed hour that made us captives when only we of all the slaves were saved who forced the iroquois to give us liberty at least a show of liberty who since instructed him in glorious arms instructed him in european arts to whose dear friendship is his glory owing his noble acts and his accomplished greatness tell him aloud he owes all this to beaufort  beauf why should i tell him this  sak to urge him by the remembrance of these mighty benefits to quit his fond pretensions to irene and not impeach his happiness to whom whatever he has whater he is he owes  beauf he owes his greatness to himself alone and carries an instructor in his breast beyond what all the world can ever supply for ulamar seems sent express from heaven to civilize this rugged indian clime but grant to me alone he owed his greatness how base how barbarous would it be to upbraid him besides all this how vain for know your sons no vulgar passion is that force acquires by just degrees and kindles into flame his the first moment blasted him like lightning that falls from heaven when jove with his own fire that tree that is sacred to himself consumes  sak i but too well remember it  beauf immediately he had recourse to me who saw and therefore loved irene first then sorrow streaming from his humid eyes that sparkled with desire my friend says he i come to take my leave for i must die since only death can make me just to beaufort for only his cold hand can quench the flame that is injurious to my friend to whom the best of mothers and my self i owe and then i love said he with faltring tongue and with a heart about to break with grief i love irene and for beaufort die  sak and how received you this  beauf with some surprise but yet with firm resolve in height of friendship not to be surpassed but rather choose to hazard her than lose so faithful and so brave a friend as ulamar  sak o noble friendship unexampld rivalship were all thy countrymen like thee brave beaufort the sun himself in all his shining round since first his progress from the east began would never have seen a greater nobler people but still my soul from this disastrous love forebodes much mischief  scene iii sak okim beauf messengers shouts beauf what shouts of joy are these  mess just now victorious ulamars arrived and with these shouts the joyful angians welcome him  beauf kind heaven be praised  mess within an hour the angians meet in council mean while your friend attends you at your house  sak o heavens my son refuses then to see me  mess the french by ambassadors now proffer peace concerning which he would confer with you before the council meets  beauf tell him i come  scene iv sak okim beaufort beauf this proffered peace shall be refused with scorn if i have any credit with the angians they proffer peace their frontless european insolence when heaven against their perjuries declares and halting vengeance like a bloodhound slow but stanch oertakes them with his deep mouthed cry confounds their treasure and their troops consumes first they sing songs of triumph for their losses and then forsooth they give the world a peace oh it is a blessed peace that binds our hands and leaves theirs loose whom neither plighted faith nor vows nor solemnst oaths could ever restrain strong bonds if bonds perfidious men could tie  sak beaufort to you i now a suppliant come ta thousand obligations add one more which if you grant me not the rest are vain  beauf but name it and it is yours  sak provide that i may with my son confer before the council meet who will i know decide this famous rivalship  beauf that madam shall be my immediate care  scene v sakia okima sak ah okima i sink i die with grief on this important now depends my all for should my ulamar obstruct this peace and obstinately should espouse irene then name a wretch that is so accursed as i  okim come you provoke the indulgent powers to leave you and lose your sons advantage and your own for both you will in this happy marriage find  sak once more thou know him not nor he himself for hitherto within this wretched breast from all the world i have kept the important mystery but now my spirit groans beneath its load and i would ease my overburthend soul  okim discharge it then upon this faithful breast  sak but first by that eternal spirit swear swear by that awful that allseeing mind that conscious is alone to the dread secret to let no time nor art nor force extort it from thy mind  okim by that eternal conscious power i swear  sak know then my son who thinks himself a huron and whom too thou believst of indian birth no huron is nor of canadian kind know he descended of a christian sire young valiant beautiful of noble race  okim a christian you amaze me of what nation  sak consult my passions and let those inform thee  okim what say thou then by nation he is french  sak french is his nation miramont his name  okim why is this secret from your son concealed  sak let time and fate reveal it to him  okim why not his mother  sak i dare not  okim what should deter you  sak know that my guardian spirit in my dreams has more than once with fearful threats forbid me besides the important secret should i tell before my son has seen and known his father so deadly is his hatred to the french the which together with his years grew up it might a criminal aversion cause to him who gave him being and besides all hopes of peace it surely would destroy for that upon his sentiment depends but he who angie to the world prefers will do his utmost to obstruct a peace that needs must tear him from this cursed clime he will know that peace will soon divnlge his birth and knows the angians never will endure to have a frenchman lead their troops to battle besides should ulamar this secret hear before he sees and knows his noble father it might produce an impious thought of me  okim this is but one of those fantastic fears to which long melancholy makes you subject for why should it produce that impious thought  sak in secret miramont and i were matched and thrice three years in bonds clandestine lived in secret too i brought forth ulamar and for three years in private was he nursed and five i bred him with me as my slave by miramont presented to my father and then your angians made us real captives when first my husbands hands and mine were joined no soul was conscious to my plighted troth but heaven and miramont and the poor priest that kindly tied the indissoluble bond should miramont avert it heaven be gone to that strange land where souls departed dwell what thoughts might such a tale produce in ulamar  okim the priest who joined you might attest your marriage  sak long since alas that faithful friend is dead  okim but why that tedious nine years mystery  sak know that my miramont of noble race was yet a younger brother of his house and therefore he depended on his king now with that king those haughty priests have power who style themselves companions of their god and they unless i would embrace their faith forbad all nuptial league twixt me and miramont upon the penance of his kings displeasure  okim when you were taken where was miramont  sak he then was in a distant fort besieged which for his monarch bravely he maintained  okim have you never since had tidings of him  sak ah there thou probst me to the very heart i since have never never heard of him  okim perhaps by fortune of that war he fell  sak should i believe thee my sad heart would break and i dear miramont once more should join thee but the great mind is merciful and good and may have comfort yet for poor sakia that i from miramont have never heard proceeds from the vast tract of land between us or want of commerce twixt the french and you or from the unusual names your nation gave us when first they brought us mourful slaves to angie for i whom the angians now sakia call nikaia was through all the huronian land and ulamar young miramont was there  okim but should he live you three can never meet for as this secret to the world divulged ruins your son with these five warlike nations so twill disgrace your husband with the french their priests offended would incense their king  sak my okima know things are altered much for by long conferences here with beaufort my son and i both strongly are inclined to embrace the christian faith  okim ye powers who ever in so short a time displayed such various wonders yet miramont by strong presumptions dead and it is your safety to promote this match  sab what with my husbands mortal enemies  okim the dead have none death reconciles us all  sak but know that once my miramont when in a dangerous state upon the bed of languishment he lay caused me to swear by all that i revered even by the sacred bond that joined our hands by love the sacred tie that joined our souls and by the bright eternal source of love that when my ulamar arrived to manhood i never would wed him to an indian maid but would transport him to those happy climes that the ocean from our canada divides besides in the dread visions of the night i now for three successive nights have seen miramont threatening with a dreadful frown irene and the lovesick ulamar these dreams are to my son of dire presage and here remind me ever it be too late to run and tear him from impending fate  act ii scene i sakia beaufort sak when meets the council  beauf already they are assembled and now dispose of mine and your sons fate the beautiful irene and in an hour here we expect zephario who must impart their final resolution to us  sak have they debated yet of peace and war  beauf that the angian council have referred to me and to your son and to the wise zephario  sak when will my son vouchsafe to hear his mother  beauf see where he comes to attend you  scene ii sakia ulamar ulam my mother  sak my son oh may the bounty of the eternal mind shower down his choicest blessings on my ulamar  ulam oh may he but prolong the present blessing that i may iong behold the best of mothers  sak and yet you could desert this mother ulamar and could resist her absolute commands and all her soft entreaties could despise and i behold thee here in spite of both all dismal with the precious blood of hurons and their allies heaven knows alas whose blood why would thou thus against my softest prayers do an unnatural deed that thus should pierce the tender bowels of the wretch that bore thee  ulam and how could i avoid it how resist the almighty voice of god and the great call of nature urging me to repel force by force and to defend my self and you  sak o name not me for me thou have undone  ulam and how could i resist my countrys call that awful call that in extreme distress aloud implored my aid  sak thy country ah thou foughtst against it ulamar and have embrud thy hands in its dear blood  ulam my hands are nobly painted with the blood of hurons and of french its mortal foes  sak and can thou then so utterly forget that thou were born upon the huronian lake  ulam no but i know that i am an angian now my hand my heart my soul are angians all  sak and has a twelve years bondage so estranged thee that thou esteemst thy countrymen thy foes o weakness to be pitied or despised  ulam for ever blessed be that eternal power that gave me a human comprehensive soul that can look down upon all narrow principles for every brave mans country is the universe his countrymen mankind but chiefly those who wish the happiness of all the rest and who are friends to all their fellow creatures and such are all the brave iroquian tribes such are the unconquered english free themselves and loving all who actually are free and all who sadly sigh for liberty but hating tyrants and their slaves alike and equally contemning both as fallen below the dignity of human nature  sak tyrants are odious slaves are to be pitied our own sad fate has told us so  ulam to me all slaves are odious as their tyrants i mean all slaves who are the tools of tyrants they are true slaves who have the souls of slaves and worse than beasts make use of their own hands to clinch the chains which first their masters tied such tame and wretched things are all your hurons no countrymen for me who here disown them such are those pests of human race the french damned to eternal slavery themselves and therefore would like devils damn mankind  sak the hurons thou disownst disown them still but know amongst them are thy dear relations whom god and nature charges thee to cherish how can thou tell that in the late fought field thou did not meet thy father in thy foe yes how can thou be sure thou did not lift thy impious head against his sacred life and stabbing me in him in whom i live act in one blow a double paracide  ulam when ever i cease to hearken to the dictates of the worlds ruler and his servant nature i shall deserve to be a thing accursed in the late fight that i might spare my kindred i shunned your hurons and attacked the french and urging through their troops my glorious way i made a slaughter of their bravest chiefs which they will long with bitter woe remember  sak ha have a care thou say mankinds thy kindred among the french too thou might find relations  ulam it is true we were created brothers all and all descend from one eternal sire but whom the father for his sons disowns i  not for my brethren no the brave and just are only brethren worthy me and such i shall respect where ever i find them  sak and can thou fondly think there are no such among the squadrons of the warlike french  ulam i know there are when first in the late fight with my good sword i carried death among the faithless french one of their foremost leaders i observed who mowed our iroquois like ripened corn extending them in ranks along the plain with him went all his soldiers hearts and eyes and long live miramont aloud they cried  sak ha miramont ah gods apart speak that again  ulam yes long live miramont aloud they cried  sak speak on  apart though something dire is on thy tongue  ulam in short that frenchman showed himself so brave that he appeared a conquest worthy me  sak by heaven the very dismal thing i feared apart  ulam with indignation stung i on him flew and in my first attack was so successful that from his wounded arm his weapon dropped  sak what will become of the forlorn sakia apart  ulam then with revenge inflamed i on him rushed and my good sword presenting to his heart  sak o heaven and earth o nature can thou bear it apart  ulam die die said i perfidious villain die  sak o miramont thou darling of my soul would i had never heard of thee again apart o wretched father and o cursed son  ulam madam you tremble and a deadly pale oerspreads your face what strange disorders this  sak i am always on the wrack when blood is spilt  ulam then now be calm for here no blood was spilt  sak how is that indeed is it possible just heaven  ulam madam it is certain for looking sternly in the frenchmans face while fate stood threatening on my lifted arm through his undaunted eyes i saw his soul so great so awful and so truly noble that i revered the sight and checked my hand and gave him liberty the salt of life and sent him to his own and now you see i can acknowledge virtue in a foe and can respect it and reward it too  sak ha what a turn of wondrous fate is here and how shall i conceal my impetuous joy miramont lives my souls desire is near me apart and happiness begins to dawn from heaven he lives and love and i shall meet again oh unexpected ravishing return to bliss too swift and mighty to be born twas but last moment that i felt despair the very worst of ills and now i hope ay now i entertain the charming hope of holding him of whom my soul is fond of holding him in these desiring arms and i shall see o i shall die with joy yes i shall see my love my life again o let me see him gods and let me die  ulam madam your looks discover great disorder she hears me not nor sees me now her eyes seem deeply fixed upon some absent object and now they wildly roll what mean these musings and these sudden starts and these convulsions that thus shake her soul heaven long preserve my mother madam hear me some body comes retire before they appproach and be not seen in this extreme disorder leads her out and returns  scene iii ulamar beaufort beauf my ulamar  ulam my friend ha thou look sad whenever thou art grieved alas i find it is i my self that suffer what thought disturbs my friend  beauf thy sympathizing grief disturbs thy friend but when i think of losing thee oh then  ulam that loss would quickly be repaired for thou who made me what i am can make another and form him fit for friendship and for thee  beauf twas heaven alone could make thee what thou art a jewel of inestimable price i added to thy luster not thy worth and the small pains i took to make thee shine makes thee more precious in my joyful eyes but when i think of losing thee  ulam i will not think of losing thee i cannot bear the thought  beauf whose must irene be  ulam heaven only knows but will alas in one half hour declare  beauf whose is her heart for thou have often inquired  ulam but never yet could find  beauf to me she still has too respectful been and much too cold and too indifferent  ulam and too uneasy and reserved to me  beauf perhaps some happier man among the crowd of her adorers while we sigh in vain possesses all her soul it is hard to think that she whose beauty captivates all hearts should be like virtue with her self content and never know desire try her once more at this important juncture for i have searched into her heart in vain it is true my soul is of her beauty fond as even of glory with whose noble fire it twenty years succesfully has burned yet i who see my fortieth sun renewed will entertain no passion that revolts from reasons sovereign and eternal law it is true i would for who would not be blessed but will not by her misery be blessed  ulam nor i by heaven  beauf but now let me conjure thee ulamar even by that charming hope that makes us languish by holy friendships venerable bond that now confines us in this strict embrace by the remembrance of those happy hours which we have past exciting one another to elevated thoughts and glorious deeds for whomsoever fate reserves irene oh let him not be blessed by halves let him not lose his friend may never any coldness come till death between our loves and us  ulam not death himself unless he quite extinguishes my mind shall make me cold to beaufort  beauf but our fate comes and i must disappear  scene iv ulamar irene iren was not that beaufort why does he avoid us what makes him look so sad  ulam by heaven she seems concerned for him apart thrice happy beaufort whose sorrow even in absence has the force to move your soul while i before your eyes unpitied can despair  iren ah you mistake me ulamar oh that i had the power as i have the will to bring soft peace to every troubled breast  ulam and it is that virtue that undoes me more it is not that angels face nor angels form that form surpassing all your lovely sex it is not that winning pomp of outward graces which upon you as on their queen attend but it is your mind that captivates my soul your mind in youths first bloom with every grace and every virtue fraught as if that heaven and natures self took pleasure to instruct you before i beheld thee my restless soul to something high to something great aspired but what i never could tell till seeing thee and knowing thee informed and fixed my ravished soul and showed it what with blind and restless search before it sought in vain yes showed it virtue virtue it self that by great heavens command assumes that lovely form tattract mankind and draw them to it self but while you captivate the gazing world you still remain serene as if that heaven designed you not to love but be adored appearing not to know how very warm how sharply pointed are those fatal eyes smiling you kill and know not that you strike and we with pleasure die  iren oh fond mistaken ulamar oh never more deceived know all the extremities of love i feel  ulam you love  iren i am all love i burn i die with love  ulam it is sure for some immortal being then for mortal man could never conceal his joy  iren alas he knows it not no more than ulamar  ulam let him be told it ever it be too late is it for beaufort i will resign to beaufort for though i love thee more than life it self though it is impossible to live without thee to show thee how much i prefer thy happiness before my own i will to make thee happy i will leave thee the loveliest thing in nature for death the most detestable  iren beaufort assure thy self has all my esteem but it is another that has all my heart  ulam o man whose happiness even gods might envy my friend and i for i for him dare answer will no advantage take of what the council and wise zephario shall anon determine but both oh gods to him resign our claim  iren aside o matchless love o proof of godlike virtue while he speaks this behold with what convulsions his struggling passion shakes his generous frame with whose excess he trembles and he dies  ulam but oh if ever thou could be too blame thou would be so in this for why oh why have thou so long concealed the fatal secret  iren because i never could till now declare it without exposing too much shameful weakness therefore my raging passion i confined which burning inward preyed upon my life but from the man i loved i hid it most in this alas i sympathize with you it is not my lovers form ensnares my heart though his our angian virgins all adore but when i saw a youth in his first bloom lead our brave iroquois with more success than our most ancient and experienced warriors perform such wonders for his countreys safety and for the libertys of humankind to which he sacrifices his repose and even his life and hazards the enjoyment of what he loves much dearer even than life  ulam oh gods o transport whither is she going  iren when i beheld all this you may be sure the almighty mind has given to me a soul that could not see a lover with these virtues these godlike virtues and remain insensible the joy that lightens from thy humid eyes informs me that thou understandst me ulamar and i designed thou should but then be sure thy godlike virtue which inflamed my heart has in my breast produced the noble pride of imitating so much excellence as thou have sacrifizd repose and life and hazarded thenjoyment even of me whom thou love more than life for thy dear country i though a woman nobly will attempt to emulate thy singular example and though i love nay dote to madness dote though my heart feels what never tongue can utter yet if my country once decrees me beauforts for beaufort i will retrieve my heart and never see thee more  ulam oh too accomplished beaufort oh my friend what have i lost by thy transcendent virtue  scene v zephario irene

wondrous friendship moved preserved thee ulamar by our own flying troops as by a torrent overborn overwhelmed trampled by friends surrounded by the foe and stood the barrier betwixt thee and fate that threatened thee from friends and foes alike the council wisely have decreed that he who saved thheroick youth to whom we owe our conquest did with him preserve the state and therefore have decreed him for reward a trifle in it self but dear to him my daughter  beauf madam do you consent  iren i do  beauf my ulamar do thou  ulam oh take her while i have voice to say she is thine  beauf oh strange
