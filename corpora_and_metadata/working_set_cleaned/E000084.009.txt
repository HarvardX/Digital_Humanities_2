writings of george washington    0 george washington    october    0 passaic falls governor reed to governor reed head quarters passaic falls    october    0 sir with respect to prisoners of war mentioned in your excellencys letter of the  d inst i beg leave to observe that it has been my wish from the beginning of the contest to the present day that no distinction should exist with respect to them that the whole should be considered on one general and liberal scale as belonging to the states and not to this or that state be exchanged according to their rank and the order of their captivity—and that all military prisoners taken from the enemy no matter where or by whom should be deemed as belonging to the public at large and be applied generally for the release of those in the enemys hands this has been my wish because it appeared to be just the only principle which could give general satisfaction in conformity to it all exchanges in the course of the war resting solely with me and made by my directions have been conducted and it has been my constant direction where the point depended wholly on me that the prisoners with the enemy were to be exchanged agreeable to it particular cases however   may arise where it may be proper to depart from the principle but these can be but rare and the principle where the business was entirely with me has never been deviated from in a single instance as to the case of lt colo simcoe and lt colo conolly—the former was captured by the jersey militia before the resolution passed which you inclose was confined by the state who also made his exchange the exchange of the latter was directly in consequence of a requisition by the state of maryland who claimed him to the honble the board of war who thought their claim was first this state claimed it on the examples and practise of some other states in like cases who had made exchanges without the interference or consulting any but their own authority when i received the boards letter upon the subject—i informed them tho i directed the exchange for the reasons i have mentioned and the considerations subjoined that previous to their letter i had supposed that citizens or inhabitants captured by the enemy were the objects to whom the act meant a preference should be given and that all officers in captivity were to stand upon a common footing to be released on the principle of priority of capture but as the terms of the act were not entirely explicit and the opinion of the board was in favor of the claim the sentiments i entertained of lt colo ramsays merit and indeed the recollection of the day of his capture his conduct upon the occasion and the whole circumstances by which he was placed   in a situation that exposed him to more than a common risk of falling or being taken determined me not to oppose the measure i have upon the present occasion attended minutely to the act—and i am fully persuaded from a recurrence to some of my correspondence on the subject of it long previous to its being passed that my ideas of it were right and that the construction and operation i supposed it should have was the true one the draft of it i find was in my possession for consideration so far back as the summer    as a regulation intended for placing the business of prisoners and their exchanges upon a different footing from what it then was and i returned it with this observation that the regulations appeared judicious and proper—such as i had a long time wished to see take place adding that it appeared to be the intention to make a distinction between prisoners and prisoners of war which was no doubt a proper and necessary one under the first i meant to comprehend citizens and civil characters not usually considered or made prisoners of exchange but whom nevertheless the enemy were seizing and taking whenever they could in order to release their officers in our hands under the last officers and soldiers of the army or militia actually taken in arms it was the practise of the states to exchange the former for military prisoners and particular officers out of the order of their captivity for officers they had taken that excited the clamor and dissatisfaction among the officers in general who were prisoners i think there should be no preference   under the idea of state captures with respect to the exchanges of military prisoners the terms of the act seem to require it i think it was the intention and if it should have a different operation it does not remove at least but in a very remote and partial degree the causes which were complained of and which appear evidently on examination from the introduction to have been the mischiefs intended to be remedied but on the contrary it would sanction partial or state exchanges of officers and only change the mode of carrying the business into execution by placing it in the hands of the continental commissary instead of the commissaries of the individual states and i am to observe further that the resolution of congress by which i am authorized to go into exchanges now in contemplation to be carried into effect points out and directs priority of capture as a governing principle i have been thus particular for your satisfaction       george washington  0 october    0 major lee to major lee head quarters  0 october    0 dear sir the plan proposed for taking a—  the outlines of which are communicated in your letter which was this moment put into my hands without a date has every mark of a good one i therefore agree to the promised rewards and have such entire confidence in your management of this business as to give it my fullest   approbation and leave the whole to the guidance of your own judgment with this express stipulation and pointed injunction that he a—d is brought to me alive no circumstance whatever shall obtain my consent to his being put to death the idea which would accompany such an event would be that ruffians had been hired to assassinate him my aim is to make a public example of him—and this should be strongly impressed upon those who are employed to bring him off the sergeant must be very circumspect—too much zeal may create suspicion—and too much precipitancy may defeat the project the most inviolable secrecy must be observed on all hands i send you five guineas but i am not satisfied of the propriety of the sergeants appearing with much specie—this circumstance may also lead to suspicion as it is but too well known to the enemy that we do not deal much in this article the interviews between the party in and out of the city should be managed with much caution and seeming indifference or else the frequency of their meetings c may betray the design and involve bad consequences    george washington    october    0 majorgeneral heath to majorgeneral heath headquarters    october    0 dear sir i have recd your favor of the  0th the disposition you have made of the troops at and near west point is agreeable to me the two small regiments at present at kings ferry were purposely stationed   there because they could not be brigaded with convenience they are shortly to be reformed and incorporated and therefore had best remain where they are untill that time genl greene had proposed to remove every superfluous store from those posts so that in case of necessity they might be evacuated with little loss he was of opinion that the enemy would if they came up seriously run an armed vessel or two above them and render the removal of the stores by water impracticable this seemed so probable a conjecture that i desired him to strip them of all but very few stores you will be pleased to follow that method the minister of france may soon be expected from the eastward should he take you in his way or should you hear certainly of his approach be pleased to give me notice of it by express i am c george washington    october    0 to the president of congress headquarters near passaic falls    october    0 sir i have been honored with your excellencys favors of the  0th and   th instants—the advance of the british army towards the borders of north carolina is an alarming circumstance more especially as there is every reason to believe that the force which lately sailed from new york is intended to coöperate with them  the enemy by several accounts received a   reinforcement from europe in the last fleet it is said by some to consist of two british regiments about seven hundred german recruits and some from scotland if so this new accession is nearly equal to their late detachment but others again say the reinforcement consists wholly of recruits i have heard nothing directly from the northward since my letter of the   th there are reports that the enemy retired after destroying fort anne fort george and burning some houses it is thought and perhaps not without foundation that this incursion was made upon a supposition that arnolds treachery had succeeded  colonel brodhead has in many of his late letters expressed his apprehension of the consequences which may result from the want of provisions should the enemy agreeably to their threats invest the post   of fort pitt this winter but by a letter from him of the   th of september matters had proceeded to such extremities that the garrison headed by the noncommissioned officers had waited upon him and he says in a decent manner remonstrated upon the hardship of having been without bread for five days upon being told that every thing would be done to relieve them they retired in good order colonel brodhead adds that the country is not deficient in resources but that public credit is exhausted and will no longer procure supplies congress will therefore see the necessity of either furnishing the commissary to the westward with a competent sum of money or of obtaining from the state of pennsylvania an assurance that the part of the quota of supplies demanded of her by the requisition of congress of february last and directed to be deposited in the magazines to the westward which were intended for the support of fort pitt shall be immediately laid in if it has not been already done the importance of that post to the whole western frontier is so great as not to admit of its being left to any risk if it can be avoided    since i began this letter i have received advices from governor clinton at albany who mentions that a party of the enemy which came from the northward had retired by the way of lake george but that another party from the westward had penetrated as far as schoharie which valuable settlement they had destroyed the governor himself was going to schenectady to make a disposition of the   force in that quarter i have sent up two continental regiments to his assistance which i hope will be sufficient to repel the enemy as they are not represented as very numerous fort schuyler is well garrisoned and has forty days provision in it i therefore hope no great danger is to be apprehended from the present incursion i have the honor to be c  george washington october   d    0 preakness majorgeneral greene to majorgeneral greene instructions sir congress having been pleased by their resolution of the  th instant to authorize me to appoint an officer to the command of the southern army in the room of majorgeneral gates till an inquiry can be had into his conduct as therein directed i have thought proper to choose you for this purpose you will therefore proceed without delay to the southern army now in north carolina and take the command accordingly uninformed as i am of the enemys force in that quarter of our own or of the resources which it will be in our power to command for carrying on the war i can give you no particular instructions but must leave you to govern yourself entirely according to your own prudence  0 and judgment and the circumstances in which you find yourself i am aware that the nature of the command will offer you embarrassments of a singular and complicated nature but i rely upon your abilities and exertions for every thing your means will enable you to effect i give you a letter to the honorable the congress informing them of your appointment and requesting them to give you such powers and such support as your situation and the good of the service demand you will take their orders in your way to the southward i also propose to them to send the baron de steuben to the southward with you his talents knowledge of service zeal and activity will make him very useful to you in all respects and particularly in the formation and regulation of the raw troops who will principally compose the southern army you will give him a command suited to his rank besides employing him as inspectorgeneral if congress approve it he will take your orders at philadelphia i have put major lees corps under marching orders and as soon as he is ready shall detach him to join you as it is necessary the inquiry into the conduct of majorgeneral gates should be conducted in the quarter in which he has acted where all the witnesses are and where alone the requisite information can be obtained i have to desire as soon as the situation of affairs will possibly permit you will nominate a court of inquiry to examine into this case agreeably to the aforementioned resolution of congress majorgeneral the baron de steuben    will preside at this court and the members will consist of such general and field officers of the continental troops as were not present at the battle of camden or being present are not wanted as witnesses or are persons to whom majorgeneral gates has no objection i wish this affair to be conducted with the greatest impartiality and with as much despatch as circumstances will permit you will on your arrival at the army take the sense in writing of the general officers and other principal officers concerning the practicability of an immediate inquiry if they judge it practicable on the principles of these instructions you will have it carried into execution if they do not think it can take place immediately you will inform general gates of it and transmit to me their determination and you will from time to time pursue the same mode that any delay which may happen may appear as i am persuaded it will really be unavoidable the court need not consist of more than five nor must it consist of less than three members and in all cases there must be three general officers should general gates have any objection to the mode of inquiry which he wishes to make to congress or to me you will suspend proceeding in the affair till he transmits his objection and you receive further orders you will keep me constantly advised of the state of your affairs and of every material occurrence my warmest wishes for your success reputation health and happiness accompany you given at head quarters preakness october   d    0     george washington    october    0 george mason to george mason  headquarters passaic falls    october    0 dear sir in consequence of a resolve of congress directing an enquiry into the conduct of general gates and authorizing me to appoint some other officer in his place during the enquiry i have made choice of majorgeneral greene who will i expect have the honor of presenting you with this letter i can venture to introduce this gentleman to you as a man of abilities bravery and coolness he has a comprehensive knowledge of our affairs and is a man of fortitude and resources i have not the smallest doubt therefore of his employing all the means    which may be put into his hands to the best advantage—nor of his assisting in pointing out the most likely ones to answer the purposes of his command with this character i take the liberty of recommending him to your civilities and support for i have no doubt from the embarrassed situation of southern affairs of his standing much in need of the latter from every gentleman of influence in the assemblies of those states as general greene can give you the most perfect information in detail of our present distresses and future prospects i shall content myself with giving the aggregate account of them and with respect to the first they are so great and complicated that it is scarcely within the powers of description to give an adequate idea of them—with regard to the second unless there is a material change both in our military and civil policy it will be in vain to contend much longer we are without money and have been so for a great length of time without provision and forage except what is taken by impress without cloathing and shortly shall be in a manner without men in a word we have lived upon expedients till we can live no longer and it may truly be said that the history of this war is a history of false hopes and temporary devices instead of system and œconomy which results from it if we mean to continue our struggles and it is to by hoped we shall not relinquish our claims we must do it upon an entire new plan we must have a permanent force not a force that is constantly fluctuating    and sliding from under us as a pedestal of ice would do from a statue in a summers day involving us in expence that baffles all calculation—an expence which no funds are equal to— we must at the same time contrive ways and means to aid our taxes by loans and put our finances upon a more certain and stable footing than they are at present our civil government must likewise undergo a reform—ample powers must be lodged in congress as the head of the federal union adequate to all the purposes of war unless these things are done our efforts will be in vain and only serve to accumulate expence add to our perplexities and dissatisfy the people without a prospect of obtaining the prize in view but these sentiments do not appear well in a hasty letter without digestion or order i have not time to give them otherwise—and shall only assure you that they are well meant however crude they may appear with sincere affection c     george washington    october    0 preakness majorgeneral gates to majorgeneral gates headquarters preakness    october    0 sir i enclose you a resolution of congress of the  th instant directing me to order a court of inquiry to be held on your conduct as commander of the southern army and to appoint an officer to command that army in your room until such inquiry be made in obedience to this order i have appointed majorgeneral greene to the command and i have instructed him respecting the inquiry in the manner which the enclosed extract from his instructions will show it appeared to me that the business could be nowhere so properly conducted as with the army where the transactions which will enter into the inquiry took place and where every kind of light can with the most facility be obtained i could not however order it immediately to commence because it is possible that the situation of affairs might render it impracticable but i have endeavored to take every precaution to prevent delay if it is not unavoidable should you have any objection to the mode proposed i shall be obliged to you to communicate it to me with your reasons in the fullest assurance that it is my aim to execute the orders of congress in the manner most consistent with justice to the public and to you in this case general greene will suspend proceeding till i receive your objections and send him further instructions i am c     george washington    october    0 to the board of war headquarters    october    0 gentlemen i am honored with your letter of the   th the enemy seem to be practising the arts of corruption so extensively that i think we cannot be too much upon our guard against its effects nor ought we to neglect any clues that may lead to discoveries but on the other hand we ought to be equally circumspect in admitting suspicions or proceeding upon them without sufficient evidence it will be the policy of the enemy to distract us as much as possible by sowing jealousies and if we swallow the bait no characters will be safe there will be nothing but mutual distrust in the present case from every thing i have heard of your informant i should suspect him of the worst intentions and notwithstanding what we are told about the motives which obliged him to leave the enemy i still think it probable he came out as a spy and that the assigned causes are either altogether fictitious or being real were made the inducement with him for undertaking the errand to avoid punishment as well as obtain a reward the kind of information he is willing to give may be    received but in my opinion it would be a very improper foundation for an inquiry unless the circumstances of it have much more weight than the character of the witness i have the honor to be c george washington  0 october    0 marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette headquarters  0 october    0 it is impossible my dear marquis to desire more ardently than i do to terminate the campaign by some happy stroke but we must consult our means rather than our wishes and not endeavor to better our affairs by attempting things which for want of success may make them worse we are to lament that there has been a misapprehension of our circumstances in europe but to endeavor to recover our reputation we should take care that we do not injure it more ever since it became evident that the allied arms could not cooperate this campaign i have had an eye to the point you mention determined if a favorable opening should offer to embrace it but so far as my information goes the enterprise would not be warranted it would in my opinion be imprudent to throw an army of ten thousand men upon an island against nine thousand exclusive of seamen and militia this from the accounts we have appears to be the enemys force all we can therefore at present do is to endeavor to gain a more certain knowledge of their situation and act accordingly this i have been some time employed in doing but hitherto with little success i shall thank you for any aids    you can afford arnolds flight seems to have frightened all my intelligencers out of their senses i am sincerely and affectionately yours  george washington   november    0 abner nash to abner nash governor of north carolina headquarters passaic falls   november    0 sir i had the honor yesterday to receive your excellencys letter of the  th of october and am extremely obliged to you for the intelligence contained in it it is of so great importance that the earliest and best intelligence of all the great movements and designs of the enemy as well as of the situation of our own affairs should be obtained that i must entreat you will be so good as to favor me with such communications as may have any influence on our military arrangements and operations while i sincerely lament the distressed and exhausted situation of the southern states i cannot but hope the enemy have committed themselves so far as to be made to repent their temerity especially since i have received information of a more recent date than your letter of the success of the militia against colonel    ferguson this i flatter myself will give a better aspect to your affairs and will awaken more extensively that spirit of bravery and enterprise which displayed itself so conspicuously on the occasion the enemy seem again to have adopted the same system of policy they have before presented with but too much success of making detachments to the southward at a time when our army is greatly reduced by the expiration of the services of the levies who were raised for the campaign only besides the detachment under general leslie which has landed in virginia it is reported another embarkation is taking place at n york but i have great confidence in the exertion of the southern states when their all is at stake and in the abilities of general greene to call forth and apply the resources of the country in the best and most effectual manner to its defence majorgeneral the baron steuben who accompanies him possesses the most distinguished military talents and has rendered signal service to this army as inspectorgeneral major lee has also marched to join the southern army with his legion the arrival of a reinforcement in new york nearly equal to the late detachment and the incursion of a large force of which i have just received intelligence from canada on the northern and western frontiers of the state of new york where great devastation has already been committed will i fear render it impossible to make any further detachments from this army to the southward i have the honor to be c  0 george washington   november    0 robert carter nicholas to robert carter nicholas headquarters passaic falls   november    0 dear sir i am perswaded that the letters of which the inclosed are copies never reached your hands i take the liberty of forwarding a duplicate of the last and triplicate of the first—with the inclosures it refers to since mine of march to you i have been favored with a third letter from our good friend colonel fairfax copy of which i also send and should be happy in knowing that you had accepted the appointment he mentions in order that i might direct all his papers to be carefully packed up and sent to you i hope i trust that no act of legislation in the state of virginia has affected or can affect the property of this gentleman otherwise than in common with that of every good and well disposed citizen of america it is a well known fact that his departure for england was not only antecedent to the present rupture with great britain but before there was the most distant prospect of a serious dispute with that country and if it is necessary to adduce proof of his attachment to the interests of america since his residence there and of the aid he has given to many of our distressed countrymen in that kingdom abundant instances may be produced not only by the gentlemen alluded to in his letter of december        but by others that are known to me and on whom justice to col fairfax will make it necessary to call if occasion should require the facts to be ascertained about the time of my writing to you in march last    i communicated the contents of col fairfaxs letter of the  d of august      to col lewis and received for an answer that the bad state of his health would render it impossible for him to discharge the trust col fairfax wished to repose in you or him in a manner agreeable to himself and therefore could not think of engaging in it if you to whom i informed him i had written should decline it but he recommended in case of your refusal mr francis whiting the former manager of cols henry and william fitzhughs estate as a person most likely in his opinion to discharge the trust with punctuality my best respects attend your lady  family c george washington   november    0 to the president of congress headquarters   november    0 sir i have been honored with your excellencys favor of  st and am happy to find that my appointment of majorgeneral greene to the command of the southern army meets the approbation of congress    by letters from governor clinton i find that the enemy have gone off for the present from the mohawk river after totally destroying the country as low down as schoharie those upon the northern quarter had repassed lake george and were again proceeding towards st johns but suddenly returned with a reinforcement and were by accounts from genl schuyler of the  st instt assembled in so considerable force at ticonderoga that i have    thought proper to send up the remainder of the new york brigade from west point to albany that they may be ready to act as circumstances may require the destruction of the grain upon the western frontier of the state of new york is likely to be attended with the most alarming consequences in respect to the formation of magazines upon the north river we had prospects of establishing a very considerable magazine of flour in that quarter previous to the late incursion the settlement of schoharie only would have delivered eighty thousand bushels of grain but that fine district is now totally destroyed i should view this calamity with less concern did i see the least prospect of obtaining the necessary supplies of flour from the states of pennsylvania delaware and maryland previous to the interruption of transportation by frost and bad roads    while our army is experiencing almost daily want that of the enemy at new york is deriving ample supplies from a trade with the adjacent states of new york new jersey and connecticut which has by degrees become so common that it is hardly thought a crime it is true there are in those states laws imposing a penalty upon this criminal commerce but it is either so light or so little attended to that it does not prevent the practice the marketts of new york are so well supplied that a great number of mouths which would otherwise be fed from the public magazines are now supported upon the fresh meats and flour of the country by which    means the enemy have been often enabled to bear the disappointments of the arrival of their provision fleets without much inconvenience and if report be true they would at this very time experience distress for want of their long expected irish fleet if the resources of the country were effectually cut off from them this cannot be done by military measures alone except in cases of blockade or seige and much less will it be in my power to do it with our army in the weak state it is verging to i believe that most nations make it capital for their subjects to furnish their enemies with provisions and military stores during the war—was this done by the several states and the laws rigidly put in execution in a few instances the practice would be stopped without something of the kind the enemy will while they have a species of money of superior value to ours find little difficulty of making up the losses which they every now and then meet with at sea and which would very much embarrass their operations had they no immediate mode of making good the deficiency i have the pleasure to inform congress that at the late meeting of the respective commissaries the exchanges of about one hundred and forty of our officers and all our privates in new york amounting to four hundred and seventysix were effected among the former are majorgeneral lincoln  brigrgenerals    thompson waterbury and duportail and ltcolo laurens sir henry clinton having made a proposal of exchanging a further number of the convention officers without attaching men to them i have acceded to it by which we shall liberate all our officers in this quarter except one brigrgeneral irvine nine colonels one captain and thirtynine lieutenants an offer is made by sir henry clinton to exchange all those for a division of the convention troops by composition where rank will not apply to this i have refused to accede unless lieuttgeneral burgoyne is taken into the account if they will agree to this he alone will liberate nearly the whole of them they have further proposed a general exchange of the convention troops officers and men for our prisoners of war at the southward i have not thought proper to enter at all upon the business of southern prisoners because i have but a very imperfect state of them and because i perceive by the powers granted to majorgeneral greene that he is at liberty to negotiate the exchange of prisoners in that quarter    i have the honor to be c     george washington   november    0 majorgeneral greene to majorgeneral greene headquarters near passaic falls   november    0 dear sir i am favored with your letter of the   st of october and am glad to find your appointment so agreeable to the views and wishes of congress so fully sensible have i long been of the distressed situation of the army not only in this quarter but also to the southward and of all our great departments from the embarrassed state of our finances that it has been not only a constant subject of representation in the strongest terms to congress and to the states individually but particularly so to the minister of france at our last interview and that a foreign loan was absolutely necessary to retrieve our affairs my ideas therefore must have been exceedingly misapprehended by him or his by the baron steuben i entirely approve of your plan for forming a flying army and in addition to this if the enemy should continue to harass those parts of virginia which are intersected with large navigable rivers i would recommend the building a number of flatbottomed boats of as large a construction as can be conveniently transported on carriages this i conceive might be of great utility by furnishing the means to take advantage of the enemys situation by crossing those rivers which would otherwise be impassable i have also written to governor jefferson on the subject if a spirit of patriotism or even a true policy animates the merchants and men of property in the southern states a subscription may be attended with    success at least the experiment can do no injury general knox has received directions to send forward the compy of artillery an order will be given for the thousand stand of arms since writing the above i have received your favor of the  d inst lieutenantcol laurens will have heard of his exchange before this time and is at liberty to go to the southward if he thinks proper with respect to the power congress have invested you with to make exchanges i should suppose it regarded the prisoners taken in the southern department on the usual principles without involving the convention or any other troops to the northward a pretty extensive exchange has just taken place in this quarter it is impossible from the nonarrival of the french arms and the scarcity in the eastern states to furnish those requested by you nor do i think the legion of the duke de lauzun can be detached from the french army the fleet of arbuthnot which still blockades that of france in the harbor of newport effectually precludes the execution of the other plan our last advices from the northward mentioned another incursion of the enemy from canada in greater force in consequence of which the remainder of the york brigade is ordered thither there are reports that an embarkation is about to be made at new york but the accounts are vague and contradictory and the fact not yet ascertained i have to request you will be pleased to send by a flag of truce the enclosed letter to brigadiergenl duportail who is exchanged i am dear sir c    george washington   november    0 william fitzhugh to william fitzhugh headquarters passaic falls   november    0 dear sir    the favorable prospect which at one stage of the campaign was held up to view has vanished like the morning dew leaving scarce a trace behind it but the recollection of past distresses on the score of provisions the want of which continues to threaten us our accounts from the southward are vague and uncertain but agreeable if it be true that a body of french and spanish troops have landed in south carolina it may aid in the total destruction of cornwallis army another embarkation is talked of at new york—but this also is a matter suggestion—not certainly as to numbers it is devoutly to be wished that the late resolves of congress for regulating the army and completing the regiments for the war may receive all the energetic force of the respective states certain i am that if this measure had been adopted four or even three years ago that we might at this time have been sitting under our vines and figtrees in full enjoyment of peace and independence to attain which the delay of the measure is unfortunate it does not make it too late but more necessary to enter upon it vigorously at this late hour an army for the war proper magazines and sufficient powers in congress for all purposes of war will soon put an end to it—but the expensive and ruinous system we were pursuing was more than the friends    of any nation upon earth would bear and served to increase the hopes of the enemy in proportion as the minds of our people were depressed by a boundless prospect of expence which was increasing as it rolled on like a snow ball    george washington   november    0 governor jefferson to governor jefferson headquarters passaic falls   november    0 sir i have been honored with your excellencys favors of the   d   th and   th ulto we have already had reports that the enemy left portsmouth precipitately a few days after landing i shall be happy to hear it confirmed as well as the cause to which their hurry is attributed that of the appearance of a french or spanish fleet upon the coast of carolina should the account be premature and should they establish a post in virginia i think it will be good policy to remove the troops of convention to a greater distance from them general phillips has applied for passports for a flagvessel to proceed to james river as heretofore with clothing and other necessaries for those troops this will be granted and should they be removed from charlottesville your excellency will be pleased upon the arrival of the vessel in james river to give directions for her to proceed to the most convenient place of debarkation relatively to where the troops may be i am glad to hear that you have permitted governor hamilton and major hayes to go to new    york while they remain there upon parole they will be less capable of concerting mischief than in virginia and it will deprive the enemy of a pretext for complaining that they are treated with rigor another embarkation is said to be preparing at new york and i think it a very probable circumstance considering the situation of the enemys affairs in south carolina and ours in this quarter they are well acquainted with the expiration of the times of the better half of our army the latter end of december and they know they may safely detach equal to the number we disband from this time to the month of may or june next which is as soon as we generally get our recruits into the field should the enemy continue in the lower parts of virginia they will have every advantage by being able to move up and down the rivers in small parties while it will be out of our power to molest them for want of the means of suddenly transporting ourselves across those rivers to come at them this might be in a very great degree obviated and they kept in check if we had a number of say flatboats upon travelling carriages attending the army collected to watch their motions we could then move across from river to river with more rapidity than they could go down one and up another and none of their detachments would be ever secure by having the water between them and us majorgeneral greene is perfectly acquainted with the kind of boats i have mentioned and with the mode of fixing them he will give the proper directions for having them constructed should your  0 excellency approve the plan newcastle i think from its situation would be a good and safe place to build the boats i have the honor to be c george washington    november    0 majorgeneral heath to majorgeneral heath private headquarters    november    0 dear sir your forage will be made to subserve a project i have in view the success of which depending upon a concurrence of things and upon causes that are unalterable i have to request that matters may be so ordered by you as that the detachment employed on this occasion may be at white plains or as low down as you mean they shall go by two oclock on thursday the   d instant they will remain there that night upon their arms and as it is not unlikely that the enemy if they are in force at kingsbridge may attempt to surprise them a vigilant lookout is to be kept and small parties of horse and foot employed in patrolling the different roads leading from the enemys lines it is my earnest wish that you make your foraging party as strong and have it as well officered as possible i am of opinion that you may trust the several works as it will be for a few days only and this body will be in advance of them to the invalids and to such troops as are rendered unfit for the field on acct of cloathing the guardboats should upon this occasion be uncommonly alert they should proceed as low down as they can with safety and so    dispose of themselves as by signals to communicate the quickest intelligence of any movements on the river a chain of expresses may also be fixed between the foragers and yr quarters for the purpose of speedy information of any extra event or occurrence below it is unnecessary to be more explicit your own judgment and conviction of the precision with which this business especially in point of time should be executed will supply any omission of mine this that is the time of being at the white plains in force under the appearance of a large forage if you cannot make it real is the first object to be attended to i dare not commit my project to writing for fear of a miscarriage of my letter but it is more than probable that between this and the day of execution i shall send an officer to you with a detailed acct of it     so soon as this comes to hand i beg of you to send by water five boats of the largest size that can be conveniently transported on carriages to the slote above dobbss ferry where i will have them met by carriages let there be five good watermen from the jersey line if they have them allotted with their arms and accoutrements to each boat under the care of an active intelligent subaltern who is also a good waterman if there should be any armed    vessels in the river above dobbss ferry let me know it that i may order the carriages to kings ferry the officer and men are to attend the boats by land as well as by water    george washington  0 november    0 john sullivan to john sullivan in congress  hdqrs passaic falls  0 november    0 dr sir you have obliged me very much by your friendly letter of the   th and i can assure you that i shall be very happy in a continuation of them you are too well acquainted with my course of business to expect frequent or long letters from me but i can truly say that i shall write to none with more pleasure when it is in my power to write at all than i will do to you the determination of congress to raise an army for the war and the honorable establishment on which the officers are placed will i am persuaded be productive of much good had the first measure been adopted four or even three years ago i have not the smallest doubt in my mind but that we should at this day have been sitting under our own vines and figtrees in the full enjoyment of peace and independence and i have as little doubt that the value which i trust officers will now set upon their commissions will prove the surest basis of public œconomy t was idle to expect that men who were suffering every    species of present distress with the prospect of inevitable ruin before them could bear to have the cord of discipline strained to its proper tune and where that is not the case it is no difficult matter to form an idea of the want of order or to convince military men of its consequent evils it is to be lamented that the call upon the states for specific supplies should come at this late hour because it is much to be feared that before those at a distance can be furnished with the resolves and make their arrangements the season for salting provision will be irretrievably lost and this leads me to a remark which i could wish never to make and which is that the multiplicity of business in which congress are engaged will not let them extend that seasonable and provident care to many matters which private convenience and public œconomy indispensably call for and proves in my opinion the evident necessity of committing more of the executive business to small boards or responsible characters than is practised at present for i am very well convinced that for want of system in the execution of business and a proper timing of things that our public expenditures are inconceivably greater than they ought to be many instances might be given in proof but i will confine myself to the article of cloathing as we are feelingly reminded of it this instead of being ready in the fall for delivery is then to be provided or to be drawn from the lord knows whither and after forcing many soldiers from the field for want of it is eked out at different periods as it can be had    through ye winter till spring and in such a piecemeal way that the soldr derivg little comfort from it is hurt both in appearance and pride while the recruiting service is greatly injured by it were this the result of necessity not a word would be said but it is the effect of a dividd attentn or overmuch business for at the periods of the extreme suffering of the army we can hear of cloathing in different places falling a prey to moths and cankerworms of a worse kind and i am much mistaken too if the cloathing system if ours can be called a system does not afford a fruitful field for stockjobbing c it may be asked what remedy i would apply to these evils in my opinion there is a plain and easy one it will not i acknowledge give relief to our immediate and pressing wants no more than order can succeed confusion in a moment but as both must have a beginning let congress without delay for this is the season to be lookg forwd to the supplies for another year employ some eminent merchant of approved integrity and abilities to import in his own way materials for the annual cloathing of officers and men agreeably to estimates to be furnished by the cloathiergeneral or if they prefer it let these imports be made by a committee of their own body when a stock is once obtained discontinue all continental agents and state agents for continental purposes and confine the business of cloathing the army wholly to the importer clothiergenl and regimental cloathiers this would be easy and simple and would soon extricate that department    from those embarrassments and impositions which have a tendency to distress individuals and load the public with an enormous expense at present we do not know where or to whom to apply i have made the distresses of the army known to congress the board of war and the states individually without learning from whence the supplies are to come and can without the aid of a perspective see a very gloomy prospect before us this winter on the score of cloathing i have two reasons for preferring the materials for cloathing to ready made cloathes first because i think we can have them made by the regimental taylors to fit each man and to suit the fashion of each regimt and secondly because the materials will always be a more ready sale if peace takes place and the troops are disbanded than readymade cloathes they wd attract less notice too at the places of export another question may arise here where are the means means must be found or the soldiers must go naked but i will take the liberty in this place to give it as my opinion that a foreign loan is indispensably necessary to the continuance of the war congress will deceive themselves if they imagine that the army or a state that is the theatre of war can rub through a second campaign as the last it would be as unreasonable as to suppose that because a man had rolled a snowball till it had acquired the size of a horse that he might do so till it was as large as a house matters may be pushed to a certain point beyond which we cannot    move them ten months pay is now due to the army every departmt of it is so much indebted that we have not credit for a single express and some of the states are harassed and oppressed to a degree beyond bearing to depend under these circumstances upon the resources of the country unassisted by foreign loans will i am confident be to lean on a broken reed the situation of the southern states is very embarrassing and i wish it were in my power to afford them relief in the way you have mentioned but it is not the very measure you suggest i urged as far as decency and policy would permit me to do at the interview at hartford but to no effect  i cannot be more particular on this subject and what i now say is in confidence the report of sir henry clintons going to the southward was groundless and i believe few troops have left new york since those under leslie i set out with telling you that i could not write long letters but have ended with a flat contradiction of it i am with much esteem and regard dear sir c     george washington  0 november    0 henry clinton to sir henry clinton headquarters  0 november    0 sir i am authorized by congress to propose a meeting of commissioners for the purpose of effecting an exchange of all continental prisoners of war now in your possession and of the hostages given in canada as well as of all officers on parole and officers violators of parole and militia actually taken in arms and remaining prisoners of war for an equal number of the convention troops and other prisoners in our hands rank for rank and where similar rank will not apply    to pursue the exchange on the footing of composition according to the valuation or tariff agreed on by the commissioners at amboy in march last in this business will of course come into contemplation an equitable adjustment and payment of the accounts of the convention troops i think it necessary to apprize you of this circumstance that there may be no misapprehension and that if the commissioners meet they may come clothed with proper powers to render the meeting effectual i request your speedy answer after which the time and place of meeting may be regulated        george washington    november    0 john sullivan to john sullivan in congress headquarters passaic falls    november    0 dr sir       i intended in my last but having spun my letter to an enormous length deferred it to have observed that as congress had made one or two late promotions from brigadiers to majorgenerals apparently on the principle of a state proportion which by the way if made a general rule i am persuaded will be found hurtful an idea has occurred to me that possibly from the same principle on a future occasion one might take place which would be particularly injurious i mean with respect to general knox generals parsons and clinton have been superseded by smallwood parsons is since restored to his rank except clinton knox now stands first on the list if from the consideration i have mentioned or from his being at the head of the artillery he should be overlooked and a younger officer preferred he will undoubtedly quit the service and you know his usefulness too well not to be convinced that this would be an injury difficult to be repaired i do not know all things considered who could replace him in his department i am sure if a question of this kind should be agitated when you were present this intimation would be unnecessary to induce you to interpose but lest you should be absent at the time i think it would be advisable to apprize some other members in whom you have confidence to guard against it perhaps indeed for sores recd by irregular  0 promotions or mistakes tho they may afterwards receive a plaister does not always meet a cure but proves that inattention or want of information was the cause of the wound if the sentiments contained in my letter to congress of this date respecting the inspectorate department are happy enough to coincide with yours i have no doubt of your giving them a proper support—to me it appears a matter of importance to keep the present inspectors in office and sure i am that it is the true interest and policy of congress to make these offices more the object of desire by the officers who fill them than of favor from them in the one case the duties will be discharged properly in the other they may be slighted or not executed at all—the additional pay necessary to make it adequate to the trouble and confinement incident to the office would be very trifling—and the future one nothing as they will not burthen the half pay list being officers in the line and receiving half pay accordingly and no other with great c  george washington    november    0 morris town to the president of congress morris town    november    0 sir i arrived at this place today having yesterday broke up the camp near the passaic falls and detached the troops to their different places of cantonment i shall repair to new windsor where i purpose    to establish my winterquarters after having made some necessary regulations here and visited the hospitals the following will be the general position of the army during the winter the pennsylvania line about four miles from hence in part of the huts which were occupied by the troops last winter the jersey line at pompton with a detachment from thence to secure the entrance of the clove near suffrans the design of these is not only to cover the country and our communication with the delaware but as much as possible to ease us in the article of transportation the connecticut new hampshire and rhode island lines in the highlands upon the east side of hudsons river the massachusetts line at west point moylans regiment of horse at lancaster in pennsylvania and sheldons at colchester in connecticut one regiment of new york is in garrison at fort schuyler and another is at saratoga but to give more effectual security to the northern and western frontiers which are both much exposed and harrassed i propose if provision can be had which is exceedingly doubtful to send the remainder of the line to albany and schenectady where it will be ready to act as occasion may require and the officers will have it more in their power to arrange themselves agreeably to the new establishment i have lately had a very pressing application from    colo scammell for liberty to resign the office of adjutantgeneral and resume the command of his regiment finding him determined upon the measure i thought it my duty to cast about for a proper person to succeed him in so important an office before i mentioned his request the gentleman i would recommend is brigadiergeneral hand who i have sounded upon the occasion and who i find will accept the appointment should congress think proper to confer it upon him his rank independent of his other qualities is a circumstance of consequence besides giving weight and dignity to the office it will take off any uneasiness which might have arisen had an officer younger than any of the present inspectors been appointed because by the regulations the adjuttgeneral is assistt inspectorgeneral and of course commands the others in that department i shall very reluctantly part with colo scammell as he has constantly performed his duty to my entire approbation and to the satisfaction of the army but his reasons which i should have transmitted at length had i not sent up his letter among my papers to new windsor were such as i could not oppose without requiring him to make greater sacrifices than he assured me his fortune would afford     having received information through major tallmadge of the  d regiment of dragoons that the enemy had collected a valuable magazine of forage at coram upon long island the destruction of which he at the same time offered to attempt with my permission which he obtained i do myself the honor to enclose a copy of his report by which congress will perceive how very handsomely he acquitted himself in the execution of his whole plan there can be no stronger proof of the gallant behavior and good conduct of the major and his officers and of the bravery and fidelity of his men than the recital of the circumstances attending the affair throughout its progress with great respect i have the honor to be c  george washington   december    0 new windsor marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette new windsor   december    0 my dear marquis since mine of yesterday by the count de custine  another opportunity has offered of writing to you more leisurely and as your departure for the southward if that ultimately should be your determination may be incommoded by delay i have taken the liberty of facilitating your journey by the enclosed dispatches     i beg you to be persuaded however that i do not mean by this to fix your determination of serving in the southern army it is my earnest wish as i mentioned at morris town that you shd be governed in this matter by european and southern advices wch ought  alone can determine you with propriety—these you are more in the way of receiving than i am if there is a prospect of a naval superiority in these seas and an augmentation of the french land force at rhode island i shall with the freedom of a friend give it as my opinion that your going to the southern army if you expect a command in this will answer no valuable purpose but must be fatiguing to yourself and embarrassing to general greene as it may contravene a permanent arrangement to the disgust of those who considering themselves as belonging to that army may be hurt by disappointments on the other hand if we are likely to remain in a state of inactivity in this quarter your seeking service to the southward where there is a more fruitful field for enterprise is not only an evidence of your zeal but will be supported by every rule of military reasoning hence it is i again repeat that circumstances should alone decide in all places and at all times my best wishes for your health honor and glory will accompany you with much truth i can add that i am my dear marquis c    george washington  0 december    0 new windsor gouverneur morris to gouverneur morris new windsor  0 december    0 dear sir your letter of the   th ult i met with on my way to these quarters where i arrived on the  th inst the suggestions contained in it required no apology as it gives me pleasure at all times to know the sentiments of others upon matters of public utility those however which you have delivered relative to an enterprise against the enemy in new york exhibit strong evidence how little the world is acquainted with the circumstances and strength of our army a small second embarkation took place about the middle of last month if another is in contemplation to take effect at the reduction of our force which i think exceedingly probable it is too much in embryo to form more than conjectural opinions of it at this time but i will suppose it large and that not more than  000 regular troops will be left behind where are the men where are the provisions where the clothes the everything necessary to warrant the attempt you propose in an inclement season our numbers never equal to those of the enemy in new york—our state lines never half complete in men but perfectly so in every species of want were diminished in the field so soon as the weather began to grow cold near  000 men on account of clothes which i had not to give nor ought to have given supposing a surplusage to the levies whose dismission was near at hand and now to prevent the man who is a permanent soldier from starving i am    obliged in place of calling in the aid of militia for new enterprises to diminish the levies on account of the provision under this description of our circumstances which is not highcoloured and when it is added that instead of getting lumber from albany for building barracks on york island in the manner and for the purpose you mention that we have neither money nor credit adequate to the purchase of a few boards for doors to our log huts when every ounce of forage that has been used in the latter part of the campaign and a good deal of the provision has been taken at the point of the bayonet when we were from the month of may to the month of september assembling militia that ought to have been in the field by the middle of july and then obliged to dismiss them for want of supplies when we cannot despatch an officer or common express upon the most urgent occasion for want of the means of support and when i further add—but this is a matter of trivial concern because it is of a present nature—that i have not been able to obtain a farthing of public money for the support of my table for near two months you can be at no loss as i have before observed to discover the impracticability of executing the measure you suggested even supposing the enemys numbers were reduced to your standard but which by the way neither is nor will be the case till the reduction of our army takes place the period for which they know as well as we do and will i have little doubt govern themselves accordingly an earnest desire    however of closing the campaign with eclat led me to investigate the means most thoroughly of doing it and my wishes had so far got the better of my judgment that i had actually made some pretty considerable advances in the prosecution of a plan for the purpose when alas i found the means inadequate to the end and that it was with difficulty i could remove the army to its respective places of cantonment where it would be well for the troops if like chameleons they could live upon air or like the bear suck their paws for sustenance during the rigor of the approaching winter i am c george washington  0 december    0 new windsor count de rochambeau to count de rochambeau headquarters new windsor  0 december    0 sir i have received your excellencys favors of the   th   th   th   th november and  st of this month in apology for suffering so many of your letters to remain so long unanswered i must assure you that i have been constantly employed since i broke up my camp near passaic falls in visiting the winter cantonments of the army between morristown and this place i have experienced the highest satisfaction in the visits which chevalier chastellux viscount noailles count de damas count de custine and the marquis de laval have done me the honor to make me  i have only to regret that their stay    with me was so short i unfortunately missed seeing the count de deuxponts who had left my quarters on his way to philadelphia before i arrived at them i however flatter myself that i shall have the pleasure of seeing him on his return i very much approve of your intention of quartering the second division in connecticut rather than in massachusetts the troops will certainly be more convenient to the probable scene of operations  i shall withdraw the chain of our dragoons and shall in future send my despatches to the duke de lauzun at lebanon as your excellency desires i wish it were in my power to furnish your excellency with the new york papers but as our communication with that place is very irregular i only obtain them accidentally i now enclose you one which contains nothing material but the account of the late dreadful hurricane    in the west indies i take the opportunity of sending this by colonel fleury who returns to your army i was made very happy in again seeing that amiable and valuable officer whose services i have experienced upon so many occasions  i have the honor to be c george washington   th december    0 new windsor majorgeneral lincoln to majorgeneral lincoln new windsor   th december    0 my dear sir i have received your favors of the   th and   th of last month and it gives me very great pleasure to find that you are appointed to a committee the subject of whose deliberations you are so well acquainted with—and it adds not a little to my satisfaction to hear that it is generally composed of gentlemen remarkable for their good sense  patriotism at a time when there never was greater occasion for men of those qualifications the general good disposition prevailing in the state to promote measures of public utility is also a happy presage that matters will mend in your quarter at least— but how unfortunate is it that the fatal system of temporary enlistments should still have such an influence as to have prevailed upon your legislature to adopt the measure of raising their recruits for three years only which in other words is nothing more nor less than an inducement to the enemy to prosecute the war three years longer  0 you have to your cost been a witness to the pernicious consequences attending a temporary army and have therefore the better right to point out to your fellow citizens what may be expected while the system is pursued—i will still hope that they will upon a reconsideration of the matter and conformably to the requisition of congress determine upon raising their men for the war only i have by this opportunity transmitted to his excellency the governor an acct of the places which will be in my opinion most convenient  proper for the deposit of salt salt meat  rum— the weekly or monthly supplies of beef cattle  the places at which they are to be delivered will be pointed out occasionally by the commissary general—he is not at present with the army— i can therefore only say that if he has given no directions to the contrary the present monthly demand should be complied with—should it amount to more than the consumption the best can be salted down on their arrival here— your remarks on the last clause of the act of requisition are undoubtedly very just and i am confident it will be found upon examination that some states have been largely deficient in their specific supplies otherwise we should not at this alarming period of the year be destitute of flour for which i see no other chance of a supply than the state of new york being obliged to take measures that will be very disagreeable  most oppressive to individuals—it is a matter of delicacy with me to complain to congress of the default of any of the states or to criticize upon their own acts and i should therefore be very    happy to see any of the legislatures take the matter up  point out the dangers arising from such a latitude as is given in the case to which you allude to add to our other difficulties the situation of the army in respect to cloathing is really distressing—by collecting all our remnants and those of a thousand colors  kinds we shall scarcely make them comfortable uniformity one of the essentials of discipline  every thing in the appearance of a soldier must be dispensed with—and what makes the matter more mortifying is that we have i am positively assured ten thousand compleat suits ready in france  laying there because our public agents cannot agree whose business it is to ship them—a quantity has also lain in the west indies for more than eighteen months owing probably to some such cause you tell me there is cloathing enough lately arrived in private bottoms to supply the army—this my dear sir is only tantalizing the naked—such is the miserable state of continental credit that we cannot command a yard of it—some of the states may  i hope will derive an advantage from it in which case i hope they will attend to the colors proper for their uniform—i informed them all very lately to what a miserable condition the troops would be reduced except they would lay themselves out for cloathing—i am certain that had our supply of that artical been ample we could have enlisted a great proportion of the levies who would for the sake of cloaths have dispensed with the money bounty for the present with every sentiment of regard  affection i am c    george washington    december    0 new windsor majorgeneral greene to majorgeneral greene new windsor    december    0 dear sir it gives me much pleasure to hear that my letters of introduction were serviceable to you i am persuaded there is not wanting a disposition in congress or the individual states to the southward to afford you every support the unhappy state of our finance which seems to be the source from whence flows all our difficulties will admit but if any thing in my power can give a spring to their exertions every motive which can flow from public and private considerations will urge me to comply with yr wishes you have no doubt an arduous task in hand but where is the man charged with conducting public business in these days of public calamity that is exempt from it your difficulties i am persuaded are great they may be insurmountable but you see them now through a different medium than you have ever done before because the embarrassment of every department is now concentred or combined in the commanding officer exhibiting at one view a prospect of our complicated distresses your friends and the great public expect every thing from your abilities that the means which may be put into your hands are competent to but they both know full well the deranged situation of our southern affairs and neither i trust are so unreasonable as to expect impossibitities i therefore think that you have nothing to apprehend on the score of public dissatisfaction on the contrary that you may gain but cannot lose in your military reputation    i will put your letter under cover to mrs greene and request her to make use of the same channel of conveyance back i shall take much pleasure in forwarding the letters to and from her and think it the best medium of conveyance for safety i have the pleasure to inform you that i learned by genl varnum who went on to congress yesterday that mrs greene and your family were well when he left rhode island genl mcdougall talks of setting out for congress the beginning of next week but if he reaches phila by the opening of next campaign it will be as much as i expect from his despatch we reached our winterqrs about the beginning of this month and i have been driven by necessity to discharge the levies want of cloathing rendered them unfit for duty and want of flour would have disbanded the whole army if i had not adopted this expedient for the relief of the soldiers for the war without knowing that colo hamilton ever had an eye to the office of adjtgeneral i did upon the application of colo scammell to resign it recommend genl hand for reasons which may occur to you  one of them and not the smallest was by having an    officer of rank appointed to guard against the discontents which would have arisen in the inspectorate department if a junr officer to the present subinspectors had been appointed for you know that by the present establishment of the inspection the adjtgenl for the time being is the second officer in that line it would have been disagreeable therefore to the present subinspectors some of whom are full colonels to have had a ltcolonel put over them with much sincerity i am dear sir c george washington    december    0 new windsor marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette new windsor    december    0 my dear marquis soon after despatching my last letter to you your favor dated at paramus was put into my hands by colo gouvion yesterday brought me your letters of the  th  th and  th in the evening and this day i have received another of the  th the chevr de la luzernes despatches came in time for the post which is the only means left me for the conveyance of letters there not being as much money in the hands of the qmgenl i believe i might go further and say in those of the whole army as would bear the expense of an express to rhode island i could not get one the other day to ride so far as pompton i am now writing to the count de rochambeau and the chevr de ternay on the subject of your several letters when their answer arrives i will communicate the contents to you you must be convinced from what passed at the interview at hartford that    my command of the french troops at r id stands upon a very limited scale and that it would be impolitic and fruitless in me to propose any measure of coöperation to a third power without their concurrence consequently an application from you antecedently to an official proposition from his excellency the minister of france the gentn at the head of the french armament at rhode island the congress or myself coud only be considered as coming from a private gentn it is therefore my advice to you to postpone your correspondence with the spanish genels and let your influence come in hereafter as auxiliary to something more formal and official i do not hesitate in giving it clearly as my opinion to you but this opinion and this business should be concealed behind a curtain that the favorable moment of the spanish operations in the floridas ought to be improved to the utmost extent of our means provided the spaniards by a junction of their maritime force with that of his most christian majesty under the command of the chevalr de ternay will give us a secure convoy and engage not to leave us till the operations of the campaign are at an end or it can be done by consent of parties i am very thankful to the minister for permitting and to you for communicating to general greene the intelligence of the spanish movements towards the floridas it may have a happy influence on his measures it may be equally advantageous to the spaniards your expressions of personal attachment and affection to me are flattering and pleasing and    fill me with gratitude it is unnecessary i trust on my part to give you assurances of mutual regard because i hope you are convinced of it and as i have already put it absolutely in your own choice to go to the southern army or to stay with this circumstances and inclination alone must govern you it would add to my pleasure if i could encourage your hope of colo nevilles exchange i refused to interest myself in the exchange of my own aid genl lincolns were exchanged with himself and upon that occasion for i know of no other congress passed a resolve prohibiting exchanges out of the order of captivity under one general head i shall express my concern for your disappointment of letters our disappointment of cloaths and disappointment in the mode of raising men but i shall congratulate you on the late change of the administration of france as it seems to be consonant to your wishes and to encourage hope  i am much pleased at the friendly disposition of portugal much good i hope will result from the combination of the maritime powers i am in very confined quarters little better than those at valley forge but such as they are i shall welcome into them your friends on their return to rhode island i am c    george washington    december    0 new windsor count de rochambeau chevalier de ternay to count de rochambeau and the chevalier de ternay new windsor    december    0 gentlemen two days ago i did myself the honor to inform his excellency the count de rochambeau that sir henry clinton was making another embarkation this is since confirmed by other accounts but i have received none yet which fix the particular corps or numbers with certainty though all agree that this detachment is intended as a reinforcement to lord cornwallis that it is to consist of about two thousand five hundred and that it is the intention of the enemy to push their operations to the southward this winter in the most vigorous manner official information is likewise lately received that this is the resolution of the british cabinet and that for this purpose a powerful reinforcement is to be sent to america with all possible despatch when it is considered how essential it is to the independence of the united states and how important to the interest of their allies that the common enemy should be obliged to relinquish their conquests in south carolina and georgia your excellencies will i am confident agree in opinion with me that no means ought to be left unessayed to endeavor to dislodge them in the course of this winter and next spring it is needless for me to enter into a detail of the situation of our affairs to the southward your excellencies must know that from the great loss of men artillery and stores in charleston and from the    defeat of our army near camden we can only hope to reassemble such a force and that chiefly of raw troops as will prevent the enemy from extending their conquests over north carolina to attempt the reduction of charleston supposing we had men sufficient for the purpose is a thing impracticable while the transportation of artillery and all kinds of stores proper for a siege must be made from hence by land i am informed by the marquis de lafayette who is still at philadelphia that a vessel had just arrived at that place from lorient which port she left the middle of october but as he makes no mention of the second division of land and sea forces expected in america to reinforce the army and navy at present under your excellencies respective commands i am led to believe that the much desired event is more remote than under present circumstances is to be wished a piece of intelligence which has been communicated to me in confidence by his excellency the minister plenipotentiary of france has turned my attention towards a new object and brought into my mind the outlines of a plan which if it can be acceded to by the parties necessary to its execution may be attended with the most solid and permanent advantages the communication of his excellency the minister is that the court of spain have in contemplation two expeditions against the british settlements in the floridas pensacola and st augustine the first consisting of four thousand men convoyed by    eight ships of war had sailed from havana the   th of october the force destined against the last was twelve ships of the line besides frigates and bombketches and ten thousand men these were to leave the havana some time in the present month the plan with which i am impressed and which i would submit to your excellencys consideration is the propriety of attempting to combine our force with that of spain for the purpose of totally subduing the common enemy not only in the floridas but in the states of south carolina and georgia it is not for me at this moment to enter upon a detail of the business my general ideas are that a proposition or request should be made to the general and admiral of the spanish forces and through them to the governor of the havana if they are not themselves at liberty to accede to the proposal to coöperate conjunctively or by diversion for the purposes i have mentioned in case they do accede their ships of war are to be sent as soon as they have made good the debarkation of their troops at st augustine or at any other given point to form a junction with the squadron of his most christian majesty at rhode island and take under their convoy the french and american troops destined for the expedition against charleston the first of which will be embarked at newport the last at philadelphia i should make such drafts from this army as would amount to two thousand men at least his excellency the count de rochambeau would i should hope be able to detach double that number and leave a sufficiency with  0 the militia who might be called in upon the occasion to give security to your works hospitals and spare stores should you choose to leave the two last behind you these corps and the troops who will be collected under the command of general greene in conjunction with the force which may be furnished by the spaniards in the manner aforementioned will form an army not to be resisted by any which the british can draw together in that quarter and capable of effecting the utmost wishes of the allied powers it is unnecessary for me to remark that the basis of my plan and propositions is that the combined fleets shall be decidedly superior to that of the enemy and that they shall coöperate to the completion of the enterprise or until it shall be abandoned by general consent to ensure so essential a point as that of a naval superiority the propriety of a further requisition to the admiral commanding his most christian majestys fleet in the west indies is submitted to your excellencies judgments i persuade myself that your excellencies will view these propositions with an eye to all their consequences and candidly approve or reject them as they appear to you practicable or proper in making them i am solely influenced by motives of general good and would not wish them carried into execution unless they shall be deemed as conducive to the interests of the powers who have generously stepped in to our relief as to those of the united states should the plan happily meet your excellencies approbations i have to request that the chevalier de ternay would be good enough to despatch a    frigate if one can be spared with the substance of these propositions to the generals of his most catholic majesty duplicate and triplicate of which i will endeavor to forward via philadelphia if the communication is to be made no time should be lost in doing it and procuring an answer i think i could in a month after hearing of the proposition being agreed to on the part of spain be ready to embark at philadelphia if the state of the river delaware will admit of it i cannot conclude this letter without mentioning an argument which in my opinion ought to induce the spaniards to accept of these propositions the force which the british will be able to draw together in south carolina and georgia will be so much superior to the american that they may without putting matters to the risk leave small garrisons in savannah and charleston and throw such a reinforcement into st augustine a very strong fortification as will in all probability defeat the enterprise whereas if they find that measures are pursuing to divest them of those acquisitions which i am convinced they mean to make the basis of a negotiation i think it more than probable that they will abandon the floridas to their fate and exert themselves to the utmost to retain the only apparent compensation for their vast expenditure of blood and treasure besides this the spaniard ought to reflect that while britain is in possession of georgia and south carolina he must hold ye floridas by a very precarious tenure or by a very expensive one i have the honor to be c     george washington    december    0 new windsor governor trumbull to governor trumbull headquarters new windsor    december    0 sir i submitted to the interference of the state of connecticut last year with respect to the cantonment of the horse without any animadversion or remark because i was hopeful that the impropriety of it would appear to them and prevent the like in future i shall as it is the request of the state and because it is my wish to harmonize as much as possible with the civil authority in the prosecution of a cause in which we are all equally interested send sheldons regiment this winter to the state of massachusetts    but i cannot help remonstrating very pointedly against a repetition of the practice in future for the following reasons—four things have always influenced me in the distribution of the troops to their winter cantonments—security of our capital posts which makes it necessary that they should have such a relative situation to each other as to afford the necessary succor cover to the country their own convenience and the convenience of the inhabitants where the two last were not incompatible with the two first— it is unnecessary i am persuaded for me to remark that if any one state can or will undertake to point out a cantonment for one part of the army another may with equal propriety do it for another part and that upon the same principle and by the same parity of reasoning that connecticut undertakes to advise or direct sheldons horse to massachusetts massachusetts may order them to new hampshire and new hampshire to some other state in a word it is striking at the most essential privilege of the commander in chief and is pregnant with every mischief that can be conceived i have the honor to be c george washington    december    0 new windsor john sullivan to john sullivan in congress new windsor    december    0 dear sir your letter  th is safe at hand and propounds a question respecting promotion which i candidly acknowledge i am puzzled to answer with satisfaction to myself if in all cases ours was one army or thirteen    armies allied for the common defence there would be no difficulty in solving your question but we are occasionally both and i should not be much out if i were to say that we are sometimes neither but a compound of both if we were considered in every point of view as one army lineal promotion as well from as to the rank of colonel would undoubtedly be the most equitable and satisfactory mode of rising and no possible objection could be made to it by any state or the troops of a state or if congress having regard to the number of troops which each state is to furnish to the confederated army were to allow the number of general officers which should be thought competent thereto there would be no difficulty here neither because the promotion would be lineal in each state and though it might fall hard upon the colonels of such states as only furnish one regiment for continental service it would be incidental to their state quotas and must be submitted to as the annexation of their regiments to other state troops also must be to form brigades but it is our having no fixed principle that i know of and sometimes acting upon one and then the other of the cases before mentioned as it happens to suit an individual state or particular characters that creates our difficulties and the discontents that prevail it is well known that in the early stages of this war i used every means in my power to destroy all kinds of state distinctions and labored to have every part and parcel of the army considered as continental    the steps which have led to a different sentimt and to our present system of politics you are not to be informed of we must take things as they are and therefore under the ideas that prevail and our general practice i am though puzzled more inclined to let all promotions be lineal in each state to the rank of brigadr inclusive where there is more than one regiment than to any other mode because it is more consonant to the expectation of the army than any other and because under it i believe a newly appointed brigadr from the southern troops would at this day be disagreeable to an eastern brigade and vice versa how far state promotions beyond the rank of brigadrs are eligible or not is a matter on which much may be said on both sides on the one hand it may be urged that the state which sends more than a brigade into the field has as good a right to accompany them with a majr genl as ye middling state has to furnish a brigr or the smallest a colo because neither has more than its due proportion of officers on the other hand it may be observed that as officers advance in rank and acquire that general knowledge which is necessary to qualify them for extensive command their feelings are more hurt and the service more injured by placing juniors over them than when it happens to inferiors though the same principle which bars the rise of a colo where there is but one regiment will apply to a brigadr where the state only furnishes a brigade at prest we want no new majrgenerals having rather a surplusage but may not the following    expedient answer in future at least in a degree the views of all namely to suffer the larger states to have majrgenls of their own line proportioned to the number of their troops and the other majrgenls to be promoted from brigadiers according to seniority this at the same time that it yields compliance to the views of the large states does not preclude the brigadiers of the smaller from promotion as there must be majorgenerals for separate comds and for the wings of the army c wch cannot be supplied by the state quotas of troops where there is no more than a just proportion of officers to men our present mode of promotion is regimentally to captns inclusively and in the line of the state afterwards but i am convinced as well from the reason and justice of the thing as from several conversations i have held with some of the most judicious officers of the army that it would be more agreeable to it that all promotion should be lineal instead of regimental in every state line for which reasons i shall recomd the measure to congrs to take place with the new establishmt of the army what i have here said with respect to promotion is general but there is a case before me in the jersey line which makes me wish that congress would fix their principle this state has three regiments which are to be reduced to two dayton is the senr colonel and among the oldest of that rank in the whole army a valuable officer and does not want to leave the service shreve is the next oldest colo in jersey and will not go out his character you are as    well acquainted with as i am ogden is the youngest and extremely desirous of staying but cannot continue if colonel dayton remains in service in his present rank the matter therefore as it is related to me is brought to this issue that dayton or ogden is to go out unless the former can be promoted which would remove every difficulty and be agreeable to the prest system of state policy as there is no genl officer in that line but if the promotion is delayed till after the first of jany or in other words till after dayton or ogden is deranged the remedy will come too late because we shall have sent out a valuable officer upon halfpay and will if dayton is the person that goes have a person to promote who but here i drop the curtain it may suffice to say that if the state of new jersey is to be allowed a brigr it ought to be granted before the first of january for more reasons than that of œconomy that you may have some data to judge of the propriety of new appointments i shall take the liberty of observing that the states from new hampshire to pennsylvania inclusively with hazens regimt make by the last requisition    battalions of infantry that three of these battns according to the present establishmt of the army will make as large a brigade as four of the old and that the number of brigadiers in the states i have mentioned amounts at this time to no more than eight viz stark of n hampshire glover and paterson of massachusetts huntington of connecticut clinton of new york and wayne hand and irvine of pennsylva and these may be    reduced to seven if hand should be placed in the staff i am most firmly of opinion that after the states have brought their troops into the field the less they have to do with them or their supplies of cloathing c c the better it will be for the common interest for reasons which manifest themselves more and more every day and for the clearest evidence of public œconomy i am dear sir with much esteem c george washington  0 december    0 new windsor to the president of congress new windsor  0 december    0 sir at a time when the army is about to undergo a material change—when congress and the states individually are disposed to establish it upon the best principles for the equal administration of justice and the preservation of the rights of the officers i am persuaded it will not be deemed presumptuous in me to offer any opinion which in my judgment may serve to promote either of these ends and render our military system as unexceptionable as possible—upon this ground therefore i take the liberty of observing that promotion in our army according to the custom which prevails at present is regimental to the rank of captain—thence in each state line to the grade of colonel—both inclusive i do not at this time recollect the inducements which led to the regimental promotion but as it has been found productive of many hard cases injurious to the feelings of officers i would propose that all promotion in the respective    state lines to the rank of colonels inclusive should be lineal—this may disappoint the hopes of a few subalterns who perchance stand high in the regiments they are newly arranged to but can do no injustice to any of them and will remedy the evils complained of as every vacancy will then be filled by the senior officer of the next grade where there is no interposition in favor of extra merit or exclusion for want of it a regulation like this is so consonant to the principles of justice and so agreeable to the wishes of the army in general as far as i have been able to collect the sentiments of it that i think there can be no possible objection to the alteration proposed by resignations chiefly deaths and other casualties we have instances and not a few of them sergeants even in one regiment coming to the command of companies before lieutenants in another this though submitted to has been the cause of much discontent as it always hurts the feelings of an officer to obey those whom he has commanded the artillery and cavalry have heretofore been considered in the same light as the line of a state and rose accordingly that is regimentally to the rank of captn and in their respective lines afterwards and this mode i presume must still be continued or their rise made wholly regimental as the regiments are from different states otherwise the officers of different states would very soon get blended together which does not seem to be the intention of congress by their apportioning of them to particular states  0 nor do i believe it to be the wish of the officers but to avoid discontent and the disputes which will arise from clashing interests it is indispensably necessary to lay down some principle of promotion declaring it to be lineal or regimental wholly or partly as is mentioned before it is more difficult and may be more delicate for me to express a sentiment respecting the promotion of colonels and general officers but as the good of the service and the peace of the army require that some principle should be established by which these promotions should be governed i have no doubt of its being done the custom of appointing the senior colonels in each state line to be brigadiers where the number of regiments are sufficient to form a brigade or more has obtained consistency and gives general satisfaction—but the appointment of major generals seems to be under no fixed government for it sometimes happens by seniority at other times by state—and has been a source of much discontent threatning the loss of very good officers i see but two ways by which the promotion of major generals can take place upon any fixed or satisfactory ground—and there is not a known rule for it and if irregular promotions happen the service i am certain will be injured by it because officers of their rank will not nor cannot submit to a junior unless there is some established principle to reconcile it to their feelings—the one is by seniority wholly—the other by seniority and states jointly—as thus—    if congress shall judge it consistent with justice and policy to allow major generals to the state which have more brigades than one in the field let them rise in their own state line by seniority as other officers do and as this will not furnish a sufficient number for the service as there will be wanting for separate commands—for the wings of the army—light infantry c let the deficiency be taken from the senior brigadiers of the whole line to be succeeded by the oldest colonels of the state lines from whence they are taken—the first mode gives in all cases the senior brigadier for major generals—the second allows each state a compleat corps of officers to its quota of men—and entitles every brigadier in the line besides to promotion according to the date of his commission which of these modes or whether either of them will be adopted by congress is submitted to their better judgment—all i aim at is to have some system established by which we may harmonize for there is nothing more certain than that the promotion of junior officers over the heads of seniors unless it is agreeable to some known and established principle never fails to produce a great deal of discontent illblood—and party which are always injurious— as i have gone so far into this subject of promotion there is one point more i would beg leave to touch upon—and that is with respect to the colonels of the smallest states whose quota of troops does not entitle them to a brigadier and who without some relief are not only cut of from all hope of promotion—the    object of a soldiers desire—but after years of faithful service experience the frequent mortification of seeing themselves passed by—this must be exceedingly grating to a deserving officer and is a personal injury because the state having but one regiment can have no claim to a brigadier—for remedy however of the evil—and the sake of justice i would with all due deference suggest the propriety of promoting them and others in like circumstances to the rank of brigadiers whenever they shall become the senior colonels of the whole line and brigadiers are wanting which may often be the case for extra service—command of the light infantry c congress will readily perceive that all these are expedients to accommodate matters in the best manner the nature of the case will admit of to the system of state troops—for if we were one army instead of a confederated army lineal promotion by the common course of succession—where merit or demerit did not interfere—would be the easiest simplest and most equitable of any but as this is not the case and we are considered as a fœderal body we have three interests to attend to viz—the common interest—state interest—and individual interest—whether any of expedients i have proposed are likely to answer the ends in view is submitted with all possible deference and without further apology by your exys c— p s   th this

me acquainted with a gentln of his merit knowledge and agreeable manners i spent several days very happily with him at our camp near the great falls of passaic in new jersey before the army separated for its cantonments the principal of which is at west point in the vicinity of this place where i make my own quarters disappointed of the second division of french troops but more especially in the expected naval superiority which was the pivot upon wch every thing turned we have been compelled to spend an inactive campaign after a flattering prospect at the opening of it and vigorous struggles to make it a decisive one on our part latterly we have been obliged to become spectators of a succession of detachments from the army at new york in aid of lord cornwallis while our naval weakness and the political dissolution of a large part of our army put it out of our power to counteract them at the southward or take advantage of them here the movements of lord cornwallis during the last month or two have been retrograde what turn the late reinforcements which have been sent to him may give to his affairs remains to be known i have reinforcd also principally with horse but the length    of the march is so much opposed to the measure that evy corps is in a greater or lesser degree ruined that encounters it i am happy however in assurg you that a better disposition never prevailed in the legislatures of the several states than at this time the folly of temporary expedients are seen into and exploded and vigorous efforts will be used to obtain a permanent army and carry on the war systematically if the obstinacy of great britain should compel us to continue it we want nothing but the aid of a loan to enable us to put our finance into a tolerable train the country does not want resources but we the means of drawing them forth it is unnecessary for me to go into a more detailed acct of our affairs as you are doubtless officially advised of every material occurrence i shall therefore only add my compliments to mr adams and the strongest assurances of being with the greatest esteem and respect dear sir yours c george washington   d of december    0 david humphreys to

necessary to insure success given at headquarters   d of december    0 george washington    december    0 new windsor james duane to james duane new windsor    december    0 my dear sir i received with much thankfulness your confidential letter of the  th inst and am greatly obliged by the affectionate expressions of personal regard which are contained in it an unreserved communication of sentiments accompanying such information as you are at liberty to give will ever be pleasing to me and cannot fail of being useful in this light i view and value your last letter some parts of which are new agreeable and instructive—while that part of it which relates to the transaction at the ct of v— is wonderfully astonishing there are two things as i have often declared which in my opinion are indispensably necessary to the well being and good government of our public affairs these are greater powers to congress and more responsibility and permanency in the executive    bodies if individual states conceive themselves at liberty to reject or alter any act of congress which in a full representation of them has been solemnly debated and decided on it will be madness in us to think of prosecuting the war and if congress suppose that boards composed of their own body and always fluctuating are competent to the great business of war which requires not only close application but a constant and uniform train of thinking and acting they will most assuredly deceive themselves many many instances might be adduced in proof of this but to a mind as observant as yours there is no need to enumerate them one however as we feelingly experience it i shall name it is the want of cloathing when i have every reason to be convinced that the expence which the public is run to in this article would cloath our army as well as any troops in europe—in place of it we have enumerable objects of distressing want necessity alone can justify the present mode of obtaining supplies for besides the hazard and difficulty we meet with in procuring them i am well convinced that the public is charged with double what it receives and what it receives is doubly charged so expensive and precarious is the present system when the army marched illegible for winter quarters i visited the hospitals and back communication from pensa to this place in the neighborhood of pittstown i fell in with a parcel of cattle that were going to be slaughtered and salted and can assure you upon my honor that besides being immensely poor they were    so small that i am convinced they would not average     lbs the   nett quarters—some could not exceed one hundd weight and others were mere calves these pass by the head and the state or states that furnish them will have the reputation of supplying that number of merchantable bullocks when the fact is that next summer a starving man would scarce eat the beef they were about to put up after the salt had extracted the little fat and juice that were in it there were about  00 in the drove i saw and my information extended to about   or  00 more of the same kind in the neighborhood i directed the commissary to select the best for salting and let the others be eaten fresh as it would be a waste of salt barrels and time to put it up i relate this as a matter coming under my own observation many other instances of a similar nature might be given from information but i avoid it this letter will accompany one to congress on the subject of promotion that of lineal instead of regimental i am perswaded as well from the opinions i have heard as from the reason and the nature of the thing will be the most consistent with justice and most pleasing to each state line with respect to the rise of colonels and promotion of general officers i have no wish to gratify except that which i have expressed in my public letter of fixing some principle to avoid discontent and the consequences which flow from it irregular promotion unless there is obvious cause for it is not only injurious in any service but in ours is derogatory of the dignity of    congress for the officer who is superceded and afterwards restored is hurt by the first act and does not feel himself obliged by the latter considering it as an act of justice only while the two acts stand as an undeniable proof on record that there is an established principle wanting or that there is a want of information or a want of firmness in congress to resist importunity because the restoring act as i have observed is an incontestable proof of one or the other of these three things at present we are in no want of major generals—in this part of the army at least but while i am on the subject of promotion and while the thing is in my mind i will beg leave to mention that if at any time hereafter there should be a brigadier junior to genl knox promoted before him he will be lost to the service tho he should thereafter be restored to his place i mention it because under the idea of state promotion he can never rise and because i am well perswaded that the want of him at the head of the artillery would be irrepairable    george washington    december    0 new windsor marquis

conveyances i have your favors of the   th    th are both come to hand my sentiments respecting your serving in the southern    army this winter were fully though concisely explained in my last if i were to add aught to the opinion therein given it should be to wait as we are hourly expecting it something more explicit from france it is impossible for us to remain much longer in uncertainty with respect to the second division of french troops vessels daily arriving from that kingdom tho they may not bring us official advices must realize or destroy our hope of an early succor in a letter which came to my hands a few days ago from count de rochambeau dated at boston the   th instt are these words on arriving at this place i found very interesting news brought by an american vessel which left the river of nantz on the  th of novr she has given me the annexed list of vessels which are coming from brest destined for america with a convoy which is preparing at brest she tells me that there is a change in our ministry that mr sartine retires and that monsr de castries succeeds him that the mars an american vessel of twenty guns would depart a little while after her charged with despatches for us although there is something extraordinary in all this news it appears to me so circumstantial that it gives an air of truth to what regards the armament he adds that all the other vessels had rejoined the spaniards at cadiz to attempt the reduction of gibraltar which was short of provisions i have received no letter yet from the count in answer to mine respecting the expedition of the spaniards to the southward the chevr de ternay to whom my letter was equally addressed is dead as you will have learnt from the despatches which i forwarded to the minister a few days ago if circumstances which you can easier explain than i  0 conjecture should make a visit from me to rhode island necessary i certainly should be most happy in your company but do not let this influence your determinations  the light infantry and grenadiers who were under orders for embarkation at new york and had actually    prepared for it were countermanded and other troops sent in their place but whether knyphausen goes or not since this change has taken place i am not able to say a confirmation of the british fleet in the channel having suffered by a storm and of the african princes having excluded the british armd vessels from their ports as also of tarletons defeat would be most welcomely recd i had the pleasure of the chevr de chastelleauxs company on his way to albany but the viscount de noailles and count damas passed on the other side of the river without calling mrs washington  tilghman who is the only person of my family that is with me at present join in best wishes to you—please make an offering of my respectful complimts to the chevr de la luzerne  mr marbois  believe me to be as i really am c george washington    december    0 new windsor governor jefferson to governor jefferson new windsor    december    0 sir your excellencys favor of the   th reached me this day i have ever been of opinion that the reduction of the post of detroit would be the only certain means of giving peace and security to the whole western frontier and i have constantly kept my eye upon that object but such has been the reduced state of our continental force and such the low ebb of our funds especially of late that i have never had it in my power to make the attempt i shall think it a most happy circumstance should your state with the aid    of continental stores which you require be able to accomplish it i am so well convinced of the general public utility with which the expedition if successful will be attended that i do not hesitate a moment in giving directions to the commandant at fort pitt to deliver to colonel clark the articles which you request or so many of them as he may be able to furnish i have also directed him to form such a detachment of continental troops as he can safely spare and put them under the command of colonel clark there is a continental company of artillery at fort pitt which i have likewise ordered upon the expedition should it be prosecuted the officers of this company will be competent to the management of the mortar and howitzers i do not know for what particular purpose colonel clark may want the sixpound cannon but if he expects to derive advantage from them in the reduction of works of any strength he will find himself disappointed they are not equal to battering a common log blockhouse at the shortest range this we have found upon experience i would therefore advise him to consider this point and leave them behind except he sees a probability of wanting them in the field i have enclosed the letter for colonel brodhead commanding at fort pitt which colonel clark may deliver whenever he sees fit it is possible that some advantage may arise from keeping the true destination of the expedition a secret as long as circumstances will admit if so the fewer who are entrusted the better    since i began this letter i have been furnished by genl knox commanding officer of the artillery and by the qr mr genl with returns of the stores in their several departments which are at fort pitt and i find they fall very far short of your excellencys requisition i have therefore formed my order to colo brodhead in proportion to the stock in his hands  there is no mortar at fort pitt but the   inch howitzer will answer the purpose and is more convenient for transportation the mutilated two of each the matter which the house of delegates have referred to my determination stands thus a board of general officers in the year      determined that officers bearing continental commissions should take    rank of those having state commissions only while their regiments continued upon a state establishment but that when such regiments became continental the officers should be entitled to receive continental commissions from the date of their state appointments thus you see it is not in my power to recommend them to congress for continental commissions while in state regiments without infringing an established rule as to the second point whether such officers shall take promotion in the line or be confined to the said two regiments i think that they had best for the sake of peace and harmony be confined to the two regiments for many of those officers left the continental line in very low ranks and obtained very high in that of the state this created much uneasiness when the troops came together in service and it was with difficulty that many of the continental officers could be made to brook being commanded by those who had been their inferiors the preceding campaign i am therefore of opinion that an attempt to introduce those gentlemen now into the continental line would create a source of infinite discontent and uneasiness more especially as you have a sufficient number of officers at home and in captivity and vacancies ought in justice to be reserved for such of the latter as wish to serve again for the quota of continental troops assigned to the state by the last establishment i have the honor to be c          george washington   january      new windsor to the president of congress new windsor   january      sir i have been honored with your excellencys favor of the   st ulto in which congress have been pleased to refer the propriety of granting genl starks request to them to me his health is undoubtedly so much impaired that he has been able to do but very little duty the preceding campaign and retirement for a time seems therefore necessary congress will either direct his return to the army at a certain period or they will leave it at large as they may judge proper i beg leave to call the attention of congress to my letter of the   th novemr last from morris town in which i mentioned colo scammells desire to quit the office of adjutantgeneral i had not at that time his letter on the subject with me i now enclose a copy of it in which his reasons for wishing to return to the line are fully set forth i find him still determined in his resolution and i shall therefore i hope be excused for pressing congress to appoint a successor i have at length thro a channel on which i can    depend gained an account as accurate as circumstances will admit of the embarkation which sailed from new york on the  0th ulto it consisted of about sixteen hundred men and was chiefly composed of detachments from the british german and provincial corps the queens rangers are said to be the only intire corps arnold commands which my informant says gives disgust to many of the other officers the destination was not reduced to a certainty but from the preparations and the refugees who embarked in the fleet it was generally thought to be to the southward i have the honor to be c     p s capt mitchell of the jersey line has marched with a company to relieve colo butler at wyoming  george washington   january      new windsor brigadiergeneral wayne to brigadiergeneral wayne new windsor   january      my dear sir i today at noon recd yours of the  d in the morning by majr fishbourn who has given me a full account of the unhappy and alarming defection of the pennsylvania line the officers have given convincing proofs that every thing possible was done by them to check the mutiny upon its first appearance and it is to be regretted that some of them have fallen sacrifices to their zeal i very much approve of    the determination of yourself colo richard butler and colo walter stewart to keep with the troops if they will admit of it as after the first transports of passion there may be some favorable intervals which may be improved i do not know where this may find you or in what situation i can therefore only advise what seems to me most proper at this distance and upon a consideration of all circumstances opposition as it did not succeed in the first instance cannot be effectual while the men remain together but will keep alive resentment and may tempt them to turn about and go in a body to the enemy who by their emissaries will use every argument and mean in their power to persuade them that it is their only asylum which if they find their passage stopped at the delaware and hear that the jersey militia are collecting in their rear they may think but too probable i would therefore recommend it to you to cross the delaware with them draw from them what they conceive to be their principal grievances and promise faithfully to represent to congress and to the state the substance of them and to endeavor to obtain a redress if they could be stopped at bristol or g t the better i look upon it that if you can bring them to a negotiation matters may be afterwards accommodated but that an attempt to reduce them by force will either drive them to the enemy or dissipate them in such a manner that they will never be recovered  major    fishbourn informs me that genl potter and colo johnston had gone forward to apprize congress of this unfortunate event and to advise them to go out of the way to avoid the first burst of the storm it was exceedingly proper to give congress and the state notice of the affair that they might be prepared but the removal of congress waving the indignity might have a very unhappy influence the mutineers finding the body before whom they were determined to lay their grievances fled might take a new turn and wreak their vengeance upon the persons and property of the citizens and in a town of the size of philada there are numbers who would join them in such a business i would therefore wish you if you have time to recall that advice and rather recommend it to them to wait and hear what propositions the soldiers have to make immediately upon the receipt of your letter i took measures to inform myself of the temper of the troops in this quarter and have sent into the country for a small escort of horse to come to me and if nothing alarming appears here and i hear nothing farther from you i shall tomorrow morning set out towards philadelphia by the route of chester warwick colonel sewards davenports mill morristown somerset princeton trenton on which route you will direct any despatches for me as i shall be exceedingly anxious to hear what turn matters have taken or in what situation they remain you will be pleased to let me hear from you i am c   0 p s january  th seven oclock a m—upon second thoughts i am in doubt whether i shall come down because the mutineers must have returned to    their duty or the business be in the hands of congress before i could reach you and because i am advised by such of the general officers as i have seen not to leave this post in the present situation of things temper of the troops and distress of the garrison for want of flour cloathing and in short every thing george washington   january      new windsor to the new england states headquarters new windsor   january      sir it is with extreme anxiety and pain of mind i find myself constrained to inform you that the event i have long apprehended would be the consequence of the complicated distresses of the army has at length taken place—on the night of the  st instant a mutiny was excited by the noncommissioned officers and privates of the pennsylvania line which soon became so universal as to defy all opposition in attempting to quell this tumult in the first instance some officers were killed others wounded and the lives of several common soldiers lost deaf to the arguments entreaties and utmost efforts of all their officers to stop them the men moved off from morristown the place of their cantonment with their arms and six pieces of artillery and from accounts just received by general waynes aid de camp they were still in a body on their march to philadelphia to demand a redress of their grievances at what point this defection will stop or how extensive it may prove god only knows at present the troops at the important posts in this vicinity remain quiet not being acquainted with this unhappy and alarming affair how long they will continue so cannot be ascertained as they labor under some of the pressing hardships with the troops who have revolted the aggravated calamities and distresses that have resulted from the total want of pay for nearly twelve months the want of cloathing at a severe season and not unfrequently the want of    provisions are beyond description the circumstances will now point out much more forcibly what ought to be done than any thing that can possibly be said by me on the subject it is not within the sphere of my duty to make requisitions without the authority of congress from individual states but at such a crisis as this and circumstanced as we are my own heart will acquit me and congress and the states eastward of this whom for the sake of despatch i address i am persuaded will excuse me when once for all i give it decidedly as my opinion that it is vain to think an army can be kept together much longer under such a variety of sufferings as ours has experienced and that unless some immediate and spirited measures are adopted to furnish at least three months pay to the troops in money which will be of some value to them—and at the same time ways and means are devised to clothe and feed them better more regularly i mean than they have been—the worst that can befall us may be expected i have transmitted congress a copy of this letter and have in the most pressing terms requested them to adopt the measure which i have above recommended or something similar to it and as i will not doubt of their compliance i have thought it proper to give you this previous notice that you may be prepared to answer the requisition as i have used every endeavor in my power to avert the evil that has come upon us so will i continue to exert every mean i am possessed of to prevent an extension of the mischief but i can neither foretell or be answerable for the issue that you may have every information that an officer of rank and abilities can give of the true situation of our affairs and the condition and temper of the troops i have prevailed upon brigadier general knox to be the bearer of this letter to him i beg leave to refer you for many matters which would be too tedious for a letter     george washington   january      new windsor to the president of congress headquarters new windsor   january      sir congress must have been long ere this informed by general wayne of the mutiny of the pennsylvania troops on the  st instant and i have no doubt    but he has kept them regularly advised of what happened afterwards i have heard nothing particular from those troops since they reached the neighborhood of somerset court house at which place they shewed some signs of a better disposition than at first the only favorable circumstance is their not having attempted to make a push for the enemy i should have immediately upon the receipt of this alarming intelligence proceeded to morristown and from thence to wherever the troops might be had matters been in such a situation here as to have justified my leaving these important posts without being well assured of the temper and affections of the garrison who labor under nearly the same distresses and have in some degree the same cause of complaint as the pennsylvanians and more especially as the officers had a little time ago acquainted me that they had discovered some symptoms of a similar intention luckily however no such disposition has yet appeared but as the distresses of the troops for flour and for some species of cloathing are great and they may only want some plausible pretext for breaking out i am strongly advised by the general officers present not to leave this place particularly as the river is intirely free of ice and therefore favorable for the enemy to take advantage of such an event should it unfortunately happen general wayne colo r butler and colo stewart will keep with the line and as they are extremely popular officers they will i think have every possible effect upon the men i wrote to general wayne upon the subject of what appeared to me the proper    mode of conducting himself and desired him to forward a copy of my letter to congress i every moment expect further intelligence from below and should matters seem indispensably to require my presence i will set out his excelly govr clinton is here and will remain in the neighborhood ready to call in his militia should there be any defection in the continental troops i do myself the honor to enclose the copy of a letter which i have written to the four eastern states preparatory to the requisition which i most earnestly intreat congress may make upon them and the others for an advance of pay and supplies if the public funds are not in condition to furnish what is necessary for the purpose matters are now come to a crisis and i should be wanting in duty to my country and unworthy of that confidence which congress have been pleased in so many instances to repose in me were i to hesitate in giving it as my opinion that altho the other troops who are more generally composed of natives and may therefore have attachments of a stronger nature may bear their distresses somewhat longer than the pennsylvanians yet that it will be dangerous to put their patience further to the test they may for what i know be only waiting to see the effects of the pennsylvania insurrection and it will be therefore far better to meet them with a part of their just dues than to put them to the necessity of demanding them in a manner disreputable and prejudicial to the service and the cause and totally subversive of all military discipline        george washington   january      new windsor brigadiergeneral wayne to brigadiergeneral wayne new windsor   january      dear sir i have received your favor of the  th with the enclosures by the express the evening before last i had been deliberating in my own mind whether to continue at this place or set out for prince town but am advised by the governor of this state and the general officers with me and which seems to be consonant to your opinion also to remain here as the ultimate measures might probably be taken before i could arrive and as the personal influence of yourself and the gentlemen with you together with that of the governor and council of the state might effect whatever could be done in that way i am now happy to inform you the troops at the several posts in this vicinity continue still quiet without giving indications of outrage or defection at this distance and under your present circumstances it is impossible to recommend if advice could reach you in time any particular line of conduct but only in general to observe that such measures founded in justice and a proper degree of generosity as will have a tendency to conciliate or divide the men appear most likely to succeed certain it is that should they finally be driven to the enemy they will be a considerable augmentation of strength against us or should they be dispersed their loss to the service will be severely felt both these evils are therefore to be avoided if there is any proper ground on which it can be done the circumstances of the moment will    point out the measures necessary to be pursued taking into view at the same time the consequences which will be involved with respect to other troops who are nearly in the same situation i have such entire confidence in the zeal ability and influence of the gentlemen concerned in the negotiation let the issue be what it may i shall have the consolation of believing that whatever could be done on the occasion has been faithfully and strenuously attempted i am dear sir c     george washington   january      new windsor majorgeneral greene to majorgeneral greene head quarters new windsor   january      my dear sir i have been duly favored with your letters of the  th and  th of decr together with the returns of the army under your command it is impossible for any one to sympathize more feelingly with you in the sufferings and distresses of the troops than i do and nothing could aggravate my unhappiness so much as the want of ability to remedy or even alleviate the calamities which they suffer and in which we participate but too largely none of the clothing so long expected from france has yet arrived we are compelled therefore to have recourse to the states and the supplies are very inadequate to our wants should the french clothing be brought in you may depend upon having a full proportion of it you will be persuaded in the mean time that i am perfectly sensible of the innumerable embarrassments and hardships you have to struggle    with in such an exhausted country and that i should be happy to be able to afford the wished relief the brilliant action of general sumpter and the stratagem of colonel washington deserve great commendation it gives me inexpressible pleasure to find that such a spirit of enterprise and intrepidity still prevails i was much surprised that any dispute about rank was like to arise between baron steuben and general smallwood nor can i conceive upon what principles the latter can found his claim of seniority for if the date of his commission is to be carried back to any given period previous to his appointment it may supersede not only that of the officer now in question but many others and indeed derange and throw into confusion the rank of the whole line of majorgenerals but as the services of the baron may be extremely necessary in virginia it may not be amiss for him to continue there till the principles of majorgeneral smallwood on the subject are more clearly ascertained and a decision is made by congress if the dispute cannot be otherwise determined the preposterous conduct of those concerned in releasing instead of exchanging the prisoners lately taken to the southward is really astonishing i had entertained hopes that a considerable number of our prisoners in charlestown might have been obtained for them in this quarter an extensive exchange has taken place we have few officers and no privates remaining in the hands of the enemy i advised you on the  nd inst of the sailing of a fleet from n york with about   00 troops on board nothing has been heard respecting it since     00 george washington    january      new windsor majorgeneral st clair to majorgeneral st clair head quarters new windsor    january      dear sir the receipt of your letter of the  th enclosing one from general wayne has if possible added to my embarrassments i had heard from general sullivan and lord stirling that the mutineers had delivered up the british emissaries immediately upon their arrival in princeton from this i was in hopes that they had precluded themselves from all assistance from that quarter and that the reduction of them by force should matters come to extremities would not be difficult but now their conduct appears to me in this light they have made known the propositions offered by sir henry clinton only by way of threat and seem to say if you do not grant our terms we can obtain them elsewhere  at the meeting with the general and field officers yesterday it was almost a universal opinion that their  0  men might be depended on i therefore gave directions for a detachment of one thousand to be prepared and held in readiness  if things are in a train of negotiation as would seem to be the case from general waynes postscript to move a force between trenton and the enemy might create suspicions in the minds of the mutineers and make them fly to the enemy for safety i do not think it prudent to write to the committee of congress to governor reed or to general wayne lest my letter should be stopped i think therefore from a consideration of the subject in every light that it will be best for you to go down to the pennsylvania side opposite trenton and send for some of the gentlemen over there inquire minutely into the situation of affairs and if there are no hopes of a reasonable compromise get from them an opinion of what ought ultimately to be done if force should be determined upon the governors of pennsylvania and jersey should instantly make arrangements for bringing out as many of their militia as can be collected while the detachment above mentioned is marching from hence that the intercourse between trenton and this place may be as expeditious  0  as possible desire colonel nelson to fix a relay of expresses from the neighborhood of trenton to morristown and let the quartermaster at morristown continue them from thence to this place i am dear sir c  george washington    january      new windsor john laurens to lieutenantcolonel john laurens  new windsor    january      dear sir in compliance with your request i shall commit to writing the result of our conferences on the present  0  state of american affairs in which i have given you my ideas with that freedom and explicitness which the objects of your commission my entire confidence in you and the exigency demand to me it appears evident  st that considering the diffused population of these states the consequent difficulty of drawing together its resources the composition and temper of a part of the inhabitants the want of a sufficient stock of national wealth as a foundation for revenue and the almost total extinction of commerce the efforts we have been compelled to make for carrying on the war have exceeded the natural abilities of this country and by degrees brought it to a crisis which renders immediate and efficacious succors from abroad indispensable to its safety  dly that notwithstanding from the confusion always attendant on a revolution from our having had governments to frame and every species of civil and military institutions to create from that inexperience in affairs necessarily incident to a nation in its commencement some errors may have been committed in the administration of our finances to which a part  0  of our embarrassments are to be attributed yet they are principally to be ascribed to an essential defect of means to the want of a sufficient stock of wealth as mentioned in the first article which continuing to operate will make it impossible by any merely interior exertions to extricate ourselves from those embarrassments restore public credit and furnish the funds requisite for the support of the war  dly that experience has demonstrated the impracticability long to maintain a paper credit without funds for its redemption the depreciation of our currency was in the main a necessary effect of the want of those funds and its restoration is impossible for the same reason to which the general diffidence that has taken place among the people is an additional and in the present state of things an insuperable obstacle  thly that the mode which for want of money has been substituted for supplying the army by assessing a proportion of the productions of the earth has hitherto been found ineffectual has frequently exposed the army to the most calamitous distress and from its novelty and incompatibility with ancient habits is regarded by the people as burthensome and oppressive has excited serious discontents and in some places alarming symptoms of opposition this mode has besides many particular inconveniences which contribute to make it inadequate to our wants and ineligible but as an auxiliary  thly that from the best estimates of the annual expense of the war and the annual revenues which  0  these states are capable of affording there is a large balance to be supplied by public credit the resource of domestic loans is inconsiderable because there are properly speaking few moneyed men and the few there are can employ their money more profitably otherwise added to which the instability of the currency and the deficiency of funds have impaired the public credit  thly that the patience of the army from an almost uninterrupted series of complicated distress is now nearly exhausted and their discontents matured to an extremity which has recently had very disagreeable consequences and which demonstrates the absolute necessity of speedy relief a relief not within the compass of our means you are too well acquainted with all their sufferings for want of clothing for want of provisions for want of pay  thly that the people being dissatisfied with the mode of supporting the war there is cause to apprehend that evils actually felt in the prosecution may weaken those sentiments which began it founded not on immediate sufferings but on a speculative apprehension of future sufferings from the loss of their liberties there is danger that a commercial and free people little accustomed to heavy burthens pressed by impositions of a new and odious kind may not make a proper allowance for the necessity of the conjuncture and may imagine they have only exchanged one tyranny for another  thly that from all the foregoing considerations result  st absolute necessity of an immediate ample  0  and efficacious succor in money large enough to be a foundation for substantial arrangements of finance to revive public credit and give vigor to future operations  dly the vast importance of a decided effort of the allied arms on this continent the ensuing campaign to effectuate once for all the great objects of the alliance the liberty and independence of these states without the first we may make a feeble and expiring effort the next campaign in all probability the period to our opposition with it we should be in a condition to continue the war as long as the obstinacy of the enemy might require the first is essential to the latter both combined would bring the contest to a glorious issue crown the obligations which america already feels to the magnanimity and generosity of her ally and perpetuate the union by all the ties of gratitude and affection as well as mutual advantage which alone can render it solid and indissoluble  thly that next to a loan of money a constant naval superiority on these coasts is the object most interesting this would instantly reduce the enemy to a difficult defensive and by removing all prospect of extending their acquisitions would take away the motives for prosecuting the war indeed it is not to be conceived how they could subsist a large force in this country if we had the command of the seas to interrupt the regular transmission of supplies from europe this superiority with an aid in money would enable us to convert the war into a vigorous offensive i say nothing of the advantages to the  0  trade of both nations nor how infinitely it would facilitate our supplies with respect to us it seems to be one of two deciding points and it appears too to be the interest of our allies abstracted from the immediate benefits to this country to transfer the naval war to america the number of ports friendly to them hostile to the british the materials for repairing their disabled ships the extensive supplies towards the subsistence of their fleet are circumstances which would give them a palpable advantage in the contest of these seas  0thly that an additional succor in troops would be extremely desirable besides a reinforcement of numbers the excellence of french troops that perfect discipline and order in the corps already sent which have so happily tended to improve the respect and confidence of the people for our allies the conciliating disposition and the zeal for the service which distinguish every rank sure indications of lasting harmony—all these considerations evince the immense utility of an accession of force to the corps now here correspondent with these motives the enclosed minutes of a conference between their excellencies the count de rochambeau the chevalier de ternay and myself will inform you that an augmentation to fifteen thousand men was judged expedient for the next campaign and it has been signified to me that an application has been made to the court of france to this effect but if the sending so large a succor in troops should necessarily diminish the pecuniary aid which our allies may be disposed to grant it were preferable  0  to diminish the aid in men for the same sum of money which would transport from france and maintain here a body of troops with all the necessary apparatus being put into our hands to be employed by us would serve to give activity to a larger force within ourselves and its influence would pervade the whole administration   thly that no nation will have it more in its power to repay what it borrows than this our debts are hitherto small the vast and valuable tracts of unlocated lands the variety and fertility of climates and soils the advantages of every kind which we possess for commerce insure to this country a rapid advancement in population and prosperity and a certainty its independence being established of redeeming in a short term of years the comparatively inconsiderable debts it may have occasion to contract that notwithstanding the difficulties under which we labor and the inquietudes prevailing among the people there is still a fund of inclination and resource in the country equal to great and continued exertions provided we have it in our power to stop the progress of disgust by changing the present system and adopting another more consonant with the spirit of the nation and more capable of activity and energy in public measures of which a powerful succor of money must be the basis the people are discontented but it is with the feeble and oppressive mode of conducting the war not with the war itself they are not unwilling to contribute to its support but they are unwilling  0  to do it in a way that renders private property precarious a necessary consequence of the fluctuation of the national currency and of the inability of government to perform its engagements oftentimes coercively made a large majority are still firmly attached to the independence of these states abhor a reunion with great britain and are affectionate to the alliance with france but this disposition cannot supply the place of means customary and essential in war nor can we rely on its duration amidst the perplexities oppressions and misfortunes that attend the want of them if the foregoing observations are of any use to you i shall be happy i wish you a safe and pleasant voyage the full accomplishment of your mission and a speedy return being with sentiments of perfect friendship regard and affection dear sir c    0 george washington    january      new windsor to the president of congress new windsor    january      sir the unhappy mutiny of the noncomd officers and privates of the pensylvania line the perplexed state of affairs in this quarter the distressed condition of the troops at west point and in the vicinity of it on acct of provision and some essential articles of cloathing combined with other embarrassments of less importance have engrossed my whole time and attention and must be offered as an apology for not complying sooner with the order of congress of the  st inst enclosed in your excellencys letter of the second relative to the expediency of removing the french troops to virginia congress being no strangers to the blockade of the french squadron at rhode island must have had in contemplation a land march of the french army to the above state to which the season length of the way badness of the roads difficulty of transportation and possibly want of covering in a good military position when there the expectation of the second division and the arrangements which are made in consequence by the french general might be offered as weighty objections by auxiliary troops against the measure but as congress have been pleased to ask my opinion of the expediency of it i think it a duty incumbent on me to add that it is not agreeable to the sentiments perhaps to the orders of the officers commanding the land and naval force at rhode island to separate while the latter is awed by a     superior marine the experiment has already been tried  i shall act to the best of my judgment in a further exchange of prisoners and will carry the views of congress into effect as far as i am able in my last of the  th i communicated the reasons which prevented my departure for morris town upon the first information i received of the revolt of the pensylvania line and the contingencies on which my going thither then depended i found notwithstanding my utmost exertion and all the aid i could derive from the governor of this state that i could only supply the garrison from day to day with provisions that it was a doubtful point tho the troops appeared tolerably quiet in this quarter how far they were to be depended upon in a serious and spirited attempt to quell others whose declared intention was to seek redress of those grievances of which they themselves participated and were constantly complaining while the propriety of weakening the garrison supposing the utmost reliance was to be had on them without provisions in the magazine or works was not less questionable on the other hand all authority in the officers of the pensylvania line over their men being at an end and the influence of those who remained     with them employed to no purpose i was convinced that the unhappy precedent they had set and the shock which discipline had received by the revolt would only be increased by my appearance among them without the means of enforcing obedience the necessity of doing which for the support of military authority was so essential as to be attempted at almost every hazard but to choose for the best in such perplexing circumstances i was driven to was not very easy ultimately however i determined to prepare a detachment of a thousand men and directed general st clair who was at morristown to proceed immediately to the committee of congress at trenton and if matters were not settled or in their opinion in a favorable train for it to make the ulterior arrangements for militia with mr president reed and governor livingston that with their assistance the detachment from hence might be enabled to act effectually thus the matter stood when a letter from the comee advised me that the business was likely to be accommodated to mutual satisfaction it would be happy for us and favorable to the probable operations of the next campaign if instead of living chiefly upon the supplies of this state they and those of jersey could be held as a kind of reserve magazine proper attention has been paid to such officers of the continental lines under my immediate command as now are or have been prisoners with the enemy in making the new arrangement of the army and i have no doubt but equal regard will be had to those in the southern army i shall write to     general greene on this head and will transmit to him a copy of the resolve explaining the sense of congress on this matter i have the honor to be c  george washington    january      new windsor sarah bache to mrs sarah bache  new windsor    january      dear madam i should have done myself the pleasure to acknowledge the receipt of the letter you did me the favor to write on the   th of december at the moment of its receipt had not some affairs of a very unusual nature which are too recent and notorious to require explanation engaged my whole attention i pray you now to be persuaded that a sense of the patriotic exertions of yourself and the ladies who have furnished so handsome and useful a gratuity for the army at so critical and severe a season will not easily be effaced and that the value of the donation will be greatly enhanced by a consideration of the hands by which it was made and presented amidst all the distresses and sufferings of the army from whatever sources they have arisen it must be a consolation to our virtuous countrywomen that     they have never been accused of withholding their most zealous efforts to support the cause we are engaged in and encourage those who are defending them in the field the army do not want gratitude nor do they misplace it in this instance although the friendship of your father may oblige him to see some things through too partial a medium yet the indulgent manner in which he is pleased to express himself respecting me is indeed very pleasing for nothing in human life can afford a liberal mind more rational and exquisite satisfaction than the approbation of a wise a great and virtuous man  mrs washington requests me to present her compliments to mr bache and yourself with which you will both be pleased to accept of mine and believe me to be with great consideration and esteem dear madam c george washington  0 january      new windsor count de rochambeau to count de rochambeau headquarters new windsor  0 january      sir i should have done myself the honor of writing sooner to your excellency on the late disturbance in the pensylvania line had i not relied that general knox first and afterwards count des deux ponts      would give you the most accurate account of this affair—and had i not been waiting to hear the event of it and collect the particulars to enable me to give you a more perfect idea of it the causes of complaint of this line mostly composed of foreigners and having even some british deserters must in great part be known to your excellency the absolute want of pay and cloathing—the great scarcity of provisions were too severe a trial for men a great proportion of whom could not be deeply impressed with the feelings of citizens some cause of complaint as to their inlistments and perhaps the instigations of internal enemies added to their discontents and contributed to bring them to so disagreeable an issue the beginning of the disturbance you had from general knox and the subsequent proceedings have no doubt been related to your excellency by the count des deux ponts who being an eye witness had an opportunity of knowing all circumstances i shall therefore content myself with adding that the civil authority having undertaken to settle the dispute there would have been an impropriety in my interfering in their conciliatory measures which would not have suited the principles of military discipline—and that the matter is in a train of being terminated as well as the manner in which it was taken up gave us reason to expect it is somewhat extraordinary that these men however lost to a sense of duty had so far retained that of honor as to reject the most advantageous propositions from the enemy the rest of our army the jersey troops excepted being chiefly composed of     natives i would flatter myself will continue to struggle under the same difficulties they have hitherto endured which i cannot help remarking seem to reach the bounds of human patience i had last evening the pleasure of seeing at my quarters count de charlus—count de dillon  and monsr du mat  the first of these gentlemen acquainted me with the object of his journey to philadelphia which he is preparing to pursue agreeable to your desire i cannot forbear lamenting sir that the absolute want of money an evil too well known in our army obliged me to interrupt the chain of communication but the conveyance by the post is so dilatory and it is so important we should speedily hear from each other that i am going to renew the chain from this place to hartford and propose to you the expediency of having it continued to rhode island nothing could give me greater pleasure than to have the honor of waiting on you at new port and improving the opportunity to make a more extensive acquaintance with the troops under your orders besides the satisfaction i should feel in seeing you again i think it very useful that we should have a further conversation on our affairs in which i may avail myself of your opinion but our circumstances have been such that it has hitherto been out of my power to execute this favorite project of mine the moment i do not think my presence at west point essential shall be devoted to a visit to your excellency     the reduction of my family by various contingencies so that i had for some days but a single aide—and the additional weight of business which of course devolved upon me have prevented my writing to your excellency lately as often as i wished by intelligence from new york we hear the enemy have collected transports on the north river—it is probable that hearing of discontents among our troops they mean to be in a situation to improve any opening that may offer lt col laurens one of my aide de camps having been appointed by congress to repair to the court of france to negotiate matters relative to our finances as well as to other articles of great importance to our army they have directed him to confer before his departure with your excellency and monsieur destouches in consequence of his instructions i expect he will be shortly at new port where he will both receive your orders for france and avail himself of any advice your excellency may be pleased to favour him with with sentiments of the most perfect regard and attachment i have c george washington    january      new windsor to the executives of the states  head quarters new windsor    january      sir i have received the disagreeable intelligence that a part of the jersey line had followed the example of that of the pennsylvania     and when the advices came away it was expected the revolt would be general the precise intention of the mutineers was not known but their complaints and demands were similar to those of the pennsylvanians persuaded that without some decisive effort at all hazards to suppress this dangerous spirit it would speedily infect the whole army i have ordered as large a detachment as we could spare from these posts to march under major general howe with orders to compel the mutineers to unconditional submission—to listen to no terms while they were in a state of resistance and on their reduction to execute instantly a few of the most active and most incendiary leaders i am not certain what part the troops detached for this purpose will act but i flatter myself they will do their duty i prefer any extremity to which the jersey troops may be driven to a compromise  the weakness of the garrison but still more its embarrassing distress for want of provisions made it impossible to prosecute such measures with the pennsylvanians as the nature of the case demanded—and while we were making arrangements as far as practicable to supply these defects an accommodation took place     which will not only subvert the pennsylvania line but have a very pernicious influence on the whole army i mean however by these remarks only to give an idea of the miserable situation we are in not to blame a measure which perhaps in our circumstances was the best that could have been adopted the same embarrassments operate against coercion at this moment but not in so great a degree the jersey troops not being from their numbers so formidable as were the pennsylvanians i dare not detail the risks we run from the scantiness of supplies we have received few or no cattle for some time past nor do know of any shortly to be expected the salted meat we ought to have reserved in the garrison is now nearly exhausted i cannot but renew my solicitations with your state to every expedience for contributing to our immediate relief with perfect respect c george washington    january      new windsor to the officer commanding the british fleet at new york headquarters new windsor    january      sir through a variety of channels representations of too serious a nature to be disregarded have come to us that the american naval prisoners in the harbor of new york are suffering all the extremities of distress from a too crowded and in all respects disagreeable and unwholesome situation on board the prisonships and from the want of food and other necessaries the picture given us of their sufferings is truly calamitous and deplorable if just it is the obvious interest of both parties to omit the plea of humanity that the causes should be without delay inquired into and removed if false it is equally desirable that effectual measures should be taken to obviate misapprehensions   0 this can only be done by permitting an officer of confidence on both sides to visit the prisoners in their respective confinements and to examine into their true condition this will either at once satisfy you that by some abuse of trust in the persons immediately charged with the care of the prisoners their treatment is really such as has been described to us and requires a change or it will convince us that the clamors are ill grounded a disposition to aggravate the miseries of captivity is too illiberal to be imputed to any but those subordinate characters who in every service are too often remiss or unprincipled this reflection assures me that you will acquiesce in the mode proposed for ascertaining the truth and detecting delinquency on one side or falsehood on the other the discussions and asperities which have had too much place on the subject of prisoners are so irksome in themselves and have had so many ill consequences that it is infinitely to be wished that there may be no room given to revive them the mode i have suggested appears to me calculated to bring the present case to a fair direct and satisfactory issue i am not sensible of any inconveniences it can be attended with and i therefore hope for your concurrence i shall be glad as soon as possible to hear from you on the subject i have the honor to be c      george washington    januury      to the commissioners for redressing the grievances of the new jersey line ringwood    januury      gentlemen the fatal tendency of that spirit which has shown itself in the pennsylvania and jersey lines and which derived so much encouragement from impunity in the case of the former determined me at all events to pursue a different conduct with respect to the latter for this purpose i detached a body of troops under majorgeneral howe with orders to compel the mutineers to unconditional submission and execute on the spot a few of the principal incendiaries this has been effected this morning and we have reason to believe the mutinous disposition of the troops is now completely subdued and succeeded by a genuine penitence      but having punished guilt and supported authority it now becomes proper to do justice i therefore wish the commissioners as soon as convenient to enter upon the objects for which they have been appointed but i think it my duty to observe to them the necessity of the greatest caution in discussing one article the terms of the enlistments of the troops in transacting this with the pennsylvanians for want of proper care the greater part of the line has been dismissed though only a small proportion was entitled to a dismission authentic and unequivocal proofs have been since found that a majority of the discharged men were fairly and explicitly enlisted for the war this evil arose from admitting the oaths of the individuals themselves before the vouchers could be assembled from the temper of the soldiery who will avoid no means of getting rid of the service it becomes necessary to admit none but the     most unsuspicious evidence in their favor generally on investigation the complaints on this head have appeared ill founded and as the presumption is strong against the soldier the proofs of an unfair detention ought to be equally strong men are extremely wanted it is at an infinite expense that they are procured and they ought not lightly to be released from their engagements  whenever a complaint has been made to me i have invariably directed an inquiry for i have ever considered it as not less impolitic than unjust in our service to use fraud in engaging or retaining men but as i mentioned above the complaint has much oftener been found to originate in the levity of the soldier than in truth i have the honor to be c george washington    january      new windsor majorgeneral howe to majorgeneral howe new windsor    january      dear sir i have received your letter of this day with the papers accompanying it for fear of a revival of the discontents in the jersey line i think it advisable     there should remain near them other troops on whose fidelity we can more perfectly rely on this account i approve the detention of the new hampshire detachment and the artillery till we hear something more of the movements on staten island perhaps on receiving intelligence of what has happened in the jersey line general robertson  may desist from his supposed intention  to march the jersey troops alone to morristown might only be one temptation the more and to harass other troops with that march in the present state of things would in my opinion be inexpedient on more accounts than one if the massachusetts detachment is pretty commodiously situated it may remain where it is till we receive further intelligence if not let it return to west point in this case you will yourself also return signify if you please to colonel barber my approbation of his keeping the new hampshire detachment and the artillery till further orders i am with great regard sir c george washington    january      new windsor robert r livingston to robert r livingston new windsor    january      dear sir the disagreeable events wch have taken place in the pennsylvania and new jersey lines the general     discontent of the army for want of pay cloathing and provisions added to the usual course of business which increases with our perplexities will i am persuaded be admitted as a sufficient apology for my not acknowledging the receipt of your confidential and obliging letter of the  th till now to learn from so good authority as your information that the distresses of the citizens of this state are maturing into complaints which are likely to produce serious consequences is a circumstance as necessary to be known as it is unpleasing to hear and i thank you for the communication the committees now forming are at this crisis disagreeable things and if they cannot be counteracted or diverted from their original purposes may outgo the views of the wellmeaning members of them and plunge this country into deeper distress and confusion than it has hitherto experienced though i have no doubt but that the same bountiful providence which has relieved us in a variety of difficulties heretofore will enable us to emerge from them ultimately and crown our struggles with success to trace these evils to their sources is by no means difficult and errors once discovered are more than half corrected this i hope is our case at present but there can be no radical cure till congress is vested by the several states with full and ample powers to enact laws for general purposes and till the executive business is placed in the hands of able men and responsible characters requisitions then will be supported by law jealousies and those     ruinous delays and illtimed compliances arising from distrust and the fear of doing more than a sister state will cease business will be properly arranged system and order will take place and œconomy must follow but not till we have corrected the fundamental errors enumerated above it would be no difficult matter to prove that less than half the present expenditures including certificates is more than sufficient if we had money and these alterations in our political movements were adopted to answer all our purposes taxes of course would be lessened the burden would be equal and light and men sharing a common lot would neither murmur nor despond the picture you have drawn of the distresses of the people of this state i am persuaded is true and i have taken the liberty in a late letter and in as delicate terms as i could express my sentiments to hint to congress the propriety of the policy of leaving the resources of this state and the jersey as a kind of reserve more than this might bring on me the charge of an intermeddler till i could speak decisively from my own knowledge    george washington   february      new windsor to the president of congress head quarters new windsor   february      sir i have on different occasions done myself the honor to represent to congress the inconveniences arising from the want of a proper gradation of punishments     in our military code but as no determination has been communicated to me i conclude a multiplicity of business may have diverted their attention from the object as i am convinced a great part of the vices of our discipline springs from this source i take the liberty again to mention the subject the highest corporal punishment we are allowed to give is a hundred lashes between that and death there are no degrees instances dayly occurring of offences for which the former is entirely inadequate courtsmartial in order to preserve some proportion between the crime and the punishment are obliged to pronounce sentence of death capital sentences on this account become more frequent in our service than in any other so frequent as to render their execution in most cases inexpedient and it happens from this that the greater offences often escape punishment while lesser are commonly punished which cannot but operate as an encouragement to the commission of the former the inconveniences of this defect are obvious congress are sensible of the necessity of punishment in an army of the justice and policy of a due proportion between the crime and the penalty and of course of the necessity of proper degrees in the latter i shall therefore content myself with observing that it appears to me indispensable that there should be an extension of the present corporal punishment and also that it would be useful to authorize courtsmartial to sentence delinquents to labor at public works perhaps even for some crimes     particularly desertion to transfer them from the land to the sea service where they have less opportunity to indulge their inconstancy a variety in punishment is of utility as well as a proportion the number of lashes may either be indefinite left to the discretion of the court to fix or limited to a larger number in this case i would recommend five hundred there is one evil however which i shall particularize resulting from the imperfection of our regulations in this respect it is the increase of arbitrary punishments officers finding discipline cannot be maintained by a regular course of proceeding are tempted to use their own discretion which sometimes occasions excesses to correct which the interests of discipline will not permit much rigor prompt and therefore arbitrary punishments are not to be avoided in an army but the necessity for them will be more or less in proportion as the military laws have more or less vigor there is another thing in our articles of war which i beg leave to suggest to congress the propriety of altering it is the  d article of the  th section allowing commanding officers of corps to furlough their soldiers this privilege if suffered to operate would often deprive the army of more men than it could spare it has been attended with abuses it is disagreeable for a general order to restrain the exercise of a privilege granted by authority of congress to prevent uneasiness and discussion it were to be wished congress would think proper to repeal this article and vest the power of designating the mode of granting furloughs in the commanderinchief or     commanding officer of a separate army it would perhaps be useful to prescribe a printed form for which purpose i have taken the liberty to enclose one this would hinder counterfeits and impositions on the same principle i enclose the form of a discharge it would in my opinion be a good regulation that a soldier returning home either on furlough or discharged who did not in ten days after his return produce to the nearest magistrate his printed certificate should be apprehended by the magistrate as a deserter and through the governor be reported to the general officer commanding in the state or department this regulation published in the army and in the several states would have a tendency to discourage desertion something of this kind has been lately adopted in virginia and i doubt not will have a good effect it were to be wished its utility may become general if congress approve i wish the board of war may be directed to have a number of printed copies made of the furloughs and passes i have the honor to be c p s i have just received the agreeable account contained in a letter from the count de rochambeau of which the enclosed is a copy  george washington   february      new windsor majorgeneral st clair to majorgeneral st clair new windsor   february      dear sir the unexpected reduction of the pennsylvania line from the unfortunate affair adds to the necessity of   0 the greatest attention to improve the measures adopted for recruiting it i do not know precisely what these are but i am informed in general that money is raising for the purpose and that the recruiting service goes on with success in order to have it conducted with regularity and activity i am to request you will undertake to superintend it and make your arrangements with the state accordingly enclosed you will find a copy of the instructions to the recruiting officers of the other parts of the army which will also be proper for the government of those of your state we have found from experience that by some means or other numbers of men are lost between the place of enlistment and the place of rendezvous to prevent this as far as possible will be worthy your particular attention i have permitted general wayne to retire for a while general irvine will immediately assist you in the execution of the business it seems a great part of the soldiers of your line have fraudulently procured a discharge by the precipitate admission of their oaths before the papers relative to their enlistments could be produced in right this cannot exempt them from their engagements and after what has happened if it were thought expedient to compel the return of such as being explicitly engaged for the war have thus perjured themselves i should have no doubt of its justice and would take the most effectual and convenient measures to notify them that if they did not immediately return to their duty they should be considered     and treated as deserters i perceive there are objections to the measure and unacquainted as i am with all the circumstances i cannot competently judge of its propriety i therefore shall be obliged to you for your opinion let me hear from time to time of your arrangements and progress i am with great esteem and regard c george washington   february      new windsor john sullivan to john sullivan in congress new windsor   february      dear sir colo armand delivered me your favor of the   th ulto last evening and i thank you for the sevl communications contained in it the measure adopted by congress of appointing ministers of war finance and for foreign affairs i think a very wise one to give efficacy to it proper characters will no doubt be chosen to conduct the business of these departments how far colo hamilton of whom you ask my opinion as a financier has turned his thoughts to that particular study i am unable to ansr because i never entered upon a discussion of this point with him but this i can venture to advance from a thorough knowledge of him that there are few men to be found of his age who has a more general knowledge than he possesses and none whose soul is more firmly engaged in the cause or who exceeds him in probity and sterling virtue      i am clearly in sentiment with you that our cause only became distressed and apparently desperate from an improper management of it and that errors once discovered are more than half mended i have no doubt of our abilities or resources but we must not slumber nor sleep they never will be drawn forth if we do nor will violent exertions which subside with the occasion answer our purposes it is a provident foresight a proper arrangement of business system and order in the execution that is to be productive of that œconomy which is to defeat the efforts and hopes of great britain and i am happy thrice happy on private as well as public accts to find that these are in train for it will ease my shoulders of an immense burthen which the deranged and perplexed situation of our affairs and the distresses of every department of the army which concentered in the comrinchief had placed upon them i am not less pleased to hear that maryland has acceded to the confederation and that virginia has relinquished its claim to the land west of the ohio which for fertility of soil pleasantness of clime and     other natural advantages is equal to any known tract of country in the universe of the same extent taking the great lakes for its northern boundary  i wish most devoutly a happy completion to your plan of finance which you say is near finished and much success to your scheme of borrowing coined specie and plate but in what manner do you propose to apply the latter as a fund to redeem its value in paper to be emitted or to coin it if the latter it will add one more to a thousand other reasons wch might be offered in proof of the necessity of vesting legislative or dictatorial powers in congress to make laws of general utility for the     purposes of war so that they might prohibit under the pains and penalty of death specie and provisions from going to the enemy for goods the traffic with new york is immense individual states will not make it felony lest among other reasons it should not become genl and nothing short of it will ever check much less stop a practice which at the same time that it serves to drain us of our provision and specie removes the barrier between us and the enemy corrupts the morals of our people by a lucrative traffic by degrees weakens the opposition affords a means for obtaining regular and perfect intelligence of every thing among us while even in this respect     we benefit nothing from a fear of discovery men of all descriptions are now indiscriminately engaging in it whig tory speculator by its being practised by those of the latter class in a manner with impunity men who two or three yrs ago would have shuddered at the idea of such connexions now pursue it with avidity and reconcile it to themselves in which their profits plead powerfully upon a principle of equality with the tory who being actuated by principle favorable to us and knowing that a forfeiture of the goods to the informer was all he had to dread and that this was to be eluded by an agreemt not to inform against each other went into the measure without risk this is a digression but the subject is of so serious a nature and so interesting to our wellbeing as a nation that i never expect to see a happy termination of the war nor great national concerns well conducted in peace till there is something more than a recommendatory power in congress it is not possible in time of war that business can be conducted well without it the last words therefore of my letter and the first wish of my heart concur in favor of it i am with much esteem and respect c george washington   february      new windsor governor jefferson to governor jefferson new windsor   february      sir i am much obliged to your excellency for your letter of the  0th of january giving me an account of the enemys incursion into your state baron     steuben has informed me of their successive operations to five miles below hoods it is mortifying to see so inconsiderable a party committing such extensive depredations with impunity but considering the situation of your state it is to be wondered you have hitherto suffered so little molestation i am apprehensive you will experience more in future nor should i be surprised if the enemy were to establish a post in virginia till the season for opening the campaign here but as the evils you have to apprehend from these predatory incursions are not to be compared with the injury to the common cause and with the danger to your state in particular from the conquest of the states to the southward of you i am persuaded the attention to your immediate safety will not divert you from the measures intended to reinforce the southern army and put it in a condition to stop the progress of the enemy in that quarter the late accession of force makes them very formidable in carolina too powerful to be resisted without powerful succors from virginia and it is certainly her policy as well as the interest of america to keep the weight of the war at a distance from her there is no doubt that the principal object of arnolds operations is to make a diversion in favor of cornwallis and to remove this motive by disappointing the intention will be one of the surest ways for removing the enemy we have just received an account that the enemys fleet employed in blockading that of our allies at rhode island has lately suffered severely by a storm     one seventyfour is said to have been stranded and entirely lost on the east end of long island another some accounts say two others dismasted and towed into gardiners bay and a ninetygun driven to sea in great distress i expect every moment a confirmation of this agreeable intelligence and the particulars i have the honor to be c      george washington    february      new windsor mrs francis mrs hillegas mrs clarkson mrs bache mrs blair to mrs francis mrs hillegas mrs clarkson mrs bache and mrs blair new windsor    february      ladies the benevolent office which added lustre to the qualities that ornamented your deceased friend  could not have descended to more zealous or more deserving successors the contributions of the association you represent have exceeded what could have been expected and the spirit that animated the members of it entitles them to an equal place with any who have preceded them in the walk of female patriotism it embellishes the american character with a new trait by proving that the love of country is blended with those softer domestic virtues which have always been allowed to be more peculiarly your own you have not acquired admiration in your own country only it is paid to you abroad and you will learn with pleasure by a part of your own sex where female accomplishments have attained their highest perfection and who from the commencement have been the patronesses of american liberty the army ought not to regret its sacrifices or     sufferings when they meet with so flattering a reward as in the sympathy of your sex nor can it fear that its interests will be neglected while espoused by advocates as powerful as they are amiable i can only answer to the sentiments which you do me the honor to express for me personally that they would more than repay a life devoted to the service of the public and to testimonies of gratitude to yourselves accept the assurances of the perfect respect and esteem with which i am ladies your most obedient c george washington    february      new windsor count de rochambeau to count de rochambeau new windsor    february      sir the count de st maime  last evening did me the honor to deliver me your letter of the  d instant  it   0 appears by the report of the naval officer that the enemy were inferior to the chevalier destouches and from the situation of the bedford and the america would probably remain so for some time it appears also to have been your excellencys expectation that m destouches would either go with his whole fleet or send a detachment to chesapeake bay in quest of arnold there are a variety of positions where arnold by putting his vessels under protection of land batteries may defy a naval attack and by collecting the provisions with which the country abounds and raising a few works may remain in security till the enemy by repairing their damaged ships should regain their superiority at sea and come to his relief portsmouth where he was by the last accounts is particularly favorable to his security in this view unless therefore the ships which m destouches may have sent should by good fortune suddenly fall in with him embarked and moving from one place to another they will have little prospect of success from these considerations if the object is judged of sufficient importance it is in my opinion essential that there should be a coöperation of land and naval forces and that m destouches should protect the expedition with his whole fleet how far this will be safe or advisable he can best judge but it has appeared to me probable that he would prefer going with his whole fleet to a separation as by making a detachment he would lose his superiority and would give mr arbuthnot an opportunity to escort his disabled     ships safe to new york and follow his detachment with the remainder imagining it to be not unlikely that he may think it advisable to employ his whole fleet upon the occasion and that your excellency would approve a cooperation with a part of your army the propriety of which for want of a knowledge of your local situation i cannot judge to give the enterprise all possible chance of success i have put under marching orders a detachment of twelve hundred men which will proceed in a few days towards the head of elk river there to embark and proceed to a coöperation i did not delay the march of this detachment till i could hear from m destouches and you as there is not a moment to be lost if the expedition is to be undertaken and the inconvenience of moving the troops to no purpose will be small in comparison with the advantage of gaining time i should have made it more considerable could i have spared the troops it may arrive at its destination of operation in about four weeks from this time if the chevalier destouches and your excellency should approve the project of a coöperation in which the whole fleet shall be employed it will be desirable that you could embark about a thousand troops on board the ships and as many pieces of siege artillery with the necessary apparatus as you will think proper this will give a degree of certainty to the enterprise which will be precarious without it arnolds force consists of about fifteen hundred men as these will be in intrenchments though     not formidable an inferior regular force with the militia will find it difficult to reduce them but with the addition of the detachments i have proposed to you to send the affair would soon be terminated this addition is of importance but the sending of artillery is absolutely necessary as it would be productive of too much delay and expense to send heavy pieces with their stores from hence by land at this season as by this movement the troops will be exposed to a disagreeable march and some expense will be incurred i shall be glad that both inconveniences may cease as soon as possible if the project is not carried into execution and i therefore request your excellency will favor me with an immediate answer the capture of arnold and his detachment will be an event particularly agreeable to this country a great relief to the southern states and of important utility in our future operations  i regret that the present prospect will compel me to postpone setting out for rhode island till i hear from you and will deprive me still longer of the pleasure for which i impatiently wish of seeing your excellency and the army i am c     february   th—the destruction of the corps under the command of arnold is of such immense importance to the welfare of the southern states that i have resolved to attempt it with the detachment i now send in conjunction with the militia even if it should not be convenient to your excellency to detach a part of your force provided m destouches is able to protect our operation by such a disposition of his fleet as will give us the command of the bay and prevent succors being sent from new york by a letter i have just received from major general the baron de steuben who commands in virginia it appears we may expect every thing from the temper of the militia of which militia are capable but an additional regular force to that i am sending would no doubt make the success much more prompt and certain if m destouches should send any ships into the bay on the principle of a cooperation it will be necessary that a light frigate should come up to the head of elk to protect the passage of the troops across the bay i impatiently wait to be favored with your excellencys answer on these points with the truest respect c      george washington    february      brigadiergeneral knox to brigadiergeneral knox private instructions head quarters    february      in the conference between the count de rochambeau and myself it was agreed that if by the aid of our allies we can have a naval superiority through the next campaign and an army of thirty thousand men or double the force of the enemy  its dependencies early enough in the season to operate in that quarter we ought to prefer it to evry other object as the most important and decisive and applications have been made to the court of france in this spirit which it is to be hoped will produce the desired effect it is therefore incumbent upon us to make evry necessary preparation on our part for the siege of new york as far as our funds and means render practicable—applications have been also made to the court of france for a large supply of powder arms heavy cannon and several other essential articles in your department—but we cannot ascertain the extent of the success these applications will meet with and as they only go to such articles as are less within the compass of our own internal means we ought not to neglect any exertion in our power for procuring within ourselves those things of which we shall stand in need     i give you this communication of what is in prospect that you may take your measures accordingly by making such estimates and demands and other arrangements as may appear to you best calculated to produce what we want—and you may rely upon all the support it will be in my power to give—in your calculations you will estimate the force on our side at about twenty thousand men the remainder with a proper siege and field apparatus are to be supposed to be furnished by our allies—you are well acquainted with new york and its defences and you can therefore judge of the means requisite for its reduction by a siege—the general idea of the plan of operations is this if we are able to procure the force we count upon to make two attacks one against the works on york island and the other against the works of brooklyn on long island—the latter will probably be conducted by our allies—ulterior operations must depend on circumstances—if we should find ourselves unable to undertake this most capital expedition and if we have means equal to it we shall attempt a secondary object the reduction of charles town—savanah penobscot may successively come into contemplation—your dispositions will have reference to these different objects though indeed a preparation for the principal one will substantially comprehend every lesser—these instructions would have been earlier given to you—but for the commotions in the army which suspended my attention george washington    february      new windsor to the president of congress new windsor    february      sir i have been honored with your excellencys favors of the  th instant general morgans signal victory over colo tarleton with the flower of the british army reflects the highest honor upon our arms and i hope will at least be attended with this advantage that it will check the     offensive operations of the enemy untill general greene shall have collected a much more respectable force than he had under his command by the last accounts from him i am apprehensive that the southern states will look upon this victory as much more decisive in its consequences than it really is and will relax in their exertions it is to be wished that the gentlemen of congress who have interest in those states would remove such ideas if any such should be found to exist and rather stimulate them to redouble their efforts to crush an enemy pretty severely shaken by the two successful strokes upon ferguson and tarleton    i shall not fail to communicate to majorgeneral parsons and the officers and men who were under his command the very flattering notice which congress has been pleased to take of their expedition to morrisania  upon general knoxs return from the eastward i desired him to form an estimate of the artillery and ordnance stores necessary for an operation upon the largest scale which would be that against new york he has accordingly furnished one copy of which i do myself the honor to enclose for the information of congress and that application may be made in time to the states possessed of the heaviest cannon for the loan of them and other stores should they be wanted and that directions may be given to the     board of war and to those boards whose business it is to provide ammunition c to endeavor to procure the deficiency of the estimate we ought without doubt to be prepared for an operation against new york should circumstances make it requisite to lessen the object the overplus stores would nevertheless form not only a valuable but such a magazine as we ought ever to have in reserve the impossibility of crossing the north river with horses and some unforeseen business have hitherto prevented my journey to newport and makes the time of my setting out precarious i have the honor to be c  george washington    february      new windsor abraham skinner to abraham skinner head quarters new windsor    february      sir you are informed of a number of officers of the convention troops who have been ordered to elizabeth town for the purpose of going into new york to be exchanged i am now to direct you will exchange them in the following manner all those who have no similar ranks in possession of the enemy you will place against such of our colonels as have been longest in captivity the others you will exchange against an equal number rank for rank but as two thirds of the officers of the convention troops are now nearly exchanged the enemy are bound on their own principles to let him  enter into immediate     contemplation for exchange and we ought in justice to ourselves to insist upon it besides lt general burgoyne the enemy owe us for three or four hundred private men who may now be applied in conjunction with general burgoyne to the exchange of all our officers remaining on long island you will therefore immediately make the following proposition to the enemy—to place ltgeneral burgoyne the officers of convention on their way to elizabeth town and the above mentioned privates in opposition to our officers prisoners in this quarter—the ballance which will be due us to be paid by the release of such officers of the southern prisoners as we shall name to the amount of that ballance this proposition is so reasonable that i dare say it will be readily complied with by the enemy especially as they must be sensible that the continuing to make any difficulties about lt general burgoyne will necessarily operate to the prejudice of future exchanges it is not however to prevent the immediate exchange of the officers on their march as this is a point already agreed upon governor livingston has represented to me that some dissatisfactions have arisen about the manner of disposing of the prisoners made by the militia of the state you are to observe the following rule to put all the persons taken in arms by the militia in a common stock to be exchanged indifferently for any prisoners of war in the hands of the enemy whether continental troops or militia according to priority of capture     to exchange all mere citizens persons not taken in arms for the citizens of the state whose militia has captured them the equity of the first rule must be obvious as all the prisoners made by the continental troops are applied indifferently to the exchange of themselves and the militia taken in arms by the same rule of priority of capture and without reciprocity there would be an evident disadvantage on the side of the continental troops as the governor also mentions some inconvenience for want of information on these points i am to desire you will make him monthly reports of all exchanges of the militia and citizens of the state made by you and of the prisoners made by the militia who have come into your hands i wish you too immediately to give him an account of what has been done in these respects since you have been in the department that he may see the state is not injured by our arrangements i am frequently at a loss for want of your presence at head quarters—i am therefore to desire you will reside constantly near it when any particular business calls you else where you will represent it at head quarters i am c george washington february  0th      new windsor marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette instructions sir i have ordered a detachment to be made at this post to rendezvous at peekskill the   th instant which together with another to be formed at morristown from the jersey troops will amount to about twelve hundred rank and file the destination   0 of this detachment is to act against the corps of the enemy now in virginia in conjunction with the militia and some ships from the fleet of the chevalier destouches which he informs me sailed the  th instant from newport you will take the command of this detachment which you will in the first instance march by battalions towards pompton there to rendezvous and afterwards proceed with all possible despatch to the head of elk you will make your arrangements with the quartermastergeneral concerning the route you are to take concerning transportation tents intrenching tools and other articles in his department of which you may stand in need with the commissarygeneral concerning provisions with the clothier concerning clothes shoes c and with general knox concerning the artillery and stores you will want for the expedition the result of these several arrangements you will report at headquarters when you arrive at trenton if the delaware is open and boats are readily to be had you will save time by going from thence by water to christiana bridge marcus hook or chester if you cannot avail yourself of this mode you must proceed by land by the route which the quartermaster and commissary may designate as most convenient for covering and supplies you are not to suffer the detachment to be delayed for want of either provision forage or wagons on the route where the ordinary means will not suffice with certainty you will have recourse to military impress you will take your measures with the quartermastergeneral in such a manner that vessels may be ready by your arrival at the head of elk to convey you down the bay to hampton roads or to the point of operation and you will open a previous communication with the officer commanding the ships of his christian majesty to concert your coöperations and to engage him to send if it can be spared a frigate up the bay to cover your passage without which or some other armed vessels might be otherwise insecure when you arrive at your destination you must act as your own judgment and the circumstances shall direct you will open a correspondence with the baron de steuben who now commands in virginia informing him of your approach and requesting him     to have a sufficient body of militia ready to act in conjunction with your detachment it will be advisable for him to procure persons in whom he can confide well acquainted with the country at portsmouth and in the vicinity some who are capable of giving you a military idea of it and others to serve as guides you should give the earliest attention to acquiring a knowledge of the different rivers but particularly james river that you may know what harbors can best afford shelter and security to the cooperating squadron in case of blockade by a superior force you are to do no act whatever with arnold that directly or by implication may screen him from the punishment due to his treason and desertion which if he should fall into your hands you will execute in the most summary way having recommended it to count de rochambeau to detach a land force with the fleet that it may be destined for the chesapeake bay though from the disposition which has already taken place it is not probable that land force will be sent yet if the recommendation should be complied with you will govern yourself in coöperating with the officers commanding the french troops agreeably to the intentions and instructions of his most christian majesty of which you were the bearer and which being still in your possession it is unnecessary for me to recite you will keep me regularly advised of your movements and progress and when the object of the detachment is fulfilled or unfortunately disappointed you will return with it by the same rout if circumstances admit of it and with as much expedition as possible to this post i wish you a successful issue to the enterprise and all the glory which i am persuaded you will deserve given at headquarters new windsor february  0th           george washington  0 february      new windsor elbridge gerry to elbridge gerry new windsor  0 february      dear sir the mail of last week brought me your letter of the  th never having entertained a doubt of your friendship the trouble you have taken to remove a supposed suspicion of it would have given me concern were it not overbalanced by the pleasure i feel at receiving in the same instant fresh assurances of your esteem and regard for me declarations thereof on your part require candor  confidence on mine i do not scruple therefore to confess that i was not a little hurt by the implications and the general complexion of mr lovells letter—and was not a little embarrassed in determining upon a line of conduct proper for me to observe on the occasion conscious that neither directly nor indirectly no act word or thought of mine had given birth to the motion transmitted you it was not a very pleasant thing to see a letter published the natural interpretation of which held out very different ideas the paragraph immediately following the motion is perfectly enigmatical to an uninformed mind but from the context and other circumstances must be supposed to relate to the same person and subject i have heard it did not but the combination was remarkable and its falling into the hands of the enemy and being exposed to public view unfortunate      george washington    february      new windsor governor jefferson to governor jefferson headquarters new windsor    february      sir i do myself the honor to communicate to your excellency a circumstance which i hope will be followed by the most salutary consequences to the state of virginia in particular and which may ultimately have the happiest effect upon the interests of america in general the chevalier des touche commanding his most christian majestys squadron in the harbour of new port finding himself enabled since the late misfortune which happened to the british fleet in gardeners bay to make a detachment has dispatched a ship of the line of    guns and three frigates to chesapeak in hopes of finding there and destroying the fleet under the direction of arnold the french ships sailed the  th instant from newport with a fair wind—they have taken on board a quantity of arms and cloathing which had arrived there on account of the state of virginia it is more than probable that these ships will have arrived in the chesapeak before my letter reaches you but should they be retarded by adverse winds or other accidents your excellency need not be told that the most profound secrecy will be necessary on such an occasion for should the least hint escape and arnold come to the knowledge of it he would not hesitate to take the opportunity of pushing out of the bay the ships once arrived at their stations—the matter becomes of public notoriety without any disadvantage     from an apprehension that the enemy may take such a position as will enable them to defend themselves and their shipping without a land cooperation and knowing that militia cannot be depended on for the vigorous measures that it may be necessary to pursue i have put a respectable detachment from this army in motion it is commanded by major general the marquis de la fayette it will proceed by land to the head of elk at which i calculate it will arrive by the  th of march at farthest and will fall down the chesapeak in transports i have written to the baron de steuben by this conveyance—given him the foregoing intelligence and some directions relative to the position which he is to take with the militia—collecting magazines etc it will be highly necessary that an immediate safe and expeditious communication should be opened between the commanding officer of the french squadron and the commanding officer on shore—in this and every other measure tending to promote the public good i am confident of your excellencys assistance and i have desired the baron to make application to you in every case where your countenance may be wanting the marquis de la fayette who is the senior officer will take the command upon his arrival—i recollect but one thing further which will require your excellencys more immediate attention and that is the business of providing the most experienced and trusty bay and river pilots should it not have been done before this reaches you and sending them to the commanding officer     to be forwarded to the fleet this trouble must necessarily devolve upon your excellency or some gentlemen appointed by you because our officers being strangers might be imposed upon in this most material point—i have c p s should you have occasion to write to the marquis de la fayette let your first letter go by land under cover to the quarter master at the head of elk and subsequent ones by boats to the same place because they will meet the transports in the bay— george washington    february      new windsor governor trumbull to governor trumbull headquarters new windsor    february      dear sir having been obliged to make a very considerable temporary detachment from the army i am under the necessity of immediately calling in what recruits may be raised in the neighboring states to replace it i have directed the superintending officers at the different places of rendezvous to do this but i must request your excellency if it possibly can be done to furnish them in whole or in part with clothing as i do not believe our whole stock on hand consists of more than waist coats and breeches for  000 men if the recruits could be made tolerably comfortable they might do garrison duty which is what they will be employed in until the spring i cannot avoid mentioning a matter to your excellency which is well worth your attention and that     of the legislature it is the shameful neglect not to call it worse of those persons appointed by law to muster and pass the recruits general parsons informs that the first which came from your state seven in number were all totally unfit for service he has sent them to hartford that the legislature may themselves be witnesses of the imposition which has been put upon the public and which will be practised in numberless instances while any but military men interested in having healthy sound soldiers are to be judges of the sufficiency of the recruit to endeavor to remedy this evil i have ordered a good fieldofficer to be stationed at each place of rendezvous and if any man is brought in not qualified for the service he is to refuse receiving him and to send him immediately back to the town which furnished him i had the honor of receiving your excellencys favor of the  th by the duke de lauzun the corps of invalids are stationed by order of congress at philadelphia and boston and it is not therefore in my power to send the invalids of the army to any other places except by the authority of congress i have honor to be c george washington    february      new windsor majorgeneral st clair to majorgeneral st clair new windsor    february      dear sir you will by the time this reaches you be acquainted with the destination of the detachment under the command of the marquis de lafayette     which though as large as could be afforded from the troops in this quarter is not so competent to the certain completion of the object in view as i could wish by some accounts from philadelphia i am led to hope that further assistance may be derived from the pennsylvania line if you find it practicable to form a battalion of eight companies of fifty rank and file each three officers to a company and two fieldofficers to a battalion in such time as the marquis shall think will answer his purpose you will be pleased to do it and put it under his command the detachment will be but temporary the nomination of the fieldofficers i leave to you it is possible that the battalion may be formed but not in time to embark at the head of elk with the other troops this will not be so material provided it can be done in a short time afterwards that time you and the marquis will determine if the companies cannot be completed to fifty each i would take them at forty rather than lose the reinforcement or even half a battalion of two hundred under the command of one fieldofficer rather than none transports can be provided and held ready at the head of elk should they not embark with the other troops the places of rendezvous of the first second fifth and sixth battalions are none of them very distant from elk and i should imagine the detachment would be most readily and conveniently formed from them but this i leave to your judgment i am c      george washington    february      new windsor majorgeneral parsons to majorgeneral parsons new windsor    february      sir captain walker has communicated to me some discoveries made of a plot among the tories of stratford and fairfield county of which i have directed him to give you the particulars it seems a clue has been found to it which if rightly improved will enable us to detect the affair in all its extent and punish the principals and their accomplices i need not observe to you of how dangerous a tendency combinations of this nature are nor of how much importance it is to put an effectual stop to them your knowledge of the country and characters of the people will enable you best to conduct the investigation and as you live in one of the counties where it seems to originate you may do it with the less risk of suspicion i am therefore to request you will undertake the     affair in the manner you think most likely to succeed and will set about it immediately you may want a party of men when you have matured the discovery to seize the persons concerned these you may take from the connecticut line as a guard to the part of the country where they will be necessary in the present state of our force they cannot exceed a subalterns command the two points most essential will be to detect any characters of importance who may be concerned in it and if possible to get into our hands the register of the associators names the person who will serve you as a spy must be assured of some generous compensation such as will be an object to his family and secure his fidelity this i leave to you to manage i am with great regard c george washington    february      new windsor chevalier destouches to the chevalier destouches hdqrs new windsor    february      sir i received two days since the letter which you did me the honor to write me of the   th instant the desire you express of being useful to these states evinced by the measure you have taken to rid the coasts of virginia of very troublesome and destructive neighbors has a title to our acknowledgments i hope the ships you have sent will meet with immediate success but i am rather apprehensive the enemy will be able to secure their vessels under the protection of land batteries   0 the count de rochambeau will have communicated to you my propositions the detachment mentioned to him has marched and may arrive at the head of elk by the  th or  th of march to proceed thence by water to the point of operation the information you were pleased to give me that you held the remainder of your fleet ready to protect your expedition in the bay was a motive for accelerating its motions if you have it in your power to block up arnold in the bay and make such a general disposition with your fleet as will at the same time prevent succors going from this quarter to him i shall flatter myself that this coöperation will effect the reduction of the corps now in virginia and the ships will then of course fall into your hands i am sensible the safe return of the america may make a material difference in your arrangements but however this may be i wait your determination to regulate my ulterior measures if the late important and agreeable intelligence of the success of count destaing is confirmed  we may flatter ourselves that it will at once lead to a decisive and glorious issue to the war i am impatient to have it in my power to congratulate you on its certainty with sentiments of perfect consideration and attachment i have the honor to be c      george washington    february      new windsor count de rochambeau to count de rochambeau new windsor    february      sir i am honored with your excellencys letters of the  th   th and   th since mine to you of the   th the important intelligence you do me the favor to communicate comes so many ways and with so many marks of authenticity that we have the greatest reason to hope it is true if so without the interference of other powers of which there seems to be no probability i think we may regard it as an event decisive of a speedy and glorious termination of the war and that his britannic majesty in spite of his last speech will be obliged to receive the law in mine of the       th i informed you of my ultimate determination respecting the detachment from this army the enclosed for the chevalier destouches which after perusal i beg you to seal and transmit communicates its march the time of its expected arrival at its destination and my present views there are rumors from new york that sir henry clinton had received orders to concentre his force at one point but as they come through a suspected channel i give them no credit yet if the enemy have received the blow of which our west india accounts speak this would be a natural consequence the flattering distinction paid to the anniversary of my birthday is an honor for which i dare not attempt to express my gratitude i confide in your excellencys sensibility to interpret my feelings for this and for the obliging manner in which you are pleased to announce it the measures we have been taking for the expedition to virginia will delay some time my visit to rhode island i wait to see whether sir henry clinton may form any new project in consequence when this is ascertained and the additional precautions we are taking for security here are completed i shall yield to my impatience for testifying personally my attachment to your excellency and your army i have the honor to be c      george washington    february      new windsor governor clinton to governor clinton new windsor    february      sir in answer to your excellencys letter of the   th i wrote fully on the   th since which i have had the honor to receive your favor of the  0th the reiterated request of both houses of assembly to leave the two regiments of the state in the quarter where they now are places me in a delicate and painful situation i have already assured your excellency and through you the legislature of my perfect disposition to comply with the wishes of the state as far as i have the means to which indeed its exertions entitle it but as an officer intrusted with the general interest of the confederacy in expectation of an offensive campaign under engagements which i shall at any rate find it difficult to fulfil i cannot in policy in justice to the united states in good faith to our allies consent to divest myself of so considerable a part of my efficient force as the two regiments in question the good of the service joined to my regard for the state will always prompt me as it has heretofore done to every effort in my power to prevent or repel attacks upon it but to give an assurance     that its troops shall remain as a cover to the western and northern frontier from an apprehended invasion is more than i could answer while our views extend beyond a mere defensive other applications similar to that from this state have been made to me a compliance with which would leave us without a competent garrison for the defence of west point a heavy detachment from this part of the army for an important service has obliged me to draw in all my outposts and to call six companies of the york line from albany as the smallest possible number necessary for the security of west point while i am compelled to deliver these sentiments i entreat your excellency to assure the assembly that it is impossible to feel more than i do for the distresses of the state and that as far as it can be made consistent with my general duty no person will do more to serve it i have the honor to be c george washington    february      new windsor marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette new windsor    february      my dear marquis i have received your favors of the   d from pompton by captn castaign you may make yourself perfectly easy as to ships of the line being at new york the iris and the others mentioned by hagerty are frigates this man relates a circumstance to me that he does not seem to have informed you of it is that a reinforcement of six hundred men is     preparing for arnold and that the convoy is to be the farges indiaman which is fitting up but that she will not be ready till the end of this week i do not give much credit to any thing he says but if it is so colonel dayton will probably be able to gain some knowledge of it the return of clothing wanting for the detachment was so long coming to hand that i had directed the clothier to despatch a parcel which he did some days ago and i am glad to find that the essential articles all exceed your demand it will be too late to send a further supply of shoes from hence you must endeavor to get them in philadelphia    the america of sixtyfour guns had got into gardiners bay after being long out the bedford was remasted this again gives admiral arbuthnot the superiority and puts it out of m destouchess power to give us any further assistance    i have already hinted to you the necessity of having a number of boats for debarking the troops at the point of destination—this is a matter to which the qr mr genl must pay particular attention to—i therefore repeat it—it is also of essential importance to keep fast sailing vessels pilotboats would be best plying from the hd of elk to hampton road for the purpose of corresponding with the french commodore or to apprize you of any danger which may arise from a change of circumstances as i am not without apprehensions that the detachment from monsr destouchess squadron will be followed by a superior one from gardiners bay as soon as     the destination of the former is known—this evinces strongly the necessity of despatch which depends upon great exertion in providing the transports with the comygenl of issues as i mentioned in a former letter or his deputy at phila and colo pickering you will make the necessary arrangemt for provisions for your corps if it could be done solely with the latter the business would be in fewer hands—as your march will be rapid to the head of elk leave good officers to bring up the tired lazy and drunken soldiers february   th —i do not think it very probable that three hundred dragoons will trust themselves in the heart of connecticut with a superior regular corps and the force of the country to oppose them but i have nevertheless given the intelligence to the duke de lauzun  upon your arrival in philadelphia if not before you will hear that a body of men supposed to be a reinforcement under general provost from europe had landed at cape fear in consequence of which the whole pennsylvania line are ordered to the southward  i have therefore directed general st clair     instead of confining himself to a single battalion to send as many as he can down the chesapeake with your detachment if circumstances should admit of your embarkation if the troops landed at cape may are from europe i do not imagine their convoy is more than a frigate or two will it not be well when matters are ripe for discovering your object to endeavor to get the ariel the trumbull and any other public vessels of war which may be in the delaware to go round to the chesapeake a combination of vessels though of unequal rate might perplex and distress the small squadron of our ally this you can urge to the gentlemen of the marine department if nothing unforeseen occurs i shall set out for rhode island when general duportail arrives here i think i may expect him about the  st of next month i am c george washington    february      new windsor john mathews to john mathews in congress headquarters new windsor    february      dear sir your favor of the   th was not received until this morning i am so totally unacquainted with the state of the southern prisoners that i did not choose to enter into a negotiation with sir henry clinton on the idea of a general exchange although liberty was given me by congress nothing particular has therefore been done respecting the gentlemen who are confined at st augustine as it could not be     supposed that the enemy would consent to a partial exchange of persons of the most considerable influence in the southern states and who besides are pretended to have rendered themselves obnoxious indeed whenever a negotiation is entered upon i foresee difficulties in procuring the liberation of those gentlemen who are most of them of eminence in the civil line as we have none of similar rank in our possession to exchange for them however whenever the matter is gone into you may be assured that all possible attention shall be paid to them not only from my own inclination to serve them but in obedience to an act of congress which directs that particular regard shall be had to them in the negotiation of the exchanges of southern prisoners the interest you take in them will be an additional consideration i have the honor to be c george washington    february      new windsor to the president of congress head quarters new windsor    february      sir i had the honor of receiving last night your excellencys two letters of the  0th instant one of them in congress with their inclosures the situation of the southern states is alarming the more so as the measure of providing a regular and permanent force was by my last advices still unattempted where the danger was most pressing and immediate unless all the states enter in good earnest upon this plan we have little to expect but their successive subjugation particular successes     obtained against all the chances of war have had too much influence to the prejudice of general and substantial principles in obedience to the orders of congress i have imparted their wish to his excellency the count de rochambeau informing him that the proposal was made on the presumption of a naval superiority but as this superiority has ceased by the safe return of the america a sixtyfour which was missing and supposed to be dismasted and by a detachment of one vessel of the line and two or three frigates into the chesapeake bay it will of course be out of the power of our allies to transport the whole or any part of their troops to the succor of the southern states besides this obstacle the present instructions and expectations of the french general and naval commander are opposed to an immediate change of position the order for the pensylvania line to march to the southward interferes with the conditional arrangements of the next campaign but in the present exigency of accumulating danger in that quarter i am entirely of opinion that these troops ought to be detached on the first notice of the storm and its ill effects i intimated to the french general the possibility and importance of improving the opportunity in an attempt upon arnold when i received a more distinct account of the damage sustained by the british fleet which was a long time coming to me i immediately put in motion as large a part of my small force here as i could with any prudence spare to   0 proceed under the command of the marquis de lafayette to the head of elk and made without delay a proposal for a coöperation in the chesapeake bay with the whole of the fleet of our allies and a part of their land force before my proposition arrived in consequence of an application to him through the chevalier de la luzerne mr destouches had sent the force i have already mentioned to chesapeake bay this separation and the return of the america prevented the execution of my plan but the marquis de lafayette still continues his march to attempt whatever circumstances will permit it is probable congress before this reaches them will have heard of the arrival of the ships in the bay but if they should have met with any delay i need not observe how necessary it will be to conceal our expectations as the only chance of success to a merely maritime operation depends on surprise i take the liberty to suggest that the american frigates in the delaware may perhaps at this juncture be usefully employed in chesapeake or cape fear the latter may be preferable but secrecy and despatch will be essential    i have the honor to be c  george washington    february      new windsor majorgeneral lincoln to majorgeneral lincoln new windsor    february      dear sir i have received your favor of the   th i am glad to hear of colonel laurenss departure he wrote to me a few days before he sailed and mentioned in     the warmest manner your exertions to get the ship manned the few continental soldiers you spared on the occasion were well bestowed considering the importance of colonel laurenss mission  by a resolve of congress of the  th of january the board of war seemed to have the payment of the invalids the resolve is as follows that the board of war draw no more warrants on the paymaster except for the invalid regiments and the regiment of artificers in the department of the commissary general military stores until the further order of congress from this i should imagine the commanding officer at boston should regularly transmit his muster rolls and abstract to the board and obtain a warrant the late lt colo lorings case is referred to me by congress and i shall take it into consideration our last advices from general greene are of the   st of january lord cornwallis with twentyfive hundred men entirely divested of baggage had made     a push against general morgan and was near recovering the prisoners taken upon the   th of january but general morgan got them off and they had crossed the yadkin on their way to virginia lord cornwallis was still advancing and general greene studiously avoiding an engagement except he could draw together a greater force of militia than he had much prospect of i am very anxious for the issue of this manœuvre which may be productive of the most important consequences lieutenantcolonel lee with his legion had surprised georgetown i have not many particulars he took lieutenantcolonel campbell and several other officers prisoners and killed a major irvine a good many privates were killed few taken our loss one killed two wounded i have tried the efficacy of proclamations of pardon to deserters so often and have found so little good resulting from them that i am inclined to think desertion is rather encouraged than remedied by a frequent repetition of them the soldier goes off remains at home after a furlough and looks for a proclamation as a thing of course i am c george washington    february      new windsor marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette new windsor   oclock pm    february      my dear marquis i have this moment received a letter from the count de rochambeau with intelligence of which the enclosed is a copy by this it appears that the first squadron had returned to newport but that m destouches was fitting up the romulus with an intent to     despatch her and i suppose the frigates for chesapeake as being of better construction for the navigation of that bay than the ships which were before there i have written to count de rochambeau and to m destouches and have informed them that you are prosecuting your march to the head of elk that you will embark there and wait only for a certain knowledge that the french squadron is again in the bay of chesapeake to determine you to proceed to a coöperation i hope the squadron will have again sailed before my letter reaches newport upon your arrival at the head of elk you will immediately embark the troops if the transports are ready that not a moments time be lost after you receive certain advices that our friends are below but until that matter is ascertained beyond a doubt you will on no account leave elk river you will write immediately to the baron steuben and inform him that he may expect the return of the squadron and that he is to continue every preparation and make every arrangement before directed for the prosecution of the coöperation with the warmest attachment i am c ps you will readily perceive the propriety of keeping parts of this letter and intelligence secret george washington    february      new windsor john park custis to john park custis new windsor    february      dear custis if you will accept a hasty letter in return for yours of last month i will devote a few moments to this purpose and confine myself to an interesting point     or two i do not suppose that so young a senator as you are little versed in political disquisitions can yet have much influence in a populous assembly composed of gentln of various talents and of different views but it is in your power to be punctual in your attendance and duty to the trust reposed in you exacts it of you to hear dispassionately and determine coolly all great questions to be disgusted at the decision of questions because they are not consonant to our own ideas and to withdraw ourselves from public assemblies or to neglect our attendance at them upon suspicion that there is a party formed who are inimical to our cause and to the true interest of our country is wrong because these things may originate in a difference of opinion but supposing the fact is otherwise and that our suspicions are well founded it is the indispensable duty of every patriot to counteract them by the most steady and uniform opposition this advice is the result of information that you and others being dissatisfied at the proceedings of the virginia assembly and thinking your attendance of little avail as there is always a majority for measures which you and a minority conceive to be repugnant to the interest of your country are indifferent about the assembly the next and i believe the last thing i shall have time to touch upon is our military establishment and here if i thought the conviction of having a permanent force had not ere this flashed upon every mans mind i could write a volume in support of the utility of it for no day or hour arrives unaccompd     with proof of some loss some expense or some misfortune consequent of the want of it no operation of war offensive or defensive can be carried on for any length of time without it no funds are adequate to the supplies of a fluctuating army tho it may go under the denomination of a regular one much less are they competent to the support of militia in a word for it is unnecessary to go into all the reasons the subject will admit of we have brought a cause which might have been happily terminated years ago by the adoption of proper measures to the verge of ruin by temporary enlistments and a reliance on militia the sums expended in bounties waste of arms consumption of military stores provisions and camp utensils to say nothing of cloathing which temporary soldiers are always receiving and always in want of are too great for the resources of any nation and prove the fallacy and danger of temporary expedients which are no more than mushrooms and of as short duration but leave a sting that is a debt which is continually revolving upon us behind them it must be a settled plan founded in system order and œconomy that is to carry us triumphantly through the war supineness and indifference to the distresses and cries of a sister state when danger is far off and a general but momentary resort to arms when it comes to our doors are equally impolitic and dangerous and prove the necessity of a controlling power in congress to regulate and direct all matters of general concern—without it the great business of     war never can be well conducted if it can be conducted at all while the powers of congress are only recommendatory while one state yields obedience and another refuses it while a third mutilates and adopts the measure in part only and all vary in time and manner it is scarcely possible our affairs should prosper or that any thing but disappointmt can follow the best concerted plans the willing states are almost ruined by their exertions distrust and jealousy succeeds to it hence proceed neglect and ill timed compliances one state waiting to see what another will do this thwarts all our measures after a heavy tho ineffectual expense is incurred does not these things show that in ye most striking point of view the indispensable necessity the great and good policy of each state sending its ablest and best men to congress men who have a perfect understanding of the constitution of their country of its policy and interests and of vesting that body with competent powers our independence depends upon it our respectability and consequence in europe depends upon it our greatness as a nation hereafter depends upon it the fear of giving sufficient powers to congress for the purposes i have mentioned is futile without it our independence fails and each assembly under its present constitution will be annihilated and we must once more return to the government of g britain and be made to kiss the rod preparing for our correction a nominal head which at present is but another name for congress will no longer do that honorable     body after hearing the interests and views of the several states fairly discussed and explained by their respective representatives must dictate and not merely recommend and leave it to the states afterwards to do as they please which as i have observed before is in many cases to do nothing at all when i began this letter i did not expect to have filled more than one side of the sheet but i have run on insensibly if you are at home give my love to nelly and the children if at richmond present my complimts to any inquiring friends i am sincerely and affectionately c p s the public gazette will give you all the news of this quarter—our eyes are anxiously towards the south for events george washington   march      marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette headquarters   march      my dear marquis i have just received letters from the count de rochambeau and the chevalier destouches informing me of their intention to operate in the chesapeake bay with their whole fleet and a detachment of eleven hundred french troops grenadiers and chasseurs included the chevalier expected to sail the  th of this month so that you will arrive at the head of elk before he appears in the bay he seems to make a difficulty which i do not comprehend about protecting the passage of your detachment down the bay     but as it is entirely without foundation i take for granted it will cease on his arrival it is of the greatest importance to the expedition as well as for the honor of our arms that you should be on the spot to coöperate the count de rochambeau requests me to send an aiddecamp to the commanding officer in virginia to assemble the militia and have every thing else ready against the arrival of the fleet you know all the necessary directions have been given but to gratify the count i am to desire you will send colonel gouvion without delay to the baron de steuben to communicate this latter intelligence and press the preparations directing the baron on the arrival of the french troops to enter immediately into their views you know the infinite value of secrecy in an expedition circumstanced like this the baron de vioménil will command the french detachment i set out in the morning for rhode island where i hope to arrive before the fleet sails to level all difficulties and be in the way to improve circumstances since writing the above i have received a letter from general greene by which it appears cornwallis with twentyfive hundred men was penetrating the country with great rapidity and greene with a much inferior force retiring before him having determined to pass the roanoke this intelligence and an apprehension that arnold may make his escape before the fleet can arrive in the bay induce me to give you greater latitude than you had in your original instructions you are at liberty to concert a plan     with the french general and naval commander for a descent into north carolina to cut off the detachment of the enemy which had ascended cape fear river intercept if possible cornwallis and relieve general greene and the southern states this however i think ought to be a secondary object and only attempted in case of arnolds retreat to new york or in case you should think his reduction would be attended with too much delay and that the other enterprise would be more easy and was from circumstances more necessary there should be strong reasons to induce a change of our first plan against arnold if he is still in virginia with a view to the second enterprise you must be making your arrangements for transportation and supplies and must endeavor to gain all the information you can about the country which may be the scene of your operations your continuing your march after the fleet had withdrawn itself from the bay may excite suspicions of their intended return you can cover your design by saying you are going to the assistance of general greene you will remember that your corps is a part of this army and will let this idea have proper weight in your determinations i am c    0 george washington    march      governor hancock to governor hancock hartford    march      sir it would have afforded me the greatest pleasure had i been able to have extended my late visit to newport as far as boston but the important operations which may be expected at the southward made it necessary for me to return as soon as possible to the north river that i might be more immediately in the way of receiving intelligence and communicating any which might be essential to the common interest to count de rochambeau the present is a most important moment the success of the expedition now in agitation seems to depend     upon a naval superiority and the force of the two fleets is so equal that we must rather hope for than entertain an assurance of victory the attempt however made by our allies to dislodge the enemy in virginia is certainly a bold one and should it fail will nevertheless entitle them to the thanks of the public the army under my immediate command is so much reduced by the detachment which i have made to coöperate with the french troops in virginia that i have been under the necessity of calling for the recruits which are raised in the neighboring states few have yet come in and i plainly perceive that unless very vigorous exertions are made     the quotas of the several states will be not only short but exceedingly late in the field i must therefore entreat the interference of your excellencys countenance and authority with the persons in the different townships whose business it may be to procure the levies not only to send forward those to the places of rendezvous which have been raised but attend to completing the deficiencies where any may have happened there is the greater necessity for a strict compliance with the number of men required by congress as the pennsylvania line which was to have composed part of the northern army has lately been ordered to the southward a regular and full compliance with the specific requisition of provision is a matter of equal importance with the foregoing to which i beg leave to call your excellencys attention also i have the honor to be with most perfect respect and esteem c george washington    march      new windsor benjamin harrison to benjamin harrison new windsor    march      my dear sir upon my return to this place last night i met your private and friendly letter of the   th of february i do not delay a moment to thank you for the interesting matter contained in it and to express surprize at that part which respects a pension for my mother true it is i am but little acquainted with her present situation or distresses if she is under any as     true it is a year or two before i left virginia to make her latter days comfortable and free from care i did at her request but at my own expence purchase a commodious house garden and lotts of her own choosing in fredericksburg that she might be near my sister lewis her only daughter—and did moreover agree to take her land and negroes at a certain yearly rent to be fixed by colo lewis and others of her own nomination which has been an annual expence to me ever since as the estate never raised one half the rent i was to pay before i left virginia i answered all her calls for money and since that period have directed my steward to do the same whence her distresses can arise therefore i know not never having received any complaint of his inattention or neglect on that head tho his inability to pay my own taxes is such i know as to oblige me to sell negroes for this purpose—the taxes being the most unequal i am told in the world—some persons paying for things of equal value four times nay ten times the rate that others do—but putting these things aside which i could not avoid mentioning in exculpation of a presumptive want of duty on my part confident i am that she has not a child that would not divide the last sixpence to relieve her from real distress this she has been repeatedly assured of by me and all of us i am certain would feel much hurt at having our mother a pensioner while we had the means of supporting her but in fact she has an ample income of her own i lament accordingly that your letter which conveyed     the first hint of this matter did not come to my hands sooner but i request in pointed terms if the matter is now in agitation in your assembly that all proceedings on it may be stopped or in case of a decision in her favor that it may be done away and repealed at my request i must defer answering your public letter till the next post this is written in much haste to go by the present mail which is on the point of closing the measures i had taken previous to the date of your letter for the reduction of arnolds corps were you may be assured every thing that was possible in my circumstances to do if the states will not or cannot provide me with the means it is in vain for them to look to me for the end and accomplishment of their wishes bricks are not to be made without straw as our eyes are turned to your quarter for interesting events we have few occurrences of moment here none pleasing i shall only add an expression of my sincere concern for the damage and losses i hear you have sustained by that arch traitor arnold and my assurances of being c      george washington    march      new windsor majorgeneral heath to majorgeneral heath new windsor    march      dear sir upon my arrival at this place yesterday i found your letter of the  d enclosing the complaint of sundry fieldofficers of the massachusetts line  it is a painful reflection that the best meant endeavors to promote the service is subject to and often meets with the most unfavorable constructions and that the numerous embarrassments which the distressed situation of our affairs unavoidably involves us in should be increased by illfounded jealousies and groundless suspicions if the gentn who addressed you on the   th ulto were hurt at the appointment of colo jamat gimat and major galvan to command in the detachmt which marched and which i presume to be the case a candid investigation of the cause would have evinced in a moment the principle and that it was not a prediliction in favor of those gentn or     a want of confidence in the complainants but the peculiar circumstances of the army that gave birth to the measure at the time the detachment was ordered there was not by the adjutants return and it was called for on purpose but two regiments if my memory serves me in camp that had more than one fieldofficer namely hazens and webbs nothing therefore but necessity could have justified my leaving a regiment without one at a time when the new levies were ordered to join and momently expected from every state and when an equal and impartial distribution of them was to be made and the whole to be provided for under such circumstances no one i am persud who considers the good of the service and the consequences of such a want can blame me for taking officers who were eligible to command and unoccupied by other duties to accompany the detachment these and these only were the reasons why no more than one fieldofficer was taken from the line of massachusetts bay and not as i have said before from a want of confidence in them or because i preferred those that did go thus much justice has dictated and i insert to remove the idea which these gentn seem to have imbibed of an intended slight but they must excuse me for adding that i concieve it to be a right inherent with command to appoint particular officers for special purposes that part of your letter wch seems to respect yourself personally needs no explanation for i never can suppose that you deem it a slight not     to have been taken from the comd of the most important post in america wt  000 men to head a detachment from that post of only  00 if this is not your allusion i am ignorant of your meaning but shall take this occasion to observe once for all that i am not conscious of exercising a partiality in favor of one line one corps or one man more than another and that where appearances have been otherwise in the eyes of those who were unacquainted with all the circumstances i could easily have explained them that i never did nor never will hurt intentionally the feelings of any deserving officer unless i can be justified upon genl principles and good is to result from it—but if officers will not see into the political motives by which i am sometimes governed in my appointments and which the good of the common cause renders indispensably necessary it is unfortunate but cannot because it ought not divert me from the practice of a duty which i think promotive of the interest of the united states and consistent with the views of that power under which i act i have been thus particular because it is my wish to convince every officer over whom i have the honor to be placed of the sincerity of my disposition to make him as happy as the times and our circumstances will admit of and that can be done consistent with the observance of that steady line of conduct i ever have and mean to pursue i am with esteem c      george washington    march      new windsor william fitzhugh to william fitzhugh new windsor    march      dear sir a few days ago brought me the honor of your favor of the  th from marlborough your other letter of jany the  0th came duly to hand—for both i thank you without offering an apology for suffering the latter to remain unacknowledged till this time because i am satisfied you will attribute my silence to any cause rather than disrespect and to none sooner than the true one—vizt the load of business which continually presses upon me it was with sincere concern that i heard of the injury you sustained in your property at the mouth of the patuxent but it is only adding another specimen to the catalogue of british clemency and wasted generosity     the accession of maryland to the confederation—and the relinquishment of the claim of virginia to the lands west of ohio are events which are exceedingly pleasing to me but i am not sufficiently acquainted with the powers of civil government under the present constitutions of the several states to determine how far they are able to obtain men for the war or for three years by coercion—nor am i enough acquainted with the abilities of them to declare what sums they ought to have given to soldiers under this description in preference to a draft of men for a shorter term this however i am decided in that the latter is the most expensive  least effectual mode that ever was devised to carry on a war which is like to become a war of finance—and that no funds within our reach can support it long i speak upon the best ground when i assert this because no day nor hour arrives without bringing with it some evidence in support of the truth of the observation to this cause also the prolongation of the war the wretched state of our finances and every capital misfortune that has befallen us may be traced i as little scruple to add that unless the powers of congress are made competent to all the purposes of war we are doing no more than wasting our time  spending our treasure to very little purpose for it is impossible to apply the strength and resources of this country while one state complys with another rejects and the majority of them change or mutilate the requisitions of that body—hence the willing states are capitally injured if not ruined—hence proceed   0 distrust jealousy  dissatisfaction and the impossibility of either projecting or executing with certainty any plan whatsoever—hence proceed all those delays which to people at a distance and unacquainted with circumstances are altogether unaccountable—and hence it is we incur useless expence because we do not bring our force and means into operation at the same time some being exhausted before others are obtained    we wait with much solicitude advices from the southern army our last accounts from that quarter were less gloomy than the former but not less equivocal  distressing i have heard nothing from genl greene since the   th of feby nor of him with precision since the  d inst matters were so critically circumstanced at that time as to add pain to impatience equally ignorant and equally anxious am i with respect to the french fleet under the command of the chevr destouches—no accounts of whom have i received but vague ones through the channel of rivingtons paper since he left newport at york town in virginia there was no intelligence of him on the   th private it is to be lamented greatly lamented that the french commanders at newport did not adopt the measure of sending the fleet and a detachmt of their land force to chesapeake bay when i first proposed it to them in the moment i received the first certn information of the damage done to the british at gardiners bay had the expedition been undertaken at that time nothing could have saved     arnolds corps during the weakened state of the british ships from destruction instead of this a small detachment only was sent from the fleet which as i foretold would have returned as they went had it not been for the accidental meeting of the romulus and the vessels under her convoy but as there is no rectifying past errors—and as it is our true policy to stand well with friends on whom we so much depend i relate this in confidence      mrs washington makes a tender of her compliments to yourself and mrs fitzhugh to which please to add those of dear sir c george washington    march      new windsor majorgeneral armstrong to majorgeneral armstrong new windsor    march      dear sir    i received with much pleasure the account of your recovered health and sincerely wish it may be of long continuance and much usefulness to yourself and country we ought not to look back unless it is to derive useful lessons from past errors and for the purpose of profiting by dear bought experience to enveigh against things that are past and irremediable is unpleasing but to steer clear of the shelves and rocks we have struck upon is the part of wisdom equally as incumbent on political as other men who have their own little bark or that of others to navigate through the intricate paths of life or the trackless ocean to the haven of security and rest our affairs are brought to an awful crisis that the hand of providence i trust may be more conspicuous in our deliverance the many remarkable interpositions of the divine government in the hours of our deepest distress and darkness have been too luminous to suffer me to doubt the happy issue of     the present contest  but the period for its accomplishment may be too far distant for a person of my years whose morning and evening hours and every moment unoccupied by business pants for retirement and for those domestic and rural enjoyments which in my estimation far surpass the highest pageantry of this world    i am sorry to hear that the recruiting business in your state is clogged with so many embarrassments it is perhaps the greatest of the great evils attending this contest that states as well as individuals had rather wish well than act well had rather see a thing done than do it or contribute their just proportion to the doing it this conduct is not only injurious to the common cause but in the end most expensive to themselves besides the distrusts and jealousies which are sown by such conduct to expect brick without straw is idle and yet i am called upon with as much facility to furnish men and means for every service and every want as if every iota required of the states had been furnished and the whole was at my disposal when the fact is i am scarcely able to provide a garrison for west point or to feed the men that are there this and ten thousand reasons which i could assign prove the necessity of something more than recommendatory powers in congress if that body is not vested with a controuling power in matters of common concern and for the     great purposes of war i do not scruple to give it decidedly as my opinion that it will be impossible to prosecute it to any good effect some states are capitally injured if not ruined by their own exertions and the neglects of others while by these irregularities the strength and resources of the country never are nor can be employed to advantage but i have exceeded the bounds of a common letter and shall trespass no longer than while i can assure you that i am with every sentiment of esteem regard and affection c george washington    march      new windsor benjamin harrison to benjamin harrison  head quarters new windsor    march      dear sir on my return from newport i found your favor of the   th of february with its inclosures at head quarters i regret exceedingly that i could not have the pleasure of seeing you not only from personal motives but because i could have entered upon the subject of your mission in a much more free and full manner than is proper to be committed to paper i very early saw the difficulties and dangers to which the southern states would be exposed for want of resources of cloathing arms and ammunition and recommended magazines to be established as ample as their circumstances would admit it is true they are not so full of men as the northern states but they ought for that reason to have been more assiduous     in raising a permanent force to have been always ready because they cannot draw a head of men together as suddenly as their exigences may require that policy has unhappily not been pursued either here or there and we are now suffering from the remnant of a british army what they could not in the beginning accomplish with their forces at the highest as your requisitions go to men arms ammunition and cloathing i shall give you a short detail of our situation and prospects as to the first and of our supplies and expectations as to the three last men by the expiration of the times of service of the old troops by the discharge of the levies engaged for the campaign only and by the unfortunate dissolution of the pennsylvanian line i was left previous to the march of the detachment under the command of the marquis de la fayette with a garrison barely sufficient for the security of west point and two regiments in jersey to support the communication between the delaware and north river the york troops i had been obliged to send up for the security of the frontiers of that state weak however as we were i determined to attempt the dislodgment of arnold in conjunction with the french fleet and army and made the detachment to which i have alluded in my late tour to the eastward i found the accounts i had received of the progress of recruiting in those states had been much exaggerated and i fear we shall in the end be obliged again to take a great proportion of their quotas in levies for the campaign     instead of soldiers for three years or for the war the regiments of new york having been reduced to two they have but few infantry to raise jersey depends upon voluntary enlistments upon a contracted bounty and i cannot therefore promise myself much success from the mode the pennsylvania line you know is ordered to compose part of the southern army general wayne is so sanguine as to suppose he will soon be able to move on with  000 or   00 men but i fancy he rather overrates the matter you will readily perceive from the foregoing state that there is little probability of adding to the force already ordered to the southward for should the battalions from new hampshire to new jersey inclusive be compleated a thing not to be expected we shall after the necessary detachments for the frontiers and other purposes are made have an army barely sufficient to keep the enemy in check at new york except this is done they will have nothing to hinder them from throwing further reinforcements to the southward and to be obliged to follow by land every detachment of their army which they always make by sea will only end in a pointless dissipation of what may now be called the northern army you may be assured that the most powerful diversion that can be made in favor of the southern states will be a respectable force in the neighborhood of new york i have hitherto been speaking of our own resources should a reinforcement arrive to the french fleet and army the face of matters may be entirely changed     arms i do not find that we can at any rate have more than  000 stand of arms to spare perhaps not so many for should the battalions which are to compose this army be compleat or nearly so they will take all that are in repair or repairable the  000 stand came in the alliance from france and i keep them apart for an emergency ammunition our stock of ammunition though competent to the defensive is by a late estimate of the commanding officer of artillery vastly short of an offensive operation of any consequence should circumstances put it in our power to attempt such an one we must depend upon the private magazines of the states and upon our allies on the contrary should the defensive plan be determined upon what ammunition can be spared will be undoubtedly sent to the southward cloathing of cloathing we are in a manner exhausted we have not enough for the few recruits which may be expected and except that which has been so long talked of and looked for from france should arrive the troops must next winter go naked unless their states can supply them from the foregoing representation you will perceive that the proportion of the continental army already allotted to southern service is as much as from present appearances can be spared for that purpose and that a supply of arms ammunition or cloathing of any consequence must depend in a great measure upon future purchases or importation nothing which is within the compass of my power     shall be wanting to give support to the southern states but you may readily conceive how irksome a thing it must be to me to be called upon for assistance when i have not the means of affording it i am c  george washington  0 march      new windsor to the board of war head quarters new windsor  0 march      gentlemen i have been honored with your favor of the   d instant inclosing the heads of two plans for the incorporation of the departments of quartermaster general and commissaries general of purchases and issues and that of the commissary of prisoners in some degree the whole to be under the direction of the quarter master general if there is an absolute necessity for such a reform i do not hesitate in pronouncing in favor of the second plan because by it the three great departments are united under one common head whereas by the first the commissariate in some measure exists which would lead to confusion and intricacy in transacting the business the board are very justly pleased to observe that all changes are not reformations and that great caution should be used in making them especially at     the opening of a campaign col pickering has i should suppose informed himself of the sentiments of his deputies upon the plan he has proposed otherwise should it be adopted it will be in their power to fix terms for themselves or confusion would immediately ensue by the resignation of all those who would not undertake an additional trouble of office without an addition of salary the effect of which at the present advanced season may easily be conceived œconomy is undoubtedly the sole motive and end of the plan proposed now if that cannot be introduced and in a very extensive way too it will be well to consider whether we had not best begin by the uniting as formerly the departments of purchasing and issuing commissary under one set of officers for as the board have again observed double sets of officers have been found productive of expence but little or no check upon each other by the second plan an officer under the character of superintendent who will be something similar in duty to the commissary of purchases at present is instituted he must be allowed it is presumed a certain number of clerks or assistants the quarter master general is also to be allowed a suitable number of clerks to enable him to transact the additional load of business thrown upon him now before a determination is formed let a calculation be made of the difference of expence between a commissary general of purchases with his assistants c both at fixed posts and with the army and a superintendent of provisions with his clerks and assistants and the additional number of clerks necessary to the quartermaster general should  00 he undertake the management of all the departments if the saving to the public should not appear very considerable by the abolition of the commissariate altogether will it be worth while to risque the mischiefs which may arise from an attempt unknown in other services or will it be worth while to add for a trifle to the load of business which in the embarrassed state of our affairs presses upon the quarter master for although as he observes he already has the care and trouble of drawing from fixed magazines all the provision deposited at them yet he would find upon experiment a thousand little perplexities incident to the commissarys department of which perhaps he is not aware while i applaud the motives on which he offers to undertake the business i cannot help expressing my fears that he is about to undertake too much for i very well know that when our public affairs were in better train the quartermaster general found it sufficiently difficult to execute the civil and military duties of his office and an active campaign will give him much more of the latter than he has yet experienced or may have an idea of from the inactivity of the last    george washington   april      new windsor majorgeneral lincoln to majorgeneral lincoln new windsor   april      dear sir every day convinces me that the enemy are determined to bend their force against the southern states and that we must support them powerfully  0  from this quarter or they will be lost except such support is given in time it will be ineffectual the enemy will not only have established themselves in posts but in the affections of many of the people the pennsylvania line is already ordered to the southern army and will march thither in detachment as it is reassembled and recruited i should not hesitate immediately to order a further reinforcement could i do it with prudence but we are so extremely weak not more than four hundred recruits from all the states having yet come in about one hundred of which from massachusetts that although the enemy have lately sent off another detachment of at least fifteen hundred men under the command of general phillips i do not think myself justifiable in doing it under present circumstances but that the measure may be adopted as early as possible i must desire and call upon you in the most positive manner to send forward every man from massachusetts that you can collect the urgency of the times requires that every exertion should be made to check the enemy in the rapidity of their progress to the southward you will have heard of the disappointment in the expedition against arnold general greene has had a general engagement with lord cornwallis  from which though he suffered a defeat he might ultimately derive advantages had his lordship no prospect of fresh succors but i have scarcely a doubt  0  that the detachment under general phillips is intended for that quarter should they form a junction and i see nothing to hinder it general greenes present force will not enable him to give any effectual opposition he had two hundred and ninety out of his small body of continental troops killed wounded and missing in the late action  you very well know that the collecting militia depends entirely upon the prospects of the day if favorable they throng in to you if not they will not move i perceive that you have by a late public order detained all the massachusetts officers who were then in the state i suppose that they might assist in bringing forward the levies you will keep only as many as are absolutely necessary for that purpose and send the others to their regiments they are exceedingly wanted there being scarcely a sufficient number in camp for ordinary duties i am c george washington   april      new windsor marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette new windsor   april      my dear marquis since my letter to you of yesterday i have attentively considered of what vast importance it will be to reinforce general greene as speedily as possible more especially as there can be little doubt but the  0  detachment under general phillips if not part of that now under the command of general arnold will ultimately join or in some degree coöperate with lord cornwallis i have communicated to the general officers at present with the army my sentiments on the subject and they are unanimously of opinion that the detachment under your command should proceed and join the southern army your being already three hundred miles advanced which is nearly half way is the reason which operates against any which can be offered in favor of marching that detachment back and forming another—a plan which i once had in my own mind as it was hastily formed and neither officers or men might have imagined they were to leave their corps for so great a length of time but as matters are circumstanced private inconveniences must give way to the public good and you will therefore immediately upon the receipt of this turn the detachment to the southward inform general greene that you are upon your march to join him and take his direction as to your route when you begin to approach him previous to that you will be guided by your own judgment and by the roads on which you will be most likely to find subsistence for the troops and horses it will be well to advise governor jefferson of your intended march through the state of virginia or perhaps it might answer a good purpose were you to go forward to richmond yourself after putting the troops in motion and having made some necessary arrangements for their progress  0  you will now take the light artillery and smallest mortars with their stores and the musket cartridges with you but let these follow under a proper escort rather than impede the march of the detachment which ought to move as expeditiously as possible without injury to them the heavy artillery and stores you will leave at some proper and safe place if it cannot be conveniently transported to christien river from whence it will be easily got to philadelphia you may leave it to the option of lieutenantcolonel stevens to proceed or not as he may think proper his family are in peculiar circumstances and he left it in the expectation of being absent but a short time should there be other officers under similar circumstances you may make them the same offers and they shall be relieved i will now mention to you in confidence the reason which operated with me more than almost any other in favor of recalling your detachment and forming another it was the uneasiness occasioned among the fieldofficers of those regiments which furnished the men upon the appointment of colonel gimat and major galvan to commands in the corps they presented a memorial to me upon the subject and i gave them the true reason which was that the regiments in their lines were so extremely thin of fieldofficers of their own that necessity if nothing else dictated the measure i have heard nothing of the discontent lately but should i find it revive again upon its being known that the corps is to continue together i shall be obliged for peace sake to  0  relieve those two gentlemen by officers properly belonging to the lines from which the regiments are formed you will therefore prepare them for such an event and tell them candidly the reasons founded principally upon their having already had their tour in the infantry should they be relieved they will probably incline to continue with the southern army there is as much or more probability of their finding employ there than with us as we shall from all appearances remain inactive i am my dear marquis c george washington   april      new windsor count rochambeau to count rochambeau head quarters new windsor   april      sir i have been honored with your excellencys favor of the   st ulto your remarks upon the uncertainty of operations which depend upon a combination of land and sea forces except there is a decisive superiority over the enemy as to the latter are judicious and consonant to the ideas which i had ever entertained upon the subject upon maturely considering the offer which your excellency has been pleased to make of marching all your force to this place except   00 men to be aided by  000 militia for the security of the fleet i am of opinion that it ought under present circumstances and appearances to be deferred as it would be putting you perhaps to an unnecessary trouble  0  and would besides the expences incident to calling out so large a body of militia tend to injure the completion of the continental battalions by recruits as the militia service is preferred by the peasantry to the continental the pay being greater the duty less—and the discipline more relaxed my reasons for waving your excellencys offer at the present time are briefly as follow i do not look upon the french troops essentially necessary at this place untill an operation against new york shall have been determined upon or untill we shall have been obliged to make so large detachments to the southward that we shall have occasion for them to assist in securing the post of west point and its dependencies—the communication from the delaware to the north river and affording cover to the country within reach of the enemys marauding parties altho i have upon finding that the enemy have sent a reinforcement of about   00 to the southward ordered the marquis de la fayette to proceed with the detachment under his command and join general greene i hope i shall be able with my remaining force and the recruits which now begin to come in to effect the latter purposes more especially as i can upon an emergency suddenly call in a respectable body of militia from the adjacent country it does not appear to me that an enterprise so weighty as that against new york can be decided upon untill we hear what reinforcements of men and ships may be expected from europe—i therefore think that the troops under your excellencys command may  0  remain in their present position untill the arrival of the viscount de rochambeau which i hope may be soon or some other intelligence from europe or till the situation of our southn affairs become yet more critical—but as it may have an effect upon the fears of the enemy in new york and hinder them from making further detachments to the southward i beg your excellency to circulate a report that you are soon to join this army and to make some demonstrations of preparing for a march indeed the approaching season—if it should not be our unhappy lot to spend another inactive campaign—will well warrant every necessary preparation for the field be the theatre of action where it may which will not only countenance the report but actually facilitate the measure if events should render it necessary to carry it into execution which is by no means improbable    george washington   april      new windsor to the president of congress head quarters new windsor   april      sir the enclosed return made up to the first of the month will show the number of recruits which have joined this part of the continental army since the formation of it upon the new establishment my requests to the executives of the several states have been earnest and my orders to the officers in them have been pointed and positive to send forward the recruits as fast as possible what to expect or  0  rather to apprehend from these delays congress can more easily conceive than i can describe some states i am told despairing of getting their quotas for the war or three years are resorting to the old expedient of temporary enlistments while impediments of another kind withhold the recruits from the army in others the bare relation of these facts without combining other circumstances of equal magnitude and uncertainty or adding to them the difficulties with which we are surrounded for want of money will convince congress of the impracticability of my fixing at this time on any definitive plan of campaign and of my inability to carry into effect those which have heretofore been the objects of contemplation they will readily see that our future operations depend upon contingencies and that our determinations must be the result of the moment dependent upon circumstances in this view of matters here the progress of the enemy under lord cornwallis and in consideration of the reinforcement which has lately gone to him i have judged it expedient to order the marquis de lafayette to proceed with his detachment to the southern army and put himself under the orders of majorgeneral greene the greatest objection i had to the measure circumstanced as things now are was that the detachment was not formed for the campaign or for so distant a service as that on which they are now ordered consequently neither officers nor men were prepared for it but the urgent calls for succor to the southern states the proximity of this corps to them the expedition with which it can  0  join the southern army and the public expense that will be saved by its advance have overcome all less considerations in deciding upon it i wish the march of the pennsylvania troops could be facilitated and that moylans cavalry could be recruited equipped and marched without delay for every judicious officer i have conversed with from the southward and all the representations i received from thence confirm me in the opinion that great advantages are to be derived from a superior cavalry without magazines and with an interrupted communication i do not see how lord cornwallis could have subsisted his army had we outnumbered him in horse i think it my duty to inform congress that there is great dissatisfaction at this time in the york line for want of pay near sixteen months i am told is due to it if it were practicable to give these and the jersey troops if they are in the same predicament a small portion of their pay it might stop desertions which are frequent and avert greater evils which are otherwise to be apprehended the four eastern states have given a temporary relief to their troops which makes the case of the others those of york particularly appear more distressing and grievous to them i have the honor to be c  george washington   april      new windsor john laurens to colonel john laurens at paris new windsor   april      my dear laurens colo armand who was charged with the delivery of many letters to you from the marquis de lafayette   0 imparting to his friends and the ministry of france your mission unfortunately arrived at boston after you had sailed by him i gave you an acct of the revolt of part of the jersey troops arnolds expedition to virginia leslies arrival at charles town and such other matters as occurred after your departure since that period several interesting events have happened some favorable others adverse among the first may be reckoned morgans brilliant action with tarleton among the latter the advantages gained by lord cornwallis over general greene the official accts of these i enclose to you cornwallis after the defeat of tarleton destroyed his wagons and made a violent effort to recover his prisoners but failing therein moved equally light and rapidly against general greene who though he had formed a junction with morgan was obliged to retreat before him into virginia whether from despair of recovering his prisoners of bringing greene to a general action or because he conceived his own situation critical i do not take upon me to determine but the fact is that here commenced cornwallis retrograde movements and greenes advance from the roanoke to the place of action on the first notice of the storm which happened on the   d of jany and of its effects i intimated to the french genl the possibility and importance of improving the opportunity in an attempt upon arnold when i received a more certn acct of the total loss of the culloden and the dismasting of the     bedford two   gun ships belonging to the british fleet at gardiners bay i immediately put in motion under the comd of ye marqs de lafayette as large a part of my small force here as i could with prudence detach  to proceed to the head of elk and made with all expedition a proposal to the count de rochambeau and the chevr destouches for a coöperation in virginia with the whole of the fleet of our allies and a part of their land force before my proposition arrived in consequence of an application to him from philadelphia the chevr destouches had sent a ship of the line and two or three frigates to chesapeake bay which not only retarded the plan i had proposed by awaiting their return but ultimately defeated the project as the enemy in the mean time remasted the bedford with those taken out of the culloden and following the french fleet arrived off the capes of virginia before it where a naval combat glorious for the french who were inferior in ships and guns but unprofitable for us who were disappointed of our object was the issue the failure of this expedition which was most flattering in the commencement is much to be regretted because a successful blow in that quarter would in all probability have given a decisive turn to our affairs in all the southern states because it has been attended with considerable expense on our part and much inconvenience to the state of virginia by the assembling of its militia because the world are disappointed at not seeing arnold in gibbets and above all     because we stood in need of something to keep us afloat till the result of your mission is known for be assured my dear laurens that day does not follow night more certainly than it brings with it some additional proof of the impracticability of carrying on the war without the aids you were directed to solicit as an honest and candid man as a man whose all depends on the final and happy termination of the present contest i assert this while i give it decisively as my opinion that without a foreign loan our present force which is but the remnant of an army cannot be kept together this campaign much less will it be increased and in readiness for another the observations contained in my letter to you of the   th of january last are verified every moment and if france delays a timely and powerful aid in this critical posture of our affairs it will avail us nothing should she attempt it hereafter we are at this hour suspended in the balle not from choice but from hard and absolute necessity for you may rely on it as a fact that we cannot transport the provisions from the states in which they are assessed to the army because we cannot pay the teamsters who will no longer work for certificates it is equally certain that our troops are approaching fast to nakedness and that we have nothing to cloathe them with that our hospitals are without medicines and our sick without nutriment except such as well men eat that all our public works are at a stand and the artificers disbanding but why need i run into the detail when it may be declared in a word that we are at the end of our tether and that now or never our deliverance     must come while alas how easy would it be to retort the enemys own game upon them if it could be made to comport with the genl plan of the war to keep a superior fleet always in these seas and france would put us in a conditn to be active by advancing us money the ruin of the enemys schemes would then be certain the bold game they are now playing would be the mean to effect it for they would be reduced to the necessity of concentring their force at capital points thereby giving up all the advantages they have gained in the southern states or be vulnerable everywhere such of the pensylvania line as had reassembled and were recruited say about  000 were ordered the middle of feby to join the southern army and since the disappointment of our enterprise against arnold i have directed the detachment under the comd of the marqs de lafayette to proceed thither but how either can march without money or credit is more than i can tell with every wish for your success and a safe and speedy return and with every sentiment of esteem and affection i am dear sir c    george washington  0 april      new windsor count de rochambeau to count de rochambeau head quarters new windsor  0 april      sir i had the pleasure of receiving your excellencys letter of the  th instant only two hours ago we are greatly indebted to the chevalier destouches for the disposition he shows to undertake the expedition to penobscot and to you for your readiness to furnish     a detachment of troops for the same purpose the object is certainly worth attention and if it can be effected will be very agreeable to the states particularly to those of the east m destouches can best judge from the situation of the enemys fleet how far it may be attempted with prudence and your excellency from the information you have recently received what number of troops will be sufficient for the enterprise i am persuaded it will be calculated how far it is probable the enemy may follow with a part of their fleet whether the post can be carried by a coup de main or may require so much time as to make it likely the operation will be interrupted before its conclusion in case of a superior squadron being sent by the enemy what possibility there is of protection or a safe retreat for the ships and even for the land force through an unsettled country all these are points too important not to have been well weighed and your conversations with the massachusetts deputies will have been able to enlighten you upon them the confidence i have in your judgment assures to you the concurrence of my sentiments in whatever you may do on the occasion i will only take the liberty to remark two things one that it appears to me frigates without any ships of the line will answer the purpose as well as with them and less will be risked by dividing the body of the fleet frigates including the fortyfours will afford a safe escort to the troops against any thing now in those seas and with respect to a detachment from     the enemys fleet it would always be proportioned to the force we should send and if we have two sixtyfours they would even be an object for their whole fleet the other observation i would make is that as despatch is essential to success it will in my opinion be advisable not to depend on any coöperation of the militia but to send at once such a force from your army as you deem completely adequate to a speedy reduction of the post the country in the neighborhood of penobscot is too thinly inhabited to afford any resource of militia there and to assemble and convey them from remote places would announce your design retard your operations and give leisure to the enemy to counteract you indeed i would recommend for the sake of secrecy to conceal your determination from the state itself these hints you will be pleased to make use of only so far as they appear to be well founded i have the honor to be c  p s i enclose a piece of intelligence just received from the president of congress     george washington    april      new windsor marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette head quarters new windsor    april      my dear marquis your favor dated at elk the  th instant reached me at ten oclock last evening while i give you credit for the manœuvre by which you removed the british ships from before annapolis i am sorry as matters are circumstanced that you have put yourself so much further from the point which now of necessity becomes the object of your destination whether general phillips remains in virginia or goes further southward he must be opposed by a force more substantial than militia alone and you will for that reason immediately open a communication with general greene inform him of the numbers situation and probable views of the enemy in virginia and take his directions as to marching forward to join him or remaining there to keep a watch upon the motions of phillips should he have formed a junction with arnold at portsmouth every difficulty so far as respects the wants of the officers and men and the uneasinesses which might arise upon their being ordered upon a more distant service than they expected were foreseen and would have been removed by recalling the detachment and forming another had not the reasons of a public nature which were mentioned in my letter of the  th outweighed all private considerations     you must endeavor to get shoes which will be essentially necessary before you can move from philadelphia and if you will cause a return to be made of such articles as will probably be wanting in the course of the campaign i will endeavor to forward them from hence with a proportion of any stores which may have been sent on by the states for their troops if the officers will write back to their friends here for any additional baggage of which they may stand in need it shall be forwarded under careful conductors the difficulties which you will experience on the score of provision and transportation would have been common to any other body of troops they will i know be great but i depend much upon your assiduity and activity had i have had the most distant prospect of such an operation as you speak of i should have looked upon your detachment as essential to the undertaking but i can assure you without entering into a detail of reasons which i cannot commit to paper that i have not at present an idea of being able to effect such a matter  this had very considerable weight in the determination of the general officers and myself for we would have been very happy in an opportunity of succoring the southern states by a diversion could it have been attempted with any tolerable hope of success the small remains of the jersey line seem necessary to form a head to which the recruits if any are obtained may unite themselves that line stands     next for detachment and therefore it is more than probable that it may soon become necessary to send the whole to the southward but the reason which i have just mentioned operates in favor of keeping the remainder as long as possible i shall be glad to hear from you the time of your setting out from elk your prospects of getting on and the temper of the troops and above all i shall ever be happy in knowing that you are well and that every thing contributes to your happiness and satisfaction being very truly and sincerely my dear marquis c p s you seem aware of the danger of attempting a passage down the chesapeak by water i will add my opinion that it is not on any account to be attempted george washington    april      new windsor to the president of congress new windsor    april      sir previous to the receipt of your letter  i had directed the commissary of prisoners to renew a proposal which was some time since made to the enemy for exchanging general burgoyne and a balance of private     prisoners due to us for the residue of our officers on long island and as many of the southern officers as would make up the difference my motives for this proposal were these general burgoyne is said to be in ill health his death would deprive us in exchanges of the value of one thousand and forty private men or officers equivalent according to the tariff which has been settled i thought it advisable not to risk so considerable a loss when his exchange would give relief to a number of our officers in captivity and disembarrass the public of the inconvenience of maintaining them there the moment i received your letter i wrote to mr skinner countermanding his instructions i believe the countermand will arrive before he has done any thing in the matter but if it does not i am persuaded the enemy will again reject the proposal as soon as i hear from him if things are situated as i expect i will execute immediately the order for the recall of general burgoyne to the best of my recollection all the officers in europe on parole have been exchanged i have the honor to be c   0 george washington    april      new windsor majorgeneral greene to majorgeneral greene new windsor    april      my dear sir your private letter of the   th ulto came safe to hand  altho the honors of the field did not fall to your lot i am convinced you deserved them the chances of war are various and the best concerted measures and the most flattering prospects may and often do deceive us especially while we are in the power of militia the motives wch induced you to seek an action with lord cornwallis are supportable upon the best military principles and the consequences if you can prevent the dissipation of your troops will no doubt be fortunate every support that it is in my power to give you from this army     shall chearfully be afforded but if i part with any more troops i must accompany them or have none to command as there is not at this moment more than a garrison for west point nor can i tell when there will be i am much pleased to find by your letter that the state of virginia exerts itself to your satisfaction my public and private letters strongly inculcate the necessity of this and i have again urged congress to use every possible mean in their power to facilitate the march of the pensylvania line as also to recruit equip and forward moylans dragoons to you with despatch i should be very sorry on any occasion to hurt the feelings of the baron de steuben whom i esteem as a very valuable officer but in the instance you have mentioned there is no cause of complaint for if he will advert to his own letters to me he will find that there was a great probability of his having marched with a detachment to reinforce you besides which there was a necessity for sending a genl officer with the detachment from hence and political considerations as it was to be a combined operation depending upon critical circumstances with a french land and sea force pointed to the marquis add to this i know that the french troops were to be commanded by an officer of senior rank to either the baron or marquis these are the facts the knowledge of which must i am persuaded satisfy the baron i am truly sensible of the merit and fortitude of     the veteran bands under your command and wish ye sentiments i entertain of their worth could be communicated with the warmth i feel them it was my full intention to have requested you to thank morgan and the gallant troops under his commd for their brilliant victory but the hurry in which my letters are too often written occasioned the omission at the time i acknowledged the official account of that action your conjecture respecting the cause of the p—m—y  has more substantial ground for its support than the letter of the m of c and i am mistaken if the licentious conduct of that line was not more the effect of an overcharge of spirits on the  st of january than of premeditated design i have the pleasure to tell you that as far as i am acquainted with the opinion of congress with respect to your conduct it is much in your favor that this is the sentiment of all the southern delegates i have great reason to believe because i have it declared to me in explicit terms by some of them since writing the above i have recd a letter from mr custis dated the   th ulto in which are these words genl greene has by his conduct gained universal esteem and possesses in the fullest degree the confidence of all ranks of people he had then just returned from the assembly at richmond i hope the disorder of which you complained in your letter of the   th was no other than the effect of over fatigue and that you are now perfectly well that success equal     to your merits and wishes may attend you is the ardent desire of dear sir c p s mrs washington and the rest of the family present their best wishes to you and i have the pleasure to tell you that mrs greene and your children were well lately your letters to her under cover to me are regularly forwarded by the post george washington    april      marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette headquarters    april      my dear marquis though the situation of southern affairs would not permit me to recall your corps to this army yet it was with great reluctance i could resolve upon seeing you separated from headquarters my friendship for you makes me desirous of having you near me and there will occur frequent occasions in coöperative measures in which it would be of the greatest utility i should have it in my power to consult you these motives would have induced me to propose to you to return personally to headquarters had i not believed you would not have chosen to quit your corps and had i not foreseen a difficulty in giving you a command in the remaining troops a select corps you could not have and there are so many majorgenerals who conceive themselves in a manner wedded to the different lines and who are to be provided for that it would not be easy at present to accommodate matters to your having a command in the line but this difficulty might be overcome and i cannot forbear     late as it is leaving it at your option to proceed with your corps or return personally to headquarters if the last should be your choice you will give orders to the officer you leave in command to march with all the necessary precaution and take the orders of the baron de steuben you will at the same time write to the baron communicating to him your instructions and to general greene informing him of your return if you resolve to proceed forward i shall have one consolation which is that from the present aspect of things it is perhaps most probable the weight of the war this campaign will be in the southern states and it will become my duty to go there in person where i shall have the pleasure of seeing you again of this i would not have you to say any thing    george washington    april      new windsor marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette new windsor    april      my dear marquis since writing the enclosed your several letters acknowledged in my public one of this date are come to hand—all of them except that of the   th arrived at hdquarters within the course of one hour the reasons assigned in some of your letters and others which have occurred to me chiefly of a political nature assure me that great advantages will be derived from your being wherever the french army and the american headquarters are i therefore not only repeat the offer contained in the enclosed letter but accompany it with a wish that you may return     if you can consistently with your own inclination relinquish your present command for the prospects i have mentioned not else as it always has been and ever will be my wish to make things as agreeable to you as the nature of the service will admit to recall the detachment i cannot for reasons which in my judgment are conclusive the accidents to which letters are liable forbid me unless i could write to you in cipher to go into a full explanation of some matters wch you seem not to be well informed and wch i wish to set you write in but i dare not attempt it in a common letter nor will there be any necessity for it if you return i am very sorry that any letter of mine should be the subject of public discussion or give the smallest uneasiness to any person living  the letter to which i presume you allude was a confidential one from me to mr lund washington with whom i have lived in perfect intimacy for near  0 years i can neither avow the letter as it is published by mr rivington nor declare that it is spurious because my letter to this gentn was wrote in great haste and no copy of it taken all i remember of the matter is that at the time of writing it i was a good deal chagrined to find by your letter of the   th of march from york     town in virginia that the french fleet had not at that time appeared within the capes of the chesapeake and i meant in strict confidence to express my apprehensions and concern for the delay but as we know that the alteration of a single word does oftentimes divert the sense or give force to expression unintended by the letterwriter i should not be surprised at mr rivington or the inspector of his gazette having taken this liberty with the letter in question especially as he or they have i am told lately published a letter from me to govr hancock and his answer which never had an existence but in the gazette that the enemy fabricated a number of letters for me formerly is a fact well known that they are not less capable of doing it now few will deny as to his asserting that this is a genuine copy of the original he well knows that their friends do not want to convict him of a falsehood and that ours have not the opportunity of doing it though both sides are knowing to his talents for lying  the event which you seem to speak of with regret my friendship for you would most assuredly have induced me to impart to you in the moment it happened had it not been for the request of h— who desired that no mention might be made of it why this injunction on me while he was communicating     it himself is a little extraordinary but i complied and religiously fulfilled it  with every sentiment of affectionate regard i am c this letter wch you say has made much noise i enclose you lest you may not have had it from any other quarter george washington    april      new windsor marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette head quarters new windsor    april      my dear marquis i have received your several letters of the   th   th two of the   th and two of the   th i am extremely concerned at the temper of your detachment and the desertions that are taking place i imagine however that these would have been nearly as great in any other corps that might have been sent and after the pennsylvania line i think it would be ineligible to detach any other state line we find by experience that they are not only dissipated on the march but being at a great distance from their states are almost entirely neglected few recruits are raised for them and these few are lost on the way we see how totally the maryland line has declined     and how little is doing to reëstablish it a line formerly among the most numerous and respectable in the army our plan at present appears to me to be to commit the defence of the southern states to the states as far as pennsylvania inclusive and to make up any additional succors that may be necessary by detachment we must endeavor to compensate these detachments for the loss of state supplies by giving them a larger proportion of continental on this principle i am sending you articles mentioned in the enclosed list twelve hundred shirts twelve hundred linen overalls twelve hundred pairs of shoes twelve hundred pairs of socks and one hundred huntingshirts which set out two days ago from this place i have also urged the board of war to do their best for you    it appears to me extraordinary that your advices should have given you an idea so different from the whole complexion of the intelligence i had received concerning the probability of a certain event  this and the situation of our own force have induced me to regard it as barely possible too precarious to enter far into our dispositions possible only in a case which we are not authorized to expect will happen  i dare not trust the details on which this opinion is founded to paper     the danger to the southern states is immediate and pressing it is our duty to give them support the detachment with you all circumstances considered was the most proper for the purpose the project general greene has lately adopted adds a particular motive to continuing its destination it is essential to him that phillips should be held in check and we cannot wholly rely on militia for this as to a transportation by water while the enemy commands the chesapeake and cape fear i do not see how it is practicable the only cause of hesitation in my mind about sending your corps to the southward was a separation from you i refer you to private letters accompanying this one written previous to the receipt of your last the other subsequently as to our force here you know what it was when you left us and you will know what it is now when i tell you that we have as yet received but few recruits the enemys present force of regular troops at new york is near seven thousand i shall recommend major macpherson as you request to general greene present my warmest thanks to that officer and assure him of the sense i have of his services    i am my dear marquis c george washington    april      new windsor alexander hamilton to lieutenantcolonel alexander hamilton new windsor    april      dear sir your letter of this date has not a little embarrassed me  you must remember the ferment in the pennsylvania   0 line the last campaign occasioned by the appointment of major macpherson and you know the uneasiness which at this moment exists among the eastern troops on account of the commands conferred upon colonel gimat and major galvan although it was the result of absolute necessity should circumstances admit of the formation of another advanced corps of which i see very little prospect from present appearances it can be but small and must be composed almost entirely of eastern troops and to add to the discontents of the officers of those lines by the further appointment of an officer of your rank to ye command of it or in it would i am certain involve me in a difficulty of a very disagreeable and delicate nature and might perhaps lead to consequences more serious than it is easy to imagine while i adhere firmly to the right of making such appointments as you request i am at the same time obliged to reflect that it will not do to push that right too far more especially in a service like ours and at a time so critical as the present i am convinced that no officer can with justice dispute your merit and abilities the opposition heretofore made has not been for the want of those qualifications in the gentlemen who are and have been the objects of discontent the officers of the line contend without having reference to particular persons that it is a hardship and reflection upon them to introduce brevet officers into commands of some     permanency in which there are more opportunities of distinguishing themselves than in the line of the army at large and with the men they have had the trouble to discipline and prepare for the field my principal concern arises from an apprehension that you will impute my refusal of your request to other motives than those i have expressed but i beg you to be assured i am only influenced by the reasons which i have mentioned i am dear sir c george washington  0 april      new windsor count de rochambeau to count de rochambeau head quarters new windsor  0 april      sir i assure your excellency that i feel extreme pain at the occasion of that part of your letter of the   th instant which relates to an intercepted letter of mine published by the enemy  i am unhappy that an accident     should have put it in their power to give to the world any thing from me which may contain an implication the least disagreeable to you or to the chevalier destouches i assure you sincerely that i have no copy of the original letter in my possession so that i am unable by a comparison to determine how far the publication may be just the enemy have fabricated whole letters for me and even a series of letters and it is not improbable they may have given a different turn to some of my expressions in the present instance it would however be disingenous in me not to acknowledge that i believe the general import to be true the copy however which your excellency has sent to me differs in some respects from that which the enemy has published as you will perceive by the enclosed gazette whatever construction     it may bear i beg your excellency will consider the letter to a private friend a gentleman who has the direction of my concerns at home totally unconnected with public affairs and on whose discretion i could absolutely rely no idea of the same kind has ever gone to any public body when i say that i believe the general import of the publication to be true i mean it in this sense that there did appear to me a degree of delay in executing the enterprise suggested by me with the causes of which i was not well apprized and an idea of this kind was probably expressed in my letter to mr washington as to the apparent insinuation that the first expedition had been preferred to the one proposed by me i could not have intended to     convey it in its fullest latitude because it would have been unjust i could not but have recollected that my formal proposal did not reach you till after the departure of the first squadron though the suggestion of it was previous my letter however was written in haste and might have been inaccurately expressed i have lately learnt though not officially that the cause of the delay i have alluded to was a want of supplies for the fleet impressed with a real esteem for and confidence in the chevalier destouches i heard this circumstance with satisfaction with this explanation i leave the matter to his candor and to yours and flatter myself it will make no impressions inconsistent with an entire persuasion of my sincere esteem and attachment i have the honor to be with perfect respect c  george washington  0 april      new windsor benjamin tallmadge to major benjamin tallmadge head quarters new windsor  0 april      dear sir your two favors of the   th and   th have been duly received fully impressed with the idea of the utility of early regular and accurate communication of the kind in contemplation i shall make no difficulty in acceding to the proposal contained in your private     letter from newport but at the same time that i am engaging in behalf of the united states a liberal reward for the services of the c—s  of whose fidelity and ability i entertain a high opinion it is certainly but reasonable from patriotism and every other principle that their exertions should be proportionably great to subserve essentially the interest of the public all the interior and minute arrangements of the correspondence i request you will settle with them as expeditiously and advantageously as may be and especially that you will urge in very forcible terms the necessity of having the communications as circumstantial frequent and expeditious as possible the great objects of information you are very well acquainted with such as arrivals embarkations preparations for movements alterations of positions situations of posts fortifications garrisons strength or weakness of each distribution and strength of corps and in general every thing which can be interesting and important for us to know besides these you are also sensible that there are many things upon a smaller scale which are necessary to be reported and that whatever intelligence is communicated ought to be not in general terms but in detail and with the greatest precision at present i am anxious to know for the reports have been very numerous vague and uncertain whether another embarkation is preparing and if so to what amount and where destined what the present force of the enemy is particularly on long island in new york     and at kingsbridge what corps are at the latter place how strong and where posted exactly and indeed what the situation prospects and designs of the enemy are so far as they can be penetrated into i am c george washington  0 april      new windsor lund washington to lund washington at mount vernon new windsor  0 april       dear lund your letter of the   th come to me by the last post i am very sorry to hear of your loss i am a little sorry to hear of my own but that which gives me most concern is that you should go on board the enemys vessels and furnish them with refreshments it would have been a less painful circumstance to me to have heard that in consequence of your noncompliance with their request they had burnt my house and laid the plantation in ruins you ought to have considered yourself as my representative and should have reflected on the bad example of communicating with the enemy and making a voluntary offer of refreshments     to them with a view to prevent a conflagration it was not in your power i acknowledge to prevent them from sending a flag on shore and you did right to meet it but you should in the same instant that the business of it was unfolded have declared explicitly that it was improper for you to yield to the request after which if they had proceeded to help themselves by force you could but have submitted and being unprovided for defence this was to be preferred to a feeble opposition which only serves as a pretext to burn and destroy i am thoroughly persuaded that you acted from your best judgment and believe that your desire to preserve my property and rescue the buildings from impending danger were your governing motives but to go on board their vessels carry them refreshments commune with a parcel of plundering scoundrels and request a favor by asking a surrender of my negroes was exceedingly ill judged and t is to be feared will be unhappy in its consequences as it will be a precedent     for others and may become a subject of animadversion i have no doubt of the enemys intention to prosecute the plundering plan they have begun and unless a stop can be put to it by the arrival of a superior naval force i have as little doubt of its ending in the loss of all my negroes and in the destruction of my houses but i am prepared for the event under the prospect of which if you could deposit in safety at some convenient distance from the water the most valuable and least bulky articles it might be consistent with policy and prudence and a mean of preserving them hereafter such and so many things as are necessary for common and present use must be retained and run their chance through the fiery trial of this summer i am sincerely yours mrs washington joins me in best and affectionate regard for you mrs washington and milly posey i do not know what negroes they may have left you and as i have observed before i do not know what number they will have left me by the time they have done—but this much i am sure of that you shall never want assistance when it is in my power to afford it i am c george washington   may      new windsor marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette new windsor   may      my dear marquis the freedom of your communications is an evidence to me of the sincerity of your attachment and every fresh instance of this gives pleasure and adds     strength to the bond which unites us in friendship in this light i view the intimation contained in your letter of the   d ulto from alexandria respecting the conduct of mr lund washington some days previous to the receipt of your letter which only came to my hands yesterday i received an acct of this transaction from the gentleman himself and immediately wrote and forwarded the answer of which the enclosed is a copy this letter which was written in the moment of my obtaining the first intimation of the matter may be considered as a testimony of my disapprobation of his conduct and the transmission of it to you as a proof of my friendship because i wish you to be assured that no man can condemn the measure more sincerely than i do a false idea arising from the consideration of his being my steward and in that character more the trustee and guardian of my property than the representative of my honor has misled his judgment and plunged him into error upon the appearance of desertion of my negroes and danger to my buildings for sure i am that no man is more firmly opposed to the enemy than he from a thorough conviction of this and of his integrity i entrusted every species of my property to his care without reservation or fear of his abusing it the last paragraph of my letter to him was occasioned by an expression of his fear that all the estates convenient to the river would be stripped of their negroes and movable property i am very happy to find that desertions had ceased and content had taken place in the detachment you   0 commanded  before this letter can have reached you you must have taken your ultimate resolution upon the proposal contained in my letters of the   st and   d of last month and have made the consequent arrangements i shall be silent therefore on the subject of them and only beg in case you should not return to this army and the papers were not lost with your other baggage on which event give me leave to express my concern that you would permit mr capitaine to furnish me with copies of the drafts and remarks of the pilots taken at colonel deys on the entrance of the harbor of new york it is possible they may be wanted and i am not able to furnish them without your assistance mrs washington and the rest of my small family which at present consists only of tilghman and humphreys join me in cordial salutations and with sentiments of the purest esteem and most affectionate regard i remain my dear marquis c george washington   may      new windsor to the president of congress head quarters new windsor   may      sir i have been honored with your excellencys favors of the   th and   th ultimo with the inclosures to which you refer—they shall be duly attended to under cover of the letter of the   th is one from general gates to congress indorsed by the     secretary ordered to be transmitted to the commander in chief without any particular directions respecting the subject of it congress have been informed of the instructions which have been given to general greene relative to bringing on the enquiry upon general gates as early as circumstances would admit and they have been advised that it was deemed impracticable at the time to hold a court at the southern army for the reasons given to general greene by the board of general and field officers consulted upon the occasion general gates has also been furnished with these reasons there remain but two methods of determining the matter speedily in a military way—directing general greene to order a court of enquiry immediately and at all events or taking depositions at the southward and bringing them before a court in this army i am sorry that i am obliged so often to wound the feelings of congress with accounts of our distressed situation on the score of provisions but duty calls upon me to represent what it is not in my power by my utmost exertions to prevent  your excellency will perceive by copies of letters from general heath of the  th instant and from     briga genl clinton of the  0th of april and  th instant to what an alarming situation we are reduced at these posts and upon the northern frontier upon the receipt of genl clintons letter of the  0th ulto i upon the  th sent off    barrels of beef which was every ounce in the magazine and  0 barrels of flour to albany i am now upon receiving the letter of the  th sending off  00 out of     barrels in the magazine of meat i have not a barrel to send the quarter master is unable to transport what is at the distant magazines and the states neither do that or send on beef cattle agreeable to requisition i have written most pressingly to the president of pennsylvania for a supply of flour and that nothing may be left unessayed on my part i am going to send major general heath to the eastern states purposely to represent our distresses for meat in their true colors and to point out to them the inevitable consequences of a failure in the noncompliance with the requisitions upon them whether this will have any better effect than my frequent applications by letter i cannot say but of this i am certain that if there is not a very great and sudden change of measures it will be next to impossible to keep the army together     to add to our present embarrassments application has just been made to me by colonel menonville who is sent forward by count rochambeau to know in what manner it will be most convenient to us to make payment for a very large quantity of provisions with which doctor franklin in behalf of the united states has contracted to supply the french army colonel menonvilles instructions have reference to resolves of congress and letters which have passed between your excellency and count rochambeau on the subject but as i am totally a stranger to the whole transaction i have been under the necessity of referring him to congress and have taken the liberty to give him letters of introduction to your excellency as colonel menonville was very pressing with me to know whether i could give him any assurances of the provision being furnished and at what places it would be most proper to deposit it i could only tell him that none of what had been required of the states for the subsistence of the army could possibly be spared because the requisitions were they fully complied with would not be more than adequate to our own wants i gave him my opinion as to the proper places of deposit in as particular a manner as the uncertainty of our plan of operations would admit colo menonville is likewise charged by the count rochambeau to solicit some heavy iron cannon for the works at newport in place of the brass battering cannon which are at present in them and which there will be a necessity of removing should the army     remove when i told him that i knew of none belonging to the continent but what were in use he informed me he understood that there were some in new hampshire which had been imported for the    gun ship now upon the stocks upon this i promised him to mention the matter to congress and to recommend a compliance with his request if the cannon should be there and can be spared without inconvenience i have c  george washington    may      new windsor john sullivan to john sullivan in congress new windsor    may      dear sir not having seen or heard of any resolve in congress for establishing the principles of promotion in the army i am apprehensive that the report of the committee who had this matter under consideration is now sleeping in congress this and a recent instance in the pensylvania regiment of artillery in proof of the absolute necessity of adopting some mode by which the whole army may be bd and a stop thereby be put to those disputes which keep it in a continual state of distraction and discontent are the reasons for my troubling you again on this subject and praying that some decision may be come to by congress it is much easier to avoid disagreements than to remove disconts and i again declare that if my differing in sentiment from the opins of     the comee in some points has been the occasion of delay i would rather than have the matter lie over a moment yield a free assent to all their propositions for any principle is better than none i also wish though this is more a matter of private than public consideration that the business could be taken up on acct of mr tilghman whose appt seems to depd upon it for if there are men in the army deserving the comn proposed for him he is one of them this gentn came out a captn of one of the light infy companies of phila and served in the flying camp in      in august of the same year he joined my family and has been in every action in which the main army was concerned he has been a zealous servant and slave to the public and a faithful assistant to me for near five years great part of which time he refused to receive pay honor and gratitude interest me in his favor and make me sollicitous to obtain his commission his modesty and love of concord placed the date of his expected comn at the  st of april      because he would not take rank of hamilton and meade who were declared aides in orders which he did not choose to be before that period altho he had joined my family and done all the duties of one from the  st of septr preceding my public letters to congress will have informed you of the situation of this army and i have no scruple in giving it as my decided opn that unless a capital change takes place soon it will be impossible for me to maintain our posts and keep the army from dispersing     the resolution of congress to appoint ministers of war foreign affairs and finance gave as far as i was able to learn the sentiments of men in and out of ye army universal satisfaction postponing of the  st delaying of the  d and disagreeing about the  d have had the direct contrary effect and i can venture to assure you not from random guess or vague information that the want of an able financier and a proper plan for the disposition of foreign loans will be a greater bar to the obtaining of them than perhaps congress are aware of i could say more on this subject were i at liberty but i shall only add that there is not in my opinion a moment to be lost in placing such a character as the world conceives an opinion of at the head of your finance that he may as soon as possible enter upon the duties of his office i am c george washington    may      new windsor philip schuyler to philip schuyler head quarters new windsor    may      dear sir the letter which you did me the favor to write on the  th instant has been duly received i am glad to find that you have received the necessary papers and are entering upon the measures for intercepting the enemys communications i hope you will be enabled by the assistance of the person proposed if he is found sufficiently faithful and intelligent to prosecute those measures to good effect because i think the intelligence obtained through     that channel may be depended upon and will eventually be of very great consequence to us much i apprehend is to be dreaded from the predatory incursions of the enemy this campaign to be apprized of their designs and guarded against them at all points as far as possible will tend most essentially to disconcert their plans and protect our frontiers as to the disposition of the vermontese i know nothing of it but from report at present they are at least a dead weight upon us it is greatly to be regretted that they are not by some means or other added to our scale as their numbers strength and resources would certainly preponderate very considerably and make the enemy extremely cautious how they advanced far in that quarter the bulk of the people i am persuaded must be well affected should it be otherwise with any of the individuals i ardently wish they may be detected in their villany and brought to the punishment they deserve      i have been exceeding distressed by the repeated accounts i have received of the sufferings of the troops on the frontier and the terrible consequences which must ensue unless they were speedily supplied what gave a particular poignancy to the sting i felt     on the occasion was my inability to afford relief such partial supplies however as were on hand to the very last barrel of meat i ordered instantly to be sent and have promised general clinton what further succor the states will enable me to give majorgeneral   0 heath hath gone to the several eastern states to enforce my pointed representations rouse them to more vigorous exertions and to make arrangements for supplies during the whole campaign i cannot but hope this measure will be attended with success i am c george washington    may      new windsor to the president of congress head quarters new windsor    may      sir his excellency the count de rochambeau having received despatches from the court of france by his son the viscount de rochambeau who arrived at boston in the frigate la concorde the  th instant has requested an interview with me i have appointed the place of meeting at weathersfield on monday next for which purpose i shall set out tomorrow from hence i am in hopes we shall be able from the intelligence received to settle a definitive plan of campaign i am sorry to inform your excellency that a part of our advanced troops were surprised on monday morning near croton river by about sixty horse and two hundred foot under the command of colonel delancey colonel greene who commanded our party was mortally wounded in his quarters the enemy attempted to carry him off but he died upon the road major flagg was killed the loss of these officers is to be regretted especially the former who had upon several occasions distinguished himself     particularly in the defence of the post at red bank in      when he defeated count donop i enclose a return of our loss upon the late occasion the enemy on their return fell in with captain fog of the new hampshire line who was patrolling near the white plains they attempted to surround him and cut him off by dint of superior numbers but the captain made so good a disposition of his small force that he brought them off with the loss of two men only the enemy had a captain and several men killed in the attack i have the honor to be c  substance of a conference between general washington and count de rochambeau at weathersfield    may       rochambeau—concerning a project of employing the squadron at newport to transport the french army to the chesapeake bay he consulted count de barras who deemed it impracticable     chiefly on account of the inferiority of the naval force to that of the enemy the objections were mentioned in detail   st washington—however desirable such an event might have been the reasons assigned by count de barras are sufficient to prove its impracticability rochambeau—should the french army march to the north river will the squadron be safe at newport under a guard of militia by secret instructions he is not permitted to separate his army except for detachments of a short duration count de barras thinks the squadron would not be secure if the enemy should take possession of rhode island and moreover he has been instructed that in case the army should march into the country his fleet should proceed to boston  d washington—it is genl washingtons opinion that the plan of campaign will render it necessary for the french army to march from newport towards the north river as soon as possible and that consequently it will be advisable for the count de barras agreeable to his instructions in that case provided to seek the first favorable moment of removing the squadron under his command to boston rochambeau—in that case what does general washington propose about rhode island does he intend it should be kept by a general officer and a body of american militia it is to be observed that if in the hurricane months the french fleet should     come to the coast the harbor of rhode island might be of use to the operations of the squadrons either for a union to act against new york or as a place of retreat in case of misfortune  d washington—as the harbor of rhode island may be useful to the fleets of his most christian majesty it is genl washingtons opinion that a force should be left for the security of newport but as the enemy will not be in a condition from the present circumstances of their affairs to detach any considerable body of men to repossess the island it is agreed between his excellency count de rochambeau and genl washington that  00 militia under a good officer will be sufficient for the guards for the works but in case of an enterprise against them a greater force should be called for their defence rochambeau—if general washington resolves that rhode island shall be left and the works destroyed does he consider the siege artillery powder magazines and heavy stores which cannot follow the french army in a land march as safe at providence under the two hundred french troops and the militia for such an object the english may attempt an enterprise to seize these stores would they not be more secure if taken with the fleet to boston  th washington—in the former communications between his excellency count de rochambeau and genl washington it was understood that the french fleet was to have remained in the harbor of newport after the removal of the army and therefore providence was fixed upon as a safe and proper deposit of the heavy artillery and spare stores—it now being determined that the fleet shall embrace the first opportunity of going round to the harbor of boston it is to be wished that the heavy artillery and spare stores should be sent round also but genl washington being informed by his excellency count de rochambeau that they have been already deposited at providence and that it will be impossible under the present circumstances of the fleet and want of transportation to remove them to boston he is of opinion that they may safely remain there under the guard of  00 french troops who will be aided by the militia of the country in case of need the possession of newport will add to their security     rochambeau—should the squadron from the west indies arrive in these seas an event that will probably be announced by a frigate beforehand what operations will general washington have in view after a union of the french army with his own  th washington—the enemy by several detachments from new york having reduced their force at that post to less than one half of the number which they had at the time of the former conference at hartford in september last it is thought advisable to form a junction of the french and american armies upon the north river as soon as possible and move down to the vicinity of new york to be ready to take advantage of any opportunity which the weakness of the enemy may afford should the west indies fleet arrive upon the coast the force thus combined may either proceed in the operation against new yk or may be directed against the enemy in some other quarter as circumstances shall dictate the great waste of men which we have found from experience in long marches to the southern states the advanced season now to commence these in and the difficulties and expense of land transportation thither with other considerations too well known to his excellency count de rochambeau to need detailing point out the preference which an operation against new york seems to have in present circumstances over an attempt to send a force to the southward answer to the p s the observation upon the  th head sufficiently answers this as the numerals  00 militia proposed to be stationed at newport may be disposed of in any manner which his excellency count de rochambeau may think proper weathersfield   d may      george washington    may      weathersfield chevalier de la luzerne to the chevalier de la luzerne weathersfield    may      sir the letter which i have the honor to enclose from the count de rochambeau will i imagine inform you of the intended march of the french army towards     the north river and of the destination of the kings squadron now in the harbor of newport if circumstances will admit of the respective movements i should be wanting in respect and confidence were i not to add that our object is new york the season the difficulty and expense of land transportations and the continual waste of men in every attempt to reinforce the southern states are almost insuperable objections to marching another detachment from the army on the north river nor do i see how it is possible to give effectual support to those states and avert the evils which threaten them while we are inferior in naval force in these seas it is not for me to know in what manner the fleet of his most christian majesty is to be employed in the w indies this summer or to inquire at what epocha it may be expected on this coast but the appearance and aid of it in this quarter are of such essential importance in any offensive operation and so necessary to stop the progress of the enemys arms to the southward i shall be excused i am persuaded for endeavoring to engage your good offices in facilitating an event on which so much depends for this i have a stronger plea when i assure you that general rochambeaus opinion and wishes concur with mine and that it is at his instance principally i make to you this address if we are happy enough to find your excellency in sentiment with us it will be in your power to inform the count de grasse of the strength and situation of the enemys naval and land force in this country     the destination of the french squadron under admiral barras and the intention of the allied arms if a junction can be formed at present the b fleet lyes within block island and about five leagues from point judith the count de rochambeau and the chevr chastellux agree perfectly in sentiment with me that while affrs remain as they now are the west india fleet should run immediately to sandy hook if there are no concerted operations where they may be met with all the information requisite and where most likely it will shut in or cut off adml arbuthnot and may be joined by the count de barras an early and frequent communication from the count de grasse would lead to preparatory measures on our part and be a means of facilitating the operation in hand or any other which may be thought more advisable i know your excellencys goodness and your zeal for the common cause too well to offer any thing more as an apology for this liberty and i persuade myself it is unnecessary for me to declare the respect and attachment with which i have the honor to be c george washington    may      weathersfield circular letter to the states weathersfield    may      sir in consequence of a conference held between the count de rochambeau and myself at this place the french army will march as soon as circumstances will admit and form a junction with the american upon the north river the accomplishment of the object which we have in contemplation is of the utmost     importance to america and will in all probability be attained unless there should be a failure on our part in the number of men which will be required for the operation or the enemy should withdraw a considerable part of their force from the southward it is in our own power by proper exertions to prevent the first and should the last take place we shall be amply repaid our expenses by liberating the southern states where we have found by experience we are only vulnerable upon the calculations that i have been able in concert with some of the most experienced french and american officers to form the operation in view will require in addition to the french army all the continental battalions from new hampshire to new jersey inclusive to be completed to their full establishment you must be sensible that the measures taken for that purpose in consequence of the last requisition of congress have been very far from answering the end as few recruits comparatively speaking have yet been sent forward and of those many have been discharged on account of inability you must also take into consideration that a number of those men who were returned when the requisition was made have since been taken off by the various casualties incident to an army i estimate about one sixth of the number therefore provision must at this time be made to replace them from what has been premised you will perceive without my urging further reasons the necessity i am under of calling upon you in the most earnest manner to devise means to send into the field without delay the number of men which have been already voted for the completion of the battalions of your state and the further deficiency of one sixth just mentioned the term of three years or for the war would undoubtedly be preferable to any shorter period but if they cannot be obtained on those conditions necessity must oblige us to take them for the campaign only which ought to be reckoned to the last of december i should hope that by proper exertions in collecting and sending forward the men that have been already raised and compelling by vigorous and decisive methods the delinquent towns to furnish their quotas the greater part of the men may be collected by the  st of july     arguments surely cannot be wanting to impress the legislature with a true sense of the obligation which they are under of furnishing the means now called for the enemy counting upon our want of ability or upon our want of energy have by repeated detachments to the southward reduced themselves in new york to a situation which invites us to take advantage of it and should the lucky moment be lost it is to be feared that they will after subduing the southern states raise a force in them sufficient to hold them and return again to the northward with such a number of men as will render new york secure against any force which we can at this time of day raise or maintain our allies in this country expect and depend upon being supported by us in the attempt which we are about to make and those in europe will be astonished should we neglect the favorable opportunity which is now offered as it is probable that some militia in addition to the full complement of continental troops may be necessary to support communications and other purposes you will be pleased to direct — men to be held in readiness to march within one week after i shall call for them to serve three months after they have joined the army and i would take the liberty of requesting that the executive may be vested with full powers during the recess to comply with any further requisition i may make for men provisions or for the means of transportation which last may be most essential in the course of our operations should it become necessary to bring provisions or stores from a distance i shall be glad to be favored with an answer as soon as possible with an assurance of what i may depend upon that if i do not clearly see a prospect of being supported i may turn my views to a defensive instead of an offensive plan and save the states and our allies the expense which would be needlessly incurred by any but an ample and effectual preparation i have the honor to be c      george washington    may      new windsor to the president of congress head quarters new windsor    may      sir i do myself the honor to inform congress that i returned from weathersfield on the evening of the   th i met only the count de rochambeau at that place accompanied by the chevalier de chastellux the british fleet having appeared off block island the count de barras did not think it prudent to be absent in consequence of the measures concerted at the late interview all the french troops except about two hundred to be left as a guard over their heavy stores and baggage at providence are to march as soon as circumstances will admit and form a junction with me upon the north river five hundred militia are to be stationed upon rhode island for the preservation of the works which have been erected and for the security of the harbor upon a full consideration of affairs in every point of view an operation against new york has been deemed preferable to making further detachments to the southward while they can only be sent by land the principal reasons which induced to this determination are as follows the difficulty and expense of transportation the lateness of the season which would throw the troops into the extremity of the heat of summer the great waste of men which we have ever experienced in so long a march at the   0 healthiest season and above all a strong presumption that the enemy weakened as they now are by detachments must either sacrifice the valuable post of new york and its dependencies or recall a part of their force from the southward to defend them the continental battalions from new hampshire to new jersey inclusive supposing them complete aided by four thousand french troops and such a reinforcement of militia as the operation after its commencement may seem to require have been deemed adequate to the attempt upon new york with its present garrison but as the battalions of those states are still considerably deficient i have written in the most pressing manner to the respective legislatures to make up such deficiencies with men for the campaign only if they cannot be obtained for a longer term and have desired the governors to hold certain numbers of militia ready for service should i have occasion to call for them i am however determined to require no more than are absolutely necessary i shall also call on the state of pennsylvania to hold sixteen hundred militia in readiness congress have been made so fully acquainted with the difficulties of every kind under which the military department labors that they must be sensible that nothing but the most vigorous exertions on the part of the states to supply men provisions and the means of transportation can enable me to prosecute to effect the operations which i have agreed in conjunction with the army of our ally to undertake or     indeed any other at the time i made my requisitions upon them i summed up every argument in my power to induce a compliance but should i find any hesitation i shall hope for the countenance and support of congress i am very apprehensive of a formidable invasion of the northern frontier as the enemy from canada are undoubtedly collecting in considerable force at crown point should this be the case it will cause a very unfortunate diversion and be very embarrassing just at this time when our whole force will be required here the necessity which i clearly foresee we shall be under of carrying every man who can be spared from other duties into the field induces me to request an order for such men of the invalid corps at boston and philadelphia as are fit for garrison duty may be ordered to march to west point where their services will be the same as those upon which they are now employed and where they may be very useful there has been a necessity of abandoning the post of fort schuyler and removing the garrison and stores to the german flats the barracks had been the beginning of this month consumed by fire and the works so exceedingly damaged by the heavy rain storm that they were rendered indefensible nor could they be repaired in any reasonable time by the number of men who could be spared as a garrison brigadiergeneral clinton recommended the evacuation of the post as the only alternative to which i the more readily consented as it had been for some     time past the opinion of the officers best acquainted with that part of the country that a post at the german flats would be more easily supported and equally advantageous to the security of the frontier upon my return i found your excellencys favors of the   th and  0th and mr secretary thomsons of the  0th i shall pay due attention to their contents i am c george washington    may      new windsor john sullivan to john sullivan in congress head quarters new windsor    may      dear sir i have been favored with your two letters of the  d    th of may the former reached me at weathersfield after i had met the count de rochambeau at that place from which time to the present moment my whole attention has been so occupied by a variety of concerns that i have been hitherto involuntarily prevented from doing myself the pleasure of writing to you no arguments were necessary to convince me of the very great public utility which would result from the success of the plan you proposed laying before congress—had i been unapprized of the advantages which might be derived to our cause from a successful attempt or even a powerful diversion in that quarter the reasons you have offered would have carried irrefragable demonstration with them and induced me to be of your opinion but the perplexed distressed and embarrassed state of our affairs on account     of supplies with which you are well acquainted the languid efforts of the states to procure men and the insuperable difficulties in the way of transportation would i apprehend have rendered the scheme however devoutly to be wished and desired abortive in the first instance and i must inform you that there is yet another obstacle which makes the attempt you have suggested absolutely impracticable with the means you propose but which i dare not commit to paper for fear of the same misfortune which has already happened to some of my letters you will have seen before the receipt of this by my public letter to congress of the   th instant the result of the deliberations of the count de rochambeau and myself at weathersfield that plan upon the maturest consideration and after combining all the present circumstances and future prospects appeared tho precarious far the most eligible of any we could possibly devise whilst we are inferior at sea the object was considered to be of greater magnitude and more within our reach than any other the weakness of the garrison of new york the centrical position for drawing together men and supplies and the spur which an attempt against that place would give to every exertion were among the reasons which prompted to that undertaking and which promised the fairest prospect of success unless the enemy should recall a considerable part of their force from the southward and even in this case the same measure which might produce disappointment in one     quarter would certainly in the event afford the greatest relief in another while an opportunity presents itself of striking the enemy a fatal blow i will persuade myself the concurring exertions of congress of the several states immediately concerned and of every individual in them who is well affected to our cause will be united in yielding every possible aid on the occasion at this crisis while i rejoice at the appointment of the minister of finance i have sincerely to regret that the ministers of the other departments have not also been appointed especially a minister of war at the same time i am happy to learn the mode of promotion is on the point of being finally established with the highest sentiments of regard i am c      george washington   june      new windsor majorgeneral greene to majorgeneral greene head quarters new windsor   june      my dear sir i have received your favor of the   d    th of april inclosing copies of your letters to congress the difficulties which you daily encounter and surmount with your small force add not a little to your reputation and i am pretty well assured that should you be obliged finally to withdraw from south and even from north carolina it would not be attributed to your want either of abilities or of exertion but to the true cause the want of means to support the war in them i feel for your mortification at the loss of the day before camden after it seemed so much in your favor but i hope you will have found that the enemy suffered severely as in their publication of the affair in the new york paper they confess the loss of two hundred the reduction of fort watson does honor to general marion and colonel lee i have lately had an interview with count de rochambeau at weathersfield our affairs were very attentively considered in every point of view and it     was finally determined to make an attempt upon new york with its present garrison in preference to a southern operation as we had not the decided command of the water you will readily suppose the reasons which induced this determination were the inevitable loss of men from so long a march more especially in the approaching hot season and the difficulty i may say impossibility of transporting the necessary baggage artillery and stores by land i am in hopes if i am supported as i ought to be by the neighboring states in this which you know has always been their favorite operation that one of these consequences will follow that the enemy will be expelled from the most valuable position which they hold upon the continent or they will be obliged to recall part of their force from the southward to defend it should the latter happen you will be most essentially relieved by it the french troops will begin their march this way as soon as certain circumstances will admit i can only give you the outlines of our plan the dangers to which letters are exposed make it improper to commit to paper the particulars but as matters ripen i will keep you as well informed as circumstances will allow a detachment of between fifteen hundred and two thousand men sailed from new york about the   th of may i advised baron steuben of this and desired him to communicate it to you i presume they will either stop in the chesapeake bay or in cape fear except the operations of the spaniards in the     floridas should call for reinforcement to that quarter but i can hardly flatter myself that they will attend to the preservation of st augustine pensacola we are told has fallen the marquis de lafayette informed me that about eight hundred recruits would be ready to march from virginia the latter end of may i have no certain accounts from maryland lately but i was told by a gentleman from thence that about four hundred might be expected to march in april i make no doubt but you are kept regularly advised by the superintending officers i have not heard that general wayne had left yorktown but i have reason to believe he has gone before this time if no fresh discontents arise among those troops the detachment with wayne will be a most valuable acquisition to you  they are chiefly the old soldiers and completely furnished with every necessary i am c     george washington   june      new windsor count de rochambeau to count de rochambeau head quarters new windsor   june      sir i had last evening the honor of receiving your favor of the   st of may by the duke de lauzun who informs me that he is authorized by your excellency and count de barras to enter into a free communication with me upon the subject of the council of war held on board the duc de bourgogne and to request my opinion upon the propriety of their determination      i must confess to your excellency that there is weight in the reasons which are offered for the detention of his majestys fleet in the harbor of newport in preference to its going round to boston but as i cannot think that it will be as safe in all possible cases in the harbor of newport after a greater part of the french army has been withdrawn as it would be in the harbor of boston i must adhere to my opinion and to the plan fixed at weathersfield as most eligible all circumstances considered i would not however set up my single judgment against that of so many gentlemen of experience more especially as the matter partly depends upon a knowledge of marine affairs of which i candidly confess my ignorance i would therefore in order to avoid delay rest the matter upon the following footing if your excellency the count de barras and the other gentlemen should upon a further consideration of the subject aided by any new informations which you may have received still think it most advisable to   0 adhere to the former resolution of the council you may make use of the enclosed letters to the governors of massachusetts and rhode island which are left open for your inspection if on the contrary you should change your opinions the letters may be destroyed as that which was written by me to the governor of rhode island from weathersfield will be sufficient for the purpose of calling out five hundred militia for the present and such further numbers as exigencies may require at any rate i could wish that the march of the troops might now be hurried as much as possible the strides which the enemy are making to the southward demand a collection of our force in this quarter that we may endeavor to commence our operation i know of no measure which will be so likely to afford relief to the southern states in so short a time as a serious menace against new york this your excellency may remember was a principal inducement for our undertaking that operation in preference to the other which was spoken of and i assure you the calls upon me from the southward are so pressing that nothing but seeing our preparations against new york in some degree of forwardness will content them or convince them that they are likely to derive any advantages from the force which they see detained here i have forwarded your excellencys despatch to the minister by a gentleman in the quarter masters department i have the honor to be c      george washington   june      new windsor to the president of congress head quarters new windsor   june      sir i have been honored with your excellencys favors of the   th may with their several enclosures i have written to the board of war on the subject of the removal of the convention troops and have given it as my opinion with my reasons that     they had best for the present be halted in pennsylvania an exchange of those troops upon proper terms would certainly be a desirable thing but under present circumstances i do not think it would be advisable to give the enemy any reinforcement of privates every man they get adds immediately to their force many of those whom we obtain in exchange are out of their term of service and consequently lost to us it is as much my wish as it can be your excellencys that general gatess affair should be brought to a decision you must be convinced that nothing has been left undone by me to effect that purpose general gates informs me that he cannot think of serving until the matter shall have been properly investigated and that he shall retire in the mean time to virginia i see no probability of any thing further being done until there shall be some recess in southern operatians i hope the rules of promotion which congress have been pleased to establish will be generally satisfactory individuals may be affected by the change of mode but it will be impossible to devise a plan which will not interfere in some degree with particular interests i send your excellency by this conveyance duplicate of my letters the original was taken in last weeks mail the communication by the post from hence to philadelphia has become so dangerous that i cannot in future trust any despatches of importance by him and i beg you will observe the same rule the parties which are sent out know the exact time at which he may be expected and cannot fail of securing     him they have not the same opportunity of intercepting expresses as their times of riding are uncertain i have the honor to be c  george washington   june      new windsor john mathews to john mathews in congress new windsor   june      dear sir       the freedom of your communications is highly pleasing to me the portrait you have drawn of our affairs is strictly agreeable to the life and you do me but justice in supposing that my mind is fortified against or rather prepared for the most distressing accts that can be given of them it would not be the part of friendship therefore to conceal any circumstance from an unwillingness to give pain especially as the knowledge of them to a man determined not to sink under the weight of perplexities may be of the utmost importance but we must not despair the game is yet in our own hands to play it well is all we have to do and i trust the experience of error will enable us to act better in future a cloud may yet pass over us individuals may be ruined and the country at large or particular states undergo temporary distress but certain i am that it is in our power to bring the war to a happy conclusion my public letters to congress and in a more especial manner my private communications to governor rutledge will bring you fully acquainted with the situation of things in this quarter and the prospects before us how far we shall be able to extricate     ourselves from the first and realize the latter time only can shew i have great expectations from the appointment of mr morris but they are not unreasonable ones for i do not suppose that by art magick he can do more than recover us by degrees from the labyrinth into which our finance is plunged i am very sorry for the disagreeable situation of our suffering soldiery at charles town and wish they could be relieved without adding to the pressure under which we at present groan how far it is in general greenes power to liberate by exchange our prisoners in that quarter i know not but all the authority i can give to do this he has reserving the troops of convention from his disposal with these i have plague enough in a late interview between the two commissaries of prisoners mr loring refused to exchange general burgoyne unless the prisoners taken at the cedars are allowed for which is opposed by a resolve of congress and has actually refused to pay a debt of privates which three months ago he promised to do mrs washington who has been very unwell for some time past joins me in respectful complimts to mrs mathews i have the honor to be c george washington   june      new windsor governor jefferson to governor jefferson new windsor   june      dear sir i have had the honor of receiving your excellencys favors of the  th and   th may the progress which the enemy are making in     virginia is very alarming not only to the state immediately invaded but to all the rest as i strongly suspect from the most recent european intelligence they are endeavoring to make as large seeming conquests as possible that they may urge the plea of uti possidetis in the proposed mediation your excellency will be able to judge of the probability of this conjecture from the circular letter of the president of congress of the  st instant  were it prudent to commit a detail of our plans and expectations to paper i could convince your excellency by a variety of reasons that my presence is essential to the operations which have lately been concerted between the french commanders and myself and which are to open in this quarter provided the british keep possession of new york there have lately been rumors of an evacuation of that place but i do not place confidence in them should i be supported by the neighboring states in the manner which i expect the enemy will i hope be reduced to the necessity of recalling part of their force from the southward to support new york or they will run the most imminent risk of being expelled with a great loss of stores from that post which is to them invaluable while they think of prosecuting the war in america and should we by a lucky coincidence of circumstances gain a naval superiority their ruin would be inevitable the prospect of giving relief to the southern states by an operation in this quarter was the principal inducement for undertaking     it indeed we found upon a full consideration of our affairs in every point of view that without the command of the water it would be next to impossible for us to transport the artillery baggage and stores of the army to so great a distance and besides that we should lose at least one third of our force by desertion sickness and the heats of the approaching season even if it could be done your excellency may probably ask whether we are to remain here for the above reasons should the enemy evacuate new york and transfer the whole war to the southward to that i answer without hesitation that we must in such case follow them at every expense and under every difficulty and loss but that while we remain inferior at sea and there is a probability of giving relief by diversion and that perhaps sooner than by sending reinforcements immediately to the point in distress good policy dictates the trial of the former give me leave before i take leave of your excellency in your public capacity to express the obligations i am under for the readiness and zeal with which you have always forwarded and supported every measure which i have had occasion to recommend through you and to assure you that i shall esteem myself honored by a continuation of your friendship and correspondence should your country permit you to remain in the private walk of life i have the honor to be c      george washington   june      new windsor william crawford to colonel william crawford new windsor   june      dear sir mr randolph delivered me your letter of the   d ulto—and sometime ago i was favored with another from you give me leave to thank you most sincerely for your kind attention to my interests and to assure you that i shall ever hold in grateful recollection your friendly endeavors to serve me my whole time is and has been since i came into the service so much engrossed by the public duties of my station that i have totally neglected all my private concerns which are declining every day and may possibly end in capital losses if not absolute ruin before i am at liberty to look after them     with respect to the round bottom i can give you little or no information—as far as a bad memory serves me for i have no papers by me to refer to i located it in the office of mr thoms lewis surveyor of augusta and laid some rights which i had purchased upon it to the amount of the contents of your survey but what has been done in the matter since i know not—nor am i quite certain that all that i have here said was actually done if without giving yourself much trouble you could enquire into this matter and pursue the necessary measures to secure this land for me i shall acknowledge it as an act of kindness will repay any expense you may be run to in the prosecution of the business and make grateful returns when it is in my power to do so i     could wish to obtain a patent for it after obviating other claims for i have heard i think that there is a caveat to prevent my obtaining a patent can you tell me how matters stand with respect to my racoon tract are the people who live on it still unconvinced of my having a patent for it if on the contrary they know or believe that i have such a patent what do they propose to do in that case it is hard upon me to have property which has been fairly obtained disputed and withheld on the other hand if the settlers on the land either through ignorance or disbelief of its being mine have made improvements of value thereon and wish to live on and enjoy them i would agree that they should remain seven years longer upon their respective plantations on terms which should in their own eyes appear moderate and easy even if it amounted to nothing more than a bare acknowledgment subject nevertheless at the expiration of that term to such reasonable rents as the land and improvements are worth and shall be adjudged just for both landlord and tenant upon these terms i would give leases for lives or a great length of years provided also in the latter case especially some mode can be adopted to let the value of the rents every seven or ten years be so raised as to bear some proportion to the increased value of the land i shall thank you for giving me information respecting this matter—and the round bottom and in general what situation my landed affairs in that country are in it not being impossible nor yet very unlikely   0 as i can give no attention to them myself that my other patented lands may be settled upon and claimed in the same way as that is on racoon i pray you also to be so kind as to let me know how simpson employs his time his force and my mill he has not that i can hear of rendered any account or paid one farthing for the profits of my mill or share of the plantation since he has been on the land which is poor encouragement for me to leave my property in his hands does the boundary as it is now settled between virginia and pensylvania affect the property of these lands which were surveyed and patented in virginia but which by the late line are thrown into pensylvania this i believe is the case with respect to my tract on racoon creek if no more of it    george washington    june      new windsor count de rochambeau to count de rochambeau head quarters new windsor    june      sir i am honored by your excellencys favors of the  th and  0th instant and with their very interesting communications which you may be assured will be kept perfectly secret i flatter myself that the whole convoy will arrive in safety in some of the eastern ports as i believe the british ships are all cruising off the hook      the count de barras has furnished me with the result of the second council of war i have so high a respect for the opinions of the gentlemen who composed it that i should have been satisfied had they barely mentioned their adherence to their former determination but the new arguments which have been introduced in favor of the detention of the fleet  at rhode island leave me no room to doubt the propriety of the measure i am so fully convinced that your excellency will make no unnecessary delay in your march that i have only occasion to repeat my former request that it may be commenced as soon as circumstances will admit my last accounts from the marquis de lafayette were of the  d of june the british army in very considerable force were then between richmond and fredericksburg their destination was uncertain but from their superiority they were at full liberty to go wherever they pleased the enclosed copy of a letter from the president of congress to me will give your excellency the latest intelligence from south carolina your requisitions to the count de grasse go to every thing i could wish you cannot in my opinion too strongly urge the necessity of bringing a body of troops with him more especially as i am very dubious whether our force can be drawn together by the time he proposes to be here now four thousand or five thousand men in addition to what we shall certainly have by that time would almost     beyond a doubt enable us with the assistance of the fleet to carry our object it is to be regretted that the counts stay upon the coast will be limited that consideration is an additional reason for wishing a force equal to giving a speedy determination to the operation  your excellency will be pleased to recollect that new york was looked upon by us as the only practicable object under present circumstances but should we be able to secure a naval superiority we may perhaps find others more practicable and equally advisable if the frigate should not have sailed i wish you to     explain this matter to the count de grasse as if i understand it you have in your communication to him confined our views to new york alone and instead of advising him to run immediately into the chesapeake will it not be best to leave him to judge from the information he may from time to time receive of the situation of the enemys fleet upon this coast which will be the most advantageous quarter for him to make his appearance in in the letter which was written to the minister from weathersfield in which he was requested to urge the count to come this way with his whole fleet sandy hook was mentioned     as the most desirable point because by coming suddenly there he would certainly block up any fleet which might be within and he would even have a very good chance of forcing the entrance before dispositions could be made to oppose him should the british fleet not be there he could follow them to the chesapeake which is always accessible to a superior force i am c george washington    june      new windsor governor clinton to governor clinton head quarters new windsor    june      dear sir i have just received a letter from brigadiergeneral clinton of the   th enclosing the examination of two prisoners who were taken lately by one of his scouts from whence it appears the enemy in canada have not made any movements in force or preparations for an incursion and indeed this intelligence corresponds so exactly with that which has been received through other channels that i cannot but regret having sent the reinforcement to the northward at a time when the aid of every man was so essential to the success of the operations in contemplation as it will be indispensably necessary when we advance towards the enemys lines to withdraw the regular force from the northward i have thought proper to advise general clinton and your excellency of it that provision might be made as far as practicable to replace these troops with the men engaged     for the campaign and the three years service  at the same time that i express my unhappiness at being forced to the measure and assure your excellency that nothing but necessity could induce me to recall the continental troops i wish it may be understood that when the moment of operating arrives there is not any consideration which can persuade me to counteract the plan that has been concerted between the conut de rochambeau and myself but lest the enemy should attempt to take advantage of their absence to make inroads on the frontier in order to distract our attention and cause a diversion in favor of their most important post i beg leave to recommend in the strongest terms that every means in your power should be made use of to guard against such an event i will also take the liberty to suggest whether an additional security might not be afforded to those posts which are exposed to the ravages of the enemy by my sending a continental officer to assist in rousing and assembling the force of the country and to put himself at the head of such militia and volunteers as might be drawn together on an emergency     from the district of country called vermont and whether in that case brigadiergeneral stark would not be a proper character to employ on this service especially as he has already obtained a reputation from his successes in that quarter is undoubtedly a man of bravery and has been accustomed to command irregular troops in action it appears to me a popular officer in that situation would be extremely advantageous on many accounts whether there may be reasons of state against it i know not i have therefore submitted it to your consideration i beg your opinion freely on the subject and have the honor to be with great respect c george washington    june      new windsor president reed to president reed head quarters new windsor    june      dear sir in the course of our expected operations we shall stand in need of a species of troops which are not at present to be procured either in this army or in any of the states to the northward of pennsylvania they are expert rifle men the use of these men will be to fire into the embrasures and to divide the enemy from their parapets when our approaches are carried very near to their works without this can be done our loss will be immense when we shall come within musquet shot—general lincoln informs me that the enemy made use of this mode at the siege of charlestown and that his batteries were in     a manner silenced untill he opposed the same kind of troops and made it as dangerous for the enemy to shew their men as it had been before for him to expose his—the number which we shall want will be about three hundred and i shall be exceedingly obliged to your excellency if you will endeavor to procure so many from the frontier of pennsylvania had the quota of militia from your state have come to this army i should have endeavored to have selected the required number from among them but that not beeing the case—i think it but reasonable that the expence of raising the rifle men should be continental i have written to this effect to congress and have requested the president to signify their approbation to your excellency if they think proper to accede to it—i would wish the corps to be formed into six companies of  0 each under the command of a captain and two subs—the whole to be commanded by a major—the term of service to the  st day of january next the choice of the officers i shall leave to your excellency if major parr formerly of the  th penna regt would engage in such a service a better officer could not be found for the purpose the bounty cannot now be determined and therefore it will be with you to procure them on as low terms as possible but that the business may not be retarded for want of proper encouragement i would wish you to make yourself acquainted with the sum which will most probably engage them and offer that whatever it may be one of the terms should be that they are to find their     own rifles as we have none in store—i shall be glad to hear as soon as possible what probability there will be of succeeding in this undertaking the greater part of the men must be with the army by the  st of augt or their services will be useless afterwards i am c george washington  0 june      peekskill count de rochambeau to count de rochambeau head quarters near peekskill  0 june      sir i had last evening the honor of your excellencys favor of the   th with a postscript of the   th the enemy by sending a detachment into monmouth county in jersey to collect horses cattle and other plunder have so weakened their posts upon the north end of york island that a most favorable opportunity seems at this moment to present itself of possessing them by a coup de maine which if it succeeds will be of the utmost consequence to our future operations i have for this reason determined to make the attempt on the night of the  d of july but as we cannot with the remainder of our own force maintain the advantage should we gain it i must entreat your excellency to put your first brigade under march tomorrow morning the remaining troops to follow as quick as possible and endeavor to reach bedford by the evening of the  d of july and from thence to proceed immediately towards kingsbridge should circumstances render it necessary your magazines having been established on the route by     crompond it may perhaps be out of your power to make any deviation but could you make it convenient you would considerably shorten the distance by marching from ridgeburg to salem and from thence to bedford leaving crompond upon your right  there is another matter which appears to me exceedingly practicable upon the same night that we attempt the works upon york isld and which i would wish to commit to the execution of the duke de lauzun provided his corps can be brought to a certain point in time—it is the surprise of a corps of light troops under the command of colo delancey which lies at morrisania without being covered by any works to effect this the duke must be at bedford on the  d of july by    oclock if possible where he will be joined by colo sheldon with  00 horse and foot and on his march from thence by about  00 infantry both officers and men perfectly acquainted with the country—upon a supposition that the duke may be at bedford at the above mentioned time—and that he will be ready to carry the design into execution he shall be met there by particular instructions from me and will find good guides at any rate i must request your excellency to send orders to the duke this evening to continue his march tomorrow morning and to reach bedford by the evening of the  d of july if he cannot be   0 there by noon in this latter case the enterprise against delancey must probably be laid aside and the legion with the first brigade of your army will be at hand to support the detachment upon york island should they succeed—i shall move down with the remainder of this army towards kingsbridge and shall be ready to form a junction with your excellency below at some point which shall be hereafter agreed upon i am certain i need not recommend the proper degree of secrecy to your excellency—one reason which makes it more than commonly necessary in the country where you are is that the enemy will have emissaries in your camp in the garb of peasants with provisions and other matters and will be attentive to every word which they may hear drop you will much oblige me by letting me know instantly by return of the line of expresses whether your first brigade and the legion can march tomorrow morning and whether the duke can be at bedford by the time first proposed the  d of july at noon under the foregoing circumstances it becomes necessary for me to march from hence on monday and i therefore submit it to your excellency whether it will not be more convenient to both of us to defer our interview untill the armies shall have proceeded lower down i shall take care to establish a proper communication between the columns and to see that a junction is formed before there shall be any danger of an attack from the enemy i have c      george washington july      peekskill majorgeneral lincoln to majorgeneral lincoln instructions sir the object of your present command—consisting of two regiments formed into four battalions under the command of colonel scammell and lieutenantcolonel sprout of a detachment of artillery under the command of captain burbeck of the corps of watermen under the command of major darby and the waterguard under the command of captain pray—is to attempt the surprise of the enemys posts upon the north end of york island my ideas as to the most probable mode of attaining this object have been minutely detailed in the several conversations which we have had upon the subject and you have been furnished with such papers as i have been able to collect and upon which my judgment has been formed but it is not my wish or desire     that these should be any restraint upon you your own observation and the circumstances of the moment must in a great degree govern you the success of your enterprise depending absolutely upon secrecy and surprise it will be wrong to prosecute it a moment after you are discovered unless the discovery is made so near the works that you may by a rapid movement gain them before the enemy have time to recollect and put themselves in a posture of defence fort george upon laurel hill ought to be your primary object because success at that place will open a communication with the main afford an asylum to the troops who may be disappointed in other attacks and secure a retreat in case of necessity to the main body of the army should you carry fort knyphausen and fort tryon only you cannot without infinite risk hold them as we shall not be in a situation to support you from without i would therefore recommend     your damaging them as much as you possibly can upon a sudden and relinquishing them the artillerymen will be proportionably divided to the three attacks each party will be provided with two lanterns and two rockets one of which is to be fired in each work as soon as it is carried if complete success should attend the enterprise not a moments time should be lost in drawing the boats across the island from the north river into haerlem creek and securing them under the guns of fort george if circumstances will admit of it but in case of a disappointment and being obliged to retreat by water and not being able to pass the enemys ships and boats the dernier resort must be a push over to the jersey shore and an abandonment of the boats if they cannot be drawn up the bank and carried off on carriages it will be very essential that i should be made acquainted as early as possible with your success     and the extent of it if complete you will announce it by the firing of thirteen cannon at one minutes interval after all lesser firing and confusion have ceased if fort george only is carried six cannon are to be fired in the same manner for fort knyphausen tryon or both of them you need not give signals because you are as before directed immediately to relinquish them the foregoing is upon a supposition that the principal object the attempt upon the works on york island is carried into execution but should you upon reconnoitring the enemy tomorrow find it unadvisable to prosecute the plan or should you be obliged to give it over on account of an early discovery by the enemys shipping or boats i would then have you turn your attention to the support of an attempt which is also to be made on the morning of the  d by the duke de lauzun upon delanceys corps lying at morrisania to effect this you will land your men at any convenient place above the mouth of spiten devil creek and march to the high grounds in front of kingsbridge where you will lie concealed until the dukes attack is announced by firing or other means you may then dispose of your force in such a manner in view of the enemy as to make them think your party larger than it is which may have the double effect of preventing them from coming over the bridge to turn the dukes right and also of preventing any of delanceys party from escaping that way your further operations must depend upon the movements of the enemy and other circumstances i expect i shall be myself in the neighborhood of kingsbridge early in the morning of the  d with the remainder of the army i shall as soon as possible open a communication with you and give you such orders as the general state of matters may require if you land send an officer and small party up the main road to meet me in case you land upon the east side of the river above the mouth of spiten devil creek you will send your boats up along the east shore if major darby receives no particular directions from me he will proceed with them to kings ferry given at headquarters near peekskill this  st day of july           george washington   july      dobbss ferry to the president of congress head quarters near dobbss ferry   july      sir i do myself the honor to inform your excellency that the army marched from their camp near peekskill on the morning of the  d without either tents or baggage and reached valentines hill about four miles on this side of kingsbridge a little after daylight the morning following general lincoln with a detachment of eight hundred men fell down the north river in boats landed near phillipss house before daylight on the morning of the  d and took possession of the ground on this side of haerlem river near where fort independence formerly stood this movement was principally intended     to support and favor an enterprise which i had projected against a corps of refugees under the command of colonel delancey at morrisania and other light troops without the bridge and which was to have been executed by the duke de lauzun with his own legion colonel sheldons regiment and a detachment of state troops of connecticut under the command of brigadiergeneral waterbury the duke notwithstanding the heat of the day of the  d marched from ridgbury in connecticut and reached east chester very early the next morning but upon his arrival there finding by the firing that general lincoln had been attacked and the alarm given he desisted from the further prosecution of his plan which could only have been executed to any effect by surprise and marched to the generals support who continued skirmishing with the enemy and endeavoring to draw them so far into the country that the duke might turn their right and cut them off from their work on the east side of haerlem river and also prevent their repassing that river in boats general parsons had possessed the heights immediately commanding kingsbridge and could have prevented their escape by that passage every endeavor of this kind proved fruitless for i found upon going down myself to reconnoitre their situation that all their force except very small parties of observation had retired to york island this afforded general duportail and myself the most favorable opportunity of perfecting reconnoitring the works upon the north end of the island and making observations     which may be of very great advantage in future finding nothing further could be done i returned the day before yesterday to this ground where i expect to be joined this day by his excellency the count de rochambeau who reached north castle the  d instant i cannot too warmly express the obligations i am under to the count for the readiness with which he detached the duke de lauzun and for the rapidity with which he pushed the march of his main body that he might have been within supporting distance had any favorable stroke upon the enemy below given us an opportunity of pursuing any advantage which might have been gained general lincoln had five or six men killed and about thirty wounded in his skirmish i have the honor to be c      george washington    july      dobbss ferry marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette headquarters near dobbss ferry    july      my dear marquis since my last i have received your letters of the  0th   th and    of june i sincerely congratulate you on the favorable turn of affairs announced in your last and i hope you will be enabled to maintain that superiority which you seem to be gaining ever lord cornwallis we have had a variety of reports of general greenes further successes in south carolina by some we are told that both augusta and ninetysix have fallen but in a letter which i have just received from monsieur     marbois he says that augusta has been taken and the siege of ninetysix raised count de rochambeau formed a junction with me at this camp about twelve miles from kingsbridge a few days ago we are waiting for reinforcements for the continental line and of militia and are in the mean time establishing our communication at dobbss ferry i shall shortly have occasion to communicate matters of very great importance to you so much so that i shall send a confidential officer on purpose to you you will in the mean time endeavor to draw together as respectable a body of continental troops as you possibly can and take every measure to augment your cavalry should the enemy confine themselves to the lower country you will no doubt pay attention to the formation of magazines above these will be in every case essential whether the war continues in virginia or whether it will still be carried on in  00 south carolina should general greene come into virginia in person you will be good enough to communicate the foregoing to him in the present situation of affairs it is of the utmost importance that a communication by a chain of expresses should be opened between this army and that in virginia they are already established from hence to philadelphia and if there is none from you to philadelphia you will be pleased to take measures for having it done you will also endeavor to establish such a communication with the coast as to be able to know whether any troops are detached by sea from lord cornwalliss army for it is more than probable that if he finds himself baffled in attempting to overrun virginia he will take a strong post at portsmouth or williamsburg and reinforce new york or south carolina should any detachment be made you will transmit to me the earliest intelligence what you say in confidence of the conduct of a certain officer shall be kept a profound secret and i will contrive means of removing him from the quarter where he is so unpopular the rhode island regiment is so thinly officered that colonel olney wishes one of the subs of the light company may be suffered to return when captain olney joins you will act in this as circumstances may permit you have the compliments and good wishes of all your friends in the french army those of the american are not behindhand with them with the warmest affection and esteem i am c  0  george washington    july      dobbss ferry to the superintendent of finance headquarters near dobbss ferry    july      dear sir your favors of the  d and  th instant have afforded me infinite satisfaction as the measures you are pursuing for subsisting the army perfectly accord with my ideas and are i am certain the only ones which can secure us from distress or the constant apprehensions of it  had magazines of any consequence been formed in the different states in pursuance of the late requisitions of congress the disposal of the articles collected at a distance from the army would have merited your attention but so little has been done in that way that i imagine you will not think the matter worthy of notice when i inform you of the trifling quantities which remain on hand of flour no magazines have been formed at any place of salt meat none was put up in pennsylvania jersey or new york there had been by estimate seven or eight thousand barrels of meat and fish put up in connecticut of which between two and three thousand have come forward and the remainder is i believe in motion massachusetts put up very little salt meat and most of it has been consumed upon the communication by the recruits or transported to  0  albany rhode island purchased one thousand barrels of which about six hundred remain at providence and i would wish them to be still kept there for a particular purpose i could never learn with certainty how much was put up in new hampshire but i have directed all that was at portsmouth to be transported by water to providence as i wish to form a small magazine of salt provision at that place as i mentioned before for a particular purpose no magazines of rum have been formed we have been in a manner destitute of that necessary article and what we are now likely to draw from the several states will be from hand to mouth from the foregoing state of facts you will perceive in how small a degree the requisitions of congress have been complied with and may form a judgment of the miserable manner in which the army has been subsisted having lately at the request of the board of war furnished them with my opinion of the quantity of provision which ought to be laid up at the several posts they will be able at the interview which you propose to have with them to lay before you my ideas upon the subject of a contract for supplying the army i beg you to be assured that i never can think your correspondence tedious or troublesome duty as well as inclination will always prompts me to listen with pleasure to your observations upon the state of our public affairs and i shall think myself happy if i can in any manner contribute to assist you in the arduous task you have undertaken i shall very anxiously wait for the visit which you  0  promise to make me i am with very sincere respect and esteem c p s will it be possible upon a sudden emergency to procure from  000 to   00 barrels of salt beef or pork at philadelphia in such case what may be at providence or new hampshire may be disposed of and go towards payment of that in philadelphia we have no news of the ship lafayette about  000 suits of clothes have arrived at boston from spain but unfortunately the coats are scarlet george washington    july      dobbss ferry majorgeneral lord stirling to majorgeneral lord stirling instructions head quarters near dobbss ferry    july      my lord while i am with the detachment of the army below you will remain in command here your principal attention will be paid to the good order of the camp and the security of the baggage and stores left in it there will be no need of advanced pickets as you will be fully covered in front the camp guards should be vigilant and the officers commanding them see that the men are not permitted to straggle or to plunder the baggage of the officers and soldiers the greatest harmony having hitherto subsisted between the french and american soldiers your lordship will be particularly careful to see that it is not interrupted by any act of imprudence on our part and as majorgeneral the baron vioménil who will command the french line is older in commission than your lordship you will take the parole and countersign from him daily it is scarcely probable that the enemy will make any attempt upon the camp while so respectable a force is near their own lines should they do it it must be by water the officer commanding  0  the waterguard will communicate any movement to colonel greaton at dobbss ferry who will give immediate intelligence to you which you will of course transmit to baron vioménil the party at dobbss ferry being for the purpose of erecting a work there they are not to be withdrawn for camp duties i am c george washington    july      dobbss ferry richard henry lee to richard henry lee  camp near dobbss ferry    july      dear sir the moving state wch the army was at the time your letter of the   th ulto came to hand the junction of the allied troops at that period and a variety of matters which have occurred since that period consequent of this junction rather than a disinclination to continue a correspondence the benefits of which were in my favor must plead as an excuse for my silence till now unconscious of having given you just cause to change the favorable sentiments you have expressed for me i could not suppose you had altered them and as i never suffer reports unsupported by proofs to have weight in my mind i know no reason why our correspondence should cease or become less frequent than heretofore excepting on my part that as our affairs became more perplexing and embarrassd the public claimed more of my attention and consequently left me less leizure for private indulgences  0  that this has been the case in an eminent degree for some time past a gentleman so well acquainted with public matters as you are need not be told the distresses of virginia i am but too well acquainted with but the plan you have suggested as a relief for it is in my judgmt a greater proof of your unbounded confidence in me than it is that the means proposed would be found adequate to the end in view were it practicable to make the experiment which at present is not as there are insuperable obstacles to my removing from the immediate command of the combined troops the reasons for this opinion i cannot entrust to paper at all times liable to miscarriage and peculiarly so of late i am fully persuaded however upon good military principles that the measures i have adopted will give more effectual and speedier relief to the  0  state of virginia than if i was to march thither with dictatorial powers at the head of every man i could draw from hence without leaving the important posts on the north river quite defenceless and these states open to devastation and ruin when i say this i would be understood to mean if i am properly supported and i have asked no extraordinary succors by the states eastward of jersey inclusive my present operation and which i have been preparing for with all the zeal and activity in my power will i am morally certain if i am properly supported produce one of two things either the fall of new york or a withdrawal of the troops from viginia excepting a garrison at portsmouth at which place i have no doubt of the enemys intention to establish a permanent post a long land march in which we have never failed to dissipate half our men the difficulty and expense of transportation and other reasons not less powerful but wch i dare not commit to writing decided me in my present plan and my hopes i trust will not be disappointed in half an hours conversation i could i flatter myself convince you of the utility of my meases but as i have before observed i dare not attempt it by letter because i have already had two or three important ones intercepted in the mails the sight of which i am persuaded occasioned the retrogade movemts of lord cornwallis and will be the means of bringing part of his force to new york to the accomplishment of one part of my plan the fatal policy of short enlistmts the primary cause of all our misfortunes—the  0  prolongation of the war—and the source of the immense debt under which we labor— is now shedding its baneful influence upon our measures and i am laboring under all the disadvantages and evils which result from them and the want of men—it can be no news to tell you that by the expiration of the terms of enlistment i was left last winter with a force so much reduced as to be scarcely able to garrison west point but it may be news and is not less true than surprizing to you to hear that not half the men which were required to be with the army as recruits for the continental battns by the first day of jany last are yet arrived—and of those asked by me from the militia not one is come but a few words more and i will put an end to this long letter no endeavors of mine have been wanting to obtain a naval superiority in these seas nor to employ that which we have to valuable purposes how far i have succeeded in the latter is but too obvious how far i may see my wishes accomplished in the former time must discover with great esteem and regard i am dear sir c  questions and replies questions by rochambeau the count de barras in his letter of the   th instant and mr de choisy in his letter of the   th demand both of them mr de choisy by the desire of the count de barras what is to be the definitive plan of operations that his excellency general washington has fixed on that they may make it known to the count de grasse on his arrival in these seas and so enable of him to concur with us i beg of his excellency to fix on the answer that i am to send to them and at the same time it will enable me to make beforehand the necessary preparations for the corps of troops that i command answers by g w it is next to impossible at this moment circumstanced as  0  we are  laboring under uncertainties to fix a definitive plan for the campaign—definitive measures must depend upon circumstances at the time of the arrival of the count de grasse—particularly on the following—  st the situation of the enemy at that moment  d on the succors he shall bring with him—or on the force we shall have collected by that period  d on the operation  advantages wch may be gained by the fleet in the moment of its arrival and  th on the continuance of the fleet upon  probability of its maintaing its decisive superiority whilst it is here let us suppose that the count de grasse does not look on it as practicable to force sandy hook and that he does not bring with him any land troops in these two cases which appear very likely because on one hand the seamen look on sandy hook bar as impossible to force and on the other hand because the court of france makes no mention of any troops to be brought here by the count de grasse in the letters that inform us of his arrival here—in these two cases does his excellency think that with an army which joined to the french corps will not be much more numerous than the troops that defend new york it will be possible to undertake with success something against that place if the fleet of count de grasse should be late in it arriving to this coast—if the count should not think it prudent to attempt forcing the passage of the hook—or fail in making the attempt—if he should bring no land troops with him  the american force should not be considerably augmented—i am of opinion that under these circumstances we ought to throw a sufficient garrison into w point leave some continental troops  militia to cover the  0  country contiguous to n york  transport the remainder both french  american to virginia should the enemy still keep a force there the season  other circumstances will admit of late operations in that quarter to be prepared for such an event i think it highly expedient that mr barras should hold all his transports in the utmost readiness to take the detachment under mr de choisy  the heavy artillery at providence on board  sail with them to meet the troops either in delaware or chesapeake as may be ultimately agreed upon if his excellency does not look on it as practicable to risk it could not the operations be directed against virginia mr de grasse be sent to chesapeak bay and bring there the detachment of mr de choisy and a part of his excellencys army or the french corps march as far as elk river where the count de grasse being master in chesapeak bay would come to convoy him would not we be then in a condition to undertake with success on lord cornwallis and force him to evacuate virginia that march of the french troops would need to be prepared beforehand it would be necessary that count de barras carry wtth him our siege artillery and bring with him all the transports necessary to the passage of the french corps in the bay of chesapeak le ct de rochambeau but should the fleet arrive in season—not be limited to a short stay  should it be able to force the harbor of n york  in addition to all these should find the british force in a divided state—i am of opinion that the enterprise against n york  its dependencies shoud be our primary object to prevent the enemy from a possibility of formg a junction  to lay a foundation for their ruin i was anxious that count de barras if he thot the departure of the royal oak had given him naval superiority should sail for chesapeak an event if the superiority is on   0 his side i devoutly wish as i am of opinion that much good  no evil can result from it—the reasons which induce the count to decline that measure have been communicated by him to your excellency  to me by letter upon the whole i do not see what more can be done than to prosecute the plan agreed to at weathersfield— to recommend it to the count de grasse to come immediately to sandy hook  if possible possess the harbor of n york at the moment of his arrival and then form a full view  consideration of the circumstances which exist form a definitive plan of campaign upon the surest grounds go w camp at dobbs ferry july         george washington    july      brigadiergeneral waterbury to brigadiergeneral waterbury headquarters    july      sir the army will make a movement this evening you will march your corps on the same route and in such time and manner as to be at east chester between daybreak and sunrise as directed in my letter of the   th your troops should be supplied if possible with three days cooked provisions and the     movement of the army as well as of your troops must be kept a secret until the moment you march  in order to prevent the enemy from obtaining any intelligence whatever from us i have ordered small parties to waylay all the roads from the north river to east chester i must request you will send an active subaltern and twenty men with good guides early this afternoon across the fields and woods from     your encampment to some good position for an ambuscade on the side of the road leading from new rochelle to east chester as near the latter as may be without hazard of discovery this party must remain perfectly concealed with orders to apprehend all persons going towards kingsbridge it is essential that your party should not be seen by any inhabitant as this might frustrate the very object of our precautions you will be convinced sir by     your own experience and good sense that the profoundest secrecy is absolutely necessary in all military matters and in no instance more indispensably so than in movements towards the enemys lines i am c p s after you have given all the necessary orders i could wish you would come to headquarters and dine with me as i may have many things to communicate personally to you     george washington    july      dobbss ferry thomas mckean to thomas mckean president of congress  headquarters near dobbss ferry    july      sir i have been honored by your excellencys three letters of the   th and   th of this month with the several resolutions of congress and the extracts from intercepted letters enclosed i am much obliged by your attention in the communication of the extracts although i had been favored with them through another channel previous to the receipt of your favors the intelligence to be collected from them if properly improved i think may turn greatly to our advantage  i take this opportunity most sincerely to congratulate you sir on the honor conferred upon you by congress in being elected to preside in that most respectable body happy as i expect to be in your correspondence i dare say i shall have no reason to complain of the mode of your conducting it as from a knowledge of your character i flatter myself it will ever be performed with great propriety i take the liberty however to request as a particular favor that you will be so good as to convey to me as you have opportunity any interesting intelligence which you may receive either from europe or respecting our continental affairs your situation will put it particularly in your power to oblige me in this request     and be assured sir that a greater obligation cannot be conferred since for want of communication in this way i have often been left in the dark in matters which essentially concern the public welfare and which if known might be very influential in the government of my conduct in the military line i am very happy to be informed by accounts from all parts of the continent of the agreeable prospect of a very plentiful supply of almost all the productions of the earth blessed as we are with the bounties of providence necessary for our support and defence the fault must surely be our own and great indeed will it be if we do not by a proper use of them obtain the noble prize for which we have been so long contending the establishment of peace liberty and independence i am dear sir c george washington july         dobbss ferry john parke custis to john parke custis dobbss ferry july         dear custis your letter of the   th covering certain proposals which were made by you to mr robt alexander came safe by the last post i read the letter with attention and think they are founded on principles of liberality and justice as far as i can form a judgment without seeing the mortgage or having recourse to the original agreement and the missives which may have passed between you how far the purchase on your part and the sale on alexanders was a matter of speculation at the     time of bargaining you yourselves and the nature of the agreement can alone determine if from the tenor of your contract you were to pay paper money—if this paper money was at that time in a depreciated state and the difference between it and specie fixed and known—and if moreover alexander like many others entertained an opinion that it would again appreciate and a paper dollar become equal in value to a silver one—it might be more just than generous as the money is in fact worth little or nothing now to let him abide the consequences of his opinion by paying him in depreciated paper because the presumption is that he would have made no allowance for appreciation tho the former should be of equal value with the latter pound for pound but this as i have before observed depends upon the nature of the bargain and the light in which the matter was understood at the time it was made by both parties if the bargain was unaccompanied by particular circumstances had no explanatory meaning but simply imported that so much money was to be given for so much land to be paid on or before a certain period it is certainly optional in you to discharge it at any time you please short of that period but i conceive that this can only be done by an actual tender of the money and that there is no legal obligatn or tye upon alexr to take your bond with any security whatever but the fear of losing the original debt or the interest of it by refusing the tender you propose to make him of £  000 at this time because i hold     it as a maxim that no man can be compelled to change the nature of his debt or alter the security of it without his own consent i have before said that for want of the mortgage and a knowledge of all the circumstances attending your bargain it is impossible for me to give a decided opinion your proposals appear to be fair and equitable but what views alexander may have had and how far he is prepared to support himself in those views by written or other valid proof i am unable to say as an honest man he ought to be content with justice and justice i think you have offered him you may recollect that i disliked the terms of your bargain when they were  st communicated to me and wished then that you might not find them perplexing and disadvantageous in the end as i now do that you may settle the matter with honor and satisfaction to yourself it gave me pain to hear that you had been so much afflicted with sickness among your people and that you thought your son in danger it would give me equal pleasure to learn that he and the rest of your family were restored to perfect health that so few of our countrymen have joined the enemy is a circumstance as pleasing to me as it must be mortifyingly convincing to them of the fallacy of their assertion that ⅔ of the people were in their intert and ready to join them when opportunity offered had this been the case the marquiss force and the other ⅓ must have abandoned the country i am much pleased with your choice of a governor     he is an honest man—active spirited and decided and will i am persuaded suit the times as well as any person in the state  you were lucky considering the route by which the enemy retreated to williamsburg to sustain so little damage i am of opinion that lord cornwallis will establish a strong post at portsmouth detach part of his force to new york and go with the residue to so carolina i returned yesterday from reconnoitring with count de rochambeau and the engineers of both armies the enemys works near kingsbridge we lay close by them two days and a night without any attempt on their part to prevent it they kept up a random cannonade but to very little effect i am waiting impatiently for the men the states this way have been called upon for that i may determine my plan and commence my operations my best wishes attend nelly custis who i hope is perfectly recovered and the little girls my complimts await inquiring friends and i am sincerely and affectionately c george washington  0 july      dobbss ferry majorgeneral greene to majorgeneral greene headquarters near dobbss ferry  0 july      my dear sir with peculiar satisfaction i do myself the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your several favors of the  0th   th and   th of may last with that of the   d     june and to assure you at the same time that it is with the warmest pleasure i express my full approbatinn of the various movements and operations which your military conduct has lately exhibited while i confess to you that i am unable to conceive what more could have been done under your circumstances than has been displayed by your little persevering and determined army lord rawdons reinforcement from england was a most untoward circumstance but even this i hope will soon be surmounted by your good fortune you will be informed from the marquis of every circumstance that has taken place in virginia a detachment from the army of this brave and fortunate young nobleman will i hope soon arrive to your assistance in carolina by our movements in this quarter and the main army taking a position near to new york and making every preparation for a serious attempt upon that place we have already produced a happy effect that of a withdraw of considerable part of the troops under the command of lord cornwallis as a reinforcement to their garrison which has been some time past closely confined to york island this withdraw will probably disappoint their views of conquest in virginia and will exceedingly embarrass the prospects of the british ministry in the proposed treaty opened at vienna  this is a very great object even   0 should any thing prevent our obtaining further success in our operations against new york the operating force of the enemy in the southern states being confined in all probability to south carolina will leave the other states in a condition to afford you such succors as with the aid of the marquiss detachment will i hope enable you to fulfil your hopes and wishes in their utmost extent in your command should this event take place you may be assured that added to the consideration of the public good which will result therefrom honor that will be thereby reflected on your own person will afford me the highest satisfaction i sincerely wish we had the means of communicating more frequently with each other than has been lately experienced be assured sir my concern for your honor and welfare interests me most particularly in every event which attends you a particular reason which cannot at this time be communicated induces me to request that you will be pleased to give me the earliest and most minute information of every event that takes place with you and a circumstantial detail of the present situation of the state of south carolina its strength and operative force with its resources for the support of an army and the extent of those resources with the places where they may be collected and secured also     the strength position and circumstances attending the enemys force i have the honor to be c  george washington  0 july      dobbs ferry marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette head quarters near dobbs ferry  0 july      my dear marquis i take your private letter of the  0th of this month in the light which you wish it that of an unreserved communication from one friend to another and i should be wanting in candor were i not to expose my sentiments to you in as free a manner i am convinced that your desire to be with this army arises principally from a wish to be actively useful you will not therefore regret your stay in virginia until matters are reduced to a greater degree of certainty than they are at present especially when i tell you that from the change of circumstances with which the removal of part of the enemys force from virginia to new york will be attended it is more than probable that we shall also entirely change our plan of operations i think we have already effected one part of the plan of the campaign settled at weathersfield that is giving a substantial relief to the southern states by obliging the enemy to recall a considerable part of their force from thence our     views must now be turned towards endeavoring to expel them totally from those states if we find ourselves incompetent to the siege of new york the difficulty of doing this does not so much depend upon obtaining a force capable of effecting it as upon the mode of collecting that force to the proper point and transporting the provisions stores c necessary for such an operation you are fully acquainted with the almost impracticability of doing this by land to say nothing of the amazing loss of men always occasioned by long marches and those towards a quarter in which the service is disagreeable i should not however hesitate to encounter these difficulties great as they are had we not prospects of transporting ourselves in a manner safe easy and expeditious your penetration will point out my meaning which i cannot venture to express in direct terms  i approve of your resolution to reinforce general greene in proportion to the detachment which the enemy may make to new york let your next attention be paid to training and forming the militia with which you may be furnished and disposing of them in such a manner that they may be drawn at the shortest notice to whatever point the enemy make their capital post and which i conclude will be at portsmouth the establishment of magazines at safe deposits will be in all cases necessary but above all things i recommend an augmentation of your cavalry to as great a height as possible it may happen that the enemy may be driven to the necessity of forcing     their way through north carolina to avoid a greater misfortune a superiority of horse on our side would be fatal to them in such a case the advantages resulting from a move of the french fleet from newport to chesapeake were early and strongly pointed out to count de barras and i thought he had once agreed to put it into execution but by his late letters he seemed to think that such a manœuvre might interfere with greater plans and therefore he declined it it would now be too late to answer the principal object as by accounts from a deserter the troops arrived from virginia last friday  should your return to this army be finally determined i cannot flatter you with a command equal to     your expectations or my wishes you know the over proportion of general officers to our numbers and can therefore conceive where the difficulty will lie general mcdougall is not yet provided for and the jersey and york troops are reserved for him they are promised to him though they have not yet joined in my letter to general greene which i beg the favor of you to forward i have hinted nothing of what i have said to you for fear of a miscarriage you will probably find a safe opportunity from your army to him and you will oblige me by communicating the part of this letter which relates to my expectation of being able to transport part of the army to the southward should the operation against new york be declined i wish as i mentioned in my last to send a confidential person to you to explain at large what i have so distantly hinted but i am really at a loss for want of knowing the officers better to find one upon whose discretion i can depend my own family you know are constantly and fully employed i however hope that i have spoken plain enough to be understood by you with every sentiment of affection and regard i am c george washington   august      dobbs ferry to the president of congress head quarters near dobbs ferry   august      sir congress will readily conceive the disagreeable situation in which i find myself when they are informed that i am not stronger at this advanced period of the     campaign than when the army first moved out of their winter quarters justice to my own feelings and character requires that i should lay before that honorable body a summary of the measures i have taken to obtain reinforcements and inform them likewise of the little success with which my requisitions have hitherto been attended i shall not go back to the date of the requisition of october last to the several states which was made in consequence of the new regulation of the army and went to the number of men called for by that arrangement it will be sufficient to say that the recruits sent in were comparatively small in proportion to the deficiencies as may be seen from the returns which i have from time to time transmitted to congress i will begin with the transactions subsequent to the conference i had with count de rochambeau at weathersfield in may when a plan of operations was concerted and the inclosure no   written to the states of new hampshire—massachusetts bay—rhode island and connecticut letters similar to the foregoing were written upon my return to new windsor to the other states as far as pennsylvania inclusive from which last   00 militia were required but it having been found that that state had been called upon by congress to send   00 militia to virginia i withdrew my request and apportioned the number asked of them to the other states—requiring only a corps of  00 riflemen from pennsylvania being very desirous of getting my force especially the continental troops together as soon as possible     or in other words by the time i could prepare boats collect stores c i wrote the letter no   to the states of new jersey—connecticut—massachusetts and new hampshire with this variation in respect to connecticut that i desired  00 of her militia might be sent without loss of time to westpoint that i might be thereby enabled to withdraw part of the continental garrison from that post for field service—and as i found that i should be under the absolute necessity of calling down hazens and the two continental battalions of new york which had been sent up for the security of the northern frontier i upon the   th of june wrote to his excellency govr hancock and to the officers commanding the militia in the western parts of massachusetts and requested that  00 part of the quota asked for might be marched without loss of time to albany to replace the continental troops drawn from that quarter notwithstanding this by my last letters from brigr genl clinton dated at albany the  0th ulto not a single man had come in from massachusetts and by a return from general mcdougall commanding at westpoint only     from connecticut had arrived at that post yesterday in short not a single militia man from any state has joined the army except the few just mentioned—about  0 line of new york and about  00 state troops of connecticut both of which were upon the line previous to my leaving our winter cantonment the inclosure no   exhibits a return of all the recruits which have joined the continental battalions     in this army since the rearrangement of them the numbers which have joined in the course of last month are particularly designated the general return for june which i have lately sent by capt roberts to the board of war furnishes a state of the army up to the  st of july to this is to be added the recruits which have joined since—and a deduction is to be made for the casualties of july for the better understanding the general return it may not be amiss to remark that the light infantry with the marquis de la fayette are included in the column upon command as are the boatmen—waggoners—extra artificers—small detached guards for various purposes—waiters and laborers in the quarter masters and commissarys departments in the same column and that designated on extra service all which being deducted from the total exhibits an army upon paper rather than an operating force i have in vain endeavored to remedy this monstrous deduction but the civil departments having been totally destitute of money have been unable to hire or pay the men necessary for their uses and i have therefore been obliged to spare them from the line to prevent a total stagnation of business while i think it my duty faithfully to draw this picture disagreeable as it is both for the full information of congress and my own justification it becomes incumbent upon me to add that i shall exert my utmost abilities so to improve the means with which i may be furnished that the present campaign     if not decisive may be not inglorious but in some degree advantageous to america i have again written in the most pressing manner to the states as your excellency will find by the inclosure no   of equal date with this i flatter myself it will have some avail but i am at all events happy in thinking that one of the ends proposed by the plan of operations concerted at weathersfield will take effect—that of obliging the enemy to recall a considerable force from the southward to support new york it is with pleasure i assure your excellency that by great exertions and powerful aids from the states of massachusetts and rhode island the heavy artillery—stores c many of which were also lent by those states have come on to the north river in a manner beyond my expectation those from pennsylvania are halted at philadelphia till my prospects of obtaining men are more encouraging i thought it best to do this that i might not to have to transport them back again or be encumbered with them here should we not be able to prosecute offensive operations i have also the pleasure to inform you that vigorous exertions are making by the four new england states to furnish a competent supply of beef cattle i have c p s i informed your excellency in my last that by the account of a deserter part of the troops had arrived at new york from virginia this is contradicted by others who have come out since who say that troops are expected from that quarter      george washington   august      dobbs ferry circular letter to states head quarters near dobbs ferry   august      sir— i regret being obliged to inform you that i find myself at this late period very little stronger than i was when the army first moved out of their quarters of the militia which were required of the state of new hampshire and which were to have joined me by the   th of last month none have come in and of the levies for the continental battalions only thirteen in the course of the last month the reinforcements from the other states have been very inconsiderable i leave you to judge of the delicate and embarrassed situation in which i stand at this moment unable to advance with prudence beyond my present position while perhaps in the general opinion my force is equal to the commencement of operations against new york my conduct must appear if not blameable highly mysterious at least our allies with whom a junction has been formed upwards of three weeks and who were made to expect from the engagements which i entered into with them at weathersfield in may last a very considerable augmentation of our force by this time instead of seeing a prospect of advancing must conjecture upon good grounds that the campaign will waste fruitlessly away i shall just remark that it will be no small degree of triumph to our enemies and will have a very pernicious influence upon our friends in europe should they find such a failure of resource or such a want of energy to draw it out that our boasted and expensive operations end only in idle parade i cannot yet but persuade myself and i do not discontinue to encourage our allies with a hope that our force will still be sufficient to carry our intended operation into effect or if we cannot fully accomplish that to oblige the enemy to withdraw part of their force from the southward to support new york and which as i informed you in my letter from weathersfield was part of our plan you must be sensible sir that the fulfilment of my engagements   0 must depend upon the degree of vigor with which the executives of the several states exercise the powers with which they have been vested and enforce the laws lately passed for filling up and supplying the army in full confidence that the means which have been voted will he obtained i shall continue my preparations but i must take the liberty of informing you that it is essentially necessary i should be made acquainted immediately on the receipt of this of the number of continental levies and militia which have been forwarded and what are the prospects of obtaining the remainder i will further add that it will be equally necessary to see that the monthly quota of provisions stipulated at the meeting of the commissioners at providence is regularly complied with i am c george washington   august      dobbss ferry to the superintendent of finance headquarters dobbss ferry   august      dear sir       the expectation of the pleasure of seeing you has prevented me hitherto from making a communication of a most important and interesting nature but circumstances will not admit of further delay and i must trust it to paper it seems reduced almost to a certainty that the enemy will reinforce new york with part of their troops from virginia in that case the attempt against the former must be laid aside as it will not be in our power to draw together a force sufficient to justify the undertaking the detachment which the enemy will probably leave in virginia seems the next object which ought to engage our attention and which will be a very practicable one     should we obtain a naval superiority of which i am not without hopes and be able to carry a body of men suddenly round by water the principal difficulty which occurs is obtaining transports at the moment they may be wanted for if they are taken up beforehand the use for which they are designed cannot be concealed and the enemy will make arrangements to defeat the plan what i would therefore wish you to inform yourself of without making a direct inquiry is what number of tons of shipping could be obtained in philadelphia at any time between this and the  0th of this month and whether there could also be obtained at the same time a few deepwaisted sloops and schooners proper to carry horses the number of doubledecked vessels which may be wanted of two hundred tons and upwards will not exceed thirty i shall be glad of your answer as soon as possible because if it is favorable i can direct certain preparations to be made in philadelphia and at other convenient places without incurring any suspicions there certainly can be no danger of not obtaining flour in philadelphia and as you seem to have doubts of procuring salt meat there i shall direct all that which is at the eastward to be collected at places from whence it may be shipped upon the shortest notice you will also oblige me by giving me your opinion of the number of vessels which might be obtained at baltimore or other places in chesapeake in the time before mentioned or thereabouts i have the honor to be c     george washington   august      dobbss ferry to the president of congress headquarters dobbss ferry   august      sir i do myself the honor to inform congress through your excellency that at a late meeting between the american and british commissaries of prisoners it has been proposed by the latter to go into a full exchange of lieutenantgeneral burgoyne and all the remaining officers of convention by composition where ranks will not apply for the remainder of our officers in this quarter and after them for those taken at the southward one of the terms insisted upon is that the prisoners surrendered by the capitulation of the cedars to the amount of four hundred and fortythree shall be allowed i have not thought myself at liberty to accept of these proposals without the concurrence of congress for the following reasons that i imagine our minister at the court of versailles has been already directed to propose the exchange of lieutenantgeneral burgoyne for the honorable mr laurens  that i do not know whether it would be agreeable to congress to release the whole of the convention officers before they have obtained a settlement for the subsistence of those troops and lastly because the refusal of the ratification of the convention of the cedars has never been repealed i would beg leave to remark on the two last that the exchange of our full colonels can never be obtained     but by composition and that it is better to effect this by a composition for inferior officers than for men because the enemy gain no reinforcement by such mode to relieve the full colonels in this quarter only  who all but one have been prisoners since      would take seven hundred privates should the security for the convention debt still be urged i would answer that we may perhaps deceive ourselves in supposing that the balance upon a general settlement for the subsistence of all prisoners since the commencement of the war will be much in our favor i am inclined to think we shall find it the contrary and owing to this the british have constantly kept their accounts with accuracy and have vouchers ready to support them we on the other hand shall be found very deficient on that score indeed i fear almost totally so except in the instance of the convention troops and prisoners of war latterly congress will judge of the expediency of repealing their act respecting the convention of the cedars upon the present occasion mr skinner the commissarygeneral of prisoners will have the honor of delivering this to your excellency i shall be obliged by an answer to several points contained in it at his return that i may instruct him accordingly i have the honor to be c      george washington    august      dobbss ferry marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette headquarters dobbss ferry    august      my dear marquis i have received your letters of the   th and  0th ultimo and  st instant i cannot learn that any troops have yet arrived at new york from virginia a fleet of twenty sail came in last saturday with troops but they are said to be hessian recruits from europe the concorde frigate has arrived at newport from count de grasse he was to leave st domingo the  d of this month with a fleet of between twentyfive and twentynine sail of the line and a considerable body of land forces his destination is immediately for the chesapeake so that he will either be there by the time this reaches you     or you may look for him every moment under these circumstances whether the enemy remain in full force or whether they have only a detachment left you will immediately take such a position as will best enable you to prevent their sudden retreat through north carolina which i presume they will attempt the instant they perceive so formidable an armament should general wayne with the troops destined for south carolina still remain in the neighborhood of james river and the enemy should have made no detachment to the southward you will detain those troops until you hear from me again and inform general greene of the cause of their delay if wayne should have marched and should have gained any considerable distance i would not have him halted you shall hear further from me as soon as i have concerted plans and formed dispositions for sending a reinforcement from hence in the mean time i have only to recommend a continuation of that prudence and good conduct which you have manifested through the whole of your campaign you will be particularly careful to conceal the expected arrival of the count because if the enemy are not apprized of it they will stay on board their transports in the bay which will be the luckiest circumstance in the world you will take measures for opening a communication with count de grasse the moment he arrives and will concert measures with him for making the best uses of your joint forces until you receive aid from this quarter     p s i would not wish you to call out a large body of militia upon this occasion but rather keep those you have compact and ready for service i am c  george washington    august      phillipsburg count de grasse to the count de grasse  camp at phillipsburg    august      sir in consequence of the despatches received from your excellency by the frigate la concorde it has been judged expedient to give up for the present the     enterprise against new york and turn our attention towards the south with a view if we should not be able attempt charleston itself to recover and secure the states of virginia north carolina and the country of south carolina and georgia we may add a further inducement for giving up this firstmentioned enterprise which is the arrival of a reinforcement of near three thousand hessian recruits for this purpose we have determined to remove the whole of the french army and as large a detachment of the american as can be spared to chesapeake to meet your excellency there the following appear to us the principal cases which will present themselves and upon which we shall be obliged ultimately to form our plans we have therefore stated them with a few short observations upon each your excellency will be pleased to revolve them in your own mind and prepare your own opinion by the time we shall have the pleasure of meeting you in virginia first what shall be done if the enemy should be found with the greater part of their force in virginia upon the arrival of the french fleet second should only a detachment be found there thirdly should the british force be totally withdrawn from thence     upon the first it appears to us that we ought without loss of time to attack the enemy with our united force upon the second it appears proper to destine such part of our force as will be amply sufficient to reduce the enemys detachment and then determine what use shall be made of the remainder and here two things present themselves for our consideration the enemy will either have sent a greater part of their force from virginia to new york or to charleston if to new york which is the least probable under present circumstances charleston will have but a moderate garrison and it may be possible to attack it to advantage if to charleston then the enemy will be so superior to general greene that they will be able to regain the whole of the state of south carolina and of consequence georgia we therefore think that in this latter case such a force at least should be detached to south carolina as will enable us to keep the field and confine the enemy in or near to charleston in the third case which we stated we mean that of supposing the enemy should have totally evacuated virginia it appears to us necessary to make a solid establishment at portsmouth or any other place if more proper in order to render a fleet in chesapeake bay entirely secure and to employ the remainder of our land force and such vessels as may be proper for the service as has been explained in the preceding article that is either in the siege of charleston if the garrison shall be found sufficiently weak to warrant     the attempt or to cover and secure the country should it be found otherwise returning back to the enterprise against new york will depend on a number of circumstances the discussion of which we will leave until we have the happiness of a conference with your excellency we have only to observe that the execution of all or any of the plans which we have proposed go upon the supposition of a decided naval superiority except that of marching a reinforcement into south carolina we would beg leave to take up so much of your excellencys time as to point out to you the vast importance of charleston and what advantages the enemy derive from the possession of it it is the center of their power in the south by holding it they preserve a dangerous influence throughout the whole state as it is the only port and the only place from whence the people can procure those articles of foreign produce which are essential to their support and it in great measure serves to cover and keep in subjection the state of georgia from thence the enemy can also establish small posts in north carolina and if they maintain a post in chesapeake they keep up the appearance of possessing four hundred miles upon the coast and of consequence have a pretext for setting up claims which may be very detrimental to the interests of america in european councils we are not sufficiently acquainted with the position of charleston neither is it necessary at this time to enter into a detail of the proper mode of attacking it or of the probability which we should have of   0 succeeding for these we will refer you to brigadiergeneral duportail commander of the corps of engineers in the service of the united states who will have the honor of presenting this this gentleman having been in charleston as principal engineer during the greater part of the siege and in the environs of it as a prisoner of war a considerable time afterwards had opportunities of making very full observations which he judiciously improved a variety of cases different from those we have stated may occur it is for this reason that we have thought proper to send general duportail to your excellency he is fully acquainted with every circumstance of our affairs in this quarter and we recommend him to your excellency as an officer upon whose abilities and in whose integrity you may place the fullest confidence we would observe that it will be very essential to the despatch of the business in contemplation for you to send up to elk river at the head of the chesapeake bay all your frigates transports and vessels proper for the conveyance of the french and american troops down the bay we shall endeavor to have as many as can be found in baltimore and other ports secured but we have reason to believe they will be very few we have the honor to be with the greatest respect attachment esteem c      george washington    august      dobbss ferry to the superintendent of finance headquarters dobbss ferry    august      dear sir i have in confidence imparted to you the alteration of our late plan and made you acquainted with our intended operations besides the provisions necessary at the head of elk to carry the troops down the bay a very considerable quantity will be wanted in virginia i should suppose three hundred barrels of flour as many of salt meat and eight or ten hogsheads of rum would be sufficient at elk for what will be consumed in virginia i imagine the order must be general as we can neither ascertain the number of     men which will be drawn together or the time they will be employed i have written to the count de grasse and have requested him to send up his light vessels of every kind to elk but i would nevertheless wish to have all that may be at baltimore and the upper parts of the bay secured i shall therefore be obliged to you to take measures at a proper time for that purpose when that time will be and when you shall give orders for the deposit at elk i will hereafter inform you i shall direct the quartermaster in due season to take up all the small craft in delaware for the purpose of transporting the troops from trenton to christeen should he have occasion for advice or assistance from you upon this occasion i must request you to give him both i am confident it will be necessary to give the american troops destined for southern services one months pay in specie this will amount to about dollars if it will be possible     for you to procure this sum you will infinitely oblige me and will much benefit the service i shall also stand in need of a sum of specie for secret services i suppose about five hundred guineas i am dear sir c  george washington    august      majorgeneral heath to majorgeneral heath instructions sir you are to take command of all the troops remaining in this department consisting of the two regiments of new hampshire ten of massachusetts and five of connecticut infantry the corps of invalids sheldons legion the third regiment of artillery together with all such state troops and militia as are retained in service of those which would have been under my own command the security of west point and the posts in the highlands is to be considered the first object of your attention in order to effect this you will make such dispositions as in your judgment the circumstances shall from time to time require taking care to have as large a supply of salted provisions as possible constantly on hand to have the fortifications works and magazines repaired     and perfected as far as may be to have the garrison at least in all cases kept up to its present strength to have the minuter arrangements and plans for the defence and support of this important post perfectly understood and vigorously acted upon in case of any attempt against it ample magazines of wood and forage are to be laid in against the approaching winter the former should be cut on the margin of the river and transported by water to the garrison the latter ought to be collected from the country below the lines in the greatest quantities possible and deposited in such places as you shall judge proper the force now put under your orders it is presumed will be sufficient for all the purposes above mentioned as well as to yield a very considerable protection and cover to the country without hazarding the safety of the posts in the highlands this is to be esteemed as it respects the friendly inhabitants and resources of the country an extremely interesting object but when compared with the former of a secondary nature the protection of the northern and western frontiers of the state of new york as well as of those parts of that and other states most contiguous and exposed to the ravages and depredations of the enemy will claim your attention but as the contingencies which are to be expected in the course of the campaign may be so various unforeseen and almost infinite that no particular line of conduct can be prescribed for them upon all such occasions you will be governed by your own prudence and discretion in which the fullest confidence is placed although your general rule of conduct will be to act on the defensive only yet it is not meant to prohibit you from striking a blow at the enemys posts or detachments should a fair opportunity present itself the most eligible position for your army in my opinion will be above i e on the north side of the croton as well for the purpose of supporting the garrison of west point as annoying the enemy and covering the country as for the security and repose of your troops waterburys brigade which may be posted towards the sound sheldons corps the state troops of new york and other light parties may occasionally be made use of to hold the enemy in check and carry on the petite guerre with     them but i would recommend keeping your force as much collected and as compact as the nature of the service will admit doing by corps instead of detachments whenever it is practicable and above all exerting yourself most strenuously and assiduously while the troops are in a camp of repose to make them perfect in their exercise and manœuvres and to establish the most regular system of discipline and duty the good of the service and emulation of corps will i am persuaded prompt the officers and men to devote their whole time and attention to the pleasing and honorable task of becoming masters of their profession the uncertainty which the present movement of the army will probably occasion with the enemy ought to be increased by every means in your power and the deception kept up as long as possible it will not be expedient to prevent the militia which were ordered from coming in until the arrival of the count de grasse or something definite or certain is known from the southward and even then circumstances may but of this you will be advised render it advisable to keep the enemy at new york in check to prevent their detaching to reinforce their southern army or to harass the inhabitants on the seacoast the redoubt on the east side of dobbss ferry is to be dismantled and demolished the platforms to be taken up and transported up the river if it can conveniently be done the blockhouse on the other side to be maintained or evacuated and destroyed as you shall think proper the waterguards and other precautions to prevent a surprise you will be pleased to take into your consideration and regulate in such a manner as you shall judge most expedient you will be pleased also to keep me regularly advised of every important event which shall take place in your department given under my hand at headquarters this   th day of august      p s by the act of congress of the  d of october    0 a return is to be made to them annually on or before the  st of september of the troops belonging to the several states that requisitions may be made for completing the same this you will be pleased to have done by the troops under your command the preservation of the boats is a matter of very great importance to which you will attend let all the new boats and such others     as are not absolutely necessary and allotted to the service of the garrison be hauled up and put under the care of a guard so that the person to whom they are committed shall be accountable for every boat the abuses committed by people belonging to commissioned whale boats on long island ought to be enquired into and suppressed especially as congress have ordered those commissions to be revoked      george washington    august      kings ferry robert morris richard peters to robert morris and richard peters  head quarters kings ferry    august      gentlemen i have devoted the first moment of my time which i could command while the troops are halted for the french army at this place to give my sentiments unreservedly on the several matters contained in your favor of the   th instant this i will attempt to do with all that frankness and sincerity which from your own candor in your communications you have a right to expect and for doing which with the greater freedom the importance of the subject will be my apology persuaded that we are influenced by the same motives and anxious in pursuit of the same object i am only unhappy that i should be forced to dissent in a single instance from the opinion of those for whose judgment and ability i have the highest deference respecting the surest and best mode for attaining that object but being at the same time fully sensible of the necessity of prosecuting the war with as much vigor as our circumstances will admit and of using the strictest economy in the prosecution of it upon these very principles i beg leave to give it as my opinion that a reduction of the number of officers     and men as fixed by the last arrangement or any material alteration of the establishment of the army for the next campaign would not in the present situation of affairs be expedient for the following reasons in the first place because the enemy must resolve to prosecute the war or be disposed to make a peace in either of which cases a respectable army in the field on our part will i conceive more than compensate the expenses of it and will eventually be the best and most economical system of policy we can possibly act upon for should the enemy still be determined to carry on the war with obstinacy not only policy but even necessity would urge us to keep up a superior army as the surest and only means of forcing them to a peace and freeing us from the calamities and expenses of the war as it is evident from many circumstances that they have relied more for success on our want of exertions than upon their own military prowess or resources and that this has been one principal inducement of their persevering hitherto but on the other hand should they be inclined to a pacification a powerful and well appointed army would both enable us to dictate our own terms at the negotiation and hasten the completion of it in addition to this whoever considers how much more expensive and less serviceable militia are than continental troops how heavy and repeated a burden on the public their bounties are when they are hired when drafted how disagreeable and frequently distressing     for them to be torn from their families to a life with which they are totally unacquainted how precarious and uncertain the aid is which may be expected from them in such cases what glorious opportunities have been lost by us and what almost ruinous advantages have been taken by the enemy in times of our weakness for want of a permanent force in the field—will i am persuaded be convinced that we ought to have constantly such an army as is sufficient to operate against the enemy and supersede the necessity of calling forth the militia except on the most extraordinary occasions i will also beg leave to remind you gentlemen of the great reduction of the number of regiments on the continental establishment viz from one hundred and sixteen to fifty since the year      and to observe in consequence that in my opinion we do not find the enemy so much exhausted or their strength so debilitated as to warrant any farther diminution of our established force by one of the late intercepted letters from lord george germaine it appears the enemy considered the number of men in their provincial corps only greater than the whole number of men in the service of the continent since which time the reinforcements that have arrived from europe amount by the best accounts i have been able to obtain to at least four thousand men that the states are able by proper exertions to furnish the number of men required by the last arrangement of the army may i think rationally be supposed as the population in many of them   0 has rather increased than diminished since the commencement of the war and as the greater part of them do actually when called upon in an emergency give a sufficient number of men for services of short duration to complete their continental regiments that the country abounds with supplies of all kinds is acknowledged from all quarters whether the men can be obtained or the resources drawn forth is more than i will presume with certainty to determine but one thing is certain that it is idle to contend against great odds when we have it in our power to do it upon equal or even advantageous terms there are also several arguments which i omit to enforce that might be adduced particularly to prove the impropriety of reducing the number of officers or making any considerable alteration in the system such as our having found by experience that the proportion of officers is not too great for the number of men that the same or a greater proportion has been esteemed necessary in other more ancient services and that the full complement is more indispensably requisite in ours because there are a larger number of levies and recruits to train and discipline annually than is to be found in the regiments of other nations and because a greater number of officers are taken from the line to perform the duties of the staff than in most other services it is likewise an established fact that every alteration in the military system or change in the arrangement unless founded in the most obvious principles of utility is attended with     uneasiness among the officers confusion with regard to the disposition of the men and frequently with irregularities and disagreeable consequences before it can be carried completely into execution perfect order throughout the whole army has but just been restored since the last arrangement took place another innovation in the present situation might be more mischievous in its effects thus i have gentlemen from a desire of faithfully performing my duty from the experience of whatever degree it is which i have acquired in the service of my country and from the knowledge i have of the present state of the army given my sentiments on the first of your queries which likewise involves the answer to your second with regard to the third i am of opinion that the recruits ought if possible to be engaged for the war or three years but if this cannot be done that the community district or class furnishing a man for a shorter term of services ought to be compellable to have him replaced by the period when his time of service expires and that funds ought to be established if practicable for recruiting the men engaged for short services while they continue with the army as it is found by experience that they may be enlisted with more facility and less expense than under any other circumstances with respect to the fourth fifth and sixth queries i am in doubt whether any alteration can be made on those subjects which shall tend essentially all things considered to the public good i have the honor to be c     george washington   st august      kings ferry circular letter to the states head quarters kings ferry   st august      sir i feel myself unhappy in being obliged to inform you that the circumstances in which i find myself at this late period have induced me to make an alteration of the main object which was at first adopted and has hitherto been held in view for the operations of this campaign it gives me pain to say that the delay in the several states to comply with my requisitions of the   th of may last on which in a great measure depended the hopes of our success in that attempt has been one great and operative reason to lead to this alteration other circumstances it is true have had their weight in this determination and it may in the course of events prove happy to the states that this deviation from our main design has been adopted the fleet of the count de grasse with a body of french troops on board will make its first appearance in the cheasapeak which should the time of the fleets arrival prove favorable and should the enemy under lord cornwallis hold their present position in virginia will give us the fairest opportunity to reduce the whole british force in the south and to ruin their boasted expectations in that quarter—to effect this desirable object it has been judged expedient taking into consideration our own present circumstances with the situation of the enemy in new york and at the southward to abandon the seige of the former and to march a body of troops consisting of a detachment from the american army with the whole of the french troops immediately to virginia with this detachment which will be very considerable i have determined to march myself the american troops are already on the west side of the hudson and the french army will arrive at kings ferry this day when the whole are crossed our march will be continued with as much despatch as circumstances will admit the american army which will remain in this department excepting two light companies and some few detachments consists of the two new hampshire regiments ten of massachusetts and five of connecticut infantry with sheldons legion cranes artillery the state troops and militia which with proper exertions of the states will it is expected be sufficient to hold the enemy in     check at new york and prevent their ravages on the frontiers the command during my absence is given to majorgeneral heath who will have the honor to communicate with the states on every occasion which may require their attention as the enemys force in new york has been for some time past very considerable and it is reported with a good degree of certainty that they have lately received a very considerable reinforcement of german recruits from europe it will be necessary still to send forward a great part if not the whole of the militia requested from your state in the same manner as though no alteration had taken place in our measures you will therefore continue to send on at least — men from your state to the orders of general heath with as much despatch as possible unless you should be informed from him that this number need not be completed on this occasion i cannot omit to repeat to you my opinion of the absolute importance of filling your continental battalions to their complete numbers for the war or three years not only our past experience for a course of years but our present situation should strongly enforce the necessity of this measure every campaign teaches us the increasing difficulty and expence of procuring shorttermed levies and their decreasing utility in the field the large reinforcements which the enemy have this campaign sent to america strongly indicate their expectations of the continuance of the war should this be the case the best way to meet them is certainly with a permanent force but should the war be drawing towards a close a permanent and respectable army will give us the happiest prospects of a favorable peace in every view a permanent army should be the great object of the states to obtain as they regard sound policy prudence or economy i have the honor to be c george washington    august      chatham to the superintendent of finance chatham    august      dear sir accounts brought by several vessels to philadelphia and to the eastward leave little doubt that the count de grasse must have already arrived in the     chesapeake or that he must be very soon there the count de rochambeau and myself have therefore determined that no time ought to be lost in making preparations for our transportation from trenton to christiana and from the head of elk down the chesapeake i have written by this opportunity to colonel miles and have directed him immediately to engage all the proper kind of craft for the navigation of the delaware which can be found in philadelphia or in the creeks above and below it and as your advice may be useful to him more especially so far as respects procuring the vessels at a distance from philadelphia i have desired him to wait upon you for that purpose i shall also be obliged to you for using your influence with the gentlemen of baltimore to permit any vessels that may be in that port to come up to elk and assist us in transportation i have little doubt from the cheerfulness with which they furnished the marquis last winter but they will comply with your requisition on the present occasion but lest there should be a necessity for the interference of the executive of the state i have written to governor lee upon that and other matters i enclose the letter under flying seal for your information and you will be good enough to forward it by a chain of expresses which is established any vessels which may be procured in the chesapeake should rendezvous as soon as possible in elk river you will be pleased to make the deposit of flour rum and salt meat at the head of elk which i requested in a former letter i am very fearful that about     fifteen hundred barrels of salt provisions and thirty hogsheads of rum which i directed to be sent from connecticut and rhode island under convoy of the count de barras would not have been ready when the fleet sailed from newport should that have been the case the disappointment will be great i would wish you to see whether a like quantity of those articles can be procured in philadelphia or in maryland if we should find that they have not gone round from the eastward i must entreat you if possible to procure one months pay in specie for the detachment which i have under my command part of those troops have not been paid any thing for a very long time past and have upon several occasions shown marks of great discontent the service they are going upon is disagreeable to the northern regiments but i make no doubt that a douceur of a little hard money would put them in proper temper if the whole sum cannot be obtained a part of it will be better than none as it may be distributed in proportion to the respective wants and claims of the men the american detachment will assemble in this neighborhood today the french army tomorrow i have the honor to be c      george washington   september      philadelphia marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette philadelphia   september      nothing my dear marquis could have afforded me more satisfaction than the information communicated in your two letters of the   st and   th ultimo of the measures you had taken and of the arrangements you were making in consequence of the intelligence i had given you calculating upon the regular force under your immediate orders the militia which have already been called for and may be expected in the field the whole of the french army and the american corps now marching with majorgeneral lincoln from the northward in addition to the land forces expected on board of the fleet i flatter myself we shall not experience any considerable difficulties from the want of men to carry our most favorite projects into execution the means for prosecuting the siege with rapidity energy and success and of supplying the troops while they are engaged in that service as they are more precarious have been and still continue to be the great objects of my concern and attention heavy cannon ordnance stores and ammunition to a pretty large amount are now forwarding general knox in whose immediate province these arrangements are who knows the whole of our resources is making every exertion to furnish a competent supply and will be on the spot to remedy every deficiency as far as the circumstances will possibly admit having also from the first moment been extremely anxious respecting the supplies of the army in     which i comprehend not only provisions of the bread and meat kind c but also forage and the means of transportation i had written pressingly to the governors of maryland and virginia on that subject previous to the receipt of your favor of the   st of august i have since reiterated my entreaties and enforced in the strongest terms i was capable of using the requisitions for specific supplies made by congress and now again called for by the superintendent of finance from the states of jersey delaware and maryland as to the supplies of pennsylvania we are to look for them from the financier himself i hope and trust the efforts of these states and of virginia will be uncommonly great and proportionate to the magnitude of the object before us in order to introduce some kind of system and method in our supplies to know with certainty what may be depended upon and to put the business in the best possible train of execution i shall send forward the heads of departments as soon as their presence can be dispensed with i have spoken to the surgeongeneral respecting hospital stores and medicines all that can be done will be done in that department as to clothing i am sorry to inform you little is to be expected except in the article of shoes of which a full supply will be sent on in my progress to the southward i shall take care as far as practicable to make all the arrangements necessary for the operation in view and to impress the executives with an idea of the absolute necessity of furnishing their quotas of supplies regularly as     we have no other resources to rely upon for the support of the army and especially as i am very apprehensive that a quantity of fifteen hundred barrels of salted provisions which i had ordered to be shipped under convoy of the count de barras did not arrive in time for that purpose but my dear marquis i am distressed beyond expression to know what has become of the count de grasse and for fear that the english fleet by occupying the chesapeake towards which my last accounts say they were steering may frustrate all our flattering prospects in that quarter i am also not a little solicitous for the count de barras who was to have sailed from rhode island on the   d ultimo and from whom i have heard nothing since that time of many contingencies we will hope for the most propitious events should the retreat of lord cornwallis by water be cut off by the arrival of either of the french fleets i am persuaded you will do all in your power to prevent his escape by land may that great felicity be reserved for you      you see how critically important the present moment is for my own part i am determined still to persist with unremitting ardor in my present plan unless some inevitable and insuperable obstacles are thrown in the way adieu my dear marquis if you get any thing new from any quarter send it i pray you on the spur of speed for i am almost all impatience and anxiety at the same time that i am c p s since writing the above i have received your favor of the   th col laurens has just arrived in this town from france via boston but i know not yet what intelligence he brings george washington    september      williamsburg to the president of congress williamsburg    september       sir i have the honor to inform congress that i arrived at this place last evening that soon after my arrival i received the pleasing intelligence that the count   0 de grasse who had put to sea on the  th in pursuit of the british fleet had returned to his former station at cape henry having driven the british from the coast taken two of their frigates and effected a junction with the squadron of the count de barras  in consequence of my having been informed of the sailing of the fleet from the capes and being apprehensive that we were not assured of the security of our navigation in the bay i had ordered the troops who were embarked at the head of elk to stop until we had further intelligence orders are this morning gone on to press them forward with every despatch possible  i am distressed to find that the supplies of the army collecting here are on too precarious a footing already a want of provisions has been experienced every measure is taking that is in my power to be better assured of our supplies in future how far i shall succeed in my endeavors time must discover i have the honor to be c     george washington    september      williamsburg count de grasse to the count de grasse headquarters williamsburg    september      sir i had the honor to receive your excellencys letter of the  th of this month soon after the arrival at this place i am at a loss to express the pleasure which i have in congratulating your excellency on your return to your former station in the bay and the happy circumstance of forming a junction with the squadron of the count de barras i take particular satisfaction in felicitating your excellency on the glory of having driven the british fleet from the coast and taking two of their frigates these happy events and the decided superiority of your fleet gives us the happiest presages of the most complete success in our combined operations in this bay it is with much regret that i find the want of transports in the bay has retarded the coming on of the troops expected from the northward if it is possible for your excellency to give us any assistance in this distress it will be attended with inexpressible advantage to the prosecution of our measures and will be acknowledged with the highest gratitude such of our troops as could not be embarked at the     head of elk are marching to baltimore where they are to be put on board such transports as may be collected at that place it is very much the wish of the count de rochambeau as well as myself to have the honor of an interview with your excellency but our particular circumstances render us dependent on your goodness for the means of conveyance if your excellency could despatch some fastsailing cutter to receive us on board and will inform us your time and place we shall be very happy to attend you at the earliest moment you shall fix count ferson an aid to count de rochambeau is sent on to hurry down the troops embarking on the bay if your excellency can furnish him the means of proceeding up the bay it will be very agreeable i am c p s since writing the above i am informed with much pleasure that your excellency has anticipated my wishes in sending transports up the bay  george washington    september      williamsburg majorgeneral st clair to majorgeneral st clair williamsburg    september      dear sir i have to request you in the most earnest manner to send forward all the recruits that are furnished by the state of pennsylvania for their line let it not be said that those troops are kept from service for     want of a few articles which they could wish to be furnished with when other troops doing duty in the field are combating almost every distress imaginable in the want of almost every necessary if any thing in the power of the state can be instantly done towards their equipment i wish the authorities to be called upon and hope they will furnish what they can without delay it is the highest absurdity in the world to keep those troops in a state of idleness at great expense and at the same time for want of them to put the public to the same or much greater charge by calling in the aid of militia which we are now obliged to do i beg you therefore to hurry on those troops with all the expedition in your power by water down the chesapeake embarking at baltimore where craft can doubtless be found by taking the proper precaution and their transportation will be perfectly secure so long as the fleet maintains its present station the place of debarkation will be in james river probably at the college landing unless further orders shall be given to carry them to some other place nearer the point of our operations i am c      questions and answers the noble and generous support which is given to this country by his most christian majesty does as it ought fill the breast of every american with gratitude  love—the zeal and alacrity with which his officers strive to carry his royal intentions into execution merit our highest admiration  applause a recent instance of this is now before us but the distressed and unfortunate circumstances of these united states and the dispersed situation of their troops are such as do not admit their military operations to be carried on with that celerity which could be wished nor place them on that advantageous ground from which they may reap all that benefit from this generous aid that in other circumstances they might expect to receive the measures which are now persuing are big with great events the peace  independence of this country and the general tranquillity of europe will it is more than probable result from our compleat success—disgrace to ourselves triumph to the enemy and probable ruin to the american cause will follow our disappointment the first is certain if the powerful fleet now in chesapeak bay or such part of it as will be competent to the purpose can     remain to the close of a regular operation which from various unforeseen causes may be protracted beyond our present expectations—the second is much to be apprehended if from the fear of loosing the aid of the fleet the operations by land are precipitated faster than a necessary prudence  regard to the lives of men will warrant—the first may be slow but sure—the second must be bloody  precarious under this state of matters general washington begs that the count de grasse will have the goodness to give him a resolution of the following questions—viz questions  st is your excellency restricted to any certain time for the continuance of the fleet upon this coast if any time is fixed beyond which your orders will not warrant your stay in this bay or if the persuit of any other object should more attract your attention—be pleased to name the day to which your departure is determined answers  st the instructions of count de grasse fix his departure to the   th of october and some engagements which he has made for other operations oblige him to be punctual but having already taken much upon himself he will also engage to stay to the end of october  d if your excellency should find yourself under a necessity to return the troops under the command of the marquis de st simon to the west indies however to be lamented such circumstance must be may i not be assured that a detachment of the fleet may be employed as a convoy to those troops and that the main fleet may remain in the bay to form a sufficient cover to our operations against the enemy—to prevent their receiving supplies by water and to protect us from any attempt from the british to give relief to lord cornwallis and raise our siege—and their fleet to remain untill the close of our operations  d the troops under the orders of marquis de st simon have a particular destination and i am not altogether at liberty to dispose of them but as my vessels will not depart before the  st of november you may count upon those troops to that period for the reduction of york      d will it in your excellencys opinion be practicable to force with your ships the passage of the york river so as to get above the enemy this measure if effected will be attended with almost infinite advantages not only as it will secure our communication to both sides of the river which otherwise must be very lengthy and tedious but will give us the navigation of the river and enable us to draw the supplies of the country throughout its whole extent—and will also form the compleat investiture of the enemys posts  d the thing is not impossible with a good wind and favorable tide but i do not find that operation very useful our communication can be established and our provisions drawn from the east side of york river without requiring the men  vessells in their passage between the batteries but i suspend my definitive answer until i can reconoitre the local situation and force of the enemy i shall certainly do every thing in my power  th so long as the enemy possesses both sides of the river it will be necessary to keep up our force on both sides—to aid our efforts in this operation will it be in your excellencys power to spare us any number of men from on board the fleet to continue so long as this measure is necessary if any what number  th i have offered and i again offer   00 or  000 men from my ships but i wish that these troops may not be employed but in a coup de main      th if in the prosecution of our operations our prospects of success should wear a favorable aspect i shall be glad to be decided whether your excellency will be able to detach some suitable vessels from your fleet sufficient to block in the british troops at wilmington and to possess the harbour of charlestown  th the form of my vessels do not admit of the enterprise  th if our operations should be of such a nature as to require it will your excellency be able to lend us some heavy cannon and other artillery—powder also—and in what number and quantity go washington sept          th i can give some cannon and powder—the two coms  which i have had admit of my sparing but a small quantity of the latter le comte de grasse george washington    september      williamsburg count de grasse to the count de grasse williamsburg    september      sir i cannot conceal from your excellency the painful anxiety under which i have labored since the receipt of the letter with which you honored me on the   d instant the naval movements which your excellency states there as possible considering the intelligence communicated to you by the baron de closen make it incumbent upon me to represent the consequences that would arise from them and to urge a perseverance in the plan already agreed upon give me leave in the first place to repeat to your excellency     that the enterprise against york under the protection of your ships is as certain as any military operation can be rendered by a decisive superiority of strength and means that it is in fact reducible to calculation and that the surrender of the british garrison will be so important in itself and its consequences and that it must necessarily go a great way towards terminating the war and securing the invaluable objects of it to the allies your excellencys departure from the chesapeake by affording an opening for the succor of york which the enemy would instantly avail himself of would frustrate these brilliant prospects and the consequence would be not only the disgrace and loss of renouncing an enterprise upon which the fairest expectations of the allies have been founded after the most expensive preparations and uncommon exertions and fatigues but the disbanding perhaps of the whole army for want of provisions the present theatre of the war is totally deficient in means of land transportation being intersected by large rivers and its whole dependence for interior communication being upon small vessels the country has been so much exhausted besides by the ravages of the enemy and the subsistence of our own army that our supplies can only be drawn from a distance and under cover of a fleet mistress of the chesapeake i most earnestly entreat your excellency farther to consider that if the present opportunity should be missed that if you should withdraw your maritime force from the position agreed upon that no future day can restore to us a similar occasion     for striking a decisive blow that the british will be indefatigable in strengthening their most important maritime points and that the epoch of an honorable peace will be more remote than ever the confidence with which i feel myself inspired by the energy of character and the naval talents which so eminently distinguish your excellency leaves me no doubt that upon a consideration of the consequences which must follow your departure from the chesapeake that your excellency will determine upon the possible measure which the dearest interests of the common cause would dictate i had invariably flattered myself from the accounts given me by skilful mariners that your excellencys position moored in the chesapeake might be made so respectable as to bid defiance to any attempt on the part of the british fleet at the same time that it would support the operations of the siege secure the transportation of our supplies by water and economize the most precious time by facilitating the debarkation of our heavy artillery and stores conveniently to the trenches in york river it is to be observed that the strength of the enemys reinforcement announced under admiral digby as we have the intelligence from the british may not only be exaggerated but altogether a finesse and supposing the account consistent with truth their total force it was hoped would not put them in condition to attack with any prospect of success if the stationary position which had been agreed upon should be found utterly impracticable there is an alternative which however inferior considered relatively   0 to the support and facility of our land operations would save our affairs from ruin this is to cruise with your fleet within view of the capes so as effectually to prevent the entrance of any british vessels upon the whole i should esteem myself deficient in my duty to the common cause of france and america if i did not persevere in entreating your excellency to resume the plans that have been so happily arranged and if invincible maritime reasons prevent i depend as a last resource upon your excellencys pursuing the alternative above mentioned and rendering the chesapeake inaccessible to any enemys vessel however the british admiral may manœuvre and endeavor to divert your excellency from the object in view i can hardly admit a belief that it can be his serious intention to engage in a general action with a fleet whose force will be superior supposing the most flattering accounts for the british to be true past experience having taught them to engage with caution even upon equal terms and forced from them acknowledgments which prove the respect with which they have been inspired let me add sir that even a momentary absence of the french fleet may expose us to the loss of the british garrison at york as in the present state of affairs lord cornwallis might effect the evacuation with the loss of his artillery and baggage and such a sacrifice of men as his object would evidently justify the marquis de lafayette who does me the honor to bear this to your excellency will explain many     particularities of our situation which could not well be comprised in a letter his candor and abilities are well known to your excellency and entitle him to the fullest confidence in treating of the most important interests i have earnestly requested him not to proceed any farther than the capes  for fear of accidents should your excellency have put to sea in this case he will despatch a letter to your excellency in addition to this i have the honor to be c      george washington   october      to the president of congress head quarters camp before york   october      sir last evening i was honored with your excellencys favor of the   st ulto with its enclosure the intelligence it contains respecting the british fleet is very agreeable and will be immediately transmitted to the count de grasse in my last which bore date the   d ultimo i informed that our preparations for a near investment of the enemy at york were fast ripening to a point i have now to acquaint your excellency that i marched from williamsburg with the whole army on the   th and approached within about two miles of the enemy at york at which distance a show was made of some opposition on our left but upon the count de rochambeau who commands that part of the army his moving a few pieces of fieldartillery under direction of the baron vioménil and giving a few shots the enemy retired on the   th the american troops moved forward and took their ground in front of the enemys works on their left no opposition except a few scattered shots from a small work by moors mill on wormleys creek and a battery on the left of pigeon quarter a small fire all day from our riflemen and the enemys yagers  0th in the morning we discovered that the enemy had evacuated all their exterior line of works and withdrawn themselves to those near the body of     the town by this means we are in possession of very advantageous grounds which command in a very near advance almost the whole remaining line of their defence all the expedition that our circumstances will admit is using to bring up our heavy artillery and stores and to open our batteries this work i hope will be executed in a few days when our fire will begin with great vigor the investment of the enemy is fully completed and drawn very near to their lines except on the river above the town where their communication is still open to prevent this and to complete the blockade a request is gone to the count de grasse desiring him to push if he thinks it practicable one or more ships above the town this if effected will answer many very valuable purposes the position of the count de grasse is judiciously taken the main fleet keeping their station in lynnhaven bay and detachments made to secure the rivers the determination of the count is favorably disposed to comply with our wishes in every necessary cooperation i shall continue to keep congress advised of such occurrences as are worthy the communication i have the honor to be c george washington   october      york count de grasse to the count de grasse before york   october      sir i should have had the honor of acknowledging sooner the note which your excellency transmitted by the marquis de lafayette but an expectation of being able to accompany my answer with interesting     intelligence induced me to defer it to the present moment with regard to the station which your excellency has determined for the main fleet the reasons which you are pleased to communicate prove that it unites all advantages and inspire the greatest confidence in the accomplishment of its object i have only one proposition to submit to your excellency on the subject of naval dispositions and the objects of it are too essential not to be exposed to you in their fullest light i mean the stationing two or three ships above the enemys posts on york river for want of this only means of completing the investment of their works the british remain masters of the navigation for twentyfive miles distance above them and have by their armed vessels intercepted supplies of the greatest value on their way to our camp the loss is redoubled by diminishing our means and augmenting those of the enemy at a most critical time we are even necessitated for the protection of williamsburg and the magazines in our rear to leave a post of seven or eight hundred men in that quarter a diminution of our force that in present circumstances we can but illy support but unless this detachment is made the enemy might in the greatest security land above queens creek to cover his left flank and by a very short march effect the most destructive purposes while the circuitous march which we from the nature of the country should be obliged to make would render it impossible to arrive in time to prevent or punish him we are besides reduced to the impossibility of concerting     measures with the corps of troops at gloucester being obliged in order to communicate with them to make a circuit of near ninety miles whereas in the other case it would be both easy and expeditious but what is a still more decisive consideration is that lord cornwallis has by the york river an outlet for his retreat and that he may by embracing a leading wind and tide and stealing a march proceed unmolested to west point where upon debarking his troops he will have the pamunky on one flank and the mattapony on the other and that finally he may by mounting the greatest part of his men and successive forced marches push his way with a compact disciplined army through a country whose population is too scattered to be collected for sudden opposition and make it impossible for us to overtake him many people are of opinion that lord cornwallis will embrace this as the only means of safety and it is certain that unless the investment is completed as above mentioned he will have it in his power either now or in a last extremity the present position of the fleet and army perfectly secures us against every enterprise on the part of the enemy in james river upon the whole i can assure your excellency that this seems to be the only point in which we are defective the enemy has already abandoned all their exterior works and withdrawn himself altogether to the body of the place and given us great advantages for opening the trenches the engineers have had a near and satisfactory view of the works without interruption     and we have most to apprehend lord cornwalliss escape for these reasons i earnestly entreat that your excellency will be pleased to authorize and enjoin the commanding officer of the ships in york river to concert measures with me for the purpose above mentioned in this case an additional ship may be necessary to remain at the mouth of the river the experiment and two frigates if your excellency thinks proper would be best calculated for the station above if upon mature examination of the passage it should appear too great a risk for the ships i would at least solicit your excellency that the vessels might advance higher up the river and take a more menacing position with respect to the enemy on our right but i must confess to your excellency that i am so well satisfied by experience of the little effect of land batteries on vessels passing them with a leading breeze that unless the two channels near york should be found impracticable by obstructions i should have the greatest confidence in the success of this important service your excellencys approbation of this measure would supersede the necessity of a defence against fireships but the nature of the river besides renders it physically impossible to form any obstructions of the kind proposed i entreat your excellency to accept the sentiments of respectful attachment with which i have the honor to be c      george washington   october      york majorgeneral greene to majorgeneral greene camp before york   october      my dear sir how happy am i in at length having it in my power to congratulate you upon a victory as splendid as i hope it will prove important fortune must have been coy indeed had she not yielded at last to so persevering a pursuer as you have been i hope now she is yours that she will change her appellation of fickle to that of constant i can say with sincerity that i feel with the highest degree of pleasure the good effects which you mention as resulting from the perfect good understanding between you the marquis and myself i hope it will never be interrupted and i am sure it never can while we are all influenced by the same pure motive that of love to our country and interest in the cause in which we are embarked i have happily had but few differences with those with whom i have the honor of being connected in the service with whom and of what nature these have been you know i bore much for the sake of peace and the public good my conscience tells me i acted     rightly in these transactions and should they ever come to the knowledge of the world i trust i shall stand acquitted by it the baron  from the warmth of his temper had got disagreeably involved with the state and an inquiry into a part of his conduct must one day take place both for his own honor and their satisfaction i have for the present given him a command in this army which makes him happy i shall always take pleasure in giving mrs greenes letters a conveyance and should she persist in the resolution of undertaking so long a journey as that from new england to carolina i hope she will make mount vernon where mrs knox now is a stage of more than a day or two with much esteem and regard i am dear sir c  george washington    october      york don francisco rendon to don francisco rendon  headquarters before york    october      sir i was yesterday honored with your favor of the  d it gives me pleasure to find so good a disposition in don bernardo de galvez  to concert his operations     in such a manner against the common enemy that the interests of his catholic majesty and those of ourselves and our ally may be mutually benefited you must be sensible that in the present political situation of affairs i cannot with any degree of propriety in behalf of the united states propose any joint plan of operations to don galvez though i flatter myself that difficulty will be ere long removed neither can i at this time determine whether we shall be able to act offensively against the enemy in south carolina and georgia that will in great measure depend upon the naval assistance we shall be able to derive from our ally of this you may assure don galvez that should any offensive plan be formed which is to be undertaken by the allied arms i will use my influence with the french commanders to give him due notice should i not be able to open a correspondence with him myself in the mean time you may inform him that he cannot make a more powerful diversion in favor of the southern states than by pushing his arms against east florida i am obliged by the extract of don galvezs letter to the count de grasse explaining at large the necessity he was under of granting the terms of capitulation to the garrison of pensacola which the commandant required i have no doubt from don galvezs well known attachment to the cause of america that he would have refused the articles which have been deemed exceptionable had there not been very powerful reasons to induce his acceptance of them    i am sir c   0 george washington    october      york to the president of congress headquarters before york    october      sir my last despatch to your excellency was of the  th i then informed you that we should open trenches on that night  we did so and established our first parallel within six hundred yards of the enemys works with the loss of only one officer of the french artillery wounded and sixteen privates killed and wounded the greater part of which were of the french line the  th and  th we were employed in completing the first parallel and in erecting batteries somewhat advanced of it the  th at   oclock in the afternoon the french battery on the left of four   pounders six mortars and howitzers opened—and at   oclock the american battery on the right of six    and    pounders—two mortars and two howitzers opened also we were informed that our shells did considerable execution in the town and we could perceive that our shot which were directed against the enemys embrasures injured them much the  0th two     french batteries one of ten eighteen and twentyfour pounders and six mortars and howitzers the other of four eighteenpounders opened as did two more american batteries one of four eighteenpounders the other of two mortars the fire now became so excessively heavy that the enemy withdrew their cannon from their embrasures placed them behind the merlins and scarcely fired a shot during the whole day in the evening the charon frigate of fortyfour guns was set on fire by a hot ball from the french battery on the left and entirely consumed her guns and stores had been taken out by the report of a deserter our shells which were thrown with the utmost degree of precision did much mischief in the course of the day yesterday morning two of the enemys transports were fired by hot shot and burnt this has occasioned them to warp their shipping as far over to the gloucester shore as possible we last night advanced our second parallel within three hundred yards of the enemys works with little or no annoyance from them only one man was killed and three or four wounded i shall think it strange indeed if lord cornwallis makes no vigorous exertions in the course of this night or very soon after i cannot but acknowledge the infinite obligations i am under to his excellency the count de rochambeau the marquis st simon commanding the troops from the west indies the other general officers and indeed the officers of every denomination in the french army for the assistance which     they afford me the experience of many of those gentlemen in the business before us is of the utmost advantage in the present operation and i am sensible it must give your excellency and congress the highest pleasure to know that the greatest harmony prevails between the two armies they seem actuated by one spirit that of supporting the honor of the allied arms and pushing their approaches with the utmost vigor i have the honor to be c george washington    october      york to the president of congress headquarters before york    october      sir i had the honor to inform your excellency in my last of the   th instant that we had the evening before opened our second parallel the   th and   th we were employed in completing it  the engineers having deemed the two redoubts on the left of the enemys line sufficiently injured by our shot and shells to make them practicable it was determined to carry them by assault on the evening of the   th the following disposition was accordingly made the work on the enemys extreme left to be attacked by the american light infantry under the command of the marquis de lafayette the other by a detachment of the french grenadiers and     chasseurs commanded by majorgeneral the baron vioménil i have the pleasure to inform your excellency that we succeeded in both nothing could exceed the firmness and bravery of the troops they advanced under the fire of the enemy without returning a shot and effected the business by the bayonet only the reports of his excellency the count de rochambeau the marquis de lafayette and lieutenantcolonel hamilton copies of which i enclose enter more particularly into a detail of the mode in which the attacks on the parts of the french and american columns were conducted we made prisoners in both redoubts one major two captains three subalterns and sixtyseven privates the works which we have carried are of vast importance to us from them we shall enfilade the enemys whole line and i am in hopes we shall be able to command the communication from york to gloucester i think the batteries of the second parallel will be in sufficient forwardness to begin to play in the course of this day the enemy last night made a sortie for the first time they entered one of the french and one of the american batteries on the second parallel which were unfinished they had only time to thrust the points of their bayonets into four pieces of the french and two of the american artillery and break them off but the spikes were easily extracted they were repulsed the moment the supporting troops came up leaving behind them seven or eight dead and six prisoners the french had four officers and twelve privates killed and wounded     and we had one sergeant mortally wounded i enclose your excellency a return of the killed and wounded of both armies up to the present time it is smaller than might have been expected  i have the honor to be c  george washington    october      york lord cornwallis to lord cornwallis head quarters before york    october      my lord to avoid unnecessary discussion and delays i shall at once in answer to your lordships letters of yesterday declare the general basis upon which a definitive treaty and capitulation must take place  the garrisons of york and gloucester including the seamen as you propose will be received prisoners of war the condition annexed of sending the british and     german troops to the parts of europe to which they respectively belong is inadmissible instead of this they will be marched to such parts of the country as can most conveniently provide for their subsistence and the benevolent treatment of prisoners which is invariably observed by the americans will be extended to them the same honors will be granted to the surrendering army as were granted to the garrison of charlestown the shipping and boats in the two harbors with all their guns stores tackling furniture and apparel shall be delivered in their present state to an officer of the navy appointed to take possession of them the artillery arms accoutrements military chest and public stores of every denomination shall be delivered unimpaired to the heads of departments to which they respectively belong the officers will be indulged in retaining their side arms and the officers and soldiers may preserve their baggage and effects with this reserve that property taken in the country will be reclaimed with regard to the individuals in civil capacities whose interests your lordship wishes may be attended to until they are more particularly described nothing definitive can be settled i have to add that i expect the sick and wounded will be supplied with their own hospital stores and be attended by british surgeons particularly charged with the care of them your lordship will be pleased to signify your determination either to accept or reject the proposals     now offered in the course of two hours from the delivery of this letter that commissioners may be appointed to digest the articles of capitulation or a renewal of hostilities may take place i have the honor c  george washington    october      york to the president of congress headquarters near york    october      sir i have the honor to inform congress that a reduction of the british army under the command of lord cornwallis is most happily effected the unremitted ardor which actuated every officer and soldier in the combined army on this occasion has principally led to this important event at an earlier period than my most sanguine hopes had induced me to expect the singular spirit of emulation which animated the whole army from the first commencement of our operations has filled my mind with the highest pleasure and satisfaction and had given me the happiest presages of success on the   th instant a letter was received from lord cornwallis proposing a meeting of commissioners     to consult on terms for the surrender of the posts of york and gloucester this letter the first which had passed between us opened a correspondence a copy of which i do myself the honor to enclose that correspondence was followed by the definitive capitulation which was agreed to and signed on the   th a copy of which is also herewith transmitted and which i hope will meet the approbation of congress i should be wanting in the feelings of gratitude did i not mention on this occasion with the warmest sense of acknowledgment the very cheerful and able assistance which i have received in the course of our operation from his excellency the count de rochambeau and all his officers of every rank in their respective capacities nothing could equal the zeal of our allies but the emulating spirit of the american officers whose ardor would not suffer their exertions to be exceeded the very uncommon degree of duty and fatigue which the nature of the service required from the officers of engineers and artillery of both armies obliges me particularly to mention the obligations i am under to the commanding and other officers of those corps i wish it was in my power to express to congress how much i feel myself indebted to the count de grasse and the officers of the fleet under his command for the distinguished aid and support which has been afforded by them between whom and the army the most happy concurrence of sentiments and views has subsisted and from whom every possible     coöperation has been experienced which the most harmonious intercourse could afford returns of the prisoners military stores ordnance shipping and other matters i shall do myself the honor to transmit to congress as soon as they can be collected by the heads of the departments to which they belong colonel laurens and the viscount de noailles on the part of the combined army were the gentlemen who acted as commissioners for forming and settling the terms of capitulation and surrender herewith transmitted to whom i am particularly obliged for their readiness and attention exhibited on the occasion colonel tilghman one of my aidsdecamp will have the honor to deliver these despatches to your excellency he will be able to inform you of every minute circumstance which is not particularly mentioned in my letter his merits which are too well known to need any observations at this time have gained my particular attention and i could wish that they may be honored by the notice of your excellency and congress your excellency and congress will be pleased to accept my congratulations on this happy event and believe me to be with the highest esteem c though i am not possessed of the particular returns yet i have reason to suppose that the number of prisoners will be between five and six thousand exclusive of seamen and others      george washington  0 october      count de grasse to the count de grasse headquarters  0 october      sir the surrender of york from which so much glory and advantage are derived to the allies and the honor of which belongs to your excellency has greatly anticipated our most sanguine expectations certain of this event under your auspices though unable to determine the time i solicited your attention in the first conference with which you honored me to ulterior objects of decisive importance to the common cause although your answer on that occasion was unfavorable to my wishes the unexpected promptness with which our operations here have been conducted to their final success having gained us time the defect of which was one of your excellencys principal objections a perspective of the most extensive and happy consequences engage me to renew my representation charleston the principal maritime port of the british in the southern parts of the continent the grand deposit and point of support for the present theatre of the war is open to a combined attack and might   0 be carried with as much certainty as the place which has just surrendered this capture would destroy the last hope which induces the enemy to continue the war for having experienced the impracticability of recovering the populous northern states has determined to confine themselves to the defensive in that quarter and prosecute a most vigorous offensive southward with a view of reconquering states whose sparse population and natural disadvantages render them infinitely less susceptible of defence although their productions render them the most valuable in a commercial view his general naval superiority previous to your excellencys arrival gave him decisive advantages in the rapid transport of his troops and supplies while the immense land marches of our succours too tardive and expensive in every point of view subjected us to be beat in detail it will depend upon your excellency therefore to terminate the war and enable the allies to dictate the law in a treaty a campaign so glorious and so fertile in consequences could be reserved only for the count de grasse it rarely happens that such a combination of means as are in our hands at present can be seasonably obtained by the most strenuous of human exertions a decisively superior fleet the fortune and talents of whose commander overawe all naval force that the most incredible efforts of the enemy have been able to collect an army flushed with success and demanding only to be conducted to new attacks and the very season which is proper for operating against the points in question     if upon entering into the detail of this expedition your excellency should still determine it impracticable there is an object which though subordinate to that above mentioned is of capital importance to our southern operations and may be effected at infinitely less expense i mean the enemys post of wilmington in north carolina circumstances require that i should at this period reinforce the southern army under general greene this reinforcement transported by sea under your convoy would enable us to carry the post in question with very little difficulty and would wrest from the british a point of support in north carolina which is attended with the most dangerous consequences to us and liberate another state this object would require nothing more than the convoy of your excellency to the point of operation and the protection of the debarkation i entreat your excellencys attention to the points which i have the honor of laying before you and that you will be pleased at the same time to inform me what are your dispositions for a maritime force to be left on the american station i have the honor to be c      george washington    october      david ross to david ross head quarters    october      sir in answer to your queries of yesterday the negroes that have been retaken from whatever state whose owners do not appear should all be treated in the same manner and sent into the country to work for their victuals and cloathes and advertised in the states they came from those from n york are most probably the property of inhabitants of that state and n jersey and should be there advertised if any officers knowing who the owners are will undertake to send them home they may be delivered     to them the other steps taken by you are proper and expedient the negroes may be furnished with two days provisions to carry them to williamsburg where there is a state commissary i am c george washington    october      york to the president of congress headquarters near york    october      sir i do myself the honor to enclose to your excellency copies of returns of prisoners artillery arms ordnance and other stores surrendered by the enemy in their posts of york and gloucester on the   th instant which were not completed at the time of my last despatches and but this moment handed to me a draft of these posts with the plan of attack and defence is also transmitted and twentyfour standards taken at the same time are ready to be laid before congress our operations against the enemy in this state being concluded it becomes my duty to inform congress of the disposition i have made for the future destination of the troops under my command the pennsylvania maryland and virginia continental troops are ordered as a reinforcement to the army under the command of general greene i shall myself with the troops of the states to the northward of pennsylvania return to my former position on the north river and the communications with it the first mentioned division composing a body of two     thousand men under the direction of major general the marquis de lafayette will on their way to south carolina make an expedition against the enemys posts at wilmington in north carolina to effect which purpose they will be transported to a proper point of debarkation under convoy of the count de grasse who encourages me if circumstances and situation of the water will admit to give them his coöperation so long as it shall be necessary to accomplish by a coup de main their object at wilmington immediately upon the reduction of that post the troops will proceed to join general greene that i may not from the above arrangement incur the censure of congress or the states who may have flattered their expectations with a prospect of my pushing my operations further southward than this state in justice to my own endeavors and for the satisfaction of congress i find myself obliged to transmit to your excellency a summary of the reasons which have induced my determinations in doing which i take the liberty to submit to congress copies of two propositions which i have had the honor to make to the count de grasse with his answers to each the first which was made immediately on my arrival at williamsburg and is dated the   th of september will show that other objects than the reduction of the british force under the command of lord cornwallis were early in my contemplation and will also declare what were at that time the sentiments of the french admiral the second proposition made after the surrender of the     british army will evince with how much reluctance i could bring myself to relinquish a further prosecution of favorite views in addition to these communications congress will scarcely need to be informed that having no means of water conveyance the transportation by land of the army with their baggage artillery ordance stores and other apparatus necessary for the siege of charleston if not utterly impracticable would be attended with such immense trouble expense and delay as would exclusive of the necessity of naval coöperation be sufficient to deter me from the undertaking especially as the enemy after regaining the naval superiority on this coast could reinforce or withdraw the garrison at pleasure the prosecution therefore of the southern war upon that broad scale which i had wished being as i judge to be relinquished nothing remained in my opinion more eligible than to reinforce general greenes army to such a state of respectability as that he might be able to command the country of south carolina and at the same time if possible by that reinforcement to effect an accomplishment of the smaller object mentioned and to march myself with the remainder of the army to north river where they will be ready at the ensuing campaign to commence such operations against new york as may be hereafter concerted or to effect any other purposes that may be judged practicable add to these reasons the count de rochambeau from the exhausted state of his stores and other considerations seemed inclined to take his resolution to remain in this     state with his troops for the winter at any rate six weeks to refresh them upon a full consideration of the reasons offered i flatter myself that my conduct will stand approved in the judgment of congress whose approbation i shall ever be solicitous to obtain i enclose also for the observation of congress a copy of my letter to the ministers of the united states at the courts of europe conveying to them the intelligence of our success against the enemy in this state the reasons for my conduct as stated in that letter i must rely upon as my justification with congress for the liberty taken in that communication unacquainted with the state of politics between congress and the courts of europe respecting future negotiations whatever our prospects from that quarter may be i cannot justify myself to my own mind without urging congress in the warmest terms to make every arrangement that may be found necessary for an early and efficacious campaign the ensuing year arguments i flatter myself need not be adduced to impress on congress the high importance of this idea whatever may be the events of the coming winter or ensuing summer an effectual and early preparation for military operations will put us upon the most respectable footing either for war or negotiation while a relaxation will place us in a disreputable situation in point of peaceful prospects and will certainly expose us to the most disgraceful disasters in case of a continuance of the hostile disposition of our enemies i do myself the pleasure     to acknowledge the receipt of your excellencys several letters of the  0th   th and   th insts and thank you for the intelligence communicated in them nothing is yet heard of admiral digby with his fleet near these coasts whatever may be his intentions count de grasse i believe is ready to meet him i have the honor to be c p s october   th at the moment of closing my despatch i am favored with the definitive determination of the count de grasse respecting the troops i hoped to have transported to wilmington by water the admirals ideas are communicated in his letter to the marquis de lafayette a copy of which is herewith transmitted  in consequence of this resolution and having no transports i am obliged to send on the troops destined for the southern district by land they will commence their march in a few days under the command of majorgeneral st clair the command of the expedition against wilmington had been committed to the marquis upon the contingency of the troops being transported     by water on failure of this event the marquis does not proceed with the reinforcement my present despatches being important i have committed to the care of colonel humphreys one of my aidsdecamp whom for his attention fidelity and good services i beg leave to recommend to the notice of congress and your excellency  george washington    october      count de grasse to the count de grasse headquarters    october      sir your excellency did me the honor to mention in one of your letters and subsequently in the note transmitted by the marquis de lafayette that from a desire to serve the united states your excellency would enter into engagements for such coöperations the next campaign as should not be incompatible with the orders of your court this offer is too essential to the interests of the common cause not to be embraced by me with the greatest eagerness while     it claims my warmest acknowledgments for the continuance of your friendly disposition towards america as it is impossible at this distance of time to determine whether it will be most advantageous for the allies to open the campaign with the siege of new york and thence proceed to that of charleston or make charleston the leading operation i take the liberty of proposing to your excellency the following general disposition as equally applicable to either namely that your excellency would assemble a decisive naval superiority in the bay of chesapeake toward the end of may from which central position we might easily transport ourselves for a reunion of our means against whichever of the maritime points above mentioned circumstances should render it most advisable to attack first with your excellency i need not insist either upon the indispensable necessity of a maritime force capable of giving you an absolute ascendency in these seas nor enlarge upon the advantages which must be derived from anticipating the british in opening the campaign next to the immediate prosecution of our present successes with the union of superior means now in our power and which would infallibly terminate the war at one stroke the plan which i have the honor to submit to your excellency is that which appears to me most likely to accomplish the great objects of the alliance your excellency will have observed that whatever efforts are made by the land armies the navy must have the casting vote in the present contest the court of france are convinced of it and have declared  00 their resolution to give this indispensable succor the triumphant manner in which your excellency has maintained the mastery of the american seas and the glory of the french flag lead both nations to look to you as the arbiter of the war public and private motives make me most ardently wish that the next campaign may be calculated to crown all your former victories i entreat your excellency to be persuaded of my attachment to your glory and of the sincere friendship with which i shall invariably continue my dear general c  george washington   th october      virginia majorgeneral st clair to majorgeneral st clair instructions sir the detachment of which you will have the command for the southward is to consist of the pensylvania maryland and virginia continental troops you will march them by the most convenient rout and in the most expeditious manner without fatiguing the troops towards wilmington in north carolina or other posts in that state of which you will endeavor to dispossess  0  the enemy if their situation from the intelligence you shall receive as you advance shall in your judgement render it practicable and advisable if it does not you will continue your march to the southern army and put yourself under the command of majrgenl greene as wilmington and other places in no ca may cease to be objects from a change of circumstances in the states to the southward of this it will be necessary for you to open an immediate communication by letter with general greene and govern yourself by his advice and orders and it may be well to communicate in confidence to the executive of the state of north carolina the enterprise against wilmington that you may procure such information and aid as it may be in their power to give for ordnance and stores and for the means of transportation and other matters in the quarter masters department you will consult general knox and colonel pickering and will make your arrangements with the commissary or state agent for supplies of provision given at headquarters near york in virginia this   th day of october      p s if there are any men upon detachment they are to be called in and marched with their regiments a sufficient number of officers must be left to carry on the sick and invalids as fast as they recover some good fieldofficers should remain to superintend this business  0  george washington   th october      majorgeneral lincoln to majorgeneral lincoln instructions sir all the troops who are about to return to the northward will be under your command and i entreat you to use every means in your power to hasten them forward by land or water or partly by both as circumstances may require the ordnance and stores of every kind must be despatched or in such train for it as to need no further cover or aid from the troops ere they can move from their prest encampment the ordnance vessels and vessels carrying stores of every other kind should receive of sick invalids and weak men as many as they can transport with safety and convenience after which if there is not water transportation for the remainder they must be marched by land on the rout the cavalry teams c came from the head of elk to this place for the reputation of the troops and preservation of property you will use your utmost exertions to prevent every species of abuse on the march destruction of fences is too often among the wanton injuries which are committed a few axes and strict attention of the officers will infallibly prevent this and i trust it will be done you will be able after informing yourself of the extent of the water transportation to determine on the number of men which must march by land and make your arrangements with the quartermastergeneral accordingly if there are any men upon detachment they are to be called in and marched with their regiments a sufficient number of officers must be left to carry on the sick and invalids as fast as they recover some good fieldofficer should remain to superintend this business given at headquarters this   th day of october        0  george washington    october      york to the president of congress headquarters near york    october      sir i do myself the honor of transmitting to your excellency a letter from general duportail in which he explains the motives of an intended application to congress for permission to go to france and for the promotion of himself and other officers of his corps i should conceal sentiments with which i am very strongly impressed and do injustice to very conspicuous merit if i did not upon the present occasion offer my testimony to the distinguished abilities and services both of general duportail and colonel gouvion their claim to the particular attention of congress at this juncture is founded upon the practice of europe sieges being considered as the particular province of the corps of engineers and as entitling them when attended with a success important in itself and its consequences to the great military rewards these officers besides are supported by a series of conduct in the line of their department which makes them not depend merely upon the present circumstances for these reasons i am induced to recommend general duportails memorial to congress for the promotions which he specifies and the leave of absence  0  the latter being by no means incompatible with the good of the service at the present period as i am reduced notwithstanding all my efforts to the necessity of retiring into winterquarters the same principles as those above mentioned forbid me to be silent on the subject of general knox who is closely united with general duportail in the merit of the siege being at the head of the artillery which is the other principal instrument in conducting attacks the resources of his genius have supplied on this and many other interesting occasions the defect of means his distinguished talents and services equally important and indefatigable entitle him to the same marks of the approbation of congress that they may be pleased to grant to the chief engineer i am c   0  george washington    november      virginia marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette mount vernon virginia    november      not till the  th instant my dear marquis was i able to leave york engaged in providing for the detachment that was to go southerly embarking the troops that were to go northerly making a distribution of the ordnance and stores for various purposes and disposing of the officers and other  0  prisoners to their respective places of destination i could not leave that part of ye country sooner on that day i arrived at eltham the seat of colonel bassett time enough to see poor mr custis breathe his last  this unexpected and affecting event threw mrs washington and mrs custis who were both present into such deep distress that the circumstance of it and a duty i owed the deceased in assisting at his funeral rites prevented my reaching this place till the   th and business here and on the road will put it out of my power to arrive at philadelphia before the last days of the prest month as this may extend to a later period than your business in that city may require i owe it to friendship and to my affectionate regard for you my dear marqs not to let you leave this country without carrying with you fresh marks of my attachment to you and new expressions of the high sense i entertain of your military conduct and other important services in the course of the last campaign altho the latter are too well known to need the testimony of my approbation and the former i persuade myself you believe is too well riveted to undergo diminution or change as you expressed a desire to know my sentiments respecting the operations of the next campaign before your departure for france i will without a tedious display of reasoning declare in one word that the advantages of it to america and the honor and glory of it to the allied arms in these states must depend absolutely upon the naval force which is employed  0  in these seas and the time of its appearance next year no land force can act decisively unless it is accompanied by a maritime superiority nor can more than negative advantages be expected without it for proof of this we have only to recur to the instances of the ease and facility with which the british shifted their ground as advantages were to be obtained at either extremity of the continent and to their late heavy loss the moment they failed in their naval superiority to point out the further advantages which might have been obtained in the course of this year if count de grasse could have waited and would have covered a further operation to the southward is unnecessary because a doubt did not exist nor does at this moment in any mans mind of the total extirpation of the british force in the carolinas and georgia if he could have extended his coöperation two months longer it follows then as certain as that night succeeds the day that without a decisive naval force we can do nothing definitive and with it every thing honorable and glorious a constant naval superiority would terminate the war speedily without it i do not know that it will ever be terminated honorably if this force should appear early we shall have the whole campaign before us the months of june to september inclusive are well adapted for operating in any of the states to the northward of this and the remaining months are equally well suited to those south of it in which time with such means i think much i will add every thing might be expected  0  how far the policy of congress may carry them towards filling their continental battalions does not lay with me to determine this measure before and since the capitulation has been strongly recommended by me should it be adopted by that body and executed with energy in the several states i think our force comprehending the auxiliary troops now here will be fully competent to all the purposes of the american war provided the british force on this continent remains nearly as it now is but as this is a contingency which depends very much upon political manœuvres in europe and as it is uncertain how far we may be in a state of preparation at the opening of the next campaign the propriety of augmenting the present army under the comd of count de rochambeau is a question worthy of consideration but as it lyes with congress to determine i shall be silent on the subject  if i should be deprived of the pleasure of a personal interview with you before your departure permit me my dear marquis to adopt this method of making you a tender of my ardent vows for a propitious  0  voyage a gracious reception from your prince an honorable reward of your services a happy meeting with your lady and friends and a safe return in the spring to my dear marqs your affectionate friend c p s i beg you to present my best respects to the viscount de noailles and let him know that my warmest wishes attend him george washington    november      to the president of congress mount vernon    november      sir i have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the   st ultimo covering the resolutions of congress of   th and a proclamation for a day of public prayer and thanksgiving and have to thank you sir most sincerely for the very polite and affectionate manner in which these enclosures have been conveyed the success of the combined armies against our enemies at york and gloucester as it affects the welfare and independence of the united states i viewed as a most fortunate event in performing my part towards its accomplishment i consider myself to have done only my duty and in the execution of that i ever feel myself happy and at the same time as it augurs well to our cause i take a particular pleasure in acknowledging that the interposing hand of heaven in the various instances of our extensive preparations for this operation has been most conspicuous and remarkable   0 after the receipt of your favor i received official information through the secretary of congress of the new choice of their president while i congratulate you sir on a release from the fatigues and troubles of so arduous and important a task i beg you to accept my sincerest thanks for the pleasure and satisfaction which i have received in the correspondence with which you have honored me and the many interesting communications of intelligence with which you have favored me i am dear sir c  george washington    november      benjamin dulany to benjamin dulany mount vernon    november      sir i learn from mr lund washington that the land formerly belonging to mr manley  is again about to be offered for sale and that you and i are like to be the only competitors in the purchase of it that i often treated with mr manley in his lifetime and since his death with his executors for that tract is a fact which cannot be unknown to you equally true is it that if the land is exposed to public sale i shall bid for it as far as i think it is worth but no farther and as men set different values upon the same thing according to the lights in which it strikes them and their own mode of estimating its value it is not     at all unlikely but that you may be the purchaser in the present case however i ever was and still am willing to give the full value of the land and as a proof of it should have no objection to the price being fixed by three honest and judicious men to be indifferently chosen this i woud give having premised this thing the intention of this letter is to make you a proposition and explain my motives for it which if acceded to may smooth every difficulty and prove convenient and beneficial to all parties it is to purchase the reversion of your land in this neck at the same time i make that of mr manleys if it is for sale you are doubtless well acquainted with the circumstance of this tract held by mrs french but as no man can have a more perfect knowledge of it than i have i think myself fully warranted in asserting that in less than ten years from this date there will be no support to the plantation and that without the aid of my woodland it cannot be maintained if my reasons are asked i will add that to say nothing of the plantation itself great part of which is old and much worn the present fencing cannot last long that one half of the plantation at this moment is dependent upon me for the means of enclosing it that though i have not a disposition to be unneighborly by depriving mrs french or you of the use of my fences yet this may not be the case with those who follow me that the woodland for fire and timber bears no proportion to the quantity of cleared land and as has been observed before will not support     the plantation in these articles but a few years longer especially if all those long lines of fencing which are furnished by me should be shifted as is very commonly the case where fields are changed and that to depend upon the fencing of another for inclosures is working land upon a very uncertain tenure and at too great a hazard to be warranted by prudence as illnature or even necessity may expose the crops that these are facts uncontrovertible and the reasoning upon them conclusive none can deny i mention them to prove first that at the same time i discover an inclination to purchase the reversion of your land i know what value to set on it and secondly as an indisputable evidence that sooner or later if you cannot get some of my woodland you will for want of timber and firing be obliged to part with it to those who have it and that this must be done to a very great disadvantage when the period of that necessity is absolutely felt and the land is more exhausted is evident to common sense it may be asked why under these disadvantages i would choose to be the purchaser the answer is plain and i shall candidly give it to you for besides having timber to supply all the wants of your land it is my wish altho it shoud not fall into my hands immediately to have in expectation by reversion all the lands in this neck that i may without loss of time proceed to the enclosing of it by a large ditch and strong post rail fence on the outer boundary of it this sir and the prospect of having the exclusive possession of the whole neck i declare to you     upon my honor are my motives for buying it is not the real want of land for i have already more than i have hands to work nor the extraordinary value of this tract that prompts me to the measure from a full conviction that i cannot in the course of nature remain long upon this theater i have a desire to see such things as are within my reach accomplished as soon as possible on this principle it is i shall go as far to purchase mr manleys land as i can conceive it is worth if the prospect of long life was before me and i had a mind to play the politician it would be my interest to let mr manleys land fall into your hands without a single bid for it on my part because having a scarcity of fencing yourself and his land i believe not a stick of timber upon it it would so much increase the demand upon the little you have as to involve at an earlier period the consequence i have foretold having dealt thus freely and frankly in describing the true situation and circumstances of these lands and my motives to purchase them i shall conclude with repeating that i will take the land of mr manley at the price any three honest and judicious men indifferently chosen shall fix upon it that i will do the same thing with respect to yours if you incline to sell or if you will fix the price yourself having a just regard to the quality and circumstances of the land i will give it without haggling an allowance being made by men of judgment conversant in these things for mrs frenchs life if she chooses to hold it     i shall offer no apology for making you these proposals my meaning is good and my offers are generous they will stand the test of examination and it is my wish that all the parties concerned vizt mrs dulany mrs french and mr triplet executor of mr manley may be consulted if my proposals and observations are good they will be struck with the force of them if they are not my mistake arises from viewing things in a wrong point of view i persuade myself that there is too much liberality in your way of thinking to suppose that because i have frankly declared my motives for making these proposals and have made generous offers towards purchasing your land that i shall set no bounds to my prices in order to obtain it i as frankly declare that this is not my intention i will give the full value but no more the whole tenor of my conduct hitherto in this business must have evinced this and will more than probably convince mr barry or rather mr wren his oracle who was ever afraid to accept the price that was offered for his land lest more could be had—of the folly and impolicy of a narrow way of thinking and give him cause if i should withhold the same offer in future to accompany it with repentance i am c      george washington    november      annapolis george plater thomas cockey dey to george plater president of the senate and thomas cockey dey speaker of the house of delegates of maryland annapolis    november      gentlemen i very sensibly feel the honor which has this day been conferred upon me by the vote of thanks of so respectable a body as that of the general assembly of the state of maryland the regard which they have been pleased to express for me personally the delicate manner in which they have recalled to view those distant events which in some degree led to our present happy situation and the general approbation which they have generously bestowed upon the whole of my conduct must ever secure to them my warmest esteem and must at the same time operate as fresh incentives to merit their future good opinion it is with the highest degree of pleasure i observe that a proper allowance has been made for the capital share which the land and sea forces of our great and good ally had in the reduction of the common enemy at york in virginia i should deem myself unpardonable were i not upon every occasion more especially upon such a one as the present to declare that to the sound counsels and vigorous exertions of their excellencies count de rochambeau and count de grasse much very much was owing while i agree in sentiment with the honorable bodies over which you preside that we may entertain a rational ground of belief that under the favor of divine providence the freedom independence and happiness of america will shortly be established upon the surest foundation i think it a duty incumbent upon me to observe that those most desirable objects are not to be fully attained but by a continuance of those exertions which have already so greatly humbled the power of our inveterate enemies relaxation upon our part will give them time to recollect and recover themselves whereas a vigorous prosecution of the war must inevitably crush their remaining force in these states or put them to the necessity of entirely withdrawing themselves     i cannot conclude without expressing my warmest wishes for the prosperity of a state which has ever stood among the foremost in her support of the common cause i confess myself under particular obligations for the ready attention which i have ever experienced to those requisitions which in the course of my duty i have occasionally been under the necessity of making i have the honor to be c  george washington    november      philadelphia governor trumbull to governor trumbull philadelphia    november      dear sir i have the honor to acknowledge your favor of the  th instant and to thank your excellency with great sincerity for the very cordial and affectionate congratulations which you are pleased to express on our late success in virginia i most earnestly hope that this event may be productive of the happy consequences you mention and i think that its good effects cannot fail to be very extensive unless from a mistaken idea of the magnitude of this success unhappily a spirit of remissness should seize the minds of the states and they should     set themselves down in quiet with a delusive hope of the contest being brought to a close i hope this may not be the case to prevent so great an evil shall be my study and endeavor and i cannot but flatter myself that the states rather than relax in their exertions will be stimulated to the most vigorous preparations for another active glorious and decisive campaign which if properly prosecuted will i trust under the smiles of heaven lead us to the end of this long and tedious war and set us down in the full security of the great object of our toils the establishment of peace liberty and independence whatever may be the policy of european courts during this winter their negotiation will prove too precarious a dependence for us to trust to our wisdom should dictate a serious preparation for war and in that state we shall find ourselves in a situation secure against every event        george washington    december      philadelphia james mchenry to james mchenry philadelphia    december      dear sir i have received your favor of the  d inst inclosing your resignation which i have delivered in to the secy at war i am convinced your transition from the military to the civil line will be attended with good consequences as you will be able to communicate that kind of information to the body of which you are now a member which they often stand in need of in times like the present—and as you seem of opinion that my sentiments on public affairs will give weight to your endeavors i with great pleasure open a correspondence on that subject you know it is an old and true maxim that to make a good peace you ought to be well prepared to carry on the war this the sentiment of our ally is not only strongly pressed upon congress by his minister here but by the gentlemen at the heads of our three great departments—finance foreign affairs and war my stay in town is merely to assist in and forward the several arrangements which are upon the carpet and i believe you are sufficiently acquainted with me to suppose that i do not fail to urge vigorous measures i am happy in finding no want of disposition in congress to adopt the measures recommended by their committees and their executive officers—the requisitions which they have made and which they will shortly make upon the states will evince this—it will afterwards lay with the states to determine whether we are early in the next campaign     to take advantage of what we have gained this or whether we are as usual to suffer the enemy to bring their reinforcements from europe before we draw ours from the neighborhood of the army as it were i need not say more to you at this time—indeed i hope you will have no occasion to make use of the hints i have given—for i have the highest opinion of the good will and vigor of your legislature i am c george washington    december      philadelphia majorgeneral greene to majorgeneral greene philadelphia    december      my dear sir i have successively received your favors of the  0th of october and  d and   st of november i thank you for your kind congratulations on an event which is certainly most important considered in a public view and which adds to my personal satisfaction by finding that it in some degree relieves you from that load of difficulty and distress with which you had so long been contending the evacuation of the state of north carolina is another very fortunate circumstance  i presented your recommendation of colonel williams to congress backed by my own the expediency of filling up the vacant brigadierships is among other matters now under consideration and if thought proper at this time there is no doubt of colonel williams being promoted    0 i hope general st clair has before or by this time joined you the enemy have sent no reinforcement from new york to charleston nor do i learn that any preparations are making for such a measure if it should be the opinion that the british force in south carolina is adequate to the maintenance of charleston i should not be surprised if sir henry clinton was to content himself with acting upon the defensive in that quarter at least until the pleasure of the ministry can be known because an additional force sufficient to regain and make establishments in the country is more than can well be spared from new york i am informed the english prints of a late date speak of a reinforcement preparing from thence for carolina and florida and i think it not at all improbable for i fancy lord cornwalliss private despatches after the battle of guilford painted his affairs in no very favorable light i am apprehensive that the states elated by the late success and taking it for granted that great britain will no longer support so losing a contest will relax in their preparations for the next campaign i am detained here by congress to assist in the arrangements for the next year and i shall not fail in conjunction with the financier minister for foreign affairs and secretary of war who are all most heartily well disposed to impress upon congress and get them to impress upon the respective states the necessity of the most vigorous exertions i am sorry that major hyrnes indisposition has prevented the transmission of the lists of prisoners as the commissary     general who is now at elizabethtown negotiating an exchange may find himself at a loss for want of them he is proceeding upon a return which genl moultrie furnished and which i believe was taken from major hyrnes books should it appear that any characters have been omitted it can easily be rectified as we shall have a considerable balance of officers remaining in our hands i really know not what to say on the subject of retaliation congress have it under consideration and we must await their determination of this i am convinced that of all laws it is the most difficult to execute where you have not the transgressor himself in your possession humanity will ever interfere and plead strongly against the sacrifice of an innocent person for the guilt of another and as to destruction of property within the enemys lines it is in fact destroying our own it will be to the eternal disgrace of the nation which drives us to the disagreeable necessity of thinking of means to curb their barbarity  i am with the warmest sentiments of esteem c george washington    december      to the president of congress philadelphia    december      sir i have been honored with the resolve of the  0th instant directing me to make inquiry into the powers and conduct of the board of directors to the associated     loyalists in new york  i shall pursue such steps as will be most likely to promote the ends which congress have in view i have taken the liberty of enclosing the copies of two letters of the   d and   th instant from the commissarygeneral of prisoners setting forth the debt which is due from us on account of naval prisoners the number remaining in captivity their miserable situation and the little probability there is of procuring their release for want of proper subjects in our hands before we proceed to an inquiry into the measures which ought to be adopted to enable us to pay off our debt and to effect the exchange of those who still remain in captivity a matter which it may take up some time to determine humanity and policy point out the necessity of administering to the pressing wants of a number of the most valuable subjects of the republic had they been taken in continental     service i should have thought myself authorized in conjunction with the minister of war to have applied a remedy but as the greater part of them were not thus taken as appears by mr skinners representation i must await the decision of congress upon the subject had a system some time past planned by congress and recommended to the several states been adopted and carried fully into execution i mean that of obliging all captains of private vessels to deliver over their prisoners to the continental commissaries upon certain conditions i am persuaded that the numbers taken and brought into the many ports of the united states would have amounted to a sufficiency to have exchanged those taken from us but instead of that it is to be feared that few in proportion are secured and that the few which are sent in are so partially applied that it creates great disgust in those remaining the consequence of which is that conceiving themselves neglected and seeing no prospect of relief many of them enter into the enemys service to the very great injury of our trading interest congress will therefore i hope see the necessity of renewing their former or making some similar recommendation to the states in addition to the motives above mentioned for wishing that the whole business of prisoners of war might be brought under one general regulation is another of no small consideration which is that it would probably put a stop to those mutual complaints of ill treatment which are frequently urged on either     part for it is a fact that for about two years we have had no reason to complain of the treatment of the continental land prisoners in new york neither have we been charged with any improper conduct towards those in our hands i consider the sufferings of the seamen for some time past as arising in a great measure from the want of that general regulation which has been spoken of and without which there will constantly be a great number remaining in the hands of the enemy i have the honor to be c       george washington   january      philadelphia thomas chittenden to thomas chittenden vermont  philadelphia   january      sir i received your favor of the   th of november by mr brownson you cannot be at a loss to know why i have not heretofore and why i cannot now address you in your public character or answer you in mine but the confidence which you have been pleased to repose in me gives me an opportunity of offering you my sentiments as an individual wishing most ardently to see the peace and union of his country preserved and the just rights of the people of every part of it fully and firmly established it is not my business neither do i think it necessary now to discuss the origin of the right of a number of inhabitants to that tract of country formerly     distinguished by the name of the new hampshire grants and now known by that of vermont i will take it for granted that their right was good because congress by their resolve of the  th of august imply it and by that of the   st are willing fully to confirm it provided the new state is confined to certain described bounds it appears therefore to me that the dispute of boundary is the only one which exists and that this being removed all further difficulties would be removed also and the matter terminated to the satisfaction of all parties now i would ask you candidly whether the claim of the people of vermont was not for a long time confined solely or very nearly to that tract of country which is described in the resolve of congress of the   st of august last and whether agreeably to the tenor of your own letter to me the late extension of your claim upon new hampshire and new york was not more of a political manœuvre than one in which you conceived yourselves justifiable if my first question be answered in the affirmative it certainly bars your new claim and if my second be well founded your end is answered and you have nothing to do but withdraw your jurisdiction to your old limits and obtain an acknowledgment of independence and sovereignty under the resolve of the   st of august for so much territory as does not interfere with the ancient established bounds of new york new hampshire and massachusetts i persuade myself you will see and acquiesce in the reason the justice and indeed the necessity of such a decision     you must consider sir that the point now in dispute is of the utmost political importance to the future union and peace of this great country the state of vermont if acknowledged will be the first new one admitted into the confederacy and if suffered to encroach upon the ancient established boundaries of the adjacent ones will serve as a precedent for others which it may hereafter be expedient to set off to make the same unjustifiable demands thus in my private opinion while it behoves the delegates of the states now confederated to do ample justice to a body of people sufficiently respectable by their numbers and entitled by other claims to be admitted into that confederation it becomes them also to attend to the interests of their constituents and see that under the appearance of justice to one they do not materially injure the rights of others i am apt to think this is the prevailing opinion of congress and that your late extension of claim has upon the principles i have above mentioned rather diminished than increased the number of your friends and that if such extension should be persisted in it will be made a common cause and not considered as only affecting the rights of the states immediately interested in the loss of territory a loss of too serious a nature not to claim the attention of any people there is no calamity within the compass of my foresight which is more to be dreaded than a necessity of coercion on the part of congress and consequently every endeavor should be used to prevent the     execution of so disagreeable a measure it must involve the ruin of that state against which the resentment of the others is pointed  i will only add a few words upon the subject of the negotiations which have been carried on between you and the enemy in canada and in new york i will take it for granted as you assert it that they were so far innocent that there never was any serious intention of joining great britain in their attempts to subjugate your country but it has had this certain bad tendency it has served to give some ground to that delusive opinion of the enemy upon which they in a great measure found their hopes of success that they have numerous friends among us who only want a proper opportunity to show themselves openly and that internal disputes and feuds will soon break us in pieces at the same time the seeds of distrust and jealousy are scattered among ourselves by a conduct of this kind if you are sincere in your professions these will be additional motives for accepting the terms which have been offered and which appear to me equitable and thereby convincing the common enemy that all their expectations of disunion are     vain and that they have been worsted in the use of their own weapon—deception  as you unbosomed yourself to me i thought i had the greater right of speaking my sentiments openly and candidly to you i have done so and if they should produce the effects which i most sincerely wish that of an honorable and amicable adjustment of a matter which if carried to hostile lengths may destroy the future happiness of my country i shall have attained my end while the enemy will be defeated in theirs believe me to be with great respect sir c  george washington   january      philadelphia marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette at paris philadelphia   january      my dear marqs i cannot suffer colonel gimat to leave this city for france without a remembrance from me to you i have remained at this place ever since you left it and am happy in having discovered the best disposition imaginable in congress to prepare vigorously for     another campaign they have resolved to keep up the same number of corps as constituted the army of last year and have urged the states warmly to compleat them requisitions of money are also made but how far the abilities and inclinations of the states individual to tax heavily to coincide with the views of congress is more than i am able at this early period to inform you a further pecuniary aid from your generous nation and a decisive naval force upon this coast in the latter end of may or beginning of june unlimited in its stay and operations would unless the resources of great britain are inexhaustible or she can form powerful alliances bid fair to finish the war in the course of next campaign with the ruin of that people the first that is an aid of money would enable our financier to support the expenses of the war with ease and credit without anticipating or deranging those funds which congress are endeavoring to establish and which will be productive though they may be slow in the establishment the second a naval superiority would compel the enemy to draw their whole force to a point which would not only disgrace their arms by the relinquishmt of posts and the states which they affect to have conquerd but might eventually be fatal to their army or by attempting   0 to hold these posts might be cut off in detail so that in either case the most important good consequences would result from the measure general lincoln has accepted his appointment of secretary at war proper plans of œconomy are adopting in every department and i do not despair of seeing ere long our affairs under much better management than they have been which will open a new field productive it is to be hoped of a fruitful harvest as you will have received in a more direct channel than from hence the news of the surprise and recapture of st eustatia by the arms of france i shall only congratulate you on the event and add that it marks in a striking point of view the genius of the marquis de boullie for enterprise and for intrepidity and resources in difficult circumstances his conduct upon this occasion does him infinite honor i shall be impatient to hear of your safe arrival in france and to receive such communications as you know will be interesting to the cause we espouse and in which we are actors though unknown to madame lafayette i beg you to present me to her as one of her greatest admirers be so good also as to make a tender of my best wishes to duke de lauzun and other gentlemen of the army of count de rochambeau who may be in the circle of your friends and with whom i have the honor of an acquaintance with sentiments of purest affection and most perfect regard i am my dear marquis your assured friend c     p s—jany  th since writing the foregoing i have had the letter and resolves herewith sent put into my hands by the delegates of virginia in congress i have a peculiar pleasure in becoming the channel through which the just and grateful plaudits of my native state are communicated to the man i love by advices just received from south carolina the enemy have evacuated all their posts in that state and have concentred their whole force in charlestown wilmington is also evacuated and north carolina is freed from its enemys the disaffected part of the state are suing for mercy and executing it is said some of their own leaders for having misguided them george washington    january      philadelphia christian febiger to colonel christian febiger philadelphia    january      sir i was much surprised on receiving a letter from genl st clair dated at taylors ferry on the   th of november to find that instead of being joined by a detachment of the virginia line he had received a letter from you inclosing a representation from the officers assembled at cumberland court amounting to a positive refusal to march except certain terms were complied with by the state —the impropriety of such conduct to give it no harsher name is so glaring that i am in hopes the gentlemen will upon     cool reflection condemn it themselves—what can they expect from their soldiers when they themselves strike at the root of authority and discipline that they have reason to complain in common with their brethren of the hardship they have endured and the difficulties they labor under for want of their pay i am ready to allow but they are mistaken if they think they are the only sufferers there are corps in the army belonging to no particular states the officers and men of which have derived no assistance from any quarter—some states may have done more than others for their troops but of this i am confident that all are yet much in arrears in fact as the principal satisfaction that has been made has been a liquidation of accounts and certificates granted for the amount due there is one reason urged in the representation which i am sorry to see given by officers and those too of my own country that they look upon our independence as established and that therefore their quitting the service can be no public disadvantage do they think the remaining force of the enemy is to be crushed by words or blows i should suppose by the former or they would never have started an idea not only ridiculous but of dangerous tendency while i think it my duty severely to censure the conduct alluded to i think i am bound to endeavor to obtain reasonable redress i have for that purpose written to his excellency the governor and have requested him to use every exertion so to provide for and equip the detachment which is ready that     both officers and men may be enabled to go upon service with some tolerable degree of comfort this i hope he will do—after which i expect and insist in the most positive manner that the detachment shall march the officers must and do very well know that it is not in the power of the state to pay them up in good money if therefore they continue to make that a plea i shall take it for granted that disinclination to the service upon which they are going is the real motive—i shall be very anxious to hear from you on this subject—for you must suppose my feelings are particularly wounded on the occasion when asked whether any and what reinforcements have marched from virginia i shall blush when i say none and more so when i assign the cause i am c george washington    january      philadelphia circular letter to the states philadelphia    january      sir although it may be somewhat out of my province to address your excellency on a subject not immediately of a military nature yet i consider it so nearly connected with and so essential to the operations under my direction that i flatter myself my interference will not be deemed impertinent upon applying to the superintendent of finance to know how far i might depend upon him for the pay feeding and clothing of the army for the current year and for the sums necessary to put it and keep it in motion he very candidly laid open to me the state of our moneyed affairs and convinced me that although the assistances we had derived from abroad were considerable yet they would be by no means adequate to our expenses he informed me further that to make up this deficiency the states had been called upon by congress for eight millions of dollars     for the service of the year      and shewed me the copy of a circular letter from himself to the several legislatures in which he had so fully and clearly pointed out the necessity of a compliance with the requisitions that it is needless for me to say more on that head than that i entirely concur with him in opinion so far as he has gone into the matter but there are other reasons which could not be so well known to him as they are to me as having come under my immediate observation and which therefore i shall take the liberty to mention your excellency cannot but remember the ferment into which the whole army was thrown twelve months ago for the want of pay and a regular supply of clothing and provisions and with how much difficulty they were brought into temper by a partial supply of the two first and a promise of more regular supplies of all in future those promises the soldiery now begin to claim and although we shall be able to satisfy them tolerably in respect to clothing and perfectly in regard to provisions if the financier is enabled to comply with his contracts yet there is no prospect of obtaining pay until part of the money required of the states can be brought into the treasury you cannot conceive the uneasiness which arises from the total want of so essential an article as money and the real difficulties in which the officers in particular are involved on that account the favorable aspect of our affairs and the hopes that matters are in a train to afford them relief contribute to keep them quiet but i cannot answer for the effects of a disappointment enabling the financier to comply with his contracts is a matter of the utmost consequence—the very existence of the army depends upon it should he fail in his payments the contract ceases and there is no alternative left but to disband or live upon the seizure of the neighboring property the saving to the public by feeding an army by contract is too well known to need any illustration and that alone ought to be sufficient inducement to the states to find the means of adhering to it it will perhaps be urged that the sum called for is immense and beyond the ability of the country to pay there is one plain answer to that objection should it be made—it is that if the war is carried on a certain expense must be incurred and that such expense must be drawn from the people either by a     partial cruel and i may say illegal seizure of that property which lays most convenient to the army or by a regular and equitable tax in money or specific articles money if it can be procured is to be preferred because it is neither liable to waste nor is it expensive in the mode of collection or transportation whereas i think i may venture to say that a great proportion of the specific articles have been wasted after the people have furnished them and that the transportation alone of what have reached the army has in numberless instances cost more than the value of the articles themselves to bring this war to a speedy and happy conclusion must be the fervent wish of every lover of his country and sure i am that no means are so likely to effect these as vigorous preparations for another campaign whether then we consult our true interest substantial economy or sound policy we shall find that relaxation and languor are of all things to be avoided conduct of that kind on our part will produce fresh hopes and new exertions on that of the enemy whereby the war which has already held beyond the general expectation may be protracted to such a length that the people groaning under the burthen of it and despairing of success may think any change a change to the better i will close with a request that your excellency will be good enough to take the first opportunity of laying these my sentiments before the legislature of your state from the attention they have ever been pleased to pay to any former requisitions or representations of mine i am encouraged to hope that the present which is equally important with any i have ever made will meet with a favorable reception i have the honor to be with the greatest respect your excellencys most obedient and humble servant p s the return of troops called for by resolve of the  0th of december is collecting and will be forwarded very soon the remote situation of some of the corps has made it a tedious business but such is the nature of it that an accurate return cannot be digested until the returns of all the legionary corps and those of artillery are obtained that credit may be given for the men serving in them     george washington    january      philadelphia circular letter to states  head quarters philadelphia    january      sir— i have the honor to transmit herewith returns of the number of men now actually in service from your state in order that measures may be adopted for completing the regiments to the full establishment agreeably to the resolution of congress of the  0th of december i cannot omit so favorable an opportunity of expressing to you my sentiments on this subject and of entreating in the most earnest manner that there may be a speedy pointed and effectual compliance with those requisitions it will i flatter myself be unnecessary to recapitulate all the arguments i made use of in the circular letter i had the honor to address to the several states at the close of the campaign of    0 in which it must be remembered i took the liberty to urge from the knowledge i had of our affairs and a series of experience the policy the expediency the necessity of recruiting the army as the only probable means of bringing the war to a speedy and happy conclusion—if these arguments had any influence at that time—if the consequent exertions were crowned with any success—if the present crisis exhibits new and more forcible inducements for still greater efforts let me point you and your legislature to these considerations and especially let me recommend in the warmest terms that all the fruits of the successes which have been obtained the last campaign may not be thrown away by an inglorious winter of languor and inactivity however at this advanced stage of the war it might seem to be an insult upon the understanding to suppose a long train of reasoning necessary to prove that a respectable force in the field is essential to the establishment of our liberties and independence yet as i am apprehensive the prosperous issue of the combined operation in virginia may have as is too common in such cases the pernicious tendency of lulling the country into a lethargy of inactivity and security and as i feel my own reputation as well as     the interest the honor the glory and the happiness of my country intimately concerned in the event i will ask the indulgence to speak the more freely on those accounts and to make some of those observations which the present moment seems to suggest—that the broken and perplexed state of the enemys affairs and the successes of the last campaign on our part ought to be a powerful incitement to vigorous preparations for the next—that unless we strenuously exert ourselves to profit by these successes we shall not only lose all the solid advantages that might be derived from them but we shall become contemptible in our own eyes in the eyes of our enemy in the opinion of posterity and even in the estimation of the whole world which will consider us as a nation unworthy of prosperity because we know not how to make a right use of it—that although we cannot by the best concerted plans absolutely command success although the race is not always to the swift or the battle to the strong yet without presumptuously waiting for miracles to be wrought in our favor it is our indispensable duty with the deepest gratitude to heaven for the past and humble confidence in its smiles on our future operations to make use of all the means in our power for our defence and security—that this period is particularly important because no circumstances since the commencement of the war have been so favorable to the recruiting service and because it is to be presumed from the increase of population and the brilliant prospects before us it is actually in our power to complete the army before the opening of the campaign—that however flattering the prospects may be much still remains to be done which cannot probably be effected unless the army is recruited to its establishment and consequently the continuance or termination of the war seems principally to rest on the vigor and decision of the states in this interesting point and finally that it is our first object of policy under every supposible or possible case to have a powerful army early in the field for we must suppose the enemy are either disposed to prosecute the war or to enter into a negociation for peace—there is no other alternative on the former supposition a respectable army becomes necessary to counteract the enemy and to prevent the accumulating expences of a lingering     war on the latter nothing but a decidedly superior force can enable us boldly to claim our rights and dictate the law at the pacification—so that whatever the disposition of the enemy may be it is evidently our only interest and economy to act liberally and exert ourselves greatly during the present winter to cut off at once all the expences of the war by putting a period to it and soon might that day arrive soon might we hope to enjoy all the blessings of peace if we could see again the same animation in the cause of our country inspire every breast the same passion for freedom and military glory impel our youths to the field and the same disinterested patriotism pervade every rank of men as was conspicuous at the commencement of this glorious revolution and i am persuaded only some great occasion was wanting such as the present moment exhibits to rekindle the latent sparks of that patriotic fire into a generous flame to rouse again the unconquerable spirit of liberty which has sometimes seemed to slumber for a while into the full vigor of action i cannot now conclude this letter without expressing my full expectation that the several states animated with the noblest principles and convinced of the policy of complying faithfully with the requisitions will be only emulous which shall be foremost in furnishing its quota of men that the calculation of the numbers wanted to fill the deficiency may be so ample as allowing for the casualties and deductions will be sufficient certainly to complete the battalions that the measures for this purpose may be so explicit pointed and energetic as will inevitably furnish the recruits in season and that such checks may be established to prevent imposition as to the quality of the men that no recruits may be accepted but those who are in fact ablebodied and effective should any of a different description be sent to the army they must be rejected the expences thrown away and the service injured though others are required to supply their places for it is only deceiving ourselves with having a nominal instead of a real force and consuming the public provisions and clothing to no effect by attempting to impose decrepit and improper men or boys upon us as soldiers the returns before alluded to being but this moment collected i regret that it was not possible they should have been     forwarded sooner to prevent a miscarriage or delay in so important a communication i have committed them to — who will have the honor of delivering these despatches and explaining my ideas very perfectly as he is charged solely with this business he will return as soon as it is negociated but he is instructed to wait until he can bear such official accounts from you to me as will fully inform me what aid may absolutely be relied upon from your state which in conjunction with the other reports of a similar nature must serve as a basis on which we may build our final plans and arrangements for the ensuing campaign  i have the honour to be c george washington   february      philadelphia majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler philadelphia   february      dear sir i have received your favor of the   st of jany enclosing the copy of your letter of the    of octr to majorgeneral stark which agreeably to your desire i return by this conveyance—the arguments and reflections respecting the dispute of the vermontese made use of in that letter appear so just as well as political as to be particularly calculated to heal the unhappy disturbances and produce a reconciliation this is one of the many proofs you have given of your ardent desire to put a period to internal contention and unite all the separate and jarring interests in prosecuting the great common cause of america i have shewed yours of the   st ulto to and conferrd with the minister of foreign affairs—my sentiments   0 in general respecting the necessity of perfect unanimity among ourselves in order to give energy  decision to our collective efforts against the enemy are too well known to be insisted upon for i have had frequent occasion to repeat that it was my most fervent wish that all grounds of jealousy and dispute between any districts of the inhabitants of the united states which were at variance might be removed by an amicable adjustment of their differences and that in my opinion moderate measures so long as they can be adopted with propriety are much more likely than violent ones to produce such a salutary effect—if therefore my public advice in my late circular letter or my private opinion which has been given without reserve on every occasion can be of any avail i am confident the consideration of all other matters would be swallowed up in or made subservient to the general good of the whole—but as it has ever been a point of delicacy with me while acting only in a military character not to interfere in the civil concerns of the continent or the legislatures except where they are intimately connected with military matters i should not think myself at liberty without deviating from that rule to intermeddle so far as to dictate particular modes of accommodation however earnestly i desire it may be effected especially on a subject which has been under the immediate consideration of congress itself whose directions it is my duty as well as inclination to be guided by— i am informed mr ira allen and mr fay have     arrived in this town from vermont on some public business to congress what the object of their mission is i know not should any thing interesting transpire i shall communicate it to you— mrs washington joins me in presenting her compliments to mrs schuyler and yourself i am c george washington   february      philadelphia count de rochambeau to the count de rochambeau philadelphia   february      sir i have been honored with your excellencys favor of the   th and   d ultimo the last enclosing copies of general greenes letter to you and your answer after informing you that i concur with you in opinion that it would not be politic at this moment to move a detachment from your main body to the southward permit me to assure you that i very sensibly feel your goodness in determining to advance the legion as soon as possible to the frontiers of north carolina i have only to request that the commanding officer may have orders to proceed further or not as circumstances may require the move of the legion will be perplexing to the enemy and as it has been heretofore the advance corps of your excellencys army you may i think give out and it will carry with it strong marks of probability that your whole army is to follow as soon as the weather will admit of the march supposing the enemy should receive the reinforcement from ireland i do not imagine that he will after the many severe blows     he has felt from plunging himself into the country march to any great distance from charleston especially if he consider that while france has a naval superiority in the west indian or american seas a body of troops might be easily thrown in between him and the town whereby his ruin would be inevitable it would certainly be our true interest if it could be done to give general greene such a force that he should be able under all circumstances to keep the enemy confined to their posts upon the coasts of south carolina and georgia but should your excellent and valuable body of men be made use of for that purpose it might possibly interfere with the plan of campaign which we may shortly expect from your court those states whose troops compose the southern army will be pressed to send forward reinforcements to general greene as early and as expeditiously as possible i am apprehensive your excellency will think me unmindful of a most agreeable piece of duty which i have been directed to perform by congress it is the presentation of two of the fieldpieces taken at york with an inscription engraved on them expressive of the occasion i find a difficulty in getting the engraving properly executed when it will be finished i shall with peculiar pleasure put the cannon into your possession in an address which i have lately received from the senate of the state of virginia on account of the surrender of york and gloucester i am desired to     make their most grateful acknowledgments to your excellency and to the officers and men under your command for your eminent services upon that occasion and to assure you that they see with pleasure the harmony which subsists between the inhabitants of the state and their generous allies i take the first opportunity of making this agreeable communication in my letter of the   th of january i requested that lord rawdon might be exchanged for brigadiergeneral moultrie of south carolina in preference to any of the colonels mentioned by sir henry clinton it being more conformable to our practice than to make exchanges by composition i now take the liberty of confirming that request  i am c george washington    february      philadelphia to the president of congress philadelphia    february      sir i do myself the honor to enclose copies of the reports of the commissarygeneral of prisoners who has just returned from new york with copies of the papers to which he refers your excellency will perceive thereby that the restriction upon the exchange of lieutenantgeneral earl cornwallis operates against the liberation of brigadiergeneral scott seven colonels and two lieutenantcolonels who upon the principles of the tariff established between us and the enemy are equivalent to his lordship in value     i also enclose the copy of a letter from sir henry clinton by which it would appear the exchange of mr laurens might be effected for earl cornwallis should congress think proper to accede to the proposal i beg leave to remark upon that letter that there has been some misconception either on the part of colonel laurens or lord cornwallis as to what passed on the subject in virginia colonel laurens asked me whether supposing an exchange could be effected between his father and his lordship i should have any objection to it i answered none personally and that as congress had made no difficulty in offering general burgoyne for mr laurens i thought they might now probably offer lord cornwallis but that the matter did not depend upon me this i find has been construed into an absolute consent on my part  with respect to the policy of prohibiting the exchange of lord cornwallis i will not pretend to determine i cannot however help observing that it operates disagreeably in giving uneasiness to those officers of ours who can only be exchanged by composition and who are by the enemy set against him and that it may be considered as a departure from the spirit of the terms of the capitulation of york mr sproats proposition of the exchange of british soldiers for american seamen if acceded to will     immediately give the enemy a very considerable reinforcement and will be a constant draft hereafter upon the prisoners of war in our hands it ought also to be considered that few or none of the naval prisoners in new york and elsewhere belong to the continental service i however feel for the situation of these unfortunate people and wish to see them released by any mode which will not materially affect the public good in some former letters upon this subject i have mentioned a plan by which i am certain they might be liberated nearly as fast as captured it is by obliging the captains of all armed vessels both public and private to throw their prisoners into common stock under the direction of the commissarygeneral of prisoners by these means they would be taken care of and regularly applied to the exchange of those in the hands of the enemy now the greater part are dissipated and the few that remain are applied partially i shall be obliged to your excellency for obtaining and transmitting me the sentiments of congress upon these subjects as early as convenient i have the honor to be c  george washington    february      philadelphia john laurens to lieutenantcolonel john laurens  philadelphia    february      my dear laurens i have had the pleasure to receive your favor of the  0th of december and also the report of the judicious and successful movement of general     greene by which he compelled the enemy to abandon their outposts this brilliant manœuvre is another proof of the singular abilities which that officer possesses since my last despatches from south carolina i have been informed via virginia of the intelligence general greene had received that a reinforcement was expected from ireland of the application he had made in consequence to the count de rochambeau and of the resolution the count had taken of detaching the legion of lauzun to his aid i hope this force together with the corps of armand will give such a decided superiority of cavalry as will prevent the enemy from reoccupying and ravaging the country again should the whole reinforcement from ireland arrive and i must confess i cannot entirely rely upon it as i have not heard the intelligence from any other quarter although a frigate has just arrived at new york with the king of englands speech and despatches from administration nothing however has transpired except the speech from the complexion of which no decisive opinion can be formed but i think a little time will disclose what the enemys intentions are should they still persist in the prosecution of the war whether they mean to occupy the two great posts of new york and charleston or concentrate the whole of their force together in the former case reinforcements may undoubtedly be expected and i know of nothing which can be opposed to them with such a prospect of success as     the corps you have proposed should be levied in carolina to make the campaign decisive is our great object i wish that the states might be impressed with the necessity of taking their measures accordingly and that the war might not be procrastinated by want of exertion on our part  believe me my dear laurens i am convinced under all circumstances of your unbounded zeal in the service of your country that success may ever attend you in the pursuit of personal glory and public felicity is the earnest wish of your affectionate friend c p s the gentlemen of the family request their affectionate regards may be presented to you george washington  0 february      philada to the president of congress philada  0 february      sir since my letter to your excellency of the   th inst i have been honored with the public and secret resolves of congress of the same date the first empowering me to appoint commissioners for the purposes     therein mentioned the last prohibiting the exchange of lieuttgeneral lord cornwallis by composition which is the only mode by which he ever can be exchanged except for civil characters we having no military grade answerable to his  i find myself so exceedingly embarrassed by the operation of the secret resolve that i hope congress will excuse me for pointing out the difficulties in which it involves me personally and the manner in which it affects as i conceive the public good by the public resolve all former restrictions are taken off and i am at liberty to go into a general exchange without limitation when it therefore shall be found that lord cornwallis is still detained those officers of ours particularly our full colonels most of whom can only be exchanged on composition who will be sufferers on that account will naturally apply to me for the reasons i must either submit to their opinions     on a conduct so apparently strange or to justify myself must be under the necessity of betraying a secret vote of congress in order more clearly to point out the manner in which the secret resolve if adhered to will operate against the public interest i must beg leave to request the attention of congress to a short recital of the reasons which induced me at this particular time to propose a meeting of commissioners to the british commanderinchief on my return from virginia the superintendent of finance informed me that the subsistence of the prisoners of war had now become so serious a matter that there was an absolute necessity of endeavoring to obtain payment of the money already due to us upon that account and at all events to fix upon some certain and regular mode of payment for their maintenance in future in order to effect these he advised my making propositions to sir henry clinton to appoint commissioners not only to liquidate the accounts of prisoners but to endeavor by the establishment of a permanent cartel a matter which we have never yet been able to obtain to adjust a number of points relating to the exchanges and accommodation of prisoners and for want of which individuals as well subjects of the united states as those of great britain are daily suffering sir henry clinton after several letters had passed upon the subject acceded to the proposition in the most extensive sense commissioners were named and i only waited for the authority of congress to   0 enable me to invest the commissioners on our part with proper powers this by the public resolve of the   th is amply granted but by the subsequent secret resolve in a manner done away the powers of our commissioners can only have reference to the public resolve and whatever stipulations are entered into will be upon a confidence that no further obstructions will be thrown in the way the exchange of lord cornwallis as heretofore would be one of the first things demanded and should that be rejected as it must be the enemy would not only have it in their power to tax us with breach of faith but they might recede in turn from any part of their agreements and it is to be feared that they would pitch upon that respecting the payment for the maintenance of their prisoners as it will be a weighty matter to them and one which they can evade with less inconvenience than almost any other as we have a very great number of theirs to support and they few of ours in addition to what i have said i have only further to remark that the gentlemen who have been named by me to execute the commission have objections to going upon it except they can meet those from the british on fair and open terms this can only be done either by withdrawing the secret vote entirely or by adhering publicly to the resolution of detaining lord cornwallis and trying what can be effected under such circumstances the last would remove my personal scruples if it should not be deemed a violation of the capitulation but i fear as i before     mentioned that the general interest would suffer by the measure we never can expect that such a cartel as will be really beneficial to us will be acceded to while an officer of lord cornwalliss high rank and family influence is excepted nor indeed while a power is reserved or implied of being able to deprive of the right of exchange any other officer who may hereafter as a prisoner of war become entitled to the advantages of a stipulation of such a nature as a cartel  i ever with diffidence enter into discussions of the above kind and i am now more than commonly apprehensive that my conduct may appear reprehensible as congress have been pleased upon several late applications to adhere to their former opinions respecting lord cornwallis had i not foreseen new difficulties arising from restricting his exchange i should have deemed myself as inexcusable in further controverting the will of congress as i should have been had i remained silent when i thought my voice might have conduced to the general good that that has been my only motive for taking up so much of your time i beg you will believe as sincerely as that i am with the utmost respect c      george washington    february      philadelphia majorgeneral heath to majorgeneral heath philadelphia    february         had the valuable storeship the marquis la fayette arrived safe from france we should have had it in our power to have supplied the officers with the necessary articles of cloathing out of the public magazine but she unfortunately miscarried the financier upon being informed of this and knowing the distress of the greater part of the officers who had now no right to place any further dependence upon their states they being called upon for a sum equal to the whole expences of the war immediately set about devising a plan by which he could afford relief to their wants without involving himself deeper in those difficulties with which he is perplexed by the scantiness of public funds upon enquiry he found gentlemen of extensive commercial credit messrs sands  co willing to supply a quantity of goods proper for the army at their places of cantonment upon a credit of six months and upon as low terms as they could be procured else where he therefore fixed upon the measure which is now about to be adopted that of giving each     officer a note for a certain sum payable in   months which the owners of the goods will receive in payment but there is no obligation upon any officer to take these notes or after he has received them to purchase cloathing of mr sands should he have supplied himself before hand he may keep them untill the time of payment which will be punctually complied with—he may discount them—or he may lay them out in any kind of stores for the campaign the great object was to procure a supply of cloathing of which the bulk of the officers were undoubtedly in want mr morris very prudently foresaw that the end would not be answered except a person could be procured who would engage to furnish a quantity of goods and to take the promissory notes at their full value in this i flatter myself he has succeeded as i am informed by those gentlemen who have taken up goods from mr sands that they have been perfectly satisfied with his prices it is to be hoped if the states comply in any degree with the requisitions upon them that we shall be able to put both officers and men upon as good and regular a footing for pay as they are now—for cloathing and provision to which it was certainly wise first to attend—the new taxes cannot be expected to come into use for some time and therefore the kind of anticipation which the financier has hit upon was a matter of necessity not of choice and as such i hope it will be received by the gentlemen of the army who will be certainly benefitted by it i am c     george washington   march      philadelphia circular to the eastern and middle states philadelphia   march      sir the operations of next campaign being contingent—depending in a great degree upon measures which are not within my controul—and very much upon the plans of the enemy  their efforts to carry them into execution—it is impossible for me at this time to say whether any or how many militia ye states in this part of the continent may be called upon to furnish for the purposes of the ensuing campaign but as i persuade myself it is the wish of every one of them to see a vigorous offensive plan prosecuted with a view of terminating the war honorably and speedily it becomes my duty to inform them that the continental force admitting the battalions should be compleated aided by any auxiliary troops that i have any expectations of is totally inadequate to the first  great object which presents itself to our view and therefore it may be essential to my future plans that the executive powers of the states should be—if they are not so already—vested with sufficient authority to call forth properly equipped such a body of militia as the exigences of service may require—the demand will not be made but in case of necessity—and will be postponed as long as possible—the consequences therefore of a want of such powers or of the delay occasioned by calling an assembly on such an emergency might prove fatal to our operations—and injurious to our cause i need not add how much it is my wish and desire and how much the public interest will be promoted by it that the continental regiments should be compleated—every man of which these are deficient will add to the draught of militia and doubly to the public expences while the troops will not be so competent to the purposes for which they are wanted to say nothing of the disadvantages which agriculture and manufactures will sustain by having the laborers and artisans called off from their work—i would beg leave to suggest that the longer term militia can be drawn out for the more beneficial and less expensive will their services be and that in case of a siege they ought to be engaged during the continuance of it or until relieved by an equal number so that the operating strength may not be diminished at a critical moment when it may be most wanted     george washington   march      william irvine to brigadiergeneral william irvine instructions sir you will proceed with all convenient despatch to fort pitt the object of your command and you will take such measures for the security of that post and for the defence of the western frontier as your continental force combined with the militia of the neighboring country will admit of under present appearances and circumstances i can promise no further addition to your regular force than a proportion of recruits for the virginia and pennsylvania regiments which are already upon the western station consequently offensive operations except upon a small scale cannot just now be brought into contemplation you may however still continue to keep yourself informed of the situation of detroit and the strength of the enemy at that place with respect to the subject of the letters which you have lately received from colonel gibson i can only repeat what i have said to you personally you must endeavor to convince both officers and men that measures are actually taking to put them upon such a footing with regard to their provisions clothing and pay that it is to be hoped they will ere long have no reason to complain they will have already found the difference between their past and present mode of obtaining provisions and clothes and they cannot therefore doubt that the only remaining difficulty which is on account of pay will be removed as soon as the financier can reap the advantages of the taxes for the current year which are but just laid and cannot therefore come yet into use the officers and men must upon a moments reflection be convinced of the wisdom of applying the public money in hand to procuring victuals and clothes they cannot be dispensed with even for a day and when both are assured that certificates of pay due to the  st of the present year will be given with interest and that pay thenceforward will be more regular and as frequent as the public treasury will admit they ought to be satisfied should the troops composing the western garrisons be discontented with their situation and think that they are partially dealt by you may make them an offer of being relieved and of taking     their chance of the emoluments which they may suppose accrue to those serving with either the northern or southern armies there may be policy in this offer because if i am not mistaken most of the men who have connexions in the upper country would rather remain there at some disadvantage than be brought away from their families      march      george washington   th march      philadelphia brigadiergeneral knox gouverneur morris to brigadiergeneral knox and gouverneur morris instructions gentlemen the powers of equal date herewith authorize you to proceed to elizabethtown in the state of new jersey in order to meet commissioners on the part of the enemy on friday the   th  instant for the purposes in the powers fully recited you will consider the settlement of accounts for the subsistence of prisoners of all descriptions from the commencement of the war to  obtaining payment or security for the payment of the large balance which it is presumed was due to the united states at that period and establishing some certain arrangements for the regular payment of the subsistance of prisoners from that time forward as the principal objects of your commission from the want of an appointment of a commissary of prisoners until some time after the commencement of the war from the variety of hands to which the charge of prisoners was committed and from the little attention which was for a long time paid to the sums expended for their support i fear it will be difficult for you to collect the materials necessary to form an account sufficiently accurate to satisfy yourselves or to gain credit with the commissioners on the part of the enemy and it is also probable that the accounts which will be produced by them will be alike subject to many objections for want of proper vouchers and other causes     you are therefore at liberty if you find no probability of being able to make a regular settlement to compound the matter by fixing upon such a sum as shall appear to you reasonable which sum shall upon payment be looked upon as a full and final discharge of all demands on the part of the united states from the commencement of the war to the time which you shall specify you are then in order to prevent all future disputes to determine to what a ration for the support of a prisoner of war shall mutually consist the value of that ration not only in whole but in its component parts what vouchers shall be esteemed mutually valid and obtain and give proper assurances for the regular monthly quarterly c payments of the balances as they may respectively become due before you proceed to the negotiation of exchanges you will pay due regard to the resolve of congress of the   d of february last with copy of which you are furnished which authorizes the exchange of lieutenantgeneral earl cornwallis only upon certain conditions therein specified by the word liberated in the resolve referred to it is not to be understood that mr laurens is to be given up without any equivalent at what the enemy will rate him is uncertain congress once offered a lieutenantgeneral for him and if the same should be demanded now and insisted upon you are at liberty to comply if circumstances should render the exchange of lord cornwallis impracticable the respective commissaries of prisoners may proceed to the exchange of other officers and if the enemy should persist in their resolution of detaining a certain number of our officers of rank as a counter security to our detention of lord cornwallis it may be submitted to upon the following principle that it will be be better for four or five gentlemen the number who will be involved to remain in captivity than the whole amounting to considerably above one hundred      in compliance with a resolve of congress of the  0th of december last copy of which and some papers relating to it you have herewith you will enter into a discussion with the british commissioners upon the powers and conduct of the board of directors to the associated loyalists in new york and you will endeavor to devise some means for the prevention of that kind of depredation which is complained of on this subject you will do nothing conclusive but report to me the substance of the measures which may have seemed to the british commissioners and yourselves most likely to answer the end i recommend to your particular attention the case of one summers a native of pennsylvania taken in      and yet detained upon long island notwithstanding every reasonable offer has been made to procure his exchange the commissary of prisoners can inform you fully of his situation and circumstances should you enter into either a general or special cartel you will endeavor to stipulate that in future citizens not in arms shall not be considered as subjects of capture but in particular cases such as for instance for guides for intelligence and such like purposes and that they shall be well treated and discharged after the ends for which they were captured are answered should the admiral accede to my proposition of sending commissioners to meet you on the subject of the treatment and exchange of marine prisoners you will endeavor in the first place to obtain a change in the mode of keeping our seamen confined the daily complaint of the miseries incident to confinement on board prisonships will authorize you to remonstrate warmly on that head and to insist upon an alteration of conduct in respect to the support and mode of payment for the subsistence of seamen you will be guided by the instruction relating to the rations of soldiers     you are acquainted with the difficulties under which we labor as to the means of procuring the exchange of the american seamen who fall into the hands of the enemy it but rarely happens that those captured by private vessels of war are given up to the continental commissaries some are taken into our service many escape through negligence and therefore it is that the balance of marine prisoners has been generally greatly against us the mode proposed by admiral digby of giving up land prisoners for seamen is altogether inadmissible it would prove a constant source of reinforcement to the enemy under present circumstances i do not see that you can come to any final determination upon the mode of exchanging or liberating seamen should commissaries meet you on that subject you will in conjunction with them form a plan which may be deemed mutually equitable and convenient and report upon it you have herewith the copies of the letters which have passed between the british general and admiral and myself upon the subject of your commission the superintendent of finance will furnish you with materials for stating our claims for subsistence of prisoners so far as he has been able to obtain them and the commissary of prisoners will furnish you with any official papers which may be in his possession and which may be found necessary to the accomplishment of a general or special cartel given under my hand and seal at philadelphia the   th day of march      p s since the above i have been furnished by congress with a number of representations respecting the treatment of our marine prisoners i have thought it proper to put them into your hands that you may make the necessary use of them george washington    march      philadelphia james mchenry to james mchenry philadelphia    march      my dear sir the fair hand to whom your letter of the  0th of january was committed presented it safe and as you very truly observed the value of it was enhanced by   0 it good laws ample means and sufficient powers may render the birth of your intendant  a public benefit and from the spirit of your people i hope these are provided without them the appointment must be nugatory never since the commencement of the present revolution has there been in my judgment a period when vigorous measures were more consonant to sound policy than the present the speech of the british king and the addresses of the lords and commons are proofs as clear as holy writ to me of two things—their wishes to prosecute the american war and their fears of the consequences my opinion therefore of the matter is that the minister will obtain supplies for the current year prepare vigorously for another campaign and then prosecute the war or treat of peace as circumstances and fortuitous events may justify and that nothing will contribute more to the first than a relaxation or apparent suppineness on the part of these states the debates upon the addresses evidently prove what i have here advanced to be true for according to the explanation of them they are meant to answer any purpose the ministers may have in view what madness then can be greater or policy and economy worse than to let the enemy again rise upon our folly and want of exertion shall we not be justly chargeable for all the blood and treasure which shall be wasted in a lingering war procrastinated by false expectations     of peace or timid measures for prosecuting the war surely we shall and much is it to be lamented that our endeavors do not at all times accord with our wishes each state is anxious to see the end of our warfare but shrinks when it is called upon for the means to accomplish it and either withholds altogether or grants them in such a manner as to defeat the end such it is to be feared will be the case in many instances respecting the requisitions of men and money i have the pleasure however to inform you that the assembly of this state  now sitting have passed their supplybill without a dissenting voice and that a laudable spirit seems to pervade all the members of that body but i fear notwithstanding they will be deficient of their quota of men it is idle at this late period of the war when enthusiasm is cooled if not done away when the minds of that class of men who are fit subjects for soldiers are poisoned by the high bounties which have been given and the knowledge of the distresses under which the army has groaned is so generally diffused through every state to suppose that our battalions can be completed by voluntary enlistment the attempt is vain and we are only deceiving ourselves and injuring the cause by making the experiment there is no other effectual method to get men suddenly but that of classing the people and compelling each class to furnish a recruit here every man is interested every man becomes a recruiting officer if our necessity     for men did not press i should prefer the mode of voluntary enlistment to all others but as it does i am sure it will not answer and that the season for enterprise will be upon us long ere we are prepared for the field the anxious state of suspense in which we have been for some time and still remain respecting the naval engagement in the west indies and the attempt upon brimstone hill in the island of st kitts is disagreeable beyond description the issue of these events must be very interesting and may give a very unfavorable turn to affairs in that quarter and on this continent in consequence of it mrs washington joins me in compts to the good ladies of your acquaintance and to yourself i am c george washington    march      philadelphia majorgeneral greene to majorgeneral greene philadelphia    march      my dear sir       it gives me the more pain to hear of your distresses for want of clothing and other necessaries as you are at so great a distance that you cannot be suddenly relieved even if we had the means i am not however without hopes that should the war be continued to the southward of which i have my doubts for reasons which i shall presently give matters will be put into a much better train than they have hitherto been the arrangements made already by the superintendent of finance have been attended with infinite public advantages and he is     extending those arrangements as fast as circumstances will possibly admit i am sorry to see a jealousy arising from a supposition there has been a partiality of conduct i am certain that there has been no such intention and that instead of a charge of having done too little it will soon be a matter of wonder how mr morris has done so much with so small means as i know he corresponds with you on the affairs of his department i shall content myself with saying that before colonel carrington leaves town measures will be taken to enable him to make provision in future for the ready transportation of stores and for the accommodation of troops moving to the southward it is agreed that the elaboratory shall be removed from richmond to new london in my former letters upon this subject i acquainted you with the reasons which operated against count de rochambeaus detaching more than the legion of lauzun towards south carolina upon your requisition for a reinforcement  although my instructions to you did not mention a power to call upon the count for assistance yet i look upon it as implied in my desire to you to correspond with him the circumstances of the moment must determine whether any or what can be spared by him by late advices from europe and from the declarations of the british ministers themselves it appears     that they have done with all thoughts of an excursive war and that they mean to send small if any further reinforcements to america it may be also tolerably plainly seen that they do not mean to hold all their present posts and that new york will be occupied in preference to any other hence and from other indications i am induced to believe that an evacuation of the southern states will take place should this happen we must concentre our force as the enemy do theirs you will therefore upon the appearance of such an event immediately make preparations for the march of the army under your command to the northward what troops shall in that case be left in the southern states will be a matter of future discussion  no other reinforcement went from new york to south carolina than that of the four hundred who had arrived letters which you had not received when you last wrote will have informed you that our first intelligence respecting the number of men embarked were false with the highest sentiments of esteem i am my dear sir c     george washington    march      morristown brigadiergeneral knox gouverneur morris to brigadiergeneral knox and gouverneur morris at elizabethtown morristown    march      gentlemen i have had intimations that under the idea of the cessation of hostilities within certain limits a number of people intend to come over from new york to our lines to prevent all intercourse of this kind is the principal design of this letter sir william howe on a former occasion proposed that a neutrality should take place to a certain distance from the spot where our commissioners were to assemble in order that they might not meet with any interruption in the transaction of their business from the hostilities and alarms which might otherwise have happened in the neighbourhood of them it was upon this principle and for this reason that the present proposal was made on my part nor was it indeed or could be construed to extend any farther it is therefore my particular desire that no persons coming from the enemy may be permitted to land except the commissioners and those immediately connected with them and as i think it expedient not only to prevent new channels of communication with the enemy from being opened but as far as practicable to shut the former i could wish you would take the trouble to inform yourselves of the practice of sending and receiving flags on the lines and point out such alterations and regulations as you shall deem proper to prevent the evils which have been complained of as resulting from too frequent an intercourse with the enemy     i have been informed by the commissary of prisoners that the enemy are preparing to send out a considerable quantity of goods under the sanction of passports granted by me for bringing out clothing necessaries c for the use of their prisoners this is so contrary to my intention and may be productive of such ill consequence that i have sent colonel smith to explain the matter to you and to request you will examine the list and signify what articles should be considered as necessaries and what quantity ought to be permitted to be sent out mr skinner is directed to give you the necessary information he will also explain to you the mode which has prevailed of making partial exchanges this subject i need not recommend particularly as it is comprehended within the limits of your commission i have the honor to be c  george washington   th march      morristown matthias ogden to colonel matthias ogden instructions sir the spirit of enterprise so conspicuous in your plan for surprising in their quarters and bringing off the prince william henry and admiral digby merits applause and you have my authority to make the attempt in any manner and at such a time as your own judgment shall direct i am fully persuaded that it is unnecessary to caution you against offering insult or indignity to the persons of the prince and admiral should you be so fortunate as to capture them but it may not be amiss to press     the propriety of a proper line of conduct upon the party you command in case of success you will as soon as you get them to a place of safety treat them with all possible respect but you are to delay no time in conveying them to congress and reporting your proceedings with a copy of these orders take care not to touch upon the ground which is agreed to be neutral namely from newark to rahway and four miles back given at headquarters morristown this   th day of march       george washington    april      newburgh to the general officers newburgh    april      the commanderinchief states to the general officers that from the best information he has been able to obtain the regular force of the enemy in new york at this time including their established provincial corps amounts at least to nine thousand men that the city militia volunteer companies rangers and some other small corps in the town amounted by a report made to the secretary of state in the winter of    0 when the enemy apprehended an attack on n york  were preparing for defence to    0 men exclusive of sailors  marines—and that this is the best criterion by which he can form judgment of their present strength that the enemys force in charles town by the last information  estimation of it consisted of   00 men that the garrison of savanna in georgia he conceives can not be less than  00 men that even among men of political knowledge  judgment a diversity of sentiment prevails respecting the evacuation of the     southern states—that if this event should take place  the whole force of the enemy shd be concentrated at new york it will stand thus regr troops now at n yk   000 from charles town    00 savanna   00  regrs   000 militia c at n york    00  total    00 under this state of the enemys force the commanderinchief requests the opinion of the genl officers seperately  in writing upon the following hypothetical questions first—supposing the enemys force at new york to be as above — that they retain possession of the harbor of new york—and that they have a naval superiority upon this coast secondly—supposing the same force—that they keep possession of the harbor—but loose their superiority at sea thirdly—that they shall have the same force in the city—but shall loose the command of the water both in the harbor  at sea is there it is asked a probability in all or either of these cases that we shall be able to obtain men  means sufficient to undertake the seige of new york —what efficient force will be necessary for the enterprise in the cases wch may be deemed practicable and what number of militia ought to be demanded to secure this force if the enemy should not reinforce new york with their southern troops—and none should arrive from europe their force at that place will then be regulars   000 militia c     0  total     0 the commanderinchief propounds the same questions—identically—on this number as he did on the larger one of         0  requests that they may be answered accordingly—numbers only making the difference of the cases that every information may be received which is in the power of the general to give to form a judgmt on these questions—heard— that the northern army will at present be composed of the regiments from new hampshire to new jersey inclusive—also of hazens lambs  cranes regiments of artillery and sheldons legionary corps— that the total number of the r  file in the above regiments of infantry by the last genl return in his possession amounts to  00 —but from this the deductions incident to all services  peculiar to ours are to be made to come at the efficient strength that it is not in his power to inform what strength these regiments will be brought to in season for an operation against new york—he can only say that every argument he was master of has been urged to the respective states to have them compleated to their full establishment— that in case the enemy shd evacuate the southern states the continental troops in that qr as far at least as north carolina will be ordered to rejoin the main army but their numbers being small and the march great the support from them cannot be much—  00 men is the most that can be expected that in the month of march last he apprised the states from delaware eastward that the plans  operations of the campaign might require a considerable aid of militia  entreated that the executive of each might to avoid delay be vested with sufficient powers to order them out for three months service to commence on their joining the army—and that the french force on the continent at this time does not he believes exceed  000 effective men—whether any or what further succors are to be expected from our allies is as yet unknown to him the commanderinchief concludes the above state of matters with the following observations that offensive operations of whatever kind they may be being generally the result of choice ought to be undertaken with due consideration of all circumstances   0  a moral certainty of succeeding for besides involving the public in a heavy expence wch the situation of our affairs can illy afford disgrace  censure scarce ever fail to attend unsuccessfull plans—while the enemy acquire spirits by and triumph at our misfortunes george washington    april      newburgh john lewis to john lewis fredericksburg newburgh    april      dear sir i have heard and sincerely lament the death of your father and my concern is increased by the information in your letter of the   th ulto of his dying much indebted so far as i am interested in the lands which he has directed

peculiar circumstances must sell to a disadvantage when they are not in general demand and when there is a dearth of money—especially those which have been and may again be exposed to the invasions of the enemy as is the case of the lands purchased by doctrs wright and jones i mean this as a general observation not to oppose it to the sales you have in contemplatn for i am convinced from experience that lands far removed from the proprietors of them—however valuable in themselves—are very unprofitable—and because i as well as your fathers estate stand in need of the money which my part of them will fetch when i say this     i take it for granted that you do not mean to sell these lands unless you can get the value of them or near it because this would not only defeat the end you have in view but do injustice to doctr walker and myself i have not a sufficient recollection of them especially the tracts in which doctr walker holds a share to describe any of them accurately with respect to norfleets  it is in no carolina near the line and upon the great road leading from suffolk to edenton—abt    miles from the former which is or was a place of very extensive trade—there ought to be if my memory serves me upwards of a thousand acres in the tract for which i think we gave £  00 and sunk a great deal more by keeping it two or three years in our own hands the land is level and i believe well timbered—capable of great improvement there being upwds of  00 acres of exceeding rich and open meadow ground belonging to the tract—a great part of which is or was ditched and in grass and other kinds of cultivation the lands purchased of jones  doctr wright lye between norfolk  suffolk   or   m from the latter  on or near nansemond river they are if i recollect right well timbered and of good quality—level as all the land thereabouts is and capable of being rendered exceedingly valuable i do not remember what kind of buildings are on the last mentioned tracts—the other norfleets had a good dwelling house  kitchen with brick chimnies      a barn but as it is at least ten or twelve years since i have been in that part of the country great changes may have taken place since a large slipe of the meadow land has i am told been taken from us whether by legal process or not i am unable to say    george washington april         to the general and field officers of the army head quarters april         the commanderinchief submits the papers accompanying this containing the case of captain joshua huddy lately hanged within the county of monmouth in new jersey state by a party of the enemy to the consideration of the general officers and commandg officers of brigades and regiments and thereupon requests from them separately and in writing a direct and laconic reply to the following queries viz   upon the state of facts in the above case is retaliation justifiable and expedient   if justifiable ought it to take place immediately or should a previous representation be made to sir henry clinton and satisfaction be demanded from him   in case of representation and demand who should be the person or persons to be required   in case of refusal and retaliation becoming necessary of what description shall the officer be on whom it is to take place and how shall he be designated for the purpose      george washington  0 april      newburgh bartholomew dandridge to bartholomew dandridge newburgh  0 april      dear sir since my last to you from philadelphia i have been favoured with your letter of the  0th ulto from new kent how far it is proper or improper to delay the appointment of a guardian or guardians to mr custiss children i shall not take upon me to decide but this i am clear in and beg leave again to urge it that whenever the necessity for it arrives you shoud take upon yourself the trust i confess to you candidly that i see very little prospect of the wars ending with this campaign or if it does that i shall have leizure to engage in new matters my own affairs will i am convinced be found in a very perplexed     condition all my book accts bonds c stand as i left them except those which have been discharged with depreciated notes—but this is not all—matters which relate immediately to myself is the least of my concern unfortunately for me i became much against my inclination but at the earnest request of colo thos colvill one of his executors to an estate which was left under the most peculiar circumstances imaginable as it was intricately involved with an estate of his brothers who had died before him—and in legacies to people in england—not by name but by description and descent almost from adam who had given infinite trouble before i left virginia by their claims unsatisfactory proofs of their descent discontents c the other executor—a mr west—whom it was intended by the testator should and who ought to have had all the trouble died three or four years ago and from an indolence of disposition inattention to business and bad accts has i fear made that which at best would have been exceedingly troublesome in a great degree perplexing and difficult so that i have not only all these difficulties to encounter but shall think myself very fortunate if i escape without loss besides this business i stand alone in another which is also under very peculiar circumstances—i mean my transactions under a power of attorney from colo geo mercer and his mortgages to colo tayloe and myself in which i disposed of his estate to the amt of £  000 payable the novr succeeding my leaving home and left the business with colo tayloe to finish but this gentn never     took one single direct or proper step in it while he was in a condition so to do and died insane so that that matter stands on a most wretched and ruinous footing add to this that yielding to the pressing solicitation of my neighbor colo fairfax when he was about to leave the country i accepted of a power of attorney authorising me to direct his business which when i left virginia was after selling good part of his personal estate left at sixes and sevens in a word i see so many perplexing and intricate matters before me which must be the work of time to arrange and bring to a conclusion that it would be injurious to the children and madness in me to undertake as a principle a trust which i could not discharge such aid however as it ever may be with me to give to the children especially the boy i will afford with all my heart with all my soul and on the assurance of it you may rely inclosed you have a copy of my acct with mr custis settled by colo mason as the mutual friend to us both i have no doubt but that every article of debit and credit contained in it is right but that there is a dificiency in the acct is obvious from the face of it when compared with known facts this acct carries with it the appearance of a final settlement—comprehending all our dealings up to the date—to wit the   th of june      whereas the fact is that all articles of charge or credit between that period and the settlemt with the genl court on the  th nov      are omitted many of which may be important one i know to be so and that is the rent     of the dower estate near wmsburg during that interval this imperfection in the settlet i can only acct for by their having as i directed for colo masons satisfaction recourse to certified copies of the last settled accts as vouchers with the genl court and their not attending or perhaps knowing of the open one on my books by which means the whole of it is excluded i shall write to mr lund washington by this conveyance for a copy of the open acct subsequent to the date of that settled with the court and previous to my leaving virginia in may      as also for any accts which he on my behalf may have raised since and will send them both to you you also have inclosed a copy of mr custiss bond to and agreement with me at the time i relinquished all my right to and property in the dower estate except the negros under that description which i had on my estate of mount vernon at the time of bargaining i gave him all the horses and implements of husbandry at the plantation but he was to pay for the stock of every kind which should be found thereon at such rates as colo bassett might affix to them    of the cattle however he removed to his seat in fairfax before any valuation was made the remainder was appraised by colo bassett on the   st of december in that year      in the manner and to the amount of the inclosed list—the    head also included in this list was valued the september following at the rate of £ 0 pr head by colo bassett—in consequence i suppose     of the depreciation but to this mr custis objected on account he alledged of the extravagant price which by the by appeared only so in sound however as i wanted nothing more than the real value and was persuaded he meant to do me justice i wrote him that the matter might be settled in any manner consistently with these views—so the matter i believe has rested ever since thus my dear sir have i given you every information in my power respecting the state of my accts with mr custis when i get and can send you the accts which i am now writing to mr lund washington for you will have the whole matter as fully before you as it is in my power to place it if the legislature of virga will not put it in the power of individuals to recover debts it would be extremely hard upon mr custiss heirs to have their property sold to discharge his when there are such ample means to do it without if they could be got at and when if property was to be sold on credit there might be the same difficulty to obtain the money arising from the sales as there is to come at that which is already due as the assembly has called in all the paper money it can no longer i presume be a tender but if the case had been otherwise the mere attempt to do it is so incompatible with my ideas of common honesty and is of so fraudulent a nature that i should have advised the refusal of it in every instance the articles which you propose to sell to wit—horses and mares can well be spared for i think they contribute more to the amusement     than profit of the raiser at any time and without the latter there can be no plea for the former in the instance before us without the household furniture mrs custis cannot do this therefore ought not to be sold i had no particular reason for keeping and handing down to his son the books of the late colo custis saving that i thought it would be taking the advantage of a low appraisement to make them my own property at it and that to sell them was not an object as they might be useful to him how far these considerations should weigh at a time when money is wanting you are the best judge of i am exceedingly glad to hear that you found your family well on your return from fairfax and that yr own health was improved by the trip your sister joins me in the most affecte manner to all friends  i am c george washington    april      henry clinton to sir henry clinton headquarters    april      sir the enclosed representation from the inhabitants of the county of monmouth with testimonials to the facts which can be corroborated by other unquestionable evidence will bring before your excellency the most wanton unprecedented and inhuman murder that ever disgraced the arms of a civilized people i shall not because i believe it to be altogether unnecessary trouble your excellency with any animadversions upon this transaction candor obliges me     to be explicit to save the innocent i demand the guilty captain lippincot therefore or the officer who commanded at the execution of captain huddy must be given up or if that officer was of inferior rank to him so many of the perpetrators as will according to the tariff of exchange be an equivalent to do this will mark the justice of your excellencys character in failure of it i shall hold myself justifiable in the eyes of god and man for the measure to which i shall resort i beg your excellency to be persuaded that it cannot be more disagreeable to you to be addressed in this language than it is to me to offer it but the subject requires frankness and decision i have to request your speedy determination as my resolution is suspended but for your answer i am sir c  george washington    april      newburg majorgeneral greene to majorgeneral greene head quarters newburg    april      dear sir your favor of the  th of feby was acknowledged in mine of the   th of march i have now received yours of the  th ultimo from pompton covering the correspondence you have had with the count de rochambeau and a general return of your army   0 your apprehensions in consequence of the movement of the legion of lauzun need not be much alarmed the present situation of the enemy in new york i am persuaded will not afford any reinforcements to your quarter the recruits raising in the states from whence your army is composed are completing as far as circumstances will admit and if needed will be ready to go to you as early as the operations of the campaign are decided which at present from a variety of circumstances among which a want of intelligence from europe is not the least are held in a state of uncertainty the state of maryland had some time ago about three hundred men enlisted and waiting only for their clothes which have been sent on from philadelphia a number also is collected in pennsylvania but until our information respecting the enemys intentions and their future mode of war is more clearly ascertained as well as our knowledge of the support and assistance which we expect from our ally it may not be well to hasten on the recruits to your army you are not insensible of the disadvantages we have ever experienced in attempts to reinforce at your distance by land it having hitherto proved a weakening of the main army without any essential augmentation to yours in present circumstances without the aid of naval forces and water conveyance your own experience and the general knowledge you have of the country will readily decide upon the impracticability of transporting by land such heavy stores and artillery as would be     necessary for great operations so that you have only to content yourself with such a force as will be competent to the purpose of confining the enemy to their lines and preventing them from carrying their ravages into the country i wait with impatience for intelligence which will decide the intentions of the enemy and fix the operations of the campaign on our part this i hope is not far distant i am c  george washington    april      newburg to the secretary at war head quarters newburg    april      dear sir finding the commissioners appointed to liquidate the accounts of moneys due for the maintenance of prisoners and make permanent provision for their future support have separated without accomplishing any thing i think it highly expedient that measures should be adopted at this moment for taking the german prisoners of war into our service as this measure has been considerably agitated i shall not amplify upon the justice and propriety of it which to me seem very obvious i am equally well persuaded of the policy there will be in augmenting every company with at least ten of these men or more if they can be obtained for i am convinced that by such an incorporation they will make exceedingly cheap and valuable recruits and being ablebodied and disciplined men will give a strength and solidity to our regiments which they will not otherwise acquire this     campaign all my accounts respecting the recruiting service are unfavorable indeed not a single recruit has arrived to my knowledge from any state except rhode island in consequence of the requisitions of congress in december last should the plan be adopted by congress the sooner it is carried into execution the better in that case i think the men ought to be recruited for the continent and not carried to the credit of the states quotas with whose lines they are to serve for without making any alteration in the establishment they may be annexed to the regiments in such a manner as that they can be formed into distinct corps whenever their fidelity and attachment shall be sufficiently evinced if circumstances should then require all the matters of bounty and encouragement being arranged with the financier and the particulars of the scheme adjusted as soon as provision shall be made for their subsistence on the journey i would detach a captain and subn from every regiment to receive and conduct them to the army so that they may certainly join the respective regiments at farthest by the  st of june in the interim i would beg leave to propose lest the enemy should attempt to counteract the design that the business should be kept secret until it is ripe for execution and then be negotiated by some gentleman of address appointed for the purpose i request an answer as speedily as possible i have the honor to be c p s i am just favored with your letters of the  0th and   d instants—i think it would be well to     permit such of the prisoners mentioned by you to return to their regts as can procure testimonials in their favor—i submit the matter to your discretion george washington april         newburg chevalier de la luzerne to the chevalier de la luzerne newburg april         sir i receive with much gratitude the remembrances and compliments of the principal officers of the french army in virginia and thank your excellency for the trouble of being the bearer of them to me and the letter from count de rochambeau with equal sensibility and pleasure i received and do now acknowledge my obligations to your excellency for the communications from your court which tho not decisive are nevertheless important the late instance of their generous aid hinted at by your excellency and particularized by mr morris is one among a variety of important considerations which ought to bind america to france in bonds of indelible friendship and gratitude never i hope to be sundered  induced by that entire confidence which i repose in your excellency and a full conviction that a nation which combines her force with ours for purposes of all others most interesting to humanity     ought not to be deficient of any information i can give to point objects to means that an accordance of them may be inseparable i shall without hesitation give you the state of our present force and my ideas of the increase of it by recruits from the best view of it which lyes before me it can scarcely be necessary to inform yr excellency that our military establishment for the present year consists of   regiments of artillery   legionary and two partisan corps and  0 regiments of infantry besides the corps of invalids or that congress have called in pointed terms upon each state to compleat its regiments to the establishment the aggregate of which if complied with would amount to    0  men exclusive of commissioned officers sergeants and music hazens regiment and the corps of invalids of this force one legionary corps two regmts of artillery and    of infantry besides hazens regt and the invalids compose the northern army but as hazens regiment is fostered by no state discouraged from recruiting by all and without funds if the case was otherwise it must soon dwindle to nothing being now very weak the present totality of the rank and file exclusive of sergeants of these regimts which compose the northern army amounts to      from this number the sick men in different branches of the staff department and such as are employed on other extra duties which the peculiarity of our circumstances compels me to furnish from ye army being deducted will reduce the efficient operating force of     these corps to      rank and file and i should be uncandid if i was not to acknowledge that i do not expect it will be increased by recruits in the course of the campaign to more than  0000 fit for duty in the field this sir in my opinion will be the full amount of the established regts of the states east of pensylvania to ascertain the number of militia which may be assembled for occasional offensive operations is more than i can do the general opinion is that there will be no want of militia for any enterprise we can have in view be this as it may this one thing is certain that this class of men are not only slow in their movements but undertaking to judge also of the propriety of them in point of amnt will wait till the necessity for it strikes them which in most cases is as injurious to the service as inability or want of inclination disappointment being the consequence of delay this observation i could not refrain making because in all combined operations especially those which may depend upon the season or a limited period for their execution it is of the utmost importance to be known the enclosed return wch is a copy of the last state of the force under the orders of majrgenl greene wch has come to my hands will give your excellency every information in my power respecting the state and condition of that army which was to be augmented by the partisan corps of colo armand consisting of about  00 horse and foot independent of those there are two small regts at fort pitt one from ye state of pensylva the other from virga     which are included in the general establishmt of the army but no partr return is here given of them what measures are adopted by the states of georgia and no and so carolina to recruit their battalions i know not virginia marched abt  00 men the latter end of feby for the southern army and by an act of the legislature passed at their last session resolved to raise more but in what forwardness they are or what is to be expected from the act i am equally uninformed maryland and pensylvania depend upon voluntary enlistments and are proceeding very slow in the business of recruiting especially the latter it is impossible for me therefore to say to what number that army will be increased this sir is an accurate state of the force we have at present and my expectation of what it may be independent of militia the enemys force from the best information i have been able to obtain of it may stand thus at new york regulars includg their established corps of provincials rank and file nine thousand militia of the city refugees and indept companies  000 sailors and marines accordg to the no of ships whch may be in the harbr and this being uncertn no numbr is given now in n y   000 charleston abt   00 savannah abt  00 in canada including british german and established provinls  000 penobscot abt  00 halifax and its dependencies uncertain but say   00 in all   000 the above estimate so far as it respects new     york charleston and savannah is i believe to be depended upon the force of canada by some accts is more by others less than  000 the regular british and german troops in that country cannot exceed  000 but in addition to these are the corps of sir john johnson and others which i am told have been considerably increased by the disaffected of this and other states who have fled to canada but it is to be observed that this force be it what it may is employed in the occupation of posts between quebec and michilimackinac and on lake champlain through an extent of not less than   or  00 miles and that all these posts are dependent upon the former for provision and supplies of every kind i am less certain of the enemys force in nova scotia than elsewhere the number here given is not from recent intelligence and may be erroneous as their garrisons are weakened or strengthened according to circumstances cumberland windsor annapolis and st johns river c are posts dependent on halifax and included in the   00 men here mentioned if this state of matters be satisfactory to your excellency or useful in the formation of any plans against the common enemy i shall be very happy in having given it permit me now sir to express the high sense i have of the honor you have done me in communicating the favorable opinion entertained of my conduct by the court and nation of france and to acknowledge my obligation to those officers who have inspired     these sentiments to stand well in the eyes of a nation which i view as one of the first in the world and in the opinion of a monarch whom i consider as the supporter of the rights of humanity and to whom i am personally indebted for the command he has been pleased to honor me with is highly flattering to my vanity at the same time it has a first claim to all my gratitude  it is unnecessary i hope to add fresh assurances of the respect and esteem with which i have the honor to be c george washington  0 april      to the president of congress head quarters  0 april      sir i have the honor to transmit to your excellency copies of the minutes of proceedings and reports of my commissioners appointed to meet commissioners on the part of the british general sir henry clinton for the purposes mentioned in their instructions copy of which is herewith communicated  a private     letter from my commissioners and a letter from sir henry clinton both written in consequence of this negotiation are also enclosed for the observation of congress after this display of the subject it is unnecessary and it might be improper for me to make any observations on these papers i submit them to the wisdom of congress and have only to beg for my own direction that i may be early informed of their determination how far any future exchanges of prisoners of war shall be continued under the practice which has been formerly adopted for that purpose i beg leave to point the attention of congress particularly to that part of the commissioners letter to me which mentions the extension of a pardon to the refugees in service of the enemy their ideas on this subject are so perfectly consonant to my own formed on the principles of policy and expediency that i cannot omit to notice it and to submit to the consideration of congress whether the adopting this measure under proper restrictions may not be attended   0 with happy consequences to our cause and be equally productive of ruin and confusion to the british interests in america lamenting that the benevolence of my intentions has been so totally defeated by the unhappy and fruitless issue of this negotiation i have only to add that with the most perfect regard i am c plan of campaign newburgh   may      unacquainted with the determinations of the court of france respecting the succor which may in their extensive arrangements for the campaign of      be generously extended to the service of america or indeed knowing what to expect from the states in consequence of the requisitions of congress for men and supplies it is impossible to point operations to particular objects but as it may give facility to future determinations to take a comprehensive view of the enemys strength in different parts of america and see with what force and means in what manner and with what prospect it can best be assailed the following statements are made and thoughts result— the enemys effective force in america from the best information that has been received of it may be estimated as follows viz— first at new york and its dependencies regulars including the established provine corps city militia independent companies and refugees sailors and marines as these depend upon circumstans none will be put down rank  file  000   000     000 second southern states   charles town   00  savanna  00  000 third canada   regulars and established provincials   000 fourth hallifax and penobscot   hallifax and its dependencies   00  penobscot  00  000 total    000 the foregoing estimate exhibits four distinct objects to view each of which tho in different degrees is important and worthy of consideration— the first is undoubtedly of the greatest magnitude and the most beneficial consequences will result from a successful operation against it consequently it is to be preferred if our force and means are adequate to the enterprise and the season should favor these are matters of very serious consideration as a disappointment would not only disgrace our arms but would involve the states in a heavy and ruinous expence— whether the second or third should claim our next attention if we are unable to prosecute the first is a matter of serious enquiry and can best be determined by a comparative and impartial view of the advantages of each which as far as my knowledge of them extend i will state in favor of carolina and georgia the wishes the feelings the long sufferings and the distresses of the southern states in general and these two in particular especially in the deprivation of their capitols their trade which is of such a nature as to make favorable remittances for continental as well as local purposes—and the principal gentlemen of the country of their homes and the comforts of life must have great weight in this scale— especially when it is considered what effect the disappointment might have upon the minds of a people who have already conceived themselves neglected—and who just beginning to immerge from the deplorable situation into which their country had been thrown by the cruel invasion of it are now exerting themselves to support the common cause in high expectation more than probable of being speedily emancipated from the force which at present possesses their capitols under these circumstances it may be difficult to bring to their view remote advantages tho ever so important upon the large or general scale and if disgust and resentment should be the consequence of disappointment it may have an unhappy influence on our plans in our councils and upon our public measures in general besides there is one powerful argument in favor of the southern expedition if we can be effectually covered by a fleet without which it is folly even to think of one and that is a moral certainty of success for knowing the number of the enemy which compose the garrisons of charles town and savanna and the strength of their works and that they have no exterior resources we can adduce such a force as cannot upon the common rules of calculation fail to insure success whereas many unforeseen difficulties may cast up in canada—we may find notwithstanding the flattering accts of the friendly disposition of its inhabitants and their wishes to be released from the yoke of british tyranny that a hostile disposition may appear in many of them whilst a painful neutrality pervades the rest add to these reasons that under the most favorable circumstances that can reasonably be expected—one campaign can do little more than give us a firm establishment in the country—and perhaps possession of their upper posts—to expect the conquest of quebec the same season unless by the dispersion of the force in canada and the impracticability of assembling it we should find quebec weakly garrisoned illy provided with provisions or military stores or a disposition in the country to rise as one man to exterminate the british force would exhibit greater proofs of a sanguine temper than a deliberate judgment canada the annexation of so capitol a province as this canada to the federal union the consequent subduction of all the northern and western indians and the restoration of peace and quietness to such an extensive frontier as we have from the river st johns in the bay of fundy to the holstein in no carolina are matters of great moment and worthy of     the most serious attention especially too when it is considered that in the case of charles town and savanna if the enemy can be confined within their lines the inhabitants of so carolina and georgia are suffering a temporary suspension only of their property in and the inconveniences of those towns and some impediments to their trade whereas in the other case multitudes of helpless families which it is impossible to protect are daily murdered or carried into hopeless captivity by the savages whole settlements destroyed and our northern and western frontier of more than a thousand miles in extent continually retreating before a cruel and bloodthirsty enemy who desolate as they go besides these an expedition into canada would at once develop the mysterious conduct of the people of vermont bring them to an explanation in a manner of all others the most advantageous to us and unexceptionable to themselves disconcert the projects of the enemy if they are in league with the rulers of these people and turn the arms and resources with which they were flattered     against them for the vermontese having often sollicited an expedition into canada with strong assurances of support durst not refuse their aid if called upon when a heavy body of troops were marching through their country avowedly and apparently to remove the source of the evils they have complaind of and which has been the ostensible reason assigned for their temporizing conduct with the enemy in canada to these considerations may be added that an expedition into that country if undertaken with sufficient means and in a proper season and manner will cost very little more than the expensive but ineffectual modes which are now pursuing by the continent agregately and the states individually for defence of them while the latter is an annual expence under all the disadvantages and evils here enumerated and the other by putting the axe to the root would remove the cause and make a radical cure i shall say nothing of the benefits which america would derive and the injury great britain must sustain by the fur and other trade of canada shifting hands nor of the immense     importance it must be to the future peace and quiet of these states especially the western parts of them to annihilate the british interest in that country thereby putting a stop to their intriguing after peace shall be established these are too obvious to stand in need of illustration—they will speak for themselves to all which may be added by way of questions proper for gentn of the navy to resolve—whether a fleet sufficient to protect the siege of charles town can lye there in safety during the operation whether chesapeake bay which is the nearest port for ships of the line would afford sufficient cover and give proper security to the besiegers and their convoys during the siege and what will be the probable consequences of the enterprise if both these questions should be resolved in the negative hallifax— with which i connect penobscot—is of the four statements least important considered in a separate point of view but if our force should be unequal to the enterprise against new york or other circumstances should render the attack of that place unadvisable and we could nevertheless combine these with canada and carry on both expeditions at once with a probability of success it would add more weight to the reasons given in     support of an expedition into that country and in case of success would be of the utmost importance as it would add much not only to the security of the trade of canada but the united states in general give a well grounded hope of rescuing the fisheries from great britain which will most essentially injure her marine while it would lay a foundation on which to build one of our own—it would confine the enemy to one harbor—and if that new york should be taken from them deprive them of every port in america thereby adding greatly to the security of our shipping upon this coast—they would in that case have no port in which they cd heave down and refit their heavy ships their west india islands if any should remain to them would be considerably distressed in the article of lumber—and lastly another province nova scotia which sometime ago was very desirous of it would be added to the federal union— having given these general ideas respecting the objects which invite to military enterprises i will next make an estimate of the force which in my judgment is necessary to each but it must be established as positions— first—that to undertake the reduction of new york upon a well grounded plan indeed with any hope of success we must not only have a superior naval force but a moral certainty of maintaining it and that that force or part of it ought if possible to be in possession of the harbor to cover the besiegers secure their communications and facilitate transportation—at the same time that the enemy thereby are effectually deprived of succors and supplies second—that to undertake the reduction of charles town—or hallifax without having and holding such naval force would be folly in the extreme third—that tho a naval force would be advantageous and might greatly facilitate the entire conquest of canada it is not absolutely necessary to the establishment of a force in the heart of the country in a siege of quebec—for the purpose of convoying ordnance stores and provisions proper for it—and depriving the enemy of all succor by sea a few ships in the st laurence frigates might answer would be highly necessary     the above being the basis on which either of the enterprises here mentioned should be undertaken i think upon every rule of military propriety we should have for the attempt against new york three times the force which compose the garrison of it to enable us to carry on the siege with spirit and vigor and to give a well grounded hope of a successful issue less than this number considering the posts we shall have to occupy and communications to establish would reduce us to one point of attack or subject us to the hazard of being beaten in detail if we attempted two when the propriety of approaching the city by the way of brooklyn and york island at or about the same time is so obviously necessary to a vigorous siege that nothing but inability should dispence with it upon this calculation then new york will require—  000 men but as it may be difficult to obtain these as a less number in a greater space of time may effect the reduction of the place and as an attempt even under these disadvantages may be preferable to any other enterprise it may be asked— first—what is the smallest number of men with which the siege of n york can be undertaken under these circumstances second—to how late a period of the campaign can the commencement of the operations be delayed without hazarding a defeat from the cold of the autumn third—whether we may rely absolutely upon the support of the fleet during the operation be it long or short—early or late in the season the orders of the court of france or the admiral alone can determine the last but with respect to the other two i think   000 effective men fifteen thousand of which to be regular troops have a tolerable good chance of reducing the post in less than three months—consequently the commencement ought not to be delayd beyond the first of september—as the difficulty proceeding from the want of wood alone will be found almost if not quite insurmountable especially upon york island where there is not a stick unless we can secure the navigation     of the no river by passing a frigate or two above the enemys works— charles town and savanna are here classed together because there can be little doubt of the latters being united to the former upon the first appearance of a movement that way if it can be done for this service i should suppose  000 men in addition to the regular force with genl greene and such aids as the country can throw in if necessary will be fully competent to the enterprise which cannot on acct of the heat and sickly season be commenced before october— canada if the expedition is sufficiently masked it will not require to march by land more than  000 men for altho some accounts make the force of the enemy in that country equal to this number yet dispersed as it is and so far apart if the intention is concealed till the moment of execution and the movements are then rapid it will be impossible to assemble it in time to oppose such a body two thousand in addition to these to go round by water as has been already mentioned and for the purpose expressed would make a firm establishment in the heart of that country and very probably reduce every post in it by january except quebec the conquest of which as has been observed before depends upon contingencies if the expedition is wholly conducted by land about the first of september will be the best time to begin the march on account of the roads the waters and the provision for harvest being then over bread and forage will be plenty on the routes the army will move and in canada and it will be too late for the enemy to send reinforcements or supplies into that country— if it is to be by land and water the sooner perhaps it commences the better because a supply of provisions can be sent round in the transports and the ships of war will cut of all succor to the enemy and their supplies of every kind hallifax i can say less to than any other object having no late accts of the strength of the works number of the garrison or temper of     the inhabitants by the best information however which i have been able to obtain the first has been encreased and considerably strengthened within the last two or three years the second may be about what i have estimated them at and with regard to the third nothing decisive can be said the whole amount of the militia of that government is about  000 and some time ago they were very desirous of being united with the confederated states of america but what changes or revolutions may have taken place in their system of politicks from the little or no prospect of emancipation held up to them i cannot undertake to determine—under the best view of the matter i have i should think less than  000 men would be inadequate burmuda being rather extraneous was not taken into the general view but as it is a harbor from which many privateers are sent to annoy our trade as great part of the inhabitants are well affected to the american cause—wish to be connected with us and depend in a very great degree upon america for subsistence it may not be amiss to give it some consideration as circumstances in the course of the campaign may lead to the conquest of this island without incurring much expence or interfering with other plans—policy in this case may invite the measure whether it is adopted with a view of retaining or ceding the island by way of composition at a general pacification— the force on the island by the best accounts i have had thence does not exceed three or  00 invalids in unimportant works commanded by higher ground within a short distance one  0 gun ship and three or four frigates with about  000 land troops to be transported in the frigates would be competent it is conceived to the reduction of this island if the enterprise is properly conducted and accompanied in the first instance with such offers as will be pleasing to the inhabitants having in the preceding pages pointed to the different objects which present themselves to view the strength of each and the force requisite for its subduction i shall next give my ideas of the mode of attacking them—or such of them—as my knowledge     of their situation will enable me to form a judgment upon and first of new york the mode of attacking this place must depend in a great measure upon a pretty accurate knowledge of what our force will be at the time fixed upon for the commencement of the operations for if it should be adjudged competent—and the measure in its nature practicable without considerable loss we ought in my opinion to make two approaches at or about the same time if it is not the principal part of our force must be conducted to one point and the attack must succeed instead of being combined with each other in either case the approaches may differ the fairest way therefore of determining upon the best is to consider first—the present situation of the force we are actually possessed of second—from whence our succors are to come third—the points from whence our provisions siege artillery military stores boats and other supplies are to be drawn and fourth—which is essentially necessary—whether possession of the interior harbor of new york by the french fleet can be so far depended upon as to warrant anterior movements which may prove pernicious if this event should not happen—and above all whether it will engage to cooperate to the end of the siege be it long or short with respect to the first it is very immaterial so far as the continental troops are concerned because they can be moved to any point with almost equal convenience—but if the french army is to march by land from virginia their going to staten island one of the approaches to brooklyn or to westchester will make a difference of ten days allowing for the passage of the north river as i shall include maryland among the states which will be called upon for militia—and new york is nearly as convenient to one point as another  0  ths of the whole requisition will be demanded of connecticut and the states eastward of it     ths of  00 new jersey and those south of it and the remaining    ths will come from new york—which is full information respecting the second article of succors— with respect to the third the greatest part of the siege artillery a large proportion of shott shells and other military stores lay at philadelphia and in the jerseys the boats are in the north river and eastward of it and a good deal of the powder is deposited at west point and in the vicinity of it—the flour is to be transported principally from new jersey and the states southward of it—and the beef will come on foot from the eastward— on the  th article i can form no decisive opinion but full and absolute possession of the harbor is of such immense importance in an attack upon new york and will contribute so much to the security of our communications safety of our convoys and speedy reduction of the garrison that no means ought in my opinion to be left unessayed to accomplish it and in the weak and defenceless state the harbor is in at present nothing would be more easy and certain than to effect this by surprize if the squadron destined for this coast could detach previous to its sailing from the west indies a few ships to gain possession thereby facilitating the entrance of the others which might and indeed ought speedily to follow— the lines on york island and the works at brooklyn are the two avenues to the town to arrive at the first there is but one way except it can be done by stratagem which is too precarious to be admitted into any plan and that is by forcing the passage of harlaem river—the approach to the second may be either by staten island or frogs neck if it should be preferred to morrissania each of which supposing the fleet to be in possession of the bay which is to be considered as a basis has its advantages as follows— staten island would in the very commencement of our movements to invest new york give us all the advantages of a full intercourse and perfect cooperation with the fleet would afford protection to it under all circumstances and at all seasons even supposing it to be blockaded by a superior navy would be convenient to the french troops marching from virginia—more convenient to any which may arrive in the fleet to debark at than any other place more advantageous on account of the heavy artillery stores c which may come in or belong to the fleet or which shall be transported from phila or virginia by water and much more convenient to all such as shall be transported by land from either of these places or the furnaces in n jersey —it will be nearer to our supplies of bread and flour more contiguous to brooklyn and much more so to bergen and paulus hook —it cuts off with the assistance of a ship or two in the sound every possibility of a retreat of the enemy and more than probably would possess unexpectedly the forage and other resources which they may be holding in reserve on staten and long island while they attempt to forage or destroy the grain and grass in westchester with a view of depriving us of them besides the reasons here given we should be more convenient to the forage of jersey and the states south of it from whence the greater part of this article must come and it might act as a stimulus to the militia of those states as their march would be shortened by it frogs neck or morrissania is equally indeed more convenient to the continental troops and york militia than staten island and is much more  0  so to the militia eastward of the north river it is more convenient on account of the boats and our beef cattle it will also be an advantageous position so soon as a force sufficient to maintain it can be assembled—it looks equally to york and long island and may have works thrown up to facilitate the passage to either or both as circumstances may point—while the enemy by being suspended between the two will either neglect one or weaken both the communication between the main and long island may be rendered easier and more secure consequently a retreat in case of a disaster safer by the way of frogs neck or morrissania than by that of staten island because in the first case there is only one water to cross which may be covered by batteries—and in the other two one of which from staten to long island is rather difficult and uncertain and should we not possess or by any mischance loose the command of the bay between the narrows and the city might become very dangerous—on the other hand our land communication from the place of disembarkation will when we are established before brooklyn  0  not only be much shorter by the way of staten island but more secure than the other by frogs neck or morrissania as the first may be reduced to about two miles of good road with a covered flank—the latter will be at least twelve of rugged road with a flank exposed to partezan strokes of the enemy from new york the greatest part of the way under this state of matters it is not easy to determine on which side to incline—to approach by the way of westchester seems to be the safest by staten island the most convenient if the latter should be adopted it will more than probable draw the principal part if not the whole of the enemys force from the north end of york island to the city—but whether it does or not there should be a body of five or  000 militia and a few continental troops in the vicinity of kings bridge to complete the investiture of the island establish communications and be ready to take advantage of circumstances if the former should be preferred the effect will be reversed and except the guards which may be necessary for the city and the stores that are in it the whole force of the enemy will i expect take a position at mcgowans heights where the island being narrow and ground commanding they could maintain themselves in the works they now have or could soon throw up against numbers much superior to their own and would only be drawn from it by a movement to brooklyn by way of morrissania or frogs neck upon the whole if our force was such as to enable us to make two attacks and each division was decidedly superior to the enemys whole force i should in that case be of opinion— that we had better approach new york by the way of staten island and westchester at the same time because by beginning at the two extreme points we shall distract the enemy and oblige them to give up one or weaken themselves at both ends of york island if it is not sufficient i then think—  0  that the safety of operating by the way of westchester the advantages of looking to two points—viz—york and long island at the same time and of assembling our force and advancing as we acquire strength and can do it with safety is to be preferred to the conveniency of staten island—especially as the propriety of approaching by the latter depends upon the position of the french fleet of which we can have no previous assurance charles town if charles town should be the object of the campaign the french and other troops destined for this service must be transported by water—so must the siege and other artillery ordnance and other stores flour salt provision salt and spirits a land transportation of artillery and military stores adequate to the siege of this place would in our circumstances be found impracticable and to march men thither by land would as we have too often experienced already dissipate half of them by sickness desertion and other causes the artillery and saddle horses might go by land and by preceding the embarkation of the troops reach some given point by the time the transports arrive at the post to which they are destined— for the voyage and support of the troops in the first stages of the siege—till the resources of the country can be collected—we ought to go provided with at least two months provision—three would be still better philadelphia under present circumstances and appearances seems best adapted for the embarkation as a sufficient number of transports may probably be had there and any number if brought there can be fitted for the accommodation of troops the most convenient and advantageous place to debark at would be stone inlet provided the banks of the river bearing that name and seperating johns and james islands are not possessed and fortified by the enemy—this inlet while that of charles town is in possession of the enemy not only affords the best harbor for the transports but is the most convenient approach from the sea to the city the most advantageous for forming a junction with the troops under the command of majr  0  genl greene and for cutting off the retreat of the garrison of savanna to charles town and measures must be previously taken by genl greene to prevent their doing it to st augustine by land— to go into a minute detail of the approaches from the place of debarkation to the enemys lines before charles town is more than i am able to do but charles town neck must be possessed in force and to do it the ashley river must be crossed as near their works as it can be done with safety our principal operation will be on this neck between the rivers ashley and cowper and a secure communication must be established by the nearest convenient route from hence to the shipping in stone inlet which as it will lye exposed to the enemys whole force will be a good deal exposed while they have the command of the harbor of charles town canada if an expedition into this country should be adopted from choice or necessity—it must be conducted either by land wholly or by land and water conjointly according to circumstances the last is to be preferred but the former may do—i shall point to the measures which to me appear necessary in both cases—and first by land the army should commence its march in the columns—the right column to proceed by the way of connecticut river coos and hazens new road the left by albany bennington manchester shrewsbury and otter creek keeping lake champlain on the left and the green mountain on the right till the junction is formed which should be about the river michiscone five or   miles from the canada line and may be by bringing them together more at right angles at the river a la moelle if circumstances should require the junction sooner or if it should be conceived more beneficial on acct of water carriage and the communications which may be useful hereafter in case we should obtain the command of lake champlain which we ought never  0  to lose sight of—the left column may advance by the way of fort edward fort anne south bay and ticonderoga to the other road by bennington and form a junction with it or otter creek the march of the two columns shoud be so ordered as that each may arrive at the place destined for the junction at the same time and for this purpose the best judgment of the march of each should be previously formed and a mode of corresponding fixed on to regulate the advances by afterwards the left column as it will be more exposed than the right will have the most extensive communication and the greatest difficulty to open and secure it should consist of  000 men the other of  000—both ought to have french troops in them that the canadians in any stage of the march may have ocular proof of our alliance with france and their cooperation with us some cavalry should march with each column and all the indians that can be obtained the object of this expedition should be masked as long as the nature of the movements can possibly conceal it and the march afterwards should be with as much celerity as it can be performed without injury to the troops the first object of the troops should be to penetrate into the heart of the country before the enemy can assemble their scattered forces and take such a position as will prevent the junction of them afterwards the country of st denis between the sorrel and st lawrence seems well situated to answer this end to effect this and prepare for the winter cantonments and subsistence of the army is all that can be counted upon without heavy artillery—to transport which and the stores necessary to it by land would be next to impossible but when the frost closes the lake chamn the enemys armed vessels therein must be possessed or destroyed or if neither of these can be done nor the post at st johns reduced then to establish one at the isle aux noix that we may by cutting the enemy off from lake champlain open a communication by water for our siege artillery and heavy stores in the spring if any thing further is undertaken in the course of the winter it must be from the circumstances of the moment and not consequential  0  of any general and preconcerted plan—one or two armed boats with sails should be built in the course of the winter at a post which may be established at the south end of lake champlain fort anne for instance and a sufficient number of batteaux should be transported from the north river to the same place while the sledding is favorable this season should also be embraced for transporting the heavy artillery stores and provisions from the one water to the other in the first instance our provision of the meat kind will transport itself and it is expected that the upper parts of connecticut river and the new hampshire grants or vermont as it is called with such aid as canada can afford will supply the flour our baggage should be light and as field artillery only will be taken our movements may be quick land and water the only difference between this and the last is that our heavy artillery provisions and stores may go in the first instance by water with such an additional force as will enable us to commence the siege of quebec or some other capital post immediately and that the expedition may be undertaken without a moments unnecessary delay—and the earlier the better—as the french fleet in the st lawrence will intercept succors and supplies by water to the enemy if any should be attempted—whereas if it is confined to a land operation altogether it must be delayed till august on acct of harvest and because it may be too late after that for the enemy to reinforce till next year hallifax provisions and every article necessary for the siege must be transported thither with the force destined for the expedition as there can be no dependence upon the country the best place to debark the troops at is sambro bay by the light house about    miles from hallifax and to march by jerusalem to the reverse of the town which is more accessable and was least fortified how it may be now i cannot say  0  penobscot alone is scarcely an object but might be visited en passant in the expedition to hallifax or canada by water and would give some eclat to either of those enterprises for the fall of it can scarcely be doubted if attempted if the enterprise is unconnected with any other object   00 men will be sufficient to employ on the expedition bermuda some good and no bad consequences can result from an attempt to take this island by surprise to effect it the ships destined for this expedition should hoist british colors as soon as they get in sight of land and adopt every other means to carry on the deception untill proper pilots are procured at the west end of the island the ships should next pursue their course as near the south side of the island as prudence will admit when they arrive opposite the mouth of castle harbor—all except one or two should immediately enter and begin the attack on the castle without loss of time the other ships should continue their course a few miles further and bring to about a mile distance from the mouth of st georges harbor to prevent the escape of any vessels from thence if this could be done in the night and troops landed under that cover it is more than probable the castle and consequently the island might be carried without much if any opposition for it is presumed very little would come from the inhabitants who have often expressed a wish to be united with america and enjoy the benefits of its support  end of vol ix   arnold   general leslie sailed from new york on the   th of october with about three thousand troops he was instructed to enter the chesapeake and

sufficiently acquainted with the situation of the country above to give an opinion upon the propriety of evacuating fort schuyler and establishing a post lower down at any rate this could not be done before the new post was in sufficient forwardness to receive the garrison immediately upon the evacuation of the old and this i take it under our present circumstances would be a work of considerable time it is a matter which will much depend upon the prevailing sentiment in the state which is more immediately interested in the measure and as you have mentioned your opinion upon the subject to his excellency the governor he will i imagine take the necessary steps to have the measure adopted should it be deemed eligible—washington to colonel william malcolm    october    0 on the   th of october brigadiergeneral james clinton was placed in command of albany and instructed as follows you will be particularly attentive to the post of fort schuyler and do every thing in your power to have it supplied with a good stock of provision and stores and you will take every other precaution which the means at your command will permit for the security of the frontier giving me the most early advice of any incursions of the enemy   i beg leave to mention general greene upon this occasion to congress as an officer in whose abilities fortitude and integrity from a long and intimate experience of them i have the most entire confidence—in the command he is going into he will have every disadvantage to struggle with the confidence and support of congress which it will be his ambition to merit will be essential to his success the defect of military resources in the southern department—the confusion in which the affairs of it must for some time be require that the commanding officer should be vested with extensive powers i dare say congress will take their measures in a manner suited to the exigency—general greene waits upon them for their orders— as in a great measure a new army is to be formed to the southward the presence of the baron de steuben will in my opinion be of more essential utility in that quarter than here where through the ensuing campaign we shall have the greatest part of our force raw recruits yet as we are organized and in some order the subinspectors will suffice for the purposes of the department i therefore submit to congress the propriety of sending the baron de steuben to the southern army the sooner they are pleased to announce their pleasure on this head the better—washington to the president of congress    october    0 to steuben washington wrote on the same day though i am sensible how important your services will be in this quarter yet as to the southward there is an army to be created the mass of which is at present without any formation at all your services there will be still more essential and as i am persuaded that your inclination is to be wherever you can be most useful i have recommended it to congress to send you with general greene to the southern army if congress approve you will take his orders and proceed as speedily as possible i wish you may have been able previously to obtain a satisfactory establishment of your department which in your absence will become more necessary than it has been heretofore but if it is not done i would not have it detain you congress by a formal resolve approved the appointment of majorgeneral greene and invested him with all the powers formerly conferred on general gates and the additional one of negotiating an exchange of prisoners his command included all the regular troops raised at the south from the state of delaware to georgia inclusive—journals october  0th col charles harrison was ordered to go with greene to take command of he artillery   a similar letter was

proper train first to give full  complete powers to congress competent to all purposes of war secondly by loans  taxes to put our finances on a more respectable footing than they are at present and thirdly that they will endeavor to establish a permanent force—these things will secure our independency beyond dispute—but to go on in our present system—civil as well as military—is an useless and vain attempt—it is idle to suppose that raw and undisciplined men are fit to oppose regular troops—and if they were our present military system is too expensive for any fund except that of an eastern nabob—and in the civil line instead of one head and director we have or soon will have thirteen which is as much a monster in politicks as it would be in the human form—our prest distresses and future prospects of distress arising from these and similar causes is great beyond the powers of description and without a change must end in our ruin—washington to william fitzhugh    october    0   when general greene joined the southern army it was general gates wish that the court of inquiry might be immediately convened it is true said he there are some evidences i could wish were here that cannot at present be procured but innocence and integrity induce me to be confident that the honor and justice of the court of inquiry will make every allowance for that deficiency a council of general officers decided however that in the state of the army at that time it was not practicable for a court to be summoned it would interfere with important operations and render it necessary to call baron steuben from virginia where his services were essential the time of assembling the court was accordingly deferred and general gates retired to his residence in the county of berkeley in virginia   the marquis de lafayette being now in command of the six battalions of light infantry stationed in advance of the main army was extremely anxious to effect some important enterprise before the campaign should be brought to a close a descent upon staten island had been projected which was to be conducted by him but it was rendered impracticable by the want of boats and of other necessary preparations he had written a letter to general washington to which the above was a reply urging for various political reasons an attack upon the upper part of new york island   i have now the pleasure to congratulate you upon your exchange    i do not mean by this notice to hasten your return to the army for that alas is upon the eve of its annual dissolution consequently of the enemys advantages i am of opinion that your influence and exertion in procuring the states quota of troops for the war providing funds for the subsistence of them magazines c will be of infinitely more importance in your own state this winter than it can be to become a mere spectator or fellow sufferer of the hunger and cold from scantiness of provision and cloathing which i expect the small remains of our army will have to encounter in a very short time and more than probably to contend with during the winter but at the same time i give this as an opinion and i leave you at full liberty to pursue the bent of

of his office and act with more efficiency than his predecessor count de rochambeau also said he is one of our best lieutenantgenerals and a most firm man by the french officers generally the change seems to have been considered auspicious for the operations in america   this plan was not approved by count de rochambeau news had lately arrived of the appointment of a new minister of marine of the preparation of a grand armament at brest and the assembling of a large spanish force at cadiz which it was rumored would be under the command of count destaing and there was every probability in the opinion of count de rochambeau that despatches from the french ministry would very soon arrive which would contain a plan of operations in this view he could not with propriety engage in any measures which might thwart such a plan it was moreover his belief that the spanish commander in the west indies had his course of action marked out by definite instructions and would not assume the responsibility of sending a squadron to transport the french and american troops to the south again the chevalier de monteil the french admiral commanding in the west indies had only a small force in those seas since the departure of m de guichen for europe and would not be able to furnish such a number of vessels from his squadron as would ensure a naval superiority on the american coast the chevalier de ternay died at newport on the   th of december after a short illness he was succeeded in the command of the fleet by the chevalier destouches who replied to the above letter in relation to his department that the season was extremely unfavorable to the project in question the northeasterly winds were so prevalent and strong that he did not think the spanish vessels could lie at anchor off rhode island and he also agreed with count de rochambeau in believing that the spanish officers would consider themselves so rigidly bound by their instructions as to deter them from listening to proposals that would divert them from the enterprise in which they were engaged he added that his own squadron could not be put into a condition to depart by reason of a deficiency in the

reasons also have weight with me first if the enemy make this detachment without which nothing material will happen in the south and if the intelligence be true about the fast recruiting of the six

the command upon an officer of the state this being the case i do not think the charge of the enterprise could have been committed to better hands than colo clarks i have not the pleasure of knowing the gentleman but independent of the proofs he has given of his activity and address the unbounded confidence which i am told the western people repose in him is a matter of vast importance as i imagine a considerable part of his force will consist of volunteers and militia who are not to be governed by military laws but must be held by the ties of confidence and affection to their leader i shall conclude with recommending to you in general to give every countenance and assistance to this enterprise should no circumstances intervene to prevent its execution one thing you may rest assured of and that is that while offensive operations are going forwd against detroit and the indians in alliance with the british in that quarter your posts with small garrisons in them and proper vigilance

enemy are mostly mounted militia not to be overtaken by our infantry nor to be safely pursued in this strong country by our cavalry our fear is that instead of meeting us they would slip by us into this province were we to proceed far from it and might again stimulate the disaffected to serious insurrection this apprehension must greatly circumscribe our efforts—lord rawdon to general leslie

by water to cape fear river that his purpose might be unsuspected he engaged pilots for james river and nobody but himself and two officers were entrusted with the secret of his destination he left the chesapeake on the   th of november and went to sea he did not stop at cape fear as he at first proposed but arrived in charleston on the   th of december after a tempestuous voyage and marched thence with a large part of his force to form a junction with lord cornwallis in consequence of this movement of general leslie it was resolved to send another body of troops to the chesapeake this detachment said sir henry clinton in a letter to lord george germaine is under the command of general arnold with whom i thought it right to send colonels dundas and simcoe as being officers of experience and much in my confidence the objects of this expedition are nearly the same as those of the one under majorgeneral leslie but rather more positive as to the establishment of a post at portsmouth on the elizabeth river i have also directed general arnold to prepare materials for building a number of boats that we may as soon as possible have a naval force in albemarle sound which force when the season is too far advanced for it to act in those waters may be employed to great advantage in the rivers of the chesapeake—ms letter december       0 the expedition consisted of

overboard arnold was instructed to strike at the magazines of the americans should an opportunity of doing it without risk offer itself and to assemble and arm the loyalists but not to encourage any

that one sergeant or more from each regiment should be delegated to meet at his quarters and make known their grievances this was done and among the others came a sergeant one williams a poor creature or fond of liquor and a deserter from the british having been taken prisoner at princeton enlisted in de lanceys battalion and deserted at kingsbridge whom the mutineers had chosen to be their commander their complaints were that many soldiers had been detained beyond the term of their enlistment that the arrearages of pay and the depreciation had not been made up and that they were suffering every privation for want of money and clothes a mode of redress was pointed out by general wayne and the colonels which seemed to satisfy the delegated sergeants and they agreed to use their efforts to bring over the minds of the others but the attempt was ineffectual and they all marched the next day january  th to princeton those who were well disposed and willing to separate from the

in it and the probable means of giving satisfaction to the soldiery upon the first two heads you have no need of any instructions what seems to me most essentially necessary to answer the end of the third is an immediate supply of money and cloathing of the first a sum equal to three months pay at least of the new emission or some other of equal value of the last a compleat suit of clothes not only for the men now in service but for the number of recruits who are to join that you may be able to speak fully upon the article of cloathing i will inform you minutely of our present supply and future prospects the few men who remain in service will with difficulty find a sufficiency of shirts vests breeches and stockings to carry them thro the winter of coats we are very deficient when those which are in the hands of the agents are brought forward there will not be more than one third of what are wanting thus you perceive that the old soldiers will have occasion for a full supply of cloathing when they take the field and that the recruits except they are furnished by their respective states must be absolutely destitute we may obtain some supplies from france between this time and the spring but we have been so often disappointed from that quarter that prudence dictates the impolicy of placing dependence upon it i have been speaking of the northern army only general greene represents the southern as literally naked and therefore should there be an arrival from europe a great part must be applied to that army as the southern states have not resources within them i have hitherto only spoken of a sum of money equal to three months pay but it is possible that a further sum may be necessary and that of specie to give new bounties to those soldiers who were early

would listen and for two or three days the officers were in a state of extreme anxiety they were somewhat relieved by an incident which is thus related in a letter from general wayne about four oclock yesterday morning we were waked by two sergeants who produced a letter from the enemy enclosed in a small piece of tealead they also brought under guard two caitiffs who undertook to deliver it to the leaders of the malecontents one of these culprits says he is a sergeant in odells newly raised corps and was promised a considerable reward on bringing back an answer the soldiers in general affect to

original enlistment could not be produced by the oath of the soldier   to give immediate certificates for the depreciation on their pay and to settle averages as soon as circumstances would admit   to

pennsylvania to whom the former delegated their powers the mutineers as yet hold command but we have expectations of reclaiming it in appearance at least either this evening or tomorrow morning however i believe it will be the most advisable measure to dissolve the line and collect it anew as well and expeditiously as we can the spies were executed yesterday pursuant to their sentence—trenton january   th general heath had taken some indirect measures to ascertain the sentiments of the soldiers as to the conduct of the pennsylvania line particularly of those constituting the detachment ordered to be in readiness to march a woman was sent into one regiment to listen to the conversation of the men and she heard them say that they would have no hand in putting down the pennsylvanians the representations of a sergeant had been received and credited in another case and general heaths steward told him that he had heard the men declare that they would not march from west point till they were paid and clothed the subject of yours of yesterday is of so delicate a nature that i am almost afraid it will be productive of ill consequences to have it handled even by the most prudent officers in the most cautious manner to seem to draw into question the fidelity and firmness of the soldiers or even to express a doubt of their obedience may occasion such a relaxation of discipline as would not otherwise exist i could wish to have these matters treated with the greatest prudence by the officers and not conversed upon before their domestics as i am apprehensive has sometimes incautiously been practised—washington to heath    january        in conformity with the instructions from congress to colonel laurens that he should consult general washington on the objects of his mission before his departure for france he proceeded to headquarters for that purpose the substance of their consultations was embodied in the form of a letter which it was intended colonel laurens should use in such a manner as he might think proper he introduced copious extracts from it into a memorial which he presented to count de vergennes and which is contained in the diplomatic correspondence of the american revolution vol ix p     those extracts differ in some slight particulars from the copy here printed which is taken from general washingtons letterbooks the original letter in the handwriting of general washington was likewise sent to count de vergennes by colonel laurens or dr franklin and is still preserved among the american papers in the archives of foreign affairs in paris—sparks   in introducing col laurens to franklin washington wrote the present infinitely critical posture of our affairs made it essential in the opinion of congress to send from hence a person who had been an eyewitness of their progress and who was capable of placing them before the court of france in a more full and striking point of light than was proper or even practicable by any written communication it was also judged of great importance that the person should be able to give a military view of them and to enter into military details and arrangements the choice has fallen upon colonel laurens as a gentleman who unites all these advantages and adds to them an integrity and an independence of character which render him superior to any spirit of party what i have said to him i beg leave to repeat to you that to me nothing appears more evident than that the period of our opposition will very shortly arrive if our allies cannot afford us that effectual aid particularly in money and in a naval superiority which are now solicited colonel laurens is so fully possessed of my ideas of our situation and wants and has himself so thorough a knowledge of them that i should trouble you to no purpose by enlarging you may place entire confidence in him and in the assurance that i am with the warmest sentiments of respect esteem and regard

undertaking in arms to dictate terms to their country—   january      and to governor livingston i doubt not we shall derive every aid from the good people of your state in suppressing this mutiny not only from a conviction of the dangerous tendency of such proceedings to effect the entire dissolution of the army but as it may effect civil as well as military authority to have a redress of grievances demanded with arms and also from a sense of the unreasonable conduct of the jersey troops in revolting at a time when the state was exerting itself to redress all their real grievances—

parties concerned in the victualling and treatment of those unfortunate people their several testimonies you must have seen and i give you my honor that the transaction was conducted with such strict care and impartiality that you may rely on its validity permit me now sir to request that you will take the proper steps to cause mr bradford your commissary and the jailor at philadelphia to abate that inhumanity which they exercise indiscriminately upon all people who are so unfortunate as to be carried into that place i will not trouble you sir with a catalogue of grievances further than to request that the unfortunate may feel as little of the severities of war as the circumstances of the time will permit that in future they may not be fed in winter with salted clams and that they may be afforded a sufficiency of fuel   the mutineers were unexpectedly surrounded and awed into an unconditional surrender with little hesitation and no resistance two of the principal actors were executed on the spot the rest pardoned the spirit of mutiny seems now to have completely subsided and to have given place to a genuine repentance this was very far from being the case previous to this step notwithstanding the apparent submission which the assurances of redress had produced they still continued insolent and refractory and disobedient to the commands of their officers a general pardon was promised by colonel dayton on condition of an immediate and full return to duty this condition was not performed on the part of the mutineers and of course they were not entitled to the benefit of the promise besides which the existence of the army called for an example—washington to governor livingston    january      the two persons executed were david gilmore of the somerset county regiment and isaac tuttle of the morris county regiment the mutineers were said to have been led by one george grant a sergeantmajor of the  d new jersey regiment and a deserter from the british the conduct of the detachment under general howe drew out high praise from washington i cannot omit doing justice to the detachment which was sent on this service there was in its behavior every mark of fidelity obedience disapprobation of the conduct of the mutineers and a conviction of the necessity of bringing them to submission and punishment they made a long march over mountainous roads and through a deep snow with the greatest patience and obeyed every order with alacrity—washington to meshech weare january        you will have heard of the defection of the pennsylvania line and the disagreeable compromise made with them it has ended in a temporary dissolution of the line one half has been absolutely discharged and the remainder have been furloughed to reassemble in the beginning of april the oaths of the men respecting the terms of their enlistments were precipitately admitted before the documents could be produced by which it afterwards appeared that the greater part had perjured themselves to get rid of the service we had it not in our power to employ coercion in the first instance owing to the distance they were from the main army and a variety of other impediments which you will easily conceive i am told the line will soon be reestablished on a better footing by new enlistments fortunately a part of the jersey line since followed their example and gave us an opportunity after compelling all the mutineers to an unconditional surrender to make examples of two of the most active leaders the perfect submission and penitence which appeared made it unadvisable to extend the severity i believe we shall have no more trouble at present from a spirit of this kind—washington to steuben   february        washington wrote robinson   general robertson

ward of the massachusetts delegation declining to ballot general sullivan added the choice of a minister of war is postponed to the  st of october this was a manœuvre of samuel adams and others from the north fearing that as i was in nomination the choice would fall on me who having apostatized from the true new england faith by sometimes voting with the southern states am not eligible they were not however acquainted with all the circumstances i was nominated against my will and if chosen should not have accepted general mcdougall is appointed minister of marine   i am equally well pleased

that virginia has yielded her claim to the country west of the ohio great good i hope will result from these measures the first will undoubtedly enable congress to speak with more decision in their requisitions of the respective states—without which it is physically impossible to prosecute the war with success great as our expences are the other will smooth the way  aid taxation by reconciling jarring interests removing jealousies and establishing a fund there are other measures lately adopted in congress with which i am highly pleased—the establishing of ministers in place of boards for the departments of war finance and foreign affairs—proper powers to and a judicious choice of men to fill these departments will soon lead us to system order  œconomy—without which our affairs already on the brink of ruin would soon have been passed redemption i enjoy by anticipation the benefit of these resolves—i hear with infinite pleasure though no nomination has yet taken place that you are generally spoken of for the department of war at the same time i learn with pain from colo hamilton that your acceptance of it is doubtful if the choice should fall on you i am perfectly aware of all your objections i feel their force but they ought not to prevail our affairs are brought to an awful crisis nothing will recover them but the vigorous exertions of men of abilities who know our wants

blockading the french fleet at newport was stationed during the winter in gardiners bay at the east end of long island the vessels were anchored in a line between gardiners island and plum island the naval force kept on this station was of course superior to that of the french at newport it consisted of one ship of ninety guns four of seventyfour three of sixtyfour one of fifty and two or three frigates on the  0th of january two french frigates and a transport laden with various supplies for the fleet set sail from boston harbor they arrived safely at newport after encountering three severe gales the commander of the british squadron had gained intelligence of their departure from boston and sent out two lineofbattle ships and two frigates to intercept them these vessels were driven back by the violence of the winds and in the night of the   d much damage was sustained by the british fleet in gardiners bay when the morning dawned a sixtyfour was discovered standing to the south of montauk point under jurymasts the culloden seventyfour was on a reef near gardiners island and the bedford seventyfour was off new london all her masts having been carried away and her upper tier of guns thrown overboard the culloden was finally lost but her masts and guns were used to repair the two other ships the america a sixtyfour was driven out to sea and was supposed at first to be lost but she returned on the  th of february without injury as soon as the news of this disaster reached m destouches he despatched an officer to plum island to observe the condition of the british fleet intending to go out with all his force and attack it should circumstances encourage the attempt by the officers report however the fleet appeared too strong notwithstanding its recent injuries and the anchorage too judiciously chosen between the islands to render an attack advisable m destouches immediately resolved on another scheme which the present state of affairs enabled him to execute the chevalier de la luzerne at the solicitation of the governor of virginia and of congress had requested that if possible a ship of the line and some frigates might be sent into the chesapeake bay to oppose arnold the british force was so much weakened by the damage done to the three ships that m destouches could now without hazard spare a corresponding detachment from his own fleet he determined therefore to send a sixtyfour and two frigates to the chesapeake for the purpose of blocking up arnolds squadron and of cooperating with the american troops on land this detachment was commanded by m de tilly and sailed from newport on the  th of february count de rochambeau offered to furnish a division of land forces but this was thought unnecessary and inexpedient as the movement was intended to be rapid and only to cut off arnolds communication by water it being presumed that the continental troops and militia in virginia were sufficient to operate against him by land—rochambeaus ms

vessels of his squadron to the chesapeake as mentioned heretofore the idea appeared in so favorable a light to washington that although he was on the eve of a departure for newport he delayed his journey to prepare for sending a detachment of land forces to cooperate with such an expedition some advices which i have received will detain me here longer than i expected i am to desire you will immediately have all the light companies of the troops under your command completed to fifty rank and file each and will assemble the whole without delay at peekskill they must be completed with shoes and as far as possible with all other necessaries for a march to morristown as it will be a pretty expeditious one it is an additional reason for having the men robust and in other respects well chosen the adjutantgeneral must carefully inspect them when formed and exchange all whom he does not approve i wish the light troops to be ready to march from peekskill by the   th at farthest i shall

count de rochambeau did not receive this letter till the   th which was ten days after the departure of m de tillys detachment it was not then practicable for him and m destouches to unite in carrying the plan here suggested into effect more especially as the british blockading squadron had been strengthened by repairing the disabled vessels and that of m destouches was weakened by the absence of three of his ships in this state of things there would be too great a risk in going to sea with a force so much inferior count de rochambeau wrote that if the above plan had come to his hands before the sailing of the detachment to virginia it was probable m destouches would have determined to go out with his whole fleet and in that case he should have spared one thousand land troops for the

yorktown and burnt four others about five hundred prisoners were taken admiral arbuthnot had sent a messenger to arnold giving intelligence of the approach of the french squadron and had thus put him on his guard he had withdrawn his frigates one of fortyfour and two others of thirtytwo guns each so high up the elizabeth river that they could not be approached by the eveillé the largest french vessel and one of the french frigates the surveillante ran aground in that river and was got off only by taking out her guns and casks of water an extract from m de tillys letter to the chevalier de la luzerne will explain his situation and the motives for his return whatever desire i may have said he to comply with the wishes of m destouches and transport myself to all the parts of the chesapeake bay into which the forces of arnold could be withdrawn it is not possible for me with my vessel to penetrate to the retreat in which he has taken shelter the shallowness of the water does not allow me to ascend nearer to him than within about four leagues i should run the hazard of being blockaded myself if i were to remain long here and without a hope of doing harm to the enemy i

rochambeau at newport whom it was important for him to consult on the subject of his mission the legislature declined granting the power to impress and the rumor that such a thing was in agitation had so alarmed the sailors that some concealed themselves and others fled from the town when colonel laurens returned therefore very little progress had been made in obtaining men the legislature offered

speaking of their services and sacrifices in the army and their devotedness to the cause of their country they add we flatter ourselves that we have gained and possess the affection of our soldiery we have certainly so much confidence in them that we are willing to accompany them not only on tours of honor but to encounter with them fatigues and danger which we think we have a right to expect but we are sorry to have so far lost the confidence of our general officers that when considerably more than one half of our men have been detached for command one fieldofficer only from the line has been permitted to attend them while nine remain to endure the sensible mortification of commanding between them a less number the greater part of whom are on detached and extra service things thus circumstanced must pointedly wound the feelings of a military character and they do certainly most sensibly ours this complaint was presented to general heath and was forwarded by him to the commanderinchief   the result of this uneasiness in the officers was the sudden determination on the part of washington to recall the detachment under lafayette in the south and to form a new one

galvan is now annexed with respect to the conduct of that gentleman—from their remonstrances and the universal report it appears that his behavior has been so untoward  disobliging as to create the greatest disgust in all the corps  as will tend essentially to injure the service—this together with his having been in the light corps the last campaign would induce me to order him to be relieved if the consideration of his being a foreigner to whom you know i wish every suitable attention  encouragement to be paid an idea of his personal abilities  respectable connections did not prevent knowing your friendship for  influence with major galvan to be very considerable i sincerely wish him thro you to be persuaded to adopt such a line of conduct as will make him more agreeable to the corps as well as more serviceable to the public—otherwise however splendid his abilities  military talents may be they will be entirely useless to himself  the world—and in the issue i fear i shall be

ships but were inferior in weight of metal the engagement began at two oclock in the afternoon and lasted for more than an hour the english then drew off and the french finding one of their ships in a distressed condition did not pursue and decided that it would be inexpedient to continue to virginia whither the english had gone claude blanchard the french commissary who accompanied this detachment wrote of this naval engagement what is certain is that the english had the worst in this affair by which nevertheless we did not profit because the conquerant could not repair her damage quickly enough the captain of this ship also made some mistakes in manœuvring and lastly m destouches who was in command for the first time and who had been unexpectedly called to this post by the death of m de ternay was afraid of the court and did not display all the energy that was requisite washington took his disappointment with coolness and good judgment writing to destouches on the   st though you have not been able to accomplish the object which you had in view you have merited the thanks of every american by the boldness of the attempt and by the gallantry and good conduct displayed through the whole course of the engagement i will confess to you sir i was never sanguine in my expectations after i saw the british fleet follow you so closely from gardiners bay i knew that the success of the expedition depended almost entirely upon your arrival in the chesapeake before admiral arbuthnot a circumstance in which the winds and weather had more influence than valor or skill had it depended upon the latter i should have had perfect confidence and the event has justified my opinion the attempt of the chevr destouches at the time he sailed was bold and enterprising for this and

having magazines filled with provisions we have a scanty pittance scattered here and there in the different states instead of having our arsenals well supplied with military stores they are poorly provided and the workmen all leaving them instead of having the various articles of fieldequipage in readiness to be delivered the quartermastergeneral as the dernier resort according to his account is but now applying to the several states to provide these things for their troops respectively instead of having a regular system of transportation established upon credit or funds in the quartermasters hands to defray the contingent expenses of it we have neither the one nor the other and all that business or a great part of it being done by military impress we are daily and hourly oppressing the people souring their tempers and alienating their affections instead of having the regiments completed to the new establishment which ought to have been done agreeably to the requisitions of congress scarce any state in the union has at this hour an eighth part of its quota in the field and little prospect that i can see of ever getting more than half in a word instead of having every thing in readiness to take the field we have nothing and instead of having the prospect of a glorious offensive campaign before us we have a bewildered and gloomy defensive one unless we should receive a powerful aid of ships land troops and money from our generous allies and these at present are too contingent to build upon   lafayette obtained some clothing for his troops by pledging his own credit   i have been obliged from the distress to which we were reduced for want of provision to apply  000 dollars of the new emission of the money sent by the state of massachusetts for the payment of her troops to the use of the quarter masters department to enable him to bring forward flour from jersey and salt meat from connecticut before i would consent to this expedient i was driven to the necessity of consuming every ounce of provision which had been kept as a reserve in the garrison of west point and i had strained impress by military force to that length that i trembled for the consequence of the execution of every warrant which i granted for the purpose—so much are the people irritated by the frequent calls which have been made upon them in that way if it be possible to furnish the quarter master with but a little money to enable him to pay part for transportation i most earnestly request it may be done as i am confident the measures we have hitherto been pursuing cannot be much longer made use of without imminent danger of bringing the people to an open resistance—washington to the president of congress   may        read in congress may   th referred to sullivan varnum and montgomery on the   th referred to bland carroll and witherspoon   the separation of vermont from new york suggested to germaine an advantage for the british for he informed general haldimand that he should give the inhabitants reason to expect the king would erect their country into a separate province   march      a year later col beverly robinson trusting to the ill feeling engendered by the supposed neglect of vermont asked ethan allen to state without reserve whatever proposals you would wish to make to sir henry clinton intimating that he would be rewarded by a separate government under the king and constitution of england  0 march    0 allen received this letter in july showed it to the governor of vermont and a number of the leaders in the state and on their advice returned no answer in september a correspondence was opened with haldimand for the exchange of prisoners an application through washington having failed and the british commander not only acceded to negotiate an exchange but proposed a truce october    and appointed commissioners schuyler at once wrote to washington sending a flag to vernon for the purpose of exchanging prisoners appears to me only a cover to some design of the enemy and gives me much uneasiness especially as rumors prevail that the person whom your excellency was informed to have been in new york in july last negotiating with the enemy has been in new york but i cannot learn that any one can positively ascertain either of these facts october    it was also rumored that the person had been in canada about six weeks before washington replied on the  th of november i confess all circumstances and previous information considered that matters in a certain quarter carry a very suspicious face should it appear upon a further investigation that there are good grounds for present suspicions you will concert measures with brigadiergeneral clinton to whom i have written upon the subject without mentioning names to seize and secure with as much secrecy and as suddenly as possible the person in question with his papers you know how very delicate a business this is and i therefore trust to your prudence in the execution of it nothing but the most palpable proofs ought to warrant the seizure of his person but a variety of means may be fallen upon to circumvent and defeat their plans when you have a regular force to depend upon the suspected person was ethan allen charges were exhibited against him in the general assembly and upon investigation his resignation as brigadiergeneral was accepted schuyler in writing to washington on the   th announced allens dismissal and added that a certain person is engaged in the enemys interests i make little doubt of but i do not think it either prudent or politic that he should be seized at present a little time will probably furnish us with sufficient testimony for a conviction the truce thus granted to vermont awakened many suspicions of a treasonable connection between the british and some vermont leaders the state had applied to congress for admission into the confederation and receiving no reply an alliance with the other new england states was proposed because it was asserted vermont was kept out of the union through the undue influence of the contiguous states claiming jurisdiction    december    0 a demand had been made of new york for a relinquishment of its claims and in february the new york senate resolved to appoint commissioners to settle the terms on which new york would accede but the house were prevented from considering this resolution by a threat of the governor to prorogue the general assembly schuyler was strongly in favor of an immediate acknowledgment of their independence that they might be made useful to the common cause but clinton did not wish action as the affair had been referred to the decision of congress in december    0 haldimand drew up his instructions for his commissioners and inserted the offer of germaine adding a promise that allen and chittenden should be provided with commands in february beverly robinson again wrote allen renewing his proposition and allen sent both of robinsons letters to the continental congress in april allen was chosen a brigadiergeneral by the state and haldimand wrote germaine expressing his suspicions that allen was endeavoring to deceive both congress and him  0 april the suspicions of schuyler increased and he wrote to washington the conduct of the vermontese is mysterious and if the reports which generally prevail are well founded their measures will certainly be attended with dangerous consequences to this and the other united states i cannot however believe that the bulk of the people are in the secret i rather conjecture that the person whom we suspected last year to have been in new york and some others are the only culpable ones and that they amuse the people with making them believe that the whole of their negotiation with general haldimand is merely calculated to give congress and this state the alarm that the independence of vermont may be acknowledged i sincerely wish they congress would speedily decide acknowledge them independent and admit them into the union if this was instantly done the measures of their leaders would be brought to the test and we should know if they had only tended to bring about their independence or to connect themselves with the enemy but unless congress are pushed to a decision i believe they will do nothing in it but who is to urge them i know not the governor cannot do it officially and our delegates i believe will not unless they believe that the decision will go against the vermontese—letter saratoga may  th on may  st

at least if it could not be done for the war or three years to hold a body of militia according to the proportion given to them ready to march in one week after being called for and to adopt some

only of count de rochambeaus propositions and queries is here stated the replies and remarks of washington are printed in full as transcribed from the records   the number of militia requested from massachusetts was two thousand two hundred from connecticut fifteen hundred from pennsylvania sixteen hundred from new hampshire four hundred and from new jersey five hundred as the defence of newport after the french army should leave it was to be entrusted to the militia of rhode island no militia were required from that state to join the army soon after pennsylvania was called upon to furnish two thousand five hundred men for the southern army and its quota under the above call was allotted to the other states   this letter was intercepted by the enemy sent to the british ministry and published in the london gazette on the   th of july others of a similar tenor were also intercepted and sir henry clinton seems to have considered them as written for that purpose and designedly put in the way of being taken it has been said that he believed they were meant to deceive and that washingtons plans were actually the reverse of those mentioned in the letters british historians have adopted this idea and commended it as an evidence of welltimed address on the part of the american general annual register for      p    —andrews history of the late war vol iv p     it is certain however that no such deception was intended and that the letters expressed the real designs of the commanderinchief the first impressions of sir henry clinton on the subject were confirmed by a confidential letter from the marquis de chastellux to the chevalier de la luzerne intercepted nearly at the same time in which the writer stated that a combined attack on new york had been determined upon and took to himself much credit for bringing over count de rochambeau to general washingtons opinion the letter also contained free remarks on the deportment of the french commander and the reserve in which he held himself as to consulting with his subordinate officers a copy of this letter was carefully transmitted from new york to count de rochambeau it being doubtless deemed well suited to breed strife in the french camp it had not this effect but it was received with displeasure by count de rochambeau i sent for the marquis de chastellux said he i showed him the letter i then threw it into the fire and left him a prey to his own reflections—mémoires de rochambeau tom i p    —sparks i have already given you my opinion in some late letters with respect to my moveable property—after removing the most valuable and least bulky articles—the rest with the buildings must take their chance—i am prepared for the worst that can happen to them to hear therefore of their

consequence of the promises made them not being complied with wayne told them of the disgrace they brought on the american arms while in jersey in general and themselves in particular that the feelings of the officers on that occasion were so wounded that they had determined never to experience the like and that he begd they would now fire either on him and them or on those villains in

brought to count de rochambeau by his son and count de barras that a strong armament had departed from brest or would immediately depart under count de grasse for the west indies and that after he had passed the azores count de grasse would detach a convoy with somewhat more than six hundred recruits escorted by the armed vessel sagittaire and destined to unite with the french army at newport money for the army and navy was also to be brought by the sagittaire the news was likewise entrusted to count de rochambeau alone that count de grasse had orders to sail with his fleet to the coast of the united states in the month of july or august to relieve the squadron of m de barras and in case m de rochambeau should march from newport to unite with general washington before the arrival of count de grasses fleet then the squadron of barras was to retire to the harbor of boston for security as it was supposed that without the protection of the french army on shore the vessels would be in danger of a naval attack from the enemy with a superior force—mémoires de rochambeau tom i p   0 it having been decided at the conference between the american and french commanders held at weathersfield that the french army should leave newport and march to the north river the manner of disposing of the french fleet was taken into consideration immediately after the return of count de rochambeau the result is explained in the following extract from a letter written by him to general washington the count de barras instead of going to boston according to his orders has held a council of war the result of which i send here enclosed i hope your excellency will as soon as possible send an order that the militia who are to be stationed on this island be raised to the number of one thousand they will be joined by four hundred men whom i shall leave under the orders of m de choisy a brigadiergeneral and a very good officer i think that the state of massachusetts may furnish the five hundred men that have been demanded by the council of war for the surety of the squadron and that it is suitable that your excellency should send to m de choisy an order to convene a greater number in case of need and letters for the governors of the states of massachusetts and rhode island it is useless to say to your excellency that one of the chief reasons that decided the council of war to keep the squadron at rhode island was the fear lest america should look upon this change from newport to boston as a retreat the desire to be nearer for our future operations when the superior naval force expected in the course of the summer shall arrive in these seas has been another reason your excellency knows that the harbor of boston is very unfavorable at this season on account of the southwest winds that blow almost continually the junction of m de barras with the forces that might come would perhaps be delayed for a month and consequently all the operations depending on it—ms letter newport may   st   i fear from the purport of the letter you did me the honor to write from n port on the  th that my sentiments respecting the council of war held on board the duke de burgogne the   st of may have been misconceivd and i shall be very unhappy if they receive an interpretation different from the true intent and meaning of them if this is the case it can only be attributed to my not understanding the business of the duke de lauzun perfectly i will rely therefore on your goodness and candor to explain and rectify the mistake if any has happened my wishes perfectly coincided with the determination of the board of war to continue the fleet at rhode island provided it could remain there in safety with the force required and did not impede the march of the army towards the north river but when duke lauzun informed me that my opinion of the propriety and safety of this measure was required by the board and that he came hither at the particular desire of the counts rochambeau and de barras to obtain it i was reduced to the painful necessity of delivering a sentiment different from that of a most respectable board or of forfeiting all pretensions to candor by the concealment of it upon this ground it was i wrote to the generals to the effect i did and not because i was dissatisfied at the alteration of the plan agreed to at weathersfield my fears for the safety of the fleet which i am now perswaded were carried too far were productive of a belief that the generals when seperated might feel uneasy at every misterious preparation of the enemy and occasion a fresh call for militia—this had some weight in my determination to give boston where i was sure no danger could be encountered but that of a blockade a preference to newport where under some circumstances though not such as were likely to happen something might be enterprized the fleet being at rhode island is attended certainly with many advantages in the operations proposed and i entreat you and the gentlemen who were of opinion that it ought to be risqued there for these purposes will be assured that i have a high sense of the obligation you mean to confer on america by that resolve and that your zeal to promote the common cause and my anxiety for the safety of so valuable a fleet were the only motives which gave birth to the apparent difference in our opinions—washington to the chevalier de chastellux    june        read in congress june   th   see this letter in the secret journal of congress vol i p       it was the strong desire of the people of virginia that washington would take command of the army in that state in the letter to which the above was a reply mr jefferson had written we are too far removed from the other scenes of war to say whether the main force of the enemy be within this state but i suppose they cannot anywhere spare so great an army for the operations of the field were it possible for this circumstance to justify in your excellency a determination to lend us your personal aid it is evident from the universal voice that the presence of their beloved countryman whose talents have been so long successfully employed in establishing the freedom of kindred states to whose person they have still flattered themselves they retained some right and have ever looked up as their dernier resort in distress that your appearance among them i say would restore full confidence of salvation and would render them equal to whatever is not impossible i cannot undertake to foresee and obviate the difficulties which stand in the way of such a resolution the whole subject is before you of which i see only detached parts and your judgment will be formed in view of the whole should the danger of this state and its consequence to the union be such as to render it best for the whole that you should repair to its assistance the difficulty would then be how to keep men out of the field i have undertaken to hint this matter to your excellency not only on my own sense of its importance to us but at the solicitations of many members of weight in our legislature not yet assembled to speak their own desires a few days will bring to me that period of relief which the constitution has prepared for those oppressed with the labors of my office and a long declared resolution of relinquishing it to abler hands has prepared my way for retirement to a private station still however as an individual citizen i should feel the comfortable effects of your presence and have what i thought could not have been an additional motive for that gratitude esteem and respect with which i have the honor to be c—charlottesville may   th in writing to mr jones a delegate in congress from virginia on the same subject washington said nobody i persuade myself can doubt my inclination to be immediately employed in the defence of that country where all my property and connexions are but there are powerful objections to my leaving this army neither time nor prudence will allow me to go into a detail of them on paper one only i will name which is that no other person has power to command the french troops who are now about to form a junction with this army let it suffice for me to add that i am acting on a great scale that temporary evils must be endured where there is no remedy at hand that i am not without hopes that the tables may be turned but these being contingent i can promise no more than my utmost exertions—june  th your presence my dear general would do a great deal should these detachments be increased to three or four thousand and the french army come this way leaving one of our generals at rhode island and two or three about new york and in the jerseys you might be on the offensive in this quarter and there would be a southern army in carolina your presence would do immense good but i should wish you to have a large force general washington before he personally appears should be strong enough to hope success—lafayette to washington camp between the rappahannock and north anna june  d   this was the convoy of french vessels with recruits sent by count de grasse under the escort of a fiftygun ship and mentioned in a note to the letter above dated june  th two thirds of the convoy and the ship had arrived at boston the other third had been dispersed in a gale near the coast   words in italics were written in cypher   count de grasse wrote as follows to count de rochambeau his majesty has entrusted me with the command of the naval force destined for the protection of his possessions in south america and those of his allies in north america the force which i command is sufficient to fulfill the offensive plans which it is the interest of the allied powers to execute that they may secure an honorable peace if the menofwar are necessary for fulfilling the projects which you have in view it will be useful to the service that m de barras or m destouches be apprized of it and that pilots be sent to us skillful and well instructed as the french ships have a larger draft of water than the british it will not be till the   th of july at the soonest that i shall be on the coast of north america but it will be necessary by reason of the short time that i have to stay in that country also being obliged to leave it on account of the season that every thing necessary for the success of your projects should be in readiness that not a moment for action may be lost—ms letter dated at sea march   th the above letter was sent by the convoy count de rochambeau despatched a vessel immediately for the west indies with full intelligence to count de grasse concerning the plans in view and also the strength situation and apparent designs of the enemy he recommended to him to enter the chesapeake on his way as there might be an opportunity of striking an important stroke there and then to proceed immediately to new york and be ready to cooperate with the allied armies in an attack upon that city he likewise requested that if possible five or six thousand land troops might be brought from the west indies he writes thus to general washington but in his mémoires he takes somewhat more credit to himself respecting the proposed operation in the chesapeake i presented to m de grasse says he a picture of the distresses of the southern states and above all of virginia which had nothing to oppose the inroads of lord cornwallis but a small body of troops under lafayette who was sustained only by his good conduct and the nature of the country intersected by many rivers i transmitted to m de grasse the articles of the conference at weathersfield i observed to him that he ought to know better than myself the possibility of forcing a passage into the harbor of new york since in circumstances nearly similar m destaing under whose orders he had served had made an ineffectual proposal to the pilots in offering them an enormous sum to take his vessels across the bar which they did not venture to attempt in short i represented to him as my private opinion that an enterprise in the chesapeake bay against lord cornwallis would be the most practicable and the least expected by the enemy who counted on our distance from that quarter i requested him to solicit strenuously from the governor of st domingo the use for three months of the french brigade under m de st simon which was destined to act with the spaniards who it appeared to me would have no employment for it during the campaign i desired him also to effect a loan in our colonies of twelve hundred thousand francs which might insure the success of this operation i concluded by entreating him to dispatch to me a frigate as soon as possible with his answer that i might arrange with general washington our march by land to join him at the point assigned in the chesapeake—mémoires tom ii p     these schemes of count de rochambeau do not appear in his letters to general washington there are several indications that he did not approve an attack upon new york and only yielded his assent to what he discovered to be the wish of the american commander—sparks   in place of the continental force thus withdrawn six hundred militia from the counties of berkshire and hampshire were ordered there with the new york militia the command was given to brigadiergeneral stark with instructions dated june   th to oppose any incursion of the enemy and protect the frontier i rely upon it that you will use your utmost exertions to draw forth the force of the country from the green mountains and all the contiguous territory and i doubt not your requisitions will be attended with success as your personal influence must be unlimited amongst those people at whose head you have formerly fought and conquered with so much reputation and glory col willett was to remain in command on the mohawk river as his popularity in that country will enable him to render essential services

york island on monday night should we be happy enough to succeed and be able to hold our conquest the advantages will be greater than can be well imagined but i cannot flatter myself that the enemy will permit the latter unless i am suddenly and considerably reinforced i shall march down the remainder of this army and i have hopes that the french force will be near at hand by that time but i shall notwithstanding direct the alarmguns and beacons to be fired in case of success and i have to request that your excellency will upon signals communicate the meaning of them to the militia and put yourself at the head of them and march with the utmost expedition towards kingsbridge bringing with you three or four days provision at least in that time i think we shall have so arranged matters as to have little need of the militia suddenly called out i have upon a hope that we shall succeed ordered brigadiergeneral clinton to send down the regular troops immediately should circumstances make it necessary i can countermand the order—washington to governor clinton  0 june      the enemys apprehension of our intentions  the probability i had reason to apprehend that their force would be collected to the north end of the island on their receiving information of our approach were among the reasons that induced me to fall upon this enterprize  added to other reasons for the necessity of its sudden execution the present stage of the moon operated for fixing the time i mentioned—the success of the enterprise depending on a sudden surprize of the posts which must be attempted by night operations when the approach can only be concealed a delay to a fuller time of the moon which would greatly expose our detachments to a discovery could not be admitted these reasons i hope will apologize to your excellency for my desire to hasten the march of your troops which must be fatigued with their long march which they have already performed should we be so happy as to succeed in this attempt it would give us exceeding great advantage in our future operations— indeed save us perhaps the time of good part of the season to establish a communication with york island—i am obliged however to confess to your excellency that i am not highly sanguine in my expectations altho i think there is a good probability of succeeding—so great that i have thot it expedient to put the attempt at hazard from my late information however  that i may not risque too much i have directed the officer commdg the detachment majr genl lincoln who will tomorrow be in a position for the purpose that he shall in person reconnoitre the situation of the enemy— inform himself by any means in his power of their probable strength  numbers from whence he will be able to determine the practicability of accomplishg his aim—on this ground the attempt will be reduced to a contingency—genl lincoln having my instructions to conduct himself eventually agreeable to his own discoveries  his judgment of his probable success or failure—should he obtain such information of the enemys position  strength as to oblige him to decline the attempt on their posts—he will then agreeable to his instructions throw himself into a situation to form a covering party to the enterprize to be conducted by the duke lauzun—washington to rochambeau   july      on july  d washington wrote to rochambeau i have this

reconnoitre the position and works of the enemy on the north end of york island the particular events of the day i shall do myself the honor to communicate when i have the pleasure to join your excellency the american army and the legion of the duke de lauzun will march tomorrow to white plains if it will be convenient to you i shall be happy to receive your excellency with your troops at that place the day after tomorrow when i shall have an opportunity to converse with your excellency i conceive i shall be able to give you such reasons for forming your junction at white plains in the first instance as will satisfy you of the utility and fitness of the position for commencing the preparations for our concerted operations of the campaign—washington to rochambeau   july      the commanderinchief takes the earliest opportunity of expressing his thanks to the duke de lauzun his officers and men for the very extraordinary zeal manifested by them in the rapid performance of their

march of yesterday and last night the troops who were engaged today merit his particular thanks—orderly book july  d   read in congress july  0th the following extract from general washingtons diary

he was desired to repair to fort lee this day and reconnoitre the enemys works position and strength as well as he possibly could and take his ultimate determination from appearances that is to attempt the surprise if the prospect was favorable or to relinquish it if it was not and in the latter case to land above the mouth of spiten devil and cover the duke de lauzun in his operation on delanceys corps at three oclock this morning i commenced my march with the continental army in order to cover the detached troops and improve any advantages which might be gained by them i made a small halt at the new bridge over the croton about nine miles from peekskill another at the church by tarrytown till dusk nine miles more and completed the remaining part of the march in the night arriving at valentines hill at mile square about sunrise our baggage and tents were left standing at the camp at peekskill  d—the length of the duke de lauzuns march and the fatigue of his corps

prevent succors by that route were attacked by the yagers and others but on the march of the army from valentines hill they retired to the island being disappointed in both objects from the causes

public opportunity of expressing his thanks to his excellency the count de rochambeau for the unremitting zeal with which he has prosecuted his march in order to form the long wishedfor junction between the french and american forces an event which must afford the highest degree of pleasure to every friend of his country and from which the happiest consequences are to be expected the general entreats his excellency the count de rochambeau to convey to the officers and soldiers under his immediate command the grateful sense he entertains of the cheerfulness with which they have performed so long and laborious a march at this hot season the regiment of saintonge is entitled to peculiar ackowledgments for the spirit with which they continued and supported their march without one days respite   by a resolve of congress robert morris as superintendnet of finance was vested with powers to dispose of the specific supplies which had been required to be furnished by the several states in such manner as he with the advice of the commanderinchief should judge best suited to promote the public interest and answer the purposes of the present campaign—journals june  th it was the opinion of mr morris that all these supplies should be sold on the best terms that could be obtained and that the army should in future be supplied by contracts   although our correspondence has been long interrupted i hope that our friendship never will be notwithstanding the arts of wicked men who have endeavored to create discord and dissension among the friends of america for myself having little but my good wishes to send you it was not worth while to take up your attention a moment with them the contents of this letter will i am sure require no apology because you always approve that zeal which is employed in the public service and has for its object the public good    it would be a thing for angels to weep over if the goodly fabric of human freedom which you have so well labored to rear should in one unlucky moment be levelled with the dust there is nothing i think more certain than that your personal call would bring into immediate exertion the force and the resources of this state and the neighboring ones which directed as they would be will effectually disappoint and baffle the deep laid schemes of the enemy—richard henry lee to washington chantilly june   th in this letter mr lee enclosed a copy of one which he had written to some of the members of congress and in which he had expressed himself as follows let general washington be immediately sent to virginia with two or three thousand good troops let congress as the head of the federal union in this crisis direct that until a legislature can convene and a governor be appointed the general be possessed of dictatorial powers and that it be strongly recommended to the assembly when convened to continue those powers for six eight or ten months as the case may be and that the general may be desired instantly on his arrival in virginia to summon the members of both houses to meet where he shall appoint to organize and resettle their government   on the draft of this letter washington has noted that in the fair copy some sentences were transposed and alterations and corrections made but the sentiments were the same   with a view of ascertaining the exact position of the enemy on the north end of new york island general washington resolved to reconnoitre their posts from the western shore of the hudson for this purpose on the   th of july he crossed the river at dobbs ferry accompanied by count de rochambeau general de beville and general duportail they were attended by an escort of one hundred and fifty men from the jersey troops then stationed on the west side of the river the day was spent in reconnoitring from the high grounds between dobbs ferry and fort lee he dined at one william days near fort lee the subsequent manœuvres near kingsbridge are briefly sketched in the following extract from his diary july   st—i ordered about five thousand men to be ready to march at eight oclock for the purpose of reconnoitring the enemys posts at kingsbridge and of cutting off if possible such of delanceys corps as should be found without their lines at the hour appointed the march commenced in four columns on different roads majorgeneral parsons with the connecticut troops and twentyfive of sheldons horse formed the right column with two fieldpieces on the north river road the other two divisions under majorgenerals lincoln and howe together with the corps of sappers and miners and four fieldpieces formed the next column on the sawmill river road the right column of the french on our left consisted of the brigade of bourbonnois with the battalion of grenadiers and chasseurs two fieldpieces and two twelvepounders their left column was composed of the legion of lauzun one battalion of grenadiers and chasseurs the regiment of soissonnois two fieldpieces and two howitzers general waterbury with the militia and state troops of connecticut was to march on the east chester road and to be joined at that place by the cavalry of sheldon for the purpose of scouring frogs neck sheldons infantry was to join the legion of lauzun and scour morrisania and to be covered by scammells light infantry who were to advance through the fields waylay the roads stop all communication and prevent intelligence from getting to the enemy at valentines hill the left column of the american troops and right of the french formed their junction as did the left of the french also by mistake as it was intended it should cross the brunx by garrineaus and recross it at williamss bridge the whole army parsonss division first arrived at kingsbridge about daylight and formed on the heights back of fort independence extending towards delanceys mills while the legion of lauzun and waterburys corps proceeded to scour morrisania and frogs neck to little effect as most of the refugees had fled and hid themselves in such obscure places as not to be discovered and by stealth got over to the islands adjacent and to the enemys shipping which lay in the east river a few however were caught and some cattle and horses brought off july   d—the enemy did not appear to have had the least intelligence of our movement or to know we were upon the heights opposite to them till the whole army was ready to display itself after having fixed upon the ground and formed our line i began with general rochambeau and the engineers to reconnoitre the enemys position and works and first from tippets hill opposite to their left from thence it was evident that the small redoubt fort charles near kingsbridge would be absolutely at the command of a battery which might be erected thereon it also appeared equally evident that the fort on coxs hill was in bad repair and little dependence placed in it there is neither ditch nor friezing and the northeast corner appears quite easy of access occasioned as it would seem by a rock the approach from the inner point is secured by a ledge of rocks which would conceal a party from observation till it got within about one hundred yards of the fort around which for that or a greater distance the ground has little covering of bushes upon it there is a house on this side under tippets hill but out of view i conceive of the crossingplace most favorable to a partisan stroke from this view and every other i could get of forts tryon knyphausen and laurel hill the works are formidable there are no barracks or huts on the east side of the hill on which forts tryon and knyphausen stand nor are there any on the hill opposite except those by fort george near the blue bell there is a number of houses but they have more the appearance of stables than barracks in the hollow near the barrier gate are about fourteen or fifteen tents which are the only encampment i could see without the line of palisades a continued hill from the creek east of haerlem river and a little below morriss white house has from every part of it the command of the opposite shore and all the plain adjoining is within range of shot from batteries which may be erected thereon the general width of the river along this range of hills appears to be from one hundred to two hundred yards the opposite shore though more or less marshy does not seem miry and the banks are very easy of access how far the battery under cover of the blockhouse on the hill northwest of haerlem town is capable of scouring the plain is difficult to determine from this side but it would seem as if the distance were too great to be within the range of its shot on that part of the plain nearest the creek before mentioned and which is also nearest the heights back of our old lines thrown up in the year      it unfortunately happens that in the rear of the continued hill before mentioned there is a deep swamp and the grounds west of that swamp are not so high as the heights near haerlem river in the rear of this again is the brunx which is not to be crossed without boats below delanceys mills july   d—went upon frogs neck to see what communication could be had with long island and the engineers attended with instruments to measure the distance across having finished the reconnoitre without damage a few harmless shot only being fired at us we marched back about six oclock by the same routes we went down but in a reversed order of march and arrived at camp about midnight supposing it probable that count de grasse would shortly appear off sandy hook with this fleet general washington wrote to him on the   st of july in count de rochambeaus cipher acquainting him with the junction of the allied armies their position and strength and the force of the enemy and also explained the plans then in view as to future operations this letter was sent under cover to col jonathan forman at monmouth with a request that he would keep lookouts on the heights and as soon as the fleet should approach go on board the fleet in person and deliver the letter to count de grasse   chosen president of congress on the  0th of july as successor to mr huntington who had resigned samuel johnson of north carolina was first chosen but he declined accepting the appointment   extracts from intercepted letters   thomas nelson   conditional instructions had been sent from sir henry clinton to lord cornwallis that the latter should despatch to new york a detachment from his army as soon as he should have established himself in a fortified post near the chesapeake their departure was delayed however till the french fleet arrived in the chesapeake and in reality no part of lord cornwalliss army left virginia for the purpose of reinforcing sir henry clinton—see the correspondence in lord cornwalliss answer to sir henry clintons narrative c pp         from the orderly book july   st—the light companies of the first and second regiments of new york upon their arrival in camp with the two companies of york levies under the command of captains sackett and williams will form a battalion under the command of lieutenantcolonel hamilton and major fish after the formation of the battalion lieutenantcolonel hamilton will join the advanced corps under the orders of colonel scammell   alluding to the expected arrival of count de grasse with a french fleet   i have no doubt but the reasons which induce you to decline the removal of the squadron under your command to the chesapeake at this time are founded in propriety but i am certain that could the measure have taken place it would have been attended with most valuable consequences more especially as from reports and appearances the enemy are about to bring part of their troops from virginia to new york although the detachments from your fleet under the command of the baron dangely did not succeed at huntington we are not the less obliged to your excellency for directing the attempt to be made if that post is maintained i think an opportunity of striking it to advantage may still be found and i doubt not but you will readily embrace it—washington to count de barras    july      the reason assigned by m de barras for remaining at newport was that he thought it imprudent to risk any new enterprise which might contra vene the general plan of operations and retard his junction with count de grasse a few days afterwards july  0 general washington wrote in his diary that count de barras had expressed himself in still stronger terms against a removal from newport this induced me said he to desist from further representing the advantages which would result from preventing a junction of the enemys force at new york and blocking up those now in virginia lest in the attempt any disaster should happen and the loss of or damage to his fleet should be ascribed to my obstinacy in urging a measure to which his own judgment was opposed and the execution of which might impede his junction with the west india fleet and thwart the views of the count de grasse upon this coast   read in congress august  th—referred to bland boudinot and varnum   an interesting note on

of arms without any compensation you may inform mr loring that i would not wish to be obliged to seize private persons to obtain the relief of those who are now in new york i have it at this time in my power to secure every loyalist in the western part of connecticut in the county of westchester and in great part of bergen but i have not encouraged a practice which i have reprobated in the enemy and which nothing shall induce me to put in execution but seeing no other mode of procuring the release of our citizens—washington to skinner   august      on receiving general washingtons letter congress resolved that he should be authorized to go into a full exchange of general burgoyne and all the remaining officers of the convention of saratoga and also that the prisoners taken at the cedars should be considered as subjects of exchange on condition that allowance be made for several canadian officers taken by the americans at st johns and chamblee and sent into the british lines on parole in      concerning whose exchange there had been a dispute—journals august   st i am clearly in sentiment with you that all emissions of paper money ought to be subject to a supreme direction to give it a proper stamina and universal credit and that good and sure funds should be appropriated for the redemption of it—but in this as in most other matters the states individually have acted so independently of each other as to become so much a rope of sand as to totter upon the brink of ruin when the independency of them by the resources which have been actually drawn from them had been applied to great objects by one common head would have been as unshaken as mount atlas and as regardless of britains efforts do destroy it as she is of the tempests that pass over her—washington to william fitzhugh   august        a correspondent of mine a servant to lord cornwallis writes on the   th of july at portsmouth and says his master tarleton and simcoe are still in town but expect to move the greater part of the army is embarked there are in hampton road one fiftygun ship two thirtysix gun frigates and eighteen sloops loaded with horses there remain but nine vessels in portsmouth which appear to be getting ready my lords baggage is yet in town his lordship is so shy of his papers that my honest friend says he cannot get at them there is a large quantity of negroes very valuable indeed but no vessel it seems to take them off what garrison they have i do not know i shall take care at least to keep them within bounds general muhlenberg with a corps of light infantry and horse is moving towards portsmouth but although i do not think they are going up the river or the bay the less so as they have made a parade of taking pilots on board i had rather act on the cautious side and by keeping a supporting position leave no chance to his lordship to outmanœuvre us should a french fleet now come into hampton road the british army would i think be ours i am going to send a flag to lord cornwallis i owe him the justice to say that his conduct to me has been peculiarly polite and many differences between commissaries have been very graciously adjusted by him to my satisfaction—lafayette to washington malvern hill july   st cornwallis took possession of york and gloucester on the  st and  d of august and having removed with as much expedition as possible all his army from portsmouth commenced fortifying those posts   rochambeau wrote a letter to barras on august   th to which washington added the following postscript the sentiments contained in the foregoing letter perfectly accord with my opinion and i am more inclined to adopt them as we have seen in the british gazettes accounts of a squadron under the command of admiral digby said to be intended to reinforce the british fleets in these seas should this squadron actually arrive form a junction with admiral rodney  graves and find the french naval force separated it might eventually prove fatal to the fleets of his most christian majesty commanded by the count de grasse and yourself i cannot avoid repeating therefore in earnest terms the request of the count de rochambeau that you would form the junction and as soon as possible with the count de grasse in chesapeake bay   this letter was signed jointly by general washington and count de rochambeau diary july   th—received despatches from the count de barras announcing the intended departure of count de grasse from cape françois with between twentyfive and twentynine sail of the line and three thousand two hundred land troops on the  d instant for the chesapeake bay and the anxiety of the latter to have every thing in the most perfect readiness to commence our operations at the moment of his arrival as he should be under the necessity from particular engagements with the spaniards to be in the west indies by the middle of october the count de barras at the same time intimated his intentions of an enterprise against newfoundland in opposition to which both count de rochambeau and myself remonstrated as being impolitic and dangerous under the probability of rodneys coming on this coast matters having now come to a crisis and a decided plan to be determined on i was obliged—from the shortness of count de grasses promised stay on this coast the apparent disinclination of their naval officers to force the harbor of new york and the feeble compliance of the states with my requisitions for men hitherto and the little prospect of greater exertion in future—to give up all ideas of attacking new york and instead thereof to remove the french troops and a detachment from the american army to the head of elk to be transported to virginia for the purpose of coöperating with the force from the west indies against the troops in that state in the letter which accompanied the despatches above mentioned count de barras said that count de grasse did not require him to form a junction with the west india squadron but left him at liberty to undertake any other enterprise which he might think proper in conformity with this permission and with the spirit of the original but contingent instructions from the ministers he proposed an expedition to newfoundland and said he should wish to take with him the land forces that had been left at newport under m de choisy this step was strongly disapproved by both general washington and count de rochambeau and as soon as he received their remonstrance against it count de barras resolved to proceed to the chesapeake it is probable likewise that some degree of personal feeling had its influence on the wishes of count de barras in the council of war which was held some time before respecting the removal of the fleet to boston after a debate indicating a little warmth among the officers count de rochambeau represents m de barras as using the following language no person is more interested than i am in the arrival of m de grasse in these seas he was my junior he has just been appointed lieutenantgeneral at the moment his approach is made known i shall set sail to put myself under his orders i will finish this campaign i will never make another—mémoires de rochambeau tom i p     hence it appears that the two naval commanders stood in a delicate relation to each other and it may be presumed that this was the reason why count de grasse left count de barras at liberty to join him or not as he should be inclined and also why the latter preferred a separate enterprise—sparks   to this request for money mr morris made a very discouraging reply stating that he had none but would make every possible exertion see his answer in the diplomatic correspondence vol xi p     on the   th washington mapped out the following line of

two armies pursued their march to trenton by different routes one column passing through chatham springfield and brunswick for the purpose of keeping up as long as possible an appearance of threatening staten island or of marching round to sandy hook to facilitate the entrance of the french fleet into the harbor a french bakery was also established at chatham as a blind to the enemy which should strengthen the opinion that operations were intended in that quarter general washington remained with the army till the  0th when he and count de rochambeau set off for philadelphia and arrived there the next day he immediately applied himself to provide vessels and other means of transporting the army baggage and stores from trenton to the head of elk so few vessels could be found that one regiment only went by water with the stores down the delaware and up christiana creek all the remaining troops marched by land and passed through philadelphia general lincoln had the

will be of great importance towards the success of our present enterprise that the enemy on the arrival of the fleet should not have it in their power to effect their retreat i cannot omit to repeat

debarkation to be more favorable to our intentions in which case you will be pleased to meet the transports while on their way with orders to proceed to any other point which may be fixed on the remainder of the troops from hence will be forwarded with all the expedition our circumstances will admit in the mean time as it will be of the greatest importance to prevent the escape of his

during the siege he laid the matter before a council of war the result has been said he in his reply that the plan i had suggested was the most brilliant and glorious but it would not fulfil the views we had proposed it is consequently decided that a large part of the fleet shall anchor in york river that four or five vessels shall be stationed so as to pass up and down in james river and that you shall aid us with the means to erect a battery on point comfort where we can place cannon and mortars we shall immediately proceed to execute this arrangement and i hasten to give you notice that we

under general weedon those officers represented that considering the nature of the ground their strength and the facility with which the enemy might reinforce that post an augmentation of their numbers was indispensable both to enable them to occupy a good defensive position and to confine the enemy within their lines general washington applied to count de grasse for a detachment of six or eight hundred marines to be sent from his ships on this service m de choisy was the bearer of the letter making the request the troops were obtained though count de grasse spared them with reluctance and desired that no future requisition of the kind might be made upon him as his situation was critical and he was unwilling to have his men so divided as to subject him to embarrassment in case of a contingency the american and french troops at gloucester were put under the command of m de choisy who was a brigadiergeneral in the french service   the attempt to pass up york river was declined by count de grasse not because he thought the works at york and gloucester would present serious obstacles but because he believed his large vessels would not be secure in that station the enemy had a great number of boats and small craft and with these they could easily bring fireships in the night from which his vessels would be exposed to imminent danger confined in the narrow channel of a river especially as he had not in his whole fleet a sufficient number of rowboats and light craft for defence in such a situation even if they could all be transported up the river in safety this objection he deemed insuperable and the project was laid aside it was revived again however a few days afterwards the passage and the river above york were reconnoitred by a french officer and upon his representation gount de grasse agreed to send up some of his vessels provided general washington would furnish such a number of rowboats as would protect them from the fireships this was about to be

side one to a detachment of french the other to a detachment of american troops the garrison is to march out at three oclock with shouldered arms drums beating a british or german march the cavalry with their swords drawn and the colors of the whole cased to a place which you will be so good as to appoint in front of the posts where they will ground their arms and afterwards return to their encampment you will be so good as to communicate this to general weedon and to make the necessary arrangements and desire him to take every precaution to prevent the loss or embezzlement of the arms—washington to brigadier general choisy    october        this letter was referred on the   th to a committee of congress randolph boudinot varnum and carroll who reported a series of resolves which were adopted the thanks of congress were voted to general washington count de rochambeau and count de grasse respectively and also to all the officers and soldiers two stands of colors taken at yorktown were presented to general washington two pieces of fieldordnance to count rochambeau and a similar tribute to count de grasse a horse properly caparisoned and an elegant sword were given to colonel tilghman who had been the bearer of the despatches containing the news of the capitulation it was also resolved that congress would cause to be erected at yorktown a marble column adorned with emblems of the alliance between the united states and france and inscribed with a succinct narrative of the events of the siege and capitulation—journals october   th   the day after the above letter was written general washington himself went on board the admirals ship both to pay his respects and offer his thanks for the services that had been rendered by the fleet and to endeavor to impress upon the count de grasse the importance of the plan he had suggested he returned the same evening but having promised to lafayette the command of the detachment destined against wilmington in case count de grasse could be persuaded to undertake the convoy and debarkation of the troops he left that officer on board the ville de paris for the purpose of further consultation with the admiral two days afterwards lafayette also came back and made the following report the count de grasse would be happy to be able to make the expedition to charleston all the advantages of which he feels but the orders of his court ulterior projects and his engagements with the spaniards render it impossible to remain here the necessary time for this operation his wish to serve the united states is such that he desires to enter into engagements for a coöperation during the next campaign as far as the plans of the court will permit the expedition to wilmington requiring less time the count de grasse would undertake to conduct to that place a detachment of two thousand americans as to the manner of operating it must be determined according to the particular information that we shall collect it will be necessary immediately to have pilots persons well acquainted with the country with whom the count de grasse would desire to converse as soon as possible in order to give his answer definitely the american troops must be furnished with their own provisions the naval army having none to spare the count de grasse gives us leave to make use of the vessels in york river the loyalist the queen charlotte and the cormorant have been sold to the state of virginia but the count de grasse does not think he will be able to embark the american troops on board his ships of the line how then shall we provide sailors to man the other vessels the count has fifteen american sailors there are some small armed vessels if after having seen the persons acquainted with the coast the count de grasse thinks he shall be able to take the troops on board his lineofbattle ships and debark them without danger then it will be useless to take the transports if frigates can run into a convenient place then the troops will be embarked on board of frigates the day of departure is to be the first of november or if possible sooner   count de grasse to lafayette—the more i reflect on the plan which you mentioned to me the more i see the impossibility of undertaking to transport troops baggage artillery and ammunition my ulterior operations require my return to an appointed place at a fixed day that day approaches and it would be impossible for me to break my engagement voluntarily the passage from hence to cape fear may possibly be accomplished in two days but it may also require more than fifteen the debarkation of troops and stores may be attended with delays and expose me to censure besides it might happen that from an obstinate succession of southerly winds i should be obliged to take the resolution of repairing to my rendezvous then i should be under the necessity of carrying with me during the whole campaign a detachment of troops useful to the continent of which i should be very sorry to deprive it thus all that i can do is to promise to escort as well as i can the vessels that may have troops on board but it will be impossible for me to remain on the coast beyond the  th of next month and even this delay must be repaired on my part by the greatest activity if you are deficient in the means of embarking or debarking let us think no more of the measure but do not attribute my refusal to any thing but the impossibility of executing a matter that was agreeable to you—ms letter october   th a long letter was likewise written by count de grasse to general washington on the subject stating the same objections and expressing his regret that the orders he was bound to follow and the engagements he had made to be in the west indies prevented him from cooperating in this enterprise which held out the fairest prospects of success   read in congress november  d referred to randolph boudinot varnum and carroll   in his reply count de grasse said that he should communicate general washingtons proposal to the french court and doubted not that every thing in their power would be done to promote his views and establish american liberty st simon embarked his troops and the fleet sailed out of the chesapeake on the  th of november for the west indies general washington presented to count de grasse two horses which were sent off to the fleet the french army remained in virginia till the following summer the headquarters of count de rochambeau were at williamsburg agreeable to what i informed you some time ago it has been agitated with the french admiral to transport by water under his convoy as far as cape fear the reinforcement destined for your aid and on that contingency it was in contemplation with these troops to attempt by coupdemain to carry the enemys post of wilmington—an attempt which with the aid of the fleet was judged to be practicable and the accomplishment of which however small the object in itself would be of great importance in the scale of future negotiation as it would in effect be the liberation of another state after some days of suspence i have just now received from the count de grasse a negative decision upon this proposal in consequence of which my resolutions are altered and the troops will go on by land every argument and persuasion had been used with the french admiral to induce him to aid the combined army in an operation against charlestown but the advanced season the orders of his court and his own engagements to be punctual to a certain time fixed on for his ulterior operations all forbid his compliance and i am obliged to submit nothing therefore remains but to give you a respectable reinforcement and to return myself to the northward with the remainder of the troops for which arrangement every preparation is now making with all possible despatch—washington to majorgeneral greene    october        the troops were transported by water to the head of elk and they marched thence by land the new jersey troops were stationed for the winter near morristown and the two new york regiments under general james clinton at pompton all the others proceeded to the north river where the light companies joined their respective regiments hazens regiment was ordered to lancaster in pennsylvania the british prisoners were marched to winchester in virginia and to fort frederic and fredericktown in maryland the barracks at fort frederic were found to be in such a state of decay that the division of the prisoners intended for that place was stationed at fredericktown as these prisoners were guarded only by militia many differences occurred and occasionally serious quarrels between them and the inhabitants and they were subsequently removed to lancaster in pennsylvania and guarded by continental troops   read in congress november  th referred to varnum montgomery and lovell certificate—general duportail commandant of the corps of engineers having signified his desire of obtaining leave to go to france for the arrangement of his domestic affairs it is with the greatest satisfaction i embrace this opportunity of testifying the sense which i entertain of his distinguished talents and services his judgment in council and wellconducted valor in the field claim the highest applause and have secured to him the esteem and confidence of the army his plan and conduct of the attacks in the late important and successful siege of york where he commanded the corps of engineers afford brilliant proofs of his military genius and set the seal to his reputation while they entitle him to my warmest thanks given at headquarters   st october      general duportail was promoted on the   th of november according to the above recommendation but general knox was passed over there was a serious difficulty in the case owing to the local partiality of some of the members of congress and to the opinion of others that general principles should be adhered to the commission of knox as brigadier bore a subsequent date to those of james clinton moultrie and mcintosh the members from new york south carolina and georgia would not agree to the promotion of knox unless those officers were promoted at the same time and a vote for the whole could not be carried several trials were made and general washington was consulted on the subject after his arrival in philadelphia lincoln had on the  0th of october been chosen secretary of war and to him washington wrote on december  th from the tenor of your private letter of this date i presume you are unacquainted with my recommendation of general knox to congress at the time general duportail was mentioned to that body by me if my expressions in his favor were not warm and full they fell as far short of my intention as of his merit and did injustice to both because i absolutely refused to recommend the latter without the former whom i thought equally at least entitled upon every principle to promotion if any thing further can be done by me it must i conceive be obtained by some other means than a direct application to congress in the mean time i hope general knox will take no hasty resolution or at least suspend the execution of it if he should to mr bee a delegate from south carolina he wrote as follows on the  th of march— i am clearly of opinion for reasons which i had the honor of detailing to you yesterday that the promotion of general knox singly will involve fewer disagreeable consequences than any other method which i have yet heard proposed for i am persuaded that no officer senior to himself as well acquainted as i am with his extraordinary exertions to prepare without proper means the siegeartillery for the last campaign the despatch with which he transported it and his uncommon assiduity and good management of it at yorktown would think his promotion an improper reward or any reflection upon his own merit if extraordinary exertions do not meet with particular attention there is no stimulus to action and an officer has little more to do than to steer clear of courtsmartial the representations of the commanderinchief at last prevailed and on the   d of march knox was promoted to the rank of majorgeneral and his commission was ordered to be dated on the   th of the preceding november thereby giving him precedence of general duportail and advancing him over the abovementioned brigadiers—sparks   john parke custis   i shall remain but a few days here mount vernon and shall proceed to philadelphia when i shall attempt to stimulate congress to the best improvement of our late success by taking the most vigorous and effectual measures to be ready for an early and decisive campaign the next year my greatest fear is that congress viewing this stroke in too important a point of light may think our work too nearly closed and will fall into a state of languor and relaxation to prevent this error i shall employ every means in my power and if unhappily we sink into that fatal mistake no part of the blame shall be mine whatever may be the winter politics of european courts it is clearly my opinion that our grand object is to be prepared in every point for war—not that we wish its continuance but that we may be in the best situation to meet every event—washington to majorgeneral greene    november        president mckean

he attended congress being introduced into the hall by two members he was addressed by the president as follows sir congress at all times happy in seeing your excellency feel particular pleasure in your presence at this time after the glorious success of the allied arms in virginia it is their fixed purpose to draw every advantage from it by exhorting the states in the strongest terms to the most vigorous and timely exertions a committee has accordingly been appointed to state the requisitions necessary to be made for the establishment of the army and they are instructed to confer with you upon that subject it is therefore the expectation of congress that your excellency would remain for some time in philadelphia that they may avail themselves of your aid in this important business and that you may enjoy a respite from the fatigues of war as far as is consistent with the service to this address general washington replied mr president i feel very sensibly the favorable declaration of congress expressed by your excellency this fresh proof of their approbation cannot fail of making a deep impression upon me and my study shall be to deserve a continuance of it it is with peculiar pleasure i hear that it is the fixed purpose of congress to exhort the states to the most vigorous and timely exertions a compliance on their part will i persuade myself be productive of the most happy consequences i shall yield a ready obedience to the expectation of congress and give every assistance in my power to their committee i am obliged by the goodness of congress in making my personal ease and convenience a part of their concern should the service require my attendance with the army upon the north river or elsewhere i shall repair to whatever place my duty calls with the same pleasure that i remain in this city   the british had recently retired from wilmington   as general smallwood had been promoted to the rank of majorgeneral colonel otho h williams was recommended by general greene to supply his place as brigadier in the maryland line   on these topics general greene had written before an exchange is gone fully into i wish something decisive may be done respecting colonel hayne as retaliation necessarily involves the whole continent i wish your excellencys order and the order of congress thereon the latter have signified their approbation of the measures i took but as retaliation did not take place immediately nor did i think myself at liberty to act on a matter of such magnitude but from the most pressing necessity and as the enemy did not repeat the offence i have been at a loss how to act with respect to the original one not having any officer of equal rank with colonel hayne in my possession i am ready to execute whatever may be thought advisable it would be happy for america if something could be done to put a stop to the practice of burning both in the northern states and here also and to prevent it here i wrote to the enemy a letter on the subject a copy of which i enclose and if they do not desist i will put the war on the footing i mention—ms letter november   st   this board was established to superintend the affairs of the refugees or loyalists william franklin formerly governor of new jersey was its president   read in congress december   th referred to clymer carroll and law   mr chittenden had been chosen governor of vermont by the people of that territory in february      and he acted as such during the revolution   i was induced to take the matter up just now from an apprehension that things might be carried to extremes and from having received lately a very confidential letter from him in which he discloses all their political manœuvres which he protests have been in reality innocent and only meant to alarm the other states this letter i have shewn to a number of my friends members of congress and others and they have advised me to write to mr chittenden in my private character give him my opinion of the unjustifiableness of the extension of their claim and advise him to accept the terms offered by the resolve of the   st of last august this i have done fully and forcibly and perhaps it may have some effect upon mr chittenden and the leaders in vermont—washington to majorgeneral schuyler   january        i am in possession of a deal of intelligence similar to that furnished by capt edgar and am at a loss to know whether the vermontese are playing a merely political or a guilty game i have reason to think the former i am now endeavoring to get all our prisoners in canada exchanged and if any of them after they are released can throw light upon a number of transactions which i confess are mysterious they will be made use of for that purpose—washington to majorgeneral heath    december        every information tending to prove that the affairs respecting the grants may be speedily and happily accommodated gives me singular satisfaction i will flatter myself that both the articles of intelligence you have received are well grounded and that it will be the unremitting effort of every one who is well effected to the general cause to prevent the horrors of civil discord in any part of the united states it has been intimated that some of the enemys shipping and armed vessels have been detained by the ice in lake champlain in such a manner that they might be destroyed and the cannon c brought off if the fact is so i will thank you for as early and explicit information as possible that measures may be taken accordingly the destruction of those vessels would i think greatly impede any future incursions from that quarter—washington to philip schuyler    january        this representation is printed in the calendar of virginia state

news of cornwallis surrender i have seen the new york prints and no mention is made of any reinforcement having sailed for america a circumstance which had it happened i think would not have been omitted at this time when the loyalists are desponding and looking upon themselves as lost and unsupported the reinforcement from new york was not more than six or seven hundred men the kings speech at the opening of the british parliament is firm and manifests a determination to continue the war although there is no appearance of his having made any alliances this i hope will prove to the states the necessity of complying with the requisitions upon them for men and supplies every argument that i could invent to induce them to it has been made use of by me in two sets of circular letters no part of the intelligence brought by the frigate has yet gone abroad it is no doubt of consequence if any alteration is to be made in the disposition of the force remaining in america it must soon become visible until we hear from the court of france we can only be making general preparations men are the most material of all and i cannot say that the means of obtaining them so far as i have yet heard are efficacious—february   th   by the resolves here referred to congress invested general washington with powers to negotiate an exchange of prisoners on the broadest scale and to take measures for settling all accounts respecting prisoners but these resolves were accompanied with a secret instruction that nothing contained therein should be construed to authorize the exchange of lieutenantgeneral cornwallis by composition it appears to have been the object of this reservation to secure the release of mr laurens who was yet retained a prisoner in england and had been for more than a year shut up in the tower of london the southern members were particularly strenuous on this point as well as indignant at the mode adopted by lord cornwallis in prosecuting the war at the south for a remarkable expression of the feelings of the delegates from south carolina and georgia on this subject see journals february   d   on a consideration of this letter it was resolved by congress that the commanderinchief be authorized to agree to the exchange of earl cornwallis by composition provided that the honorable henry laurens be liberated and proper assurances be obtained that all accounts for the support of the convention prisoners and all other prisoners of war shall be speedily settled and discharged—journals february   d   read in congress february   st referred to

as my commissioners will go fully authorized to treat of the exchanges of lord cornwallis and the honorable mr laurens i have no occasion to be particular in my answer to your excellencys letter on that subject i shall only observe that i apprehend lord cornwallis misunderstood colonel laurens in the conversation they had upon that matter in virginia i could never have given an assurance that his lordship should be exchanged for mr laurens the father of the colonel as i had no authority to make any such stipulation—washington to sir henry clinton    february        the commissioners did not meet and exchange powers till the   st of march the time having been deferred at the request of sir henry clinton   i have received since my arrival at these quarters your favor of the   th of feby respecting the exchange of your honble father for lord cornwallis i am sorry to inform you that upon my arrival at philadelphia and for a long time after i had been there i experienced the greatest disinclination in congress to the exchange of lord cornwallis upon any terms and that it was not till after i had combated their objections in different ways and at several meetings of their committees that i got the matter placed upon such a footing as to leave me at liberty to negotiate the exchange of that officer at any rate the principal difficulties are now so far removed as to admit commissioners on each side to meet and they are now sitting at elizabeth town for the purpose of exchanges in which mr laurenss is particularly given in charge for settling of accounts c and i

choisy was directed to stop at charlotte courthouse virginia   it has been my uniform opinion since the capitulation of york town that unless the enemy can send such reinforcements to this continent as will in their judgment place their two principal posts of new york and charles town in a state of perfect security or they are sure of having a naval superiority on this coast during the operations of the campaign they will concentre their force at one of those points and further it has as invariably been my opinion that new york will be the last hold they will quit in the united states if i am mistaken in the first i shall believe that a negotiation of peace or a truce is near at hand and that they hazard much for the uti possidetis which from present appearances and my conception of the views of the british government i have not the smallest idea of i mean peace this year—washington to col laurens    april        general washington left philadelphia on the   d of march having been there four months and after stopping a day or two at morristown he proceeded to newburg where he arrived on the  st of april and established his headquarters at that place   washington wrote on april   th that he had intelligence that the centries at the doors of sir henry clintons quarters were doubled at eight oclock every night from the apprehension of an attempt to surprise him in them if this be true it is more than probable the same precaution extends to other personages in the city of new york—a circumstance i thought it proper for you to be advertized of   see vol ii p       while

he was conveyed to new york and put in close confinement on the   th of april he was sent out of the city in the charge of a number of refugees commanded by captain lippincott and hanged on the heights near middletown the people in the neighborhood were extremely exasperated at this act of wanton barbarity and at their solicitation general forman who resided at monmouth obtained affidavits and a proper statement of facts with which he first went to elizabethtown where the american commissioners general knox and gouverneur morris were then attempting to negotiate an exchange of prisoners and laid the matter before them by their advice he proceeded to general washingtons headquarters and his statement and the papers of which he was the bearer were submitted to the consideration of the general and field officers twentyfive officers sent answers to the above queries in writing they were unanimous in the opinion that retaliation was justifiable and expedient that the leader of the party who murdered captain huddy was the person who ought to suffer and that in case he could not be obtained an officer equal in rank to captain huddy should be selected by lot from the british prisoners twentytwo of the american officers agreed in the decision that a representation should first be made to sir henry clinton and satisfaction demanded the other three thought that the laws of war and the enormity of the offence justified an immediate execution without previous notice to the british commander the officers assembled at the quarters of general heath who stated to them the questions he says they were ordered not to converse together on the subject till each one had written his opinion sealed it up and sent it to the commanderinchief—heaths memoirs p     if this order

of the negotiation as reported by his commissioners he complains that the americans made unreasonable demands first in requiring him to agree to an exchange of prisoners in all parts of the world whereas it was known that his powers extended to such only as had been captured in america secondly in an exorbitant requisition of two hundred thousand pounds sterling as the balance due to the united states for the maintenance of british prisoners from the beginning of hostilities to that time whereas in sir henrys opinion the balance was greatly in his favor and thirdly in demanding that for the future provisions should not be purchased in the united states for the support of british prisoners but should be sent to them from the british posts on these essential points as well as on many others of less moment the difference of opinion was so great that no arrangement could be effected—see sparks life of gouverneur morris vol i p       this plan of campaign was drawn up by
