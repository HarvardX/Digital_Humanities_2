you cannot hide yourself from me i am one who see every thing in a moment you have heard what has happened to me since i went   cheerly no faith i have not   vain the most extraordinary thing always something surprising wherever i go for my part i really think as to myself that  but what are you at cheerly what attempting to spy into your neighbors cabin just like me egad i have done that often in my time though it is hardly fair play between you and i   cheerly vain you know a seaman cannot act unfairly here is a little frigate in this harbor of which i would fain take the command honorably

fanny ever since i found truelove beginning and thought his hand was worth the winning i called each little artful aid in to spare the question from a maiden to wake or show when asked to go i still denied all lads beside and prayed of ralph to carry me it seemed so pat in tender chat to whisper fanny will you marry me in evening fine and summer weather when over the fields we walked together though i can trip it like a fairy i have often pretended to be weary then leaning on his arm awhile i slily asked him with a smile i am tired ralph will you carry me but on the way he never would stay

master at present  if you will go halves with me in a hundred pounds you may   ralph not i indeed   aloud i dare say you have a purpose   vain in a low voice now for heavens sake    ralph i go shares with you   vain fifty pounds   low ralph leave the house directly or    loud vain sixty   low ralph i will let mr brummagem know   loud brum comes near to them vain a hundred   low ralph that you are    vain the devil   ralph you may be for aught i know    brum mercy on me what is all this   vain a plague of this unseasonable interruption there is nothing left but decamping mr brummagem you will excuse me  i will take another opportunity  damn it my genius has failed me   brum beats vain off ralph still speaking to him i have a great mind to let mr brummagem know who you are   brum eagerly puis on his hat who is he in the name of wonder who is the dog   ralph his name is vain   brum what captain vain an impudent scoundrel   ralph to think of imposing on you   brum with his live a thousand years   ralph a vulgar fellow when no gentleman in spain ever wishes you to live less than ten thousand at least   brum i begin to enjoy it now the dangers over it will make a curious anecdote in my life   aside with proper embellishments   ralph it reminds me of a singular circumstance that sir andrew sends me an account of in his last letter   brum ay what was that   ralph why  but i keep you standing  takes a chair and sits pray brummy no ceremonies   brum egad i see you use none  takes a chair likewise and sits   ralph sir andrew gives an account  i believe i have the letter in my pocket  takes a letter from his pocket   brum puts on his spectacles ah let me hear all that sir andrew says    ralph reads a young man of this place    brum where is it dated from barcelona eh  peering over letter   ralph aside it is lucky that i happen to know that  oh from barcelona certainly  but why need i read i will tell it you  a young man was desperately in love with a girl of good fortune and the father denied his consent and wanted to marry her against her inclinations   brum more fool he well   ralph wherefore they laid a scheme to join the young peoples hands under the fathers nose   brum ah and how did they manage it   ralph one day the old man comes home as usual with a hat as large  takes brums hat from his head aye larger than yours  puts the hat on the table making signs occasionally as to some one without and seeing some strangers coming about the house takes up his cane that he always carried as you do  takes cane from brummagems hand this is a gold head   brum oh the purest gold of spain it was given to my grandfather by the    ralph ay no matter i thought as much well he takes his cane and runs to his coffers where he kept his money for sir andrew says he did not suspect the design on his daughter   brum oh a simpleton   ralph quite a fool now his money was all fast secured under two stout keys such as these  takes the keys from brummagems girdle danglesem about and lays them on the table and forth he sets to beat the rogues from his coffers   brum well well   ralph in the mean time while he was busy at his coffers a maid servant coming behind his back  fanny enters unobserved by brummagem  takes the keys off table opens the door which she leaves unlockt lays the keys down again on the table takes the keys goes to her young mistresss door opens it lets the young lady know that her lover was waiting in the next room with a clergyman to marry them before they left the house   brum well there was some decency in the young folks at least   ralph oh sir andrew says he was a most excellent young man   brum but suppose now the father had happened to meet the maid on this errand  turning sees fanny who had just replaced the keys  what do you want here hussy   fanny i came to see if you would have the chocolatecup taken away sir   brum oh very well  ay by all means this is some of the finest china that  fanny carries out the cups but i say my dear friend  replaces the keys in his girdlesuppose he had met the maid   ralph why that would have been unlucky to be sure  but as it happened he never suspected her   brum well and so    ralph the young lady was all in readiness to sly to her lover but so overcome with fear that she durst not venture to leave the room upon which her lover    cheerly conducted by fanny crosses the stage unobserved by brummagem and both go into lauras room goes to her room to encourage   aside so far all is safe  brum oh oh my dear friend but what  all this happen before the fathers face   ralph no no brummy you misunderstand me they went behind the fathers back   brum egad it is lucky the old gentleman didnt turn his head round what a pretty kettle of fish there would have been   ralph oh but then  aye very true  i had forgot to tell you one circumstance this scheme was managed by a rogue of a servant who played the old fool the most ludicrous trick  i cannot help laughing when i think of it   brum affects to laugh i will show you how they contrived it  they turn toward each other brum by all means it is a good story i dare say   ralph excellent i will show you well now you shall suppose i am this rogue of a servant   brum good   ralph and that you are the fool of a father   brum with all my heart   ralph now i take your large hat  such a one well suppose as this  takes brums hat from table or larger and i clap it entirely over your face  ties a handkerchief over the hat now turn your head about first on one side then on the other side what do you see   brum nothing to be sure   ralph well while i keep this hat close over your eyes forth comes the whole procession  first the maid servant with a bundle of her mistresss clothes   fanny comes out of lauras room with a bundle of clothes and exit cheerly and laura following her brum trying to lift up the hat or peep from it ay very good   ralph then the lover supporting the poor frightened damsel   brum ay very good   ralph and lastly she herself as anxious to escape as a prisoner for life from his prison but trembling with fear lest her father should hear her for if he had you know   cheerly and laura go off ha ha ha you know    brum ha ha  looking from behind the hat very true i comprehend you  how their hearts must have leapt when they got clear off   ralph ay  and when their hands were instantly joined by the clergyman in the next room   brum a rare story indeed and very rarely contrived not like poor captain vains with his fools coat and his thousand years   ralph no twas managed by a much cleverer fellow you may take off the hat  the storys over   takes off the hat brum and where did this happen   ralph in devonshire   brum in devonshire why you said it was in spain   ralph aye devonshire in spain   brum and what sort of an ass is the old man   ralph much such another as yourself   brum as me   ralph his names brummagem   brum that is my name   ralph the same  brummagem
