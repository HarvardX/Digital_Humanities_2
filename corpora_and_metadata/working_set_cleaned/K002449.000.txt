medical improvement an address read to the medical society by john aitken fellow of the college of surgeons of edinburgh a surgeon of the royal infirmary and a president of the medical society  nequid falsi dicere audeat nequid very non audeat mobilitate viget et vires acquirit eundo edinburgh printed for and sold by john bell  mdcclxxvii  the following pages are most respectfully inscribed to the presidents and other members of the medical society  an address etc gentlemen it is with much diffidence that i officially presume to deliver a few detached thoughts chiefly respecting medical improvement as an address introductory to the commencement of our literary business in this place your indulgent candor which i have so often experienced i flatter myself will on this occasion impute the faults which you will doubtless discover not to intention but inability or misconception  i cheerfully embrace this opportunity to express the most grateful impressions i entertain of the great and unsollicited honor you have been pleased to confer upon me by twice calling me to the office of president had my powers been equal to my wishes no part of my conduct in that elevated character had been unworthy of you or of this chair although indispensible avocation permits me no longer to hold any office among you yet will i lose no opportunity of being present and as far as i may be able of assisting in your instructive speculations and of promoting to the utmost of my power the general prosperity of a society to which i ever have been so much attached  in the commercial world it is allowed by all that the comparative rate of exchange is a just index of the prosperous or adverse state of trade in different countries individually or relatively considered with no less truth in my opnion the comparative degree of cultivation to which belles lettres and philosophy or the fine and useful arts arrive in different kingdoms may be regarded as demonstrative of their relative civilization  judging by this criterion although in this respect caledonia may not justly boast of being the first she is by no means the last of the european nations her progress in the walk of general science and liberality is rapid and i hope will long continue so justice however constrains me to confess that long too long in a great degree she had neglected the medical philosophy in an era not beyond the recollection of some present the immortal honor of planting a medical school in this metropolis now indeed second in fame and erudition to none in europe was reserved to a distinguished a fortunate monro to his memory consenting nations pay that just tribute of applause which his country in general but this city and its university in particular ought to perpetuate by a statue  by a worthy select band of the numerous students who flocked from all quarters allured by the rising fame of the edinburgh university this medical society in      was happily instituted of its various progress and present flourishing independent state i presume you to be well informed and therefore avoid attempting any particular historical narration of these circumstances at present  the building the medical hall  a handsome edifice of various elegant appartments with a cupola and spire ornamented with the insignia of aesculapius erected chiefly by the liberal contributions of the members in which we are now assembled is a grand phenomenon of medical ardor unparallelled in any country and may justly be regarded as a temple sacred to aesculapius reared by the virtuous zeal of his youthful votaries for purposes the most liberal and praiseworthy the friends of science not of your number many gentlemen applauding the noble intentions of the society have been generously pleased to contribute toward defraying the expense of building the hall  lists of whom are suspended in the principal appartment who have generously contributed toward its structure are entitled to our most grateful thanks  contemplating this fabric and the many other aids which the present advantageous state of our society affords to facilitate study you must have anticipated me in this reflection that while our minds are gratefully affected to our meritorious predecessors our every power ought to be exerted if not to advance at least to maintain our extended reputation that the verdant laurels they have transmitted may not wither in our hands overwhelming us with indelible ignominy and disgrace  it is with the highest pleasure i perceive without being chargeable with adulation i can fairly aver that this society at no period of its existence has been more secure of progress than at present the learning genius and manly liberality of sentiment which i know you possess and which with much satisfaction and instruction i have so often observed animating your debates constitute the foundation on which this assertion rests  you are not to be informed that the combined powers of genius and industry must perseveringly operate through the course of several years that a tolerably complete knowledge of even the elementary parts of the science of medicine as already ascertained and taught may be acquired to have proceeded so far in medical study is indeed to have made no despicable progress but i trust your ardent ambition is more aspiring than to remain satisfied with the acquisition of a bare acquaintance of the dogmata of this or the other medical sect or professor i e of the present state of the healing art it would be offering an undeserved insult to your sagacity were i but once to imagine that you could entertain a belief that the medical philosophy had already attained the utmost perfection of which it is susceptible you well know that the unexplored regions of the terra incognita medicinalis so to speak still afford abundant scope for your most protracted labors so just is the observation ars longa vita brevis  anatomy as being the grand basis of the medical fabric from the earliest periods of society in every civilized country has been cultivated with the most unrelenting ardor of investigation which many most material improvements have from time to time rewarded are there not still however many very interesting parts and circumstances of the structure of the animal automaton which we but little know and many others of great importance of which we are totally ignorant what anatomist has hitherto been able successfully to evolve the texture of the spleen an organ of considerable size and probably of proportional importance in the animal economy very lately it has been supposed the sole fabricator of the globular part of the blood the late ingenious mr hewson of london endeavored to establish this opinion  the same question may be put with respect to the structure of the muscular fiber or living solid and that specific configuration of the several orders of the secretory organs upon which such a wonderful variety and opposition of secreted liquors probably depends but above all it may be put with respect to the brain and its appendages parts essential to life often the seat of disease evidently variously organized of great volume and surprizingly diversified in their external form  i will be pardoned for expressing my fears that few anatomical improvements are to be expected from you while residing in this country at least while its present tone continues however great your ability and ardor because an insuperable barrier is opposed to your progress i mean the want of private dissection in the end of the eightteenth century when philosophical liberality is diffused from pole to pole what a pity or rather what a shame that even in the metropolis of a kingdom not uncivilized and in its principal university too where the circle of education is otherwise tolerably complete this grand and almost only avenue to the aesculapian temple should remain most barbarously blocked up  a public course of anatomical demonstration exceeded by none and equalled by few is i confess annually made here by a learned discerning accurate indefatigable professor whom none of you can more respect than i do i notwithstanding hesitate not to declare it as my positive opinion and i will venture to say it is not solitary that no public anatomical exhibitions where the student is merely a passive spectator are sufficient to convey and impress those precise and multifarious ideas of this important branch of natural knowledge absolutely requisite to complete the medical character throwing discovery altogether out of the question  to acquire a tolerable knowledge of even the great outlines of anatomy it is indispensibly necessary to take the knife in hand and with the most unremitting attention dissect a variety of bodies of different sizes ages and sexes properly chosen and prepared for the purpose much more must this plan be followed if it be proposed to soar in the regions of discovery and improvement i can experimentally assert that more anatomical information will be reaped from the well conducted dissection of one body than from repeated public courses  if this opinion be well founded it is a selfevident consequence that attending one or two public courses of anatomy must be much inadequate to accomplish the medical philosopher especially if the practice of surgery the most evidently useful part of the healing art be his destination humanity revolts at the idea of the many unavoidable and i fear too often fatal blunders that must result from this capital defect of the medical education to be obtained in this country it is abundantly mortifying indeed to observe those who wish to attain a proper degree of anatomical knowledge after spending several years at our universities and probably attaining their highest honors reduced to the alternative of either undertaking expensive expeditions into foreign countries in this respect more civilized than ours or of remaining dangerously uninformed  if one should attempt to adjust the wheels and springs of a nice and delicate mechanism he perhaps had never before seen or at least never minutely considered with what indignant contempt would we treat the rude audacious pretender thousands alas are daily subjected to the unpractised knife of operators of necessity awkward i had almost said unskilled because they never could enjoy the requisite opportunity of either acquiring proper dexterity to perform any proposed operation with due address or full knowledge of the parts concerned from the want of access to the dead human body  this alarming consideration is surely of sufficient force to conquer the vulgar prejudices against private dissection whether the offspring of superstition or ignorance the violation of the sepulcher or the clandestine robbery of the tomb is most justly regarded as a crime of a deep dye but certainly private dissection under proper regulations is compatible with the most absolute security in this respect of this the practice of most of the european countries is an irrefragable proof viz of these countries to which our students are compelled to resort to obtain opportunities of diffecting which might so easily be afforded at home were a proportional number of dead human bodies annually furnished by authority to the medical students in the different towns of scotland in general and to those attending our universities in particular for private dissection the salutary consequences would soon surpass conception it is truly astonishing that a matter of such endless importance had not long ever now challenged the notice and roused the attention of the honorable superintendants of our police or even of the legislature itself  the criminal and flagitious whether they expire under the hands of the executioner or by disease ought always to be consigned to the anatomical knife that thus in some degree when dead they may atone to society for their depredation and turbulence when alive public utility seems likewise to have a good title to the use of the dead bodies of those who by idleness and dissipation have rendered themselves objects of public charity and consequently perhaps for many years have been clothed and fed at the public expense  humanity patriotism and even selfinterest conspire to stimulate every individual to promote at least not to oppose the establishment of a measure so pregnant with the most solid advantages to mankind the advancing liberality of this country affords the strongest reasons to hope that the auspicious era is not very distant when medical improvement shall be no more retarded by the impossibility of acquiring anatomical information in the only way that it can be acquired a mischief hitherto so opprobrious fatal and gigantic  if anatomy be defective phisiology which teaches the functions of the various organs and parts detected by anatomy must necessarily be proportionally defective not only is this the fact but the uses even of many parts which the anatomist has described with tolerable accuracy are far very far from being sufficiently explained by the phisiologist e g of several of the generative organs of the different substances and protuberances of the brain of the ganglions etc  in like manner many of the general laws and principles of the living system are not illustrated with satisfactory precision while one physiologist affirms that menstruation depends on topical another refers it to general plethora some contend that nutrition is effected by the nerves others by the vessels and a variety of facts are artfully adduced to establish these opposite doctrines with respect to many other physiological disquisitions the same contrariety of opinion exists  if the question be put what shall be said when doctors disagree i reply recur to nature collect useful facts from them draw manly liberal chaste conclusions disregard ideal cobweb flimsy theories the baseless fabric of a vision general principles rationally deduced as corrollaries from established facts only in my opinion can justly claim the dignified appellation of theory  pathology you know treats of the morbid states of animal nature with a view to effect their prevention alleviation or cure many anatomical and physiological speculations are more curious than useful and may therefore although not strictly just have the merit of being innocent pathological disquisitions on the contrary must always produce the most serious consequences because they influence the medical conduct of disease our small knowledge or rather our great ignorance of this department affords but a melancholy theme to the anxious philosophic inquirer the variety and opposition the absurdity and confusion of numberless futile conceits wild imaginations fanciful opinions dignified forsooth with the name of doctrines are the opprobrium of the medical profession and present to the contemplative mind the idea of primaeval chaos when darkness brooded over the great abyss  although i possessed ability neither your time nor patience permit me to attempt a particular enumeration of the striking absurdities which have in a great degree hitherto overwhelmed pathology depressing medicine far beneath the rank of her sister arts because these arts are established in the evolved unalterable laws of nature  one class of pathologists have recourse to the sensible qualities of the atmosphere as chiefly contributing to create the numerous and important tribe of febrile disorders and endeavor to support their reasonings by meteorological registers and observations without end with equal confidence another tribe disregarding in a great measure this opinion muster up invisible miasmata and floating poisons to untie every gordian knot either as principal agents or complete efficients in like manner while the favorite system of one period refers us with much plausibility to the fluids and morbific matter there existing for the seat and causes of many diseases that of another with at least equal probability directs our attention almost solely to spasm and other affections of the solids  i cannot avoid here to remark that were the science of medicine like fluxions infinitesimals the quadrature of the circle etc i e purely a matter of curious uninteresting speculation we might view the fluctuating instability of its dogmata or doctrines as they are called with the same tone of mind with which we contemplate the fantastic shiftings of the aurora borealis or visions of the night but how diametrically opposite must be the feelings of humanity reflecting that these successive doctrines have respectively during their fashionable periods of domination greatly influenced the medical management of disease compelling the passive entramelled bewildered practitioner to employ the most opposite curative means in the same morbid states the consequent havoc devastation and massacre of mankind is more easily imagined than described  the ancient maxim in medio tutissimus ibis should perhaps never be entirely neglected it seems exceedingly probable a priori that the fluids being made or elaborated by the solids and these on the other hand supported by the fluids their affections will not long remain distinct but rather always be reciprocal however non nostrum tantas componere lites  moreover how little we do know with tolerable certainty respecting the impressions made on the sentient parts of our bodies by what are named the potentiae nocentes or of the derangement of organization or of the number and nature of the morbid alterations thence consequent yet it seems absolutely necessary that these particulars be marked with the utmost possible precision for instance we are told that there are two species of febrile delirium requiring the most opposite treatment but who has hitherto pointed out with sufficient accuracy the symptoms ascertaining their important discrimination if therefore in such a perilous predicament the genius of blunder should but for a moment overcloud the practitioners discernment which is a very supposable but i hope a rare occurence conclamatum est  till pathology therefore is more determined and complete dont cases beset with dubiety and peril seem justly to demand a suspension of hostilities so to speak or of our therapeutic efforts which permit me to say may often with justice be termed the impertinence of art these daring practitioners who in the advanced critical febrile states which they by no means understand exhibit febrifuge nostrums such as jamess powders with a temerity that equally shocks our feelings and alarms our fears may not ineptly be compared to the nonplusd statesman who to smother dissension and broil of which his maladministration is probably the cause risks the very existence of the state itself by plunging it headlong into general combustion and foreign war  it is with much pleasure i acknowledge that in this most essential department of the medical philosophy light and order happily begin to diffuse their genial influence over darkness and confusion the genius and labors of some whom this society can reckon among her honorary sons have already contributed in no small degree to this most desirable purpose i am confident i speak your sentiments and most assuredly my own when i mention with the most particular gratitude the great advantages we have so often and so happily reaped in our inquiries from the cullenian nosology a work perspicuous though concise elaborate yet not voluminous in every part demonstrative of the liberal views and extensive medical erudition of its very respectable and accomplished author who with truth may say exegi monumentum aere perennius  supposing just indications of cure to be formed in consequence of an advanced and chaste pathology to be then provided with proper and active agents or remedies to fulfill these indications becomes a matter of most important concern the jarring opinions of authors respecting the nature activity dose and mode of exhibition of almost every article of the materia medica present a most extensive field for useful experiment and investigation  with respect to medical improvement i shall only in general add that your expectations in my opinion are less likely to be frustrated if you look for it to result more from anatomical physiological and pathological progress than from the discovery of any addition to the materia medica this part of the medical science is by no means to be neglected although it be probable that advancing but a single step in any of the other walks may be productive of more real and solid improvement and utility than the acquisition of a thousand simples if it be true that it is an easier business to fulfill than institute proper curative indications  be assured that the physician towers above the empiric the nurse and old woman almost only in proportion to his superior information respecting the parts the laws and morbid states of animal nature the more perfect his acquirements in these particulars the higher his preeminence among the sons of aesculapius no mode of inauguration however solemn no academic rites or authority however great or ancient can elevate to the honorable rank of physician a person of an opposite description such a one could only be regarded as an empty dignified form around whose blighting temples the venal the surreptitious the prostituted laurels of apollo must basely fade to the utter discredit of all concerned a more melancholy consequence still would be that his practice could not fail to prove the bane of society operating the destruction of such individuals as might become the unfortunate subjects of his temerity  if therefore to become a physician  i e to be qualified to mark with precision the almost infinitely various affections of animated matter so as to direct as far as may be its movements to the blissful abode of longaevity and health be a task only terminating with life to be exhausted by no labor and to which the most discriminating mental powers are not superior the folly not to say criminality of attempts such as those of tissot etc to incite vulgar vanity to tamper with the most precious interests of mankind needs no illustration  in every species of philosophical investigation particularly those of a medical nature where certainty is so difficultly attained to guard against credulity is a counsel i deem of such infinite importance that before i put an end to this address i cannot help tendering it in the most earnest manner to the particular notice of my younger socii in all cases where there is not absolute demonstration or at least as high a degree of evidence as the nature of the argument admits to suspend belief or to exercise a proper degree of skepticism till mature examination and reflection shall compel assent i regard as a measure prudent rational and philosophic the unsupported ipse dixit of any man however great his name in science i always consider as a very weak argument recantation at best is exceedingly disagreeable  the constitution of our society or its present system of laws i am far from reckoning perfect many meliorations i doubt not will be made from time to time no good reason can be assigned why our meetings should be suspended during half the year in summer indeed they might probably be thin but it does not follow that your speculations on that account would be less instructive or your essays more imperfect  i conclude by congratulating you upon your affairs being now happily in such a prosperous train as to afford the most flattering prospects i contemplate the rising glory and future greatness of the medical society with no small degree of pleasurable ecstasy and expectation methinks i hear its towering genius with the most complacent exultation exclaim
