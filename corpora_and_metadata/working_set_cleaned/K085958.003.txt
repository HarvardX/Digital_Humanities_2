leads to a pleasurable one no conception however lively no language however forcible no pen however ingenious ever yet succeeded in describing the lost the unhinged state of the human mind when sudden and dreadful distress brings on a temporary suspension of the mental faculties much less can the tumultuary throng of broken and incoherent ideas be described which seem to be precipitated from the overloaded heart to the wandering brain at the doubtful return of imperfect recollection  though i should never forget we re i to live a thousand years the freezing horror the madening agony i endured when i encountered the murderous glare of the lioness as her eyes flashed fire in the moment of springing at me yet i cannot think i was utterly senseless except for a very short interval my situation was more like that of a frantic bedlamite in a powerful paroxism i screamed i fought i resisted and verily believed when at the moment reason began to dawn i felt something tug my clothes that i was covered with wounds and at my last gasp  judge of my astonishment reader when as my recollection grew more and more perfect i found myself entirely free from injury and that it was nothing but the cub that occasioned the tugging which i described before if i was astonished at this how was my wonder turned to delight when looking wildly round me i beheld the lioness stretched on a pointed prominence of the rock beneath me and weltering in gore  the truth was that as i fell at the very instant she sprung at me she could not resist the force of her own impetuosity and meeting with nothing to oppose the violence of the effort she made to seize me she was precipitated over my head into the abyss beneath mysterious providence thought i that can strengthen the single hair by which our lives are suspended to mock the force of the tempest and the ferocity of lions oh what an effusion of gratitude issued from my lips but not fast enough to relieve my poor loaded heart i grew dizzy every artery throbbed i thought i should again have fainted at length a flood of thankful tears calmed me into obedient and passive resignation  and now the poor cub that seemed delighted at my returning to life frolicked and played about me like a kitten i could not help taking pleasure at its awkward antics and yet it was a pleasure mingled with dread who knew if i attempted to protect it when it grew older and got strength but my life would be the forfeit was compassion to a brute a sensation to be indulged by me had i not in my own species experienced the villainy of a false friend the barbarity of an unnatural brother and even the cruelty of an unkind husband and could i expect any thing but treachery and destruction from a beast of prey no i was determined to rid myself of every fear by destroying the object of my apprehensions  as i was absorbed in this meditation the poor thing came about me in so innocent and harmless a manner that all the world could not have induced me to injure it i ever held life as so sacred a trust though heaven knows for the benefits with which it abounds it is scarcely worth preserving that i never wantonly nor perversely destroyed any thing that had animal existence what new feelings then was i to adopt that could so far make me forget my nature as to kill the thing that flew to me for protection  besides i argued thus what the mother did was natural it was in defense of her young and the mercy of that gracious providence who had destroyed her to preserve me would be ill requited were i to take the life of an innocent and defenseless creature under a dread of my destruction which no chance could accomplish without the permission of providence the utmost therefore i could prevail upon myself to resolve on was to lose the cub by the way and trust to chance for the rest  thus i reflected and rambled making a short stay now and then near some plantain tree where i imperfectly satisfied my hunger or dipping out withn a shell some water from one of those innumerable rivulets which issued from the cascade to slake my thirst and all this during a most debilitated state of body become almost paralytic with the shocking vicissitudes that had assailed my mind  i found however i had more care upon my hands than for myself the poor cub was no more proof against hunger than i and as it would not leave me i felt it incumbent on me to procure it some food i mashed the fruit of the plantain into a sort of a paste with water but he would not touch it i tried him with berries and other fruit to no purpose at last he seemed to entice me to the verge of the lawn on the east side where i perceived a declining path which led in a serpentine direction among various shrubs gradually toward the sea shore  the farther we went on the more eager the cub seemed and as i made but a slow progress and was obliged out of weakness several times to sit down he could scarcely contain his impatience at length he darted away from me and presently returned with some sort of flesh in his mouth which he laid down at my feet then ran away again and then again retuned with more flesh which he began to eat  a most uncommon gloom came over me at this circumstance confused conjecture pointed out every thing dreadful and nothing conclusive my mind seemed involved as if shutting out faculty and under the influence of a horrid gloom that distorted idea and paralyzed reflection i hastened to obey an impulfe which i knew would lead me to something dreadful yet which hurried me on with a force resistless  arrived near the bottom where a skirting of the rock prevented loose objects from being washed into the sea gracious god what a horrid sight did i behold bones heads legs arms and other fragments of human carcasses lay scattered upon the sand my poor heart sunk within me truly thought i did i conjecture that the island had been despoiled of its inhabitants by wild beasts truly did i anticipate a fate that too certainly awaits me and though i have once miraculously escaped a fate now inevitable that no shelter can evade no vigilance elude  thus i walked about uttering distracted and incoherent sentences when i discerned that which had i given myself time for reflection would have considerably relieved my mind the bodies of the poor wretches which had been thus mangled were those i had buried i knew their clothes and i knew the wrappers in which i had enclosed them and from which they had been torn and this proves the common observation that lions will not prey upon carcases to be false  i soon found the mouth of that hollow into which i had plunged the bodies and as i knew i was then standing immediately under the wreck it was my business seriously to take such measures as would be most likely to lead me to my old habitation  sunk as i was in despair never did lightning dart quicker across the atmosphere than did this ray of hope across my mind it made in a moment two important discoveries i found that no injury had been done to the living and i knew exactly where i was  looking about i observed a perforation in the rock which seemed to take a horizontal direction this i determined to explore taking at the same time every precaution not to be misled when i had ventured as far as i could judge by measuring my steps about three hundred yards all the way upon rising ground the opening took two different roads one almost sttraight on and the other to the left as i thought i discerned a glimmer of light at the end of that which led to the left i pursued it knowing that if i discovered nothing to my satisfaction i could but on my return take again a direction to the left and i should then satisfy myself as to where it might lead me  when i got to the end of this cavern i found to my great surprise that it opened upon the lawn and i began now to see that it must certainly be contiguous to the plain where i had fixed my abode and that i had only played about it in my ramblings i therefore determined to return and pursue the straightforward track which of course i should now find by turning to my left to be brief i did so when finding the cavern take two directions again i providentially pursued that which led to the right and in a few minutes observed the glimmer of a lamp which i knew could proceed from no place but my inner apartment which served me for a kitchen and which lamp i had so constructed that it would not only burn for five days but mark the hours by the decrease of the oil  chap ii hannah like pandora explores the fatal chest from which issues all manner of evils she however finds hope at the bottom fatigued to such a degree as to be almost berest of all power i with inconceivable difficulty reached my couch by the side of which my knees involuntarily obeyed their accustomed office while my mind issued from my lips  after a short time my prayers and tears having wonderfully relieved me i began a little to recollect myself and consider what to set about my first wish was to visit the wreck and explore the dreadful secret that i had so imperfectly discovered but finding my mind unequal to so trying a task and knowing besides that night would come on before i could accomplish it i adopted what prudence dictated and determined by refreshment and repose to strengthen my faculties until they should be able to sustain all consequences before i sought to know what i feared would require their united force to bear up my resolution against what i had to endure  i instantly made a fire and began to prepare my supper but when i went to fetch some rice i found it had been visited by vermin i had frequently been plundered by a kind of mungoose and another animal like the kangaroo which i used to catch in traps but by what i could remark the creature that had been so busy in my absence was of a smaller kind i was not long however in the dark for the young lion who had not stirred a moment from my side as i was laying my cloth sprung across the cavern and in a moment returned with a large rat which he laid at my feet  extraordinary occurrences though of ever so trivial a nature always made upon my mind a deep impression in my present lonely situation my nerves perpetually in a tremulous state no wonder if this disposition had strengthened i looked at the creature with pleasure and but for apprehension could have caressed it i recollected my partiaiity for cats which seemed to have been dictated by something intuitive to inure me to the presence of a species of animal which though naturally ferocious can be tamed and domesticated  i went a great way into this i knew not why the noble nature of the lion thought i is almost a proverb and so many extraordinary circumstances have been well authenticated concerning him that there can be no doubt but he is capable of feeling of honor of generosity and of gratitude why then should we hesitate in cultivating the friendship of a lion when we cultivate the friendship of men who we know are incapable of all these  has any body ever dared to dispute the fact of the gladiator whose life was saved by the intervention of providence that sent a lion into the circus out of whose foot the man had plucked a thorn when he accidentally met him in a forest this was more than noble i know not if it would dishonor the expression to call it godlike  hannon a general of a carthaginian army after rendering some accidental service to a lion so tamed him that he followed him to the camp carried his baggage for him and became an able and valuable domestic this was the noble nature of a brute see what upon this occasion was the mean the grovelling feelings of man the suspicious carthaginians whom hannon had rendered services of a thousand times greater magnitude than he had rendered the lion they pusilanimously fearing that a man who could tame lions would in the end become a formidable and dangerous enemy banished him from their country  the beautiful story of una in spencer and the reverence in which a lion is supposed to hold the softer sex next came into my mind in short i went on in such a train of thinking and so bewildered my imagination on this subject that at length recollecting on a sudden that by the size of the animal it must have been born not far distant from the time of the shipwreck i exclaimed if i could prevail upon myself to believe in the doctrine of pythagoras i might be tempted to think that the soul of hewit when it fled his existence returned to inhabit this noble beast that so he might yet be my protector  during the time these my reflections took place in my mind i looked at the creature with such complacency that he seemed delighted i encouraged him therefore called him leo and enticed him to eat but though he lapped up the water in which some rice and plantain had been boiled which had a soft taste like milk he seemed to have no relish for any thing to eat but animal food i therefore gave him permission to eat the rat at which he came purring about me greatly pleased and then took it into a corner and devoured it  i now retired to rest not however without apprehension but not enough to weigh much upon my mind for after reviving my confidence by a supplication fatigue lulled me into a most profound sleep  in the morning i found my lion who with cat like watch as shakespeare calls it had waited for me to awake i arose and began to think what i had to do and to consider whether i had resolution enough to encounter the dreadful task of exploring the chest i certainly sound myself greatly restored but i was uncommonly depressed after breakfast however as suspense seemed to me to be worse than the worst certainty i resolved let the consequence be what it might to penetrate the perhaps fatal secret  fatal it was for on opening the chest i discovered but too plainly that it belonged to my husband oh the horridly cruel feelings that drenched me at every pore as i examined the contents of it my letters to him tenderly written at different times little presents that i had made him on his birth day on mine on the different anniversaries of our marriage new years gifts my own portrait letters he had intended to send me all collected no doubt to serve him as a consolation in my absence other letters which i could not then examine and a variety of articles all as so many piles of unmerciful proofs that he for whom i had encountered such wretchedness such peril was now no more  oh god cried i this is dreadful was it for this i escaped from shipwreck from savages from the machinations of a villain from famine from the jaws of the lioness oh that the sea had swallowed me that i had been killed and eaten that i had died in defending my honor that i had starved that i had satiated the hunger of a monster any any fate rather oh infinitely rather than this but i have still my remedy in my power and surely when the various the complicate agravations are considered if fate has allotted any particular minister to punish suicide my unexampled provocation will avert the impending stroke and admitting the plea of stern necessity soften crime into virtue and turn the frown of justice into the smile of mercy  consider continued i consider oh god my deplorable condition let me not live to be a prey to reflection yet let not madness drive me to self slaughter rather if thou shall graciously determine that the measure of my sufferings is complete stretch forth thy merciful hand and take a life already lost to all the purposes of animation  it would touch the susceptible reader to the soul could i find language to picture the forlorn the fallen the heart sick situation to which i was reduced at this moment at the distance of a year and a half my tears blot out the words as i write them and how divine providence soothed my mind into an abandonment and afterward into a repentance of my dreadful determination to destroy myself that power alone knows that has permitted me to sustain and to survive so many trials with no comfort but the hope that my carreer of misery at an end i shall in a better world meet my husband never to part again  it is astonishing with what avidity the human mind after glutting itself with inordinate distress flies to the other extreme and deceives itself into consolation scarcely had i brought myself into a state far from composure but something less distracted but i chid my hasty fears that had driven me to grieve for perhaps an imaginary evil the arguments i had held before occurred to me again it was true i had ascertained the dreadful fact but it did not actually follow though probability seemed to lend it a color that hewit was on board at the time the ship was lost he might by accident have been left behind the ship might have been driven from her moorings by the storm and he ashore for the two boats i had seen could not have held any thing like her complement of hands these and twenty other delusive hopes gross absurd ignorant nay all but impossible did i catch at like so many straws to save my poor heart from sinking  at last i was so possessed with this impulse that i determined to examine the ships books and every other document that could possibly lead me to the real truth and indeed i was stongly inclined to do this from another reason which was that as we were at war with france when the grosvenot left india it was possible that hewit might in some kind of way been captured and his property detained though he might have been set free  all these vague and inconclusive conjectures gave way to conviction upon examining the books for i not only found that he had been a foremastman on board that ship but by a station book belonging to one of the mates that he had not left her at the time she was laboring in the storm consequently he must have been shipwrecked in her  nay at last i found a signal book in his own hand writing which informed me that he fired the very gun as a signal of distress that awaked me in the dreadful condition i formerly described as i lay in the cavern nay heart breaking circumstance as there was scarcely a memorandum in the whole book that had not some tender allusion by way of comment to the violent and unexampled affection he bore me so opposite this note did he put up a supplication to heaven that unworthy as he was of me through the mediation of those prayers i might then be putting up for him and which heaven knows at that very moment i was putting up for him his impending danger might be averted  to trouble the reader with the effect this disappointment had on my mind would be only going over the same ground again the difference was that as my grief in the first instance was vented in frantic exclamation so now it was saddened into sullen despair  my investigation of this business was not however entirely in vain i found that the entrepreneur had shipped a lioness big with young as a present for the queen of france and by the recollection of the beast that fled from me at the time of the shipwreck which doubtless had buffetted the billows and escaped to shore and that it could be no other whose fangs i had so miraculously escaped i had no doubt but that it was the mother of poor leo and this relieved my mind from any further apprehension that beasts of prey inhabited the island  this though a negative comfort was yet a comfort and as a man would forget for a moment the consumption that was wasting him upon being relieved from the tooth ache so the malady that i felt and hoped would consume me underwent a transient suspension upon my receiving this assurance that the short life i was fated to linger out would not be tormented with the additional pang of so terrible an apprehension  chap iii letters and documents which astonished hannah hewit and will no doubt astonish the reader after an examination of more than five hours of different documents which now and then contained passages too powerful for my feelings i resolved to return home and since nothing could flatter me with a reverse of my wretched fate alas now too certain explore no more at a time than i had resolution to bear  this lesson of prudence i not only set myself but performed if a heart breaking circumstance overpowered me i took the consolation of reflecting that providence permitted it perhaps to prevent something more sinister then i would take a short walk look at the beauties that surrounded me take some trifling refreshment pat leo and then return peruse more misery and take more relief  thus for several days i went on i would kiss john hewits hair enclosed in a trinket wish myself with him and then solemnly vow not to hasten my dissolution then read a fragment of a repentant letter on which i could plainly perceive he had shed tears then drop a tear on it myself then feel a slight relief then place it near my heart and make a solitary dinner  then would i peruse in a pocket bible where our different ages were written in his own hand the day of our marriage the ages of our children the last of which memorandums he had blotted out and afterward restored then as in agony the book was falling from my hand would accident point me out some sacred sentence which admonishing my weakness inspired me with resolution  the feeling reader will not only picture this for me and a great deal more but will pardon me that i hang upon griefs when it is my duty to relate circumstances  the particulars which i gathered from those papers connected with a chain of events relative to this history were these my brother the lawyer while he lay under sentence of death in newgate informed hewit that he and sourby had connived at all the wretchedness he had suffered that in the last business mrs vint who was a cast off mistress of sourby was an instrument it was she who enflamed the passions of hewit by every art she could devise and in particular by exaggerating every thing relative to the interview with binns at the play of bringing proof upon proof through the medium of engines that were employed that i had met him repeatedly in private before we went to france  my brother the lawyer however was very little concerned in this the whole scheme was concerted between sourby and that diabolical woman of whom though i did not entirely approve i had the weakness to entertain a good opinion which after all is not wonderful for i was tired out at last and except some material concern of my own obliged me to be on my guard i chose to silence the dictates of my own sagacity rather than be perpetually suspicious  these two friends though they hated each other joined hand and heart in this infernal plot his point to gain me here is to gain hewit our sudden departure for france delayed their measures for a time our return renewed them the nicest hints were thrown out the most subtle arts employed even my innocent child was an instrument of their infernal infamy and the reader knows they so far succeeded as to drive a husband with a broken heart from her arms whom even while he thought her an adultress he loved dearer than the whole world  when hewit left me it was his firm determination to go to india and for that purpose he was as he wrote under weigh in the downs in the vansitart and to say the truth this was a master stroke of sourby all whose pleasures were nothing unless the fruit of treachery for as he hated mrs vint he wished to deprive her of hewit that he might laugh at her while he had me completely in his power  but the lady who in art was at least a match for the gentleman chose to expostulate with him upon this and vowed she would instantly acquaint me with every thing and so disconcert all his scheme if he did not cause hewit to be arrested when the ship should arrive at portsmouth that she by stepping in and relieving him might make such merit of her friendship as should induce him to be grateful  this was accordingly done hewit was arrested at portsmouth and detained till the ship had sailed and now good mrs vint chose very opportunely to happen to be near at hand and offered either to pay the money or get bail for him the first offer he did not chose to accept for indeed he did not owe the money being arrested upon a perjury the other however with some hesitation he did accept and came to town but finding at length too plainly what return she expected for all this friendship he not only revolted at the conditions but began to see a motive for believing that i might have been wronged  in this situation he fluctuated and actually made several attempts to find me till at length when he was on the point of surrendering himself to prison in exoneration of his bail to get rid of the obligation my brother the lawyer sent for him as i mentioned before acquainted him with the whole business from first to last and taught him how to laugh at the action which was a fraud  during all this time by unfortunately taking too much precaution i missed of my husband and he of me nay the circumstance is a kind of miracle for among the documents in the fatal chest i found a duplicate of the very newspaper in which i had as the reader remembers read an account of my brothers being condemned and which contained though probably from the shock of such dreadful news i i overlooked it the following advertisement  a repentant husband  if hannah hewit wife of john hewit who with the most unexampled cruelty left her to wretchedness and distress without the smallest provocation but instigated by calumny and treachery will make known to her miserable and disconsolate husband the place of her abode she shall be soon convinced that nothing but a train of the most subtle and diabolical art could have been the cause of his unpardonable conduct and that it shall be the business of his life by tenderness and contrition to merit her forgiveness a line addressed to j h salopian coffeehouse will be remembered with the truest gratitude  searching further i found the trials of my brother the lawyer and sourby at length in which every nerve was evidently strained by the whole gang to save them an alibi was set up swearers on their part came to invalidate the evidence for the crown mrs vint who was taken up as an accomplice turned kings evidence to have her full revenge on sourby and being severely cross examined by the counsel grew so exasperated that she threw a candlestick at his head for the trial lasted from nine oclock one morning till three the next for which she was committed for a contempt of court in short though i at the time heard not a syllable of it nor was mr morris acquainted with it who plodding on minded no business but his own it was evident the town must have rung of it  early in the trial it went hard with my brother and indeed such a catalogue of black deeds came out against him that the jury very soon made up their minds this was not exactly the case in relation to sourby to whose superior cunning after all my brother had been the dupe points of law were artfully thrown in the way of conviction persons of distinction particularly a lord appeared to give him the character of a gentleman and a man of probity and honor and though the bench and indeed the jury considered him as the greater villain of the two yet his crime was so warily committed and his defense so artfully undertaken that there was no bringing home to him the crime of forgery with intent to defraud  every power however in the breast of the judges was stretched to punish sourby and his sentence was to be transported to the coast of africa for life nor did they spare in the passing this sentence to mark his attrocity nay those fashionable gentlemen who appeared to gloss over so infamous a character were severely glanced at and greatly to the honor of the bench was this conduct the poor wretch who breaks a bakers window to steal a loaf that a starving family may satisfy the cravings of hunger must be hanged nor will a single creature appear in his behalf nor a counsel plead his cause for he is poor the fashionable villain whose study is domestic ruin shall have the first legal abilities to support his cause and persons of the first distinction to give him a fair character because he is rich  i would ask does an advocate think he supports the honor of the bar by receiving the brief and fee of a client whose infamous character he in common with all the world is acquainted with does a lord believe he has not uttered virtual perjury when he has given a man the character of honest and honorable whom he knows has spent many many thousands without ever having received a single shilling in his life that he has either earned or inherited  to crown this business i cannot refrain from mentioning a letter of mrs vint to sourby in answer to one where he upbraids her for becoming kings evidence she most triumphantly glories in the prospect she has of seeing him hanged she ridicules him for one who in the progress of his nefarious profession had acted like an idiot and a bungler upbraids him for not leaving hewit to her management telling him that his malignant mind could never bear that any person should receive a satisfaction but himself she laughs at him for the folly of having so often missed the accomplishment of his designs upon me she anticipates all the mortification and all the ignominy he is to suffer she tries him casts him condemns him puts the halter round his neck draws the cap over his eyes and at last with a most solemn asseveration that the declaration comes from the bottom of her soul she vows she would give a year of her own life to have the pleasure of assisting the hangman then to finish all she adds but what was to be expected of one whose father an irish white boy was called murdering murdoch and whose mother left the more creditable purlieus of billingsgate to support an infamous life by betraying innocence to prostitution  well said i upon reading this did heaven direct its vengeance it could no longer wink at such complicate such monstrous villainy but sent that shark at once its minister of justice to punish him and of mercy to protect me  chap iv leo becomes very usfeul hannah turns builder and erects the shell of a very elegant structure many other documents did i discover which however are of no further moment to the reader than as serving for a corroboration of all i have related and now having let two months elapse with no other employ than feasting my mind with a food it devoured and nauseated i became collected enough to look round me and see in earnest what plan i had best adopt  certainty is so preferable to suspense that i now began thus to reason with myself suppose i had never discovered the fatal chest how would it have mended my situation i should have had reason to believe that poor hewit was yet alive what then as to him but wretchedness of mind mixed with the pangs of compunction what as to me but solitariness and uncertainty while he was wandering through the world in search of her he would never find  but to be so near him and yet lose him that pang was severe but it was inevitable the hand of fate was in it we were born to separate never to meet again and i was in a better situation to taste the misery bitter as it was where i could sooth my own sorrows by the sweet recollection that i had not deserved them than in a vain idle world where the trivial and unfeeling would have ridiculed a pious duty to which their pitiable and trifling minds were insensible  on the the other hand for such a situation i was not unmindful how many comforts as far as i was capable of comfort i possessed in a desolate island where one would think i should find nothing but danger and famine i was safe and in the midst of plenty the riches of the east courted my acceptance and my faithful lion secured me from every peril  my poor leo who most fortunately for me became my protector for i soon began to discover though i had been pretty secure from annoyance before i emptied the ship of her provisions that having now such a magazine i should soon have been overrun by depredators as to the rats which i at first wondered at for they were european rats i found upon recollection they must have come from the ship and being few in number might soon be dispersed but creatures now came about me of several descriptions nay the smaller sort of the monkeys at last scented my store  leo however soon rooted them all and in a fortnight i was ptetty well convinced i should have no further trouble at first i own i was very much alarmed lest his preying upon animal food might one day or other make him forget his duty but these apprehensions soon ceased i treated him exactly as i would a favorite cat made palatable messes for him and gave him no animal food but what i previously dressed which no doubt softened his natural ferocity for no lamb ever was so gentle no spaniel so obedient  one circumstance very probably contributed to the attention and fidelity i received from leo after i had had him about a fortnight he pursued a kind of racoon which turned round and defending itself leo soon conquered him but exactly as i have known a rat turn in despair against a large dog so this nasty animal by way of a desperate effort flew at leos eyes and fastened its talon so deep into one of them that i had great fear he would have lost the sight of it i turned occulist upon this occasion and by proper applications made a perfect cure of him in the course of something more than three weeks and this the reader will readily grant insured me his gratitude  under all these considerations having balanced the good and the bad having seen the folly of despair the impossibility of radical relief the certainty of as much comfort as such a situation would admit i fairly looked my fortune full in the face and plainly saw all things considered that miserable as i was there were thousands in the world infinitely worse off  i had now been on this desolate island exactly a year and having weathered the first rainy season and being not yet forty there was little probability but i might see many more days pass over my head than would be welcome to me in order to beguile the time therefore as much as possible i was determined to go upon some large plan that i might fully employ my mind and give free scope for my ingenuity  having made this my object of contemplation for many days i at at last digested every thing first of all i was determined to change my place of abode for i had no doubt but living within the rock had been in a great measure the cause of the different illnesses i had been afflicted with besides it was dreary and had a tendency rather to inspire than dispel gloom i therefore resolved to erect a proper building calculated for pleasure and convenience in a situation on the lawn which was sufficiently shaded from the south sun and sheltered from the north wind with a large expansion of verdure that terminated before me with the promontary that i have already described to extend like a terrace and over look the sea on the right with the cascade and on the left with those majestic trees tier upon tier that made a large segment of that natural amphitheatre into which the whole was so beautifully formed  i had a great deal to think of a slight building would have been blown down by the first hurricane or washed away by the rain and though i had a variety of materials it did not appear that they would serve to erect any edifice proof against such accidents i had an idea of planting trees and interlacing spars junk and other things so as in time to make a firm wall its foundation fairly rooted in the earth but this would require time to bring it to perfection and i wanted a place to reside in immediately besides there would be no ingenuity in it  i must have a place thought i in which strength shall vie with symetry which shall evince taste elegance a knowledge of proportion that shall at once brave the fury of the storm stem the course of the inundation and yet be handsome and ornamental  i resolved to build a wall of an oval form my roof i was determined should be flat with a low dome in the center by this means i knew i should oppose such a body of strength and roundness to the weather as would so completely shelter me that the wind and rain could find no lodgment from any quarter and then i should be perfectly secure from all external apprehension  this shell once completed i planned to divide it within into a vestibule a saloon a storehouse a kitchen a chapel and a dormitory which several partitions would serve to strengthen it still more and give me opportunity with perfect convenience to follow all my occupations but i shall first describe how i managed to erect the shell  i could have cast the whole wall in moulds in the nature of london wall or any other walls surrounding great cities but i chose rather to build it with brick and mortar my brick i formed from that earth which lay about in plenty and which i have before described as bearing a strong resemblance to the petunse with which with the assistance of the kaolin they in china make porcelaine the kaolin admitting only of a semivitrification and the petunse being capable of completely vitrifying these bricks i think i formed upon a better principle than those which are made in england and this i shall particularly describe as perhaps it may induce an imitation of my plan and ill as the world deserves at my hands i am not so churlish as to withhold any thing that can be of use to my fellow creatures greatly as they have profited though i have never done so by my ingenuity  as to mortar i had noticed a part of the rock indeed many parts of it that had been fairly slaked at the commencement of the rainy reason this was nothing more than lime rendered quick by the heat of the sun whose power the rock containing a quantity of calcareous gas had opened the pores and expelled it by calcination exactly as the same operation is performed by fire  i therefore got together a quantity of these lime stones thus almost ready burnt to my hands as to the other ingredient sand there could be no difficulty of course in finding that and with these materials having first made me a trowel a level and every necessary tool for my purpose i turned bricklayer and built me an oval brick wall strengthened occasionally with bond timber fiftyfour feet by thirtysix and thirteen feet high from the surface of the earth allowing two feet more for the foundation  before i could form my roof it was necessary i should mark out my interior plan i described in the center a circle of eighteen feet diameter i then formed it into an octagon which i intended to call my saloon so that there were eighteen feet left either way toward the ends and nine feet toward the sides the space for my door was toward the south and the space between that and the saloon formed a vestibule on the other side behind the saloon i had a space exactly the size of the vestibule which i intended to make into a dormitory and now having drawn these lines there remained toward each end a space something in the form of the letter d one of these that toward the west i separated exactly in the middle one part to serve for a kitchen the other for a storeroom and the remaining d i intended to use as a chapel the altar being at the end and standing north and south  at the point of every angle given me by these forms i placed an upright eleven feet high i next formed my roof to dovetail into the ends of these uprights and intermixed it with smaller quartering and now i had got the complete skeleton of my building my next business was to raise a dome from the octagon in the center which i did by forming eight pieces of basket work into gores leaving four appertures for a skylight these being placed in their proper situations and drawn to a point i laced them together first with oziers and then afterward with small cordage after this i cut gores of the same size out of sailcloth and having sewed them strongly together they took the form of a cap for the basketing so that the whole was now a complete dome  with the flat part of the roof i had very little trouble for i first nailed sailcloth over it tarred and afterward copper and now being covered in i had nothing to do but to enclose my apartments and to decorate them  i began with my dormitory which i enclosed every where with sailcloth and hung afterward with chintz next i enclosed my kichen with painted sailcloth only and furnished it with utensils made out of the ships copper after this i fitted up my storeroom in the same manner and this was all i was able to do and to house all my treasure before the arrival of the birds a second time gave me notice that i must make every thing wind and water tight against the approaching rainy season  the reader will recollect that my wall was thirteen feet high and that my ceiling was no more than eleven so that the flat part of the roof was not so high by two feet as the wall which formed a parapet round it in order therefore to divert the rain i had at given distances left perforations in the building of the wall like the scuppers of a ship which were sure to answer every purpose  the foundation of the building no weather could injure i had therefore nothing to do but to look to the windows of these there were two that looked into the vestibule two into the kitchen two into the storeroom one into my dormitory and four into the chapel besides four others which were framed into the dome to serve as a skylight for the octagons  having found several of the cabin windows pretty sound which were of course unshipped early in the storm to make room for the dead lights i resolved to use them as far as they would go knowing that the same dead lights in the same extremity would again serve to replace them as to the skylight i was not able there to use glass at all i therefore stretched fine calico across the appertures on the inside having first given it three or four complete coats of gum so as to render it properly transparent  i had now my kitchen my storeroom and my dormitory entirely completed and furnished i determined therefore to employ the short time that remained before the rainy season in getting eggs catching young birds and laying in such stores as might serve to vary my food and eke it out the longer  i had my annoyance the monkies to encounter as before but indeed i had seen a great deal more of them since i had changed my situation from the plain to the lawn on account of the cocoa nuts which they seemed very fond of and as they threw them with force upon the rocks to break them i had nothing to do at any time but to watch and protected by leo to help myself whenever i thought proper  chap v the building gets into a very forward state during its progress the reader will have reason to admire the perseverance and ingenuity of hannah hewit the birds were now gone and the rainy season began again to set in i therefore resolved to get ready the inside of my building i had paved my storeroom and kitchen with large gray bricks or rather tiles as those were places of common use but having in my researches found earth of a variety of colors that would mould into any form i resolved to floor the rest of the apartments variously according to the uses to which they were to be appropriated  my dormitory i raised upon quartering and laid down in it a regular flooring of wood for i considered that sleeping warm and comfortable would be greatly conducive to the preservation of my health over this i laid sailcloth and again over that coarse chintz so that it formed altogether a beautiful carpet my bed furniture was made of a fine muslin spread over a bedstead in the form of a canopy my bed was down and my coverlid a clear muslin worked in silks with roses and violets and extended over a rich strawcoloured taffeta my toilette was composed of a sprigged muslin the colors lilac and green which i stretched over a pink taffeta and the sides of the room as i mentioned before being hung with a fine chintz it formed upon the whole an elegant and comfortable bed chamber  i floored the vestibule alternately with black and white square tiles and having taken care properly to vein them in the moulding it had all the effect of marble i then hung it with sailcloth as i had done the kitchen and store room and over that pasted india paper  my saloon which i meant to appropriate to purposes of amusement i resolved to decorate as neatly as possible i therefore formed a fancy floor something like mosaic work lined the dome first with sailcloth and then india paper cut into fanciful forms and afterward painted the sides a pearl color which as i intended to decorate it with pictures i thought would have a still and harmonious effect  my chapel being an object of more attentive consideration than my other apartments i resolved to lay it out in a manner proper to inspire devotion the floor was mosaic but of a grander and more striking kind than that of my saloon the sides formed of sailcloth i disposed into compartments with an intention in time to fill them with paintings the subjects taken from scripture and between them appeared niches holding urns on which i meant to place inscriptions each sacred to the memory of some friend or descriptive of some event wherein the mercy of providence had manifested itself in my favor  at the back i erected a neat altar and on the table laid the bible i had found in the fatal chest behind which i placed two skulls and the bones of four arms intesected as closely as poffible as a memento mori reader guess whose skulls and whose bones these were whose could they be to revive a wish that i had experienced a similar fate but those of the husband and wife whom i had found embracing each other and embraced by death  i did not inform the reader that a few days after i regained the cavern i took a whole morning to inter the mangled remains of those poor wretches that the lioness had scattered upon the sand at which time having found that unhappy couple in a state less mutilated than the rest i reserved these sad relicts to serve for the solemn use i had now put them to  all this work without any of the ornamental part performed a little at a time took me the whole of the rainy season which seemed to be shorter and less violent than the last during its continuance though i was now and then indisposed and had a kind of aguish fever i cannot say i had any serious illness greatly owing no doubt to the comfortable manner in which i was housed and also probably to my keeping my mind in continual occupation  lest it should appear extraordinary that in nine months i should have brought a building of such magnitude to this state of forwardness with no artificer in any one of the branches but myself i will show that i found all i did easily practicable  it must first of all be given me that i was perfectly mistress of every mystery in building which after what the reader has known of me will i think be very readily admitted as to all the materials except the brick and mortar i was furnished from the wreck with three times as much as i wanted as to wood work i had yards spars sprits booms handspecs marlinspikes and many other resources and if i wanted any thing to bend into particular forms canes and other acquatic plants in prodigious variety grew every where around me  the ships ropes were of very particular use to me for with them i interlaced and bound every thing together particularly about the roof so as to add considerably to its strength and then for iron work i could not possibly want that where there were such a plenty of ring bolts rag bolts fender bolts boot hooks fish hooks foot hooks can hooks and cat hooks  the difficulty if there were any should seem to proceed from my inability to manage objects of such a massy and ponderous kind but this objection will be completely done away when it is considered there is not a possible resource against every inconvenience of this nature but is to be found on board a ship and if five or six men can navigate a vessel of two hundred and fifty tons in all weathers take in her laden discharge it weigh her anchors cat them and in short find themselves equal to every necessary labor what difficulty could i possibly find in removing a body of five or six hundred weight to a short distance  it is not strength in such a case it is the multiplication of mechanical power if i wanted to raise a perpendicular i have already described how easily it was to be done by means of a tackle which by the action and reaction of blocks may be managed till the purchase shall lighten five hundred weight to a feather  if i wanted to haul any thing to a given distance by describing the nature of warping a vessel out of a harbor or heaving up an anchor which weighs several tons exclusive of the pressure of the water uncalculable as to weight and which may be done with ease by six or eight men how very easily must i have been able to accomplish the removal of six hundred weight by means of my capstern  besides i had a labourer and a very able one leo with two paniers upon his back would carry me three thousand bricks of a day at last i made a cart for him and fairly put him in harness and such was his gratitude to me that no racer at newmarket on whom thousands were betted or set of ponies in hyde park who paraded with the toast of the day for heaven knows every modern toast is almost an ephemeron could prance along with more pride or more grace than did this noble creature  i confess after all that my perseverance was beyond credibility but without it nothing is to be accomplished and with it almost every thing my labor solaced me and it is well it did for my mind was naturally so active and so continually aspiring that had i not cheated myfelf of grief by giving every encouragement to its activity i should either have saddened into melancholy or have been exasperated into distraction  nor can i charge myself with any thing romantic extravagant or unbecoming why should i be a churl and refuse to profit of the treasure fortune had thrown in my way i dont think that any hermit ever slept upon moss who could get down and though i believe in my conscience that i should be the being of all others that could sit down easiest contented with the poorest lot yet though i have so little of that envy in me which i formerly described that the translation would scarcely excite in me a smile i cannot say i should find any reluctance in exchanging with the richest  to be plain even though obscurity and oblivion were to draw an eternal veil over me and my story whether my days were to be few or many still was there nothing reprehensible in my perseverance a tendency to preserve my health to glorify him who gave me endowments by a continual exertion of them to consider that in a mortal to repine is to rebel in short in every moral sense correctly and conscienceously to do my duty and to strengthen myself against every trial could have nothing in it blameable or unworthy and even if the ambition of making known the merit of my various sufferings my irreproachable love or my uncommon fortitude made a part of that strong desire to display those abilities such as they were with which heaven had endowed me though such ambition should never be gratified i had not done the smallest injury to the meanest worm and therefore could find nothing with which i had a right to reproach myself  indeed if my labors were to have excited all the world to visit my island as in admiration of a prodigy i could not have pursued them with a more unremitted attention nor could i get rid of the idea that though so much love so much fortitude so much patience so much resignation had been manifested in vain as to the benefit of their possessor yet these exemplary qualities would not be exercised in vain as to the benefit of the world  chap vi hannah having built a house wants a garden she accomplishes her wish and gets very forward in her different studies having so far succeeded in a building calculated so well for use and pleasure i resolved to relax a little and pursue amusement and labor turn by turn the rainy season being now over and my habitation having pretty well stood that and the storm that accompanied it i began again to taste that air in which flitted a thousand perfumes and to regard those objects which renovated by nutritious moister felt additional strength and looked more beautifully verdant  and now it struck me that having a house i ought to have a garden to be sure no pleasure ground was ever laid out by capability  brown with more grandeur or stocked with more beautiful shrubbery than the splendid expanse both behind and before my house but orange trees only bore oranges citron tree citrons and so on i was determined by innoculation grafting and inarching to make the cassia tree bear olives the shaddock teem with pomgranates and the plantain bend with clusters of tamerinds  besides i had found in the ship a multiplicity of flower seeds all classed and named which were intended for the gardens at versailles then i had bulbes tuberous and other roots and layers and suckers and offsets with these how well i might stock a flower garden and again i had potatoes beans peace onions garlic and a variety of other articles with which the french stuff their soup maigre and their sauces and which would of course form a very pretty variety for my kitchen garden  in short i soon made a hoe a rake and a spade and having determined to devote first two hours in a day and afterward an hour or so occasionally in the course of a month i began every way to feel the benefit of my labor for it being the kind of exercise in which i ever took delight an employ peculiarly calculated to inspire moral ideas and fit the mind for the purest of contemplation it gave me bodily and mental health and agreeably set off the value of my other occupations  i had certainly now employment enough on my hands i gardened i wrote i painted i played on the the guittar or the mandoline i carved i modelled in short i did whatever necessity or inclination induced me to and it is beyond credibility solaced by so many amusements all of them rational how strongly my mind bore up against its troubles  i never in my life as the reader must have seen could bear to pass an idle moment if i was in view of nature i contemplated her beauties if night hid her from my eyes still was she in mind and still was i forming projects to manifest her various perfections i cannot say i could go so far as sir john fielding who said in my presence that he was glad he was blind because it gave him more perfect opportunity for contemplation but i think were it the pleasure of providence to afflict me in any way i should as much as it is in the power of a human being find some resource to supply the deficiency like the provident ant who does not stay to lament that her habitation is destroyed but who immediately considers through what medium she can form a new one  solomon tells the sluggard to go to the ant miracle certainly of industry he might have told the ignorant to go the be as great a miracle of ingenuity i have a thousand times thought what an admirable instance of shrewd contrivance it is that the cells of a honeycomb taking a hexangular form the whole space is not only occupied in a way the most convenient to its inhabitants but there is not the smallest room no not the thickness of a hair lost or confounded but were i to go on in this strain i could expatiate for ever and yet find no observation worthy the wonderful theme wonderful indeed from the very spider who waves his entrails into a net to catch his prey to the obliging silkworm who spins away his substance that the coquette may catch here is  though i have been betrayed into this rapsody i mean nothing more by it than that with ingenuity method will accomplish any thing i ever found it so and it was peculiarly necessary in my present situation to put my wits to the test and thus i was enabled to perfect so many things which but for the explanations i have gone into would have appeared incredible but which thus explained the reader will allow must have been easily practicable  i had found aboard the entrepreneur as before noticed a great variety of colors for painting but besides this i had now made from earth bones flowers the blood of the sea snake and other materials some admirable colors of my own oils and varnishes i had brought to such perfection that i had no doubt but in time i should rival the famous varnish in which the beautiful tone of the cremona fiddle is said to consist  thus i was completely stocked with materials for painting as for music i had a harp a guitar a mandolina two fiddles several flutes and a viol di gamba besides a very large assortment of strings both in catgut and wire and as i was determined to make a pianoforte for my saloon i had no doubt in the end of fitting up an organ in my chapel  as for writing i had a long time abandoned the plantain leaf being well supplied with pen ink and paper and thus i was now prepared to write my history to paint it and to set it to music and all this i was determined in some degree to perform even as i have repeatedly said though time should bury me and my labors in the same oblivion  in the first place as the works of such superior authors as shakespeare and milton make their way to the public through the medium of paintings and engravings what chance would a narrative of simple though extraordinary facts stand of being introduced to the world unassisted by the pencil or the graver again as every thing written by ladies is expected to teem with poetry particularly sonnets it struck me that a few stanzas now and then set to music would throw in a novelty which might give it a fillup and send it more rapidly into circulation to be sure it is but a sorry mode of recommendation it is like sweetening with molasses which though pleasant to the palate is loathsome to the stomach and conceals the flavor of the beverage but as poor walmesley would have said had he been alive and heard me make the remark all this we must do to comply with the taste of the town  at the same time i have not the smallest wish to insinuate any thing against the respective merits of arts or artists my quarrel is that nothing stands upon its own foundation the world will not take for granted the naked beauty of the object that presents itself it must be dressed and heaven knows it is sometimes so dressed that what was meant to ornament and embellish serves only to caracature and disguise  a literary production a painting or any other work of genuis should make its own appeal to the public its merits will manifest themselves without the aid of adventitious assistance its demerits no adventitious assistance can bolster up an execrable poem at which the public has been in raptures stands a chance of failing through the medium of a print that laughs at any reigning folly and an admirable play on the point of being damned may work out its salvation by the opportune appearance of a ghost or an elephant  but i reconcile it this way  englishmen will have a good deal for their money and to say truth how can it be expected that they should purchase a work of literature be it the history of the bible of their own country of the catabaws of plants of the heavenly constellations of mites of air unless circulated through the medium of sixpenny numbers with the united advantages of being assisted by the whole body of arts when the quartern loaf is at the enormous expense of sixpence three farthings  these considerations induced me to enforce the particulars of my history in every possible way that the fertility of my imagination would permit me and as the fatal chest which contained so many interesting documents relative to poor hewit had furnished me with sad proof of the most material facts my history contains so i was determined to deposit my labors there that the world if ever they should be discovered might learn through that medium a story which though extraordinary enough in itself might perhaps become more worthy of attention when so many fortuitous circumstances should lend it weight and responsibility  i own i had one objection to cramming every thing into the chest and it was this one of those poets who in my prosperity i taught to impose upon the public had made a large sum of money by publishing fac similes of writings drawings and other documents said to have been found in a trunk and actually written by the famous ben jonson cotemporary of shakepeare among the rest there was a letter in queen elizabeths own hand writing commending one of those masks he is well known to have written for her court and inviting him to attend the performance of it facetiously calling him in imitation of johsons character of justice clement in his speech to brainworm a merry knave  out of this chest i also proved that jonson and shakespeare were upon the best terms and so far from jonsons having ever said that instead of not blotting out a line shakespeare ought to have blotted out thousands there is a letter which expressly noes that if any one could have the temerity to strike a single word out of shakespeare or to torture his meaning in any manner it ought to be deemed literary sacrilege  what a severe satire by anticipation jonson had here written against shakespeares numerous commentators but i ought not to dwell upon this subject i only introduced it to show how very similar sometimes invention is to fact and also that though every body believed what i insinuated had they opened their eyes they would have found that there was not one word of truth in it for i did nothing more than retail over again the story of chatterton  but the best thing in this business and that which made the greatest noise was a song with which ben jonson was so delighted that he treasured it up as a model for rapturous love though the intelligent reader will plainly see it was as great an imposition as the rest i had indeed an idea of sporting a play supposed to be sent by shakespeare to jonson for his opinion but i saw in a moment that it would only be straining the string until it snapt a few loose things which bore the genuine marks of having been written by so great a man might be pretty well managed as they would naturally pass for what he considered as trifles and probably intended to burn but a play no no thought i the english may be credulous but their credulity proceeds from the excess of their good nature their own inherent integrity and their willingness to admit what is seriously and solemnly averred to be fact not from their want of understanding and critical discrimination upon either of which whoever grossly imposes may be assured of that resentment his temerity so richly deserves  the little song in question which is supposed to be written to anne hatheaway who all the world knows received the addresses and afterward became the wife of shakespeare i shall subjoin just to show how easily an imposition of this kind gains current belief  a love dittie addressed to the idol of mine heart and the delyghte of mine eyes the faireste among the most fair anne

perilous situation i had now full employ all of which i might particularly enumerate were it not that if i did so my history would appear little better than a journal and yet it is material to notice how much i gained upon time by keeping in all i did to an exact regularity and how this mode vavaried my pleasures as well as my employments  in the first place as there was scarcely a day of the year but marked some extraordinary circumstance of my life i always commemorated it by a form suitable to the occasion my prayers my food my employments my very dress spoke something analagous every distressful event was a fast every providential escape a thanksgiving thus my poetry was heroic pathetic elegiac pastoral serious or comic my painting was grand terrific affecting pleasing familiar or caracature my music was majestic melting magical insinuating simple or grotesque according to circumstances  i had so many memorable days to notice that i divided them into classes those of a more interesting description such as hewits birthday my own our marriage our separation his shipwreck mine the day i landed on my island my escape from the lioness and others which the reader can point out as well as i and which show what fragile tenements we inhabit were among the first class and were suitably solemnized  but were i minutely to describe the rotation of my calender which was as numerously stocked and i am as sure as honestly as the popes it would be like slyly intimating to the reader a recapitulation of the circumstances of my life lest through inattention or indifference they might any of them have been passed by  i shall only say therefore that having no country but my own island no world but of my own creating no communication but with my own ideas that i might not lose the exercise of that reason by which human creatures are distinguished some to their honor some to their execration beyond all other animals i made that country that world that society out of what i had known and experienced which had this advantage beyond living in an actual world that like the salutary air of malta ireland and some other places where noxious animals are not known to exist so neither envy nor slander nor indeed one of the mental evils that issued from pandoras box dared to draw its poisonous breath in the pure atmosphere of my dominions  i dont know how far the reader may be pleased with these trifling matters but to me they made up a delightful because an inoffensive and rational series of enjoyments it would have been indeed with me tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow had i not found some ingenious means of cheating the tedious hours i had no ambition to gratify that fools might wonder i had no sum to amass for my heir to squander i had no domestic happiness for my friends to envy i did not lead a life my life was all retrospection and had i not found employment for my faculties by contemplating as on a dream or reading as in a book past occurrences of my extraordinary life i must have lingered on a vacant useless existence a living chaos absorbed in a chasm of time  employing myself however rather more rationally as i had nothing to wish for but to join poor hewit and dared not accelerate the means i thought i should render my life more acceptable to him who bestowed it by blending cheerfulness with resignation and therefore went on providing for what was to happen on the morrow though that morrow was which by the bye happens perpetually in the world only a repetition of what had passed long before  as in my retrospective almanac two and sometimes three events would happen on the same day of the year it generally introduced some extraordinary or whimsical coincidence for instance on the very day of the month sourby had been swallowed by the shark did we thirteen years before receive the news that our fortune had been swallowed up by him and his confederates the day of the year on which i had put the impudent monkey to death in the cavern did i give a rude coxcomb at a masquerade a slap in the face i had reason enough to remember it for hewit had like to have been involved in a duel  on the day of the year i saw the queen of france in all her splendor was i by accident in a mob where they were leading a poor wretch with a halter about her neck to be whipped at the carts tail the day of the year on which my brother the lawyer was hanged for forgery he had been many years before honorably acquitted of a perjury of which he was guilty and hewit had been falsely punished for the crime of desertion of which he was innocent  i shall not dwell upon observations of this kind i think the reader will be interested in whatever relates to me and if so it will not be a matter of indifference to learn that i filled my time by employments worthy a mind made up to every extraordinary and trying occasion  by the time the birds made their next appearance i had got wonderfully forward in all my undertakings i had painted and framed twelve pictures for my saloon all subjects from my own life four scripture pieces were hung in my chapel and i had gone into a number of other studies particularly pneumatic chemistry in which i had made some wonderful discoveries as to the nature of different gases and among the rest i clearly proved by decompounding water that it is not an element but a composition of two airs and as a positive demonstration of the truth of this experiment by uniting these two airs i recomposed them into water again  i heartily wish for the sake of my fellows creatures whose welfare though i shall never witness my heart nevertheless yearns after that some ingenious practitioner may have made the same notable discovery for though simples and natural remedies are fully competent to cure colds fevers and other common complaints which many an old woman with culpepper in her hand has eradicated as secumden artem as the whole tribe of warwick lane could have done yet as luxury is every day adding to the catalogue of natural disorders so many artificial ones as the muscles of which medical men know but little the nervous system of which they know less and the spleen of which they know nothing at all are now supposed to be the seat of complaints our ancestors never heard of so it is but fair that galenical pharmacy should give way to chemical and that vital fire nearly extinguished by the dinner and the bottle should receive a prometheon renovation by chemical fire issuing from the retort or the crucible  in particular i would recommend a close attention to this doctrine of air for as life depends upon respiration as the man who breathes freest loudest and longest is in the best health as no man can breathe free loud or long who inhales an air that disagrees with his constitution so we have nothing to do but to pick and choose till we have found that air most condusive to health and thus breathe physic instead of taking it in pills or by spoonfulls  from levoifier on chemistry i took most of these hints which books together with many others on different subjects i found on board the entrepreneur but what pleased me most was a work that treated on mechanics a study i was peculiarly qualified for and in which i had ever taken delight and which indeed in my situation was more material to me than any other  as i was absorbed in study one day on the power of mechanical operations just after having separated the movements of a time piece in order to clean it it struck me that i should find no great difficulty in making an automaton i had seen the chess player introduced with great success about the year      and knew perfectly upon what principle it acted but this was not enough for me to make any object mechanically come and go and ape common actions like archytuss flying dove regiomontanuss wooden eagle or his iron fly was unworthy my genius it was only the the second edition of lady catharina with the magic lantern i was determined to make an automaton that should speak and nothing appeared to me more easy  a common penny toy cries cuckoo as plain as the cuckoo itself if therefore i had chose to content myself with keeping to open words the business would soon have been effected for instance an automaton or rather an autologon might soon be taught to speak italian but i determined my automaton should speak english nasals gutterals and all how i was charmed at the circumstance it would be a sort of companion to me it continually ran in my head and i was determined to lose no time in bringing it to perfection  to be brief having made my figure and tried a variety of movements i sound by adding a pair of bellows i should in time in great measure carry my point the principal i went upon was that of a musical clock which utters open sounds through the medium of pent air conveyed occasionally into different pipes instead therefore of a succession of regular sounds forming a musical melody upon the diapason flute or other stop producing notes by means of circular perforations i made the sounds issue from reeds formed as nearly as possible in the shape into which the fauces are pursed or dilated in the act of speaking and instead of those tubes from whence issue the mellow even tone of the flute and diapason i made all my pipes in imitation of the vox humane the clarinet and the bassoon all which have a sound something resembling the human voice  as out of the common octave with the addition of the sharp fourth and the flat seventh may be formed a great variety of melody or to come nearer the matter as you may count the different changes upon eight bells until you are stunned and tired so a great deal of conversation may be made out of a very few common place words i presently taught my figure a variety of interjections he would cry out oh ah humph as correctly as a critic who was asked if he recollected a particular beauty in shakespeare i made him sigh as naturally as a self approving adonis who expected you to fall in love with him he would whistle as vacantly as a dashing fellow who had just received a useless admonition from his injured father and he would laugh as triumphantly as an impudent rake who had just put modesty to the blush  when i had brought my contrivance to this i selected a few words that by transposition and retransposition would form different sentences and by this method this kind of anagram in language i made my figure converse pretty well at first i was wenderfully pleased with my contrivance but there was something so hollow and so ghostly in the sound that after a time i grew perfectly shocked at it particularly at night and having taught it to say o ow i luv u anna it spoke or i fancied it spoke so much in the tone of john hewits voice who from a natural dialect pronounced with difficulty the aspiration h that i began to fear it might introduce a melancholy which would trench upon all those laudable resolutions i had so properly and so firmly made  i therefore determined lest my nerves should be affected for a time at least to lay by my speaking figure and as the rainy season was likely to come on soon which never failed of itself by keeping me within doors and depressing my spirits to turn my mind too much to gloomy objects i placed it in a corner of my dormitory resolving never to use it unless when i could be sure my resolution would be equal to the trial  though these circumstances can afford the reader but little amusement i trust i shall be excused for having mentioned them to exercise my mind was my greatest pleasure and my greatest comfort and those who have most indulgence will be happiest to find that a lone woman who had not a single motive for life should have the fortitude the prudence the religion to live miserable and resigned  i had now been two years and a half without seeing a human face when the birds paid me a third visit i took this hint to lay in my usual stock and protected by leo who was now grown a most beautiful animal i set about birds nesting in spite of the monkies i had been tollerably successful and had met with little annoyance for some time i could not help noticing however a large baboon that leered at me from behind some rock or stump of a tree wherever i went in vain did leo scamper after him up the rocks whenever he could he returned to the charge and it is inconceivable how nauseous and disagreeable his antics were  one afternoon having dispatched leo for a basket of eggs i had left behind me i was sitting on a cane garden chair before my door when that ugly wretch the baboon surprised me he caught me in his arms and it was vain that i endeavored to disengage myself from his grasp i screamed and rent the air with my cries all hope seemed in vain and what might have been the consequence heaven knows if my noble protector on hearing my voice had not flown to my assistance  to have seen him was to have seen a guardian angel his generous tenderness for me and his ineffable contempt for his foe were in the same moment manifest in his eyes it was like a gallant englishman protecting innocence from distress it was like binns he disengaged the horrid wretch from me with the most cautious care then seeing i was safe terrified him with all the apprehension of death and then as if thinking him too insignificant for his revenge spurned at him and permitted him to escape  chap viii hannah experiencing disagreeable effects from the rainy season gets first into a consumption and afterward into the horrors the birds having taken their departure the rain soon after set in i therefore betook myself to painting and ornamenting being determined to complete my building in every respect by the time it should be fine weather after which if i should want employ i might build a pleasure house upon the mountain where by catching young ones and breeding them up tame i might keep deer and buffaloes in a sort of kraal or enclosure in the manner they were kept by the caffres  i set about my saloon and soon added six or eight pictures to my catalogue with their proper frames carved and gilt in which last labor it is astonishing what occasion i had to admire the maleability of gold i beat out a single louis dore into as many slips or leaves as by calculation had they been paper and converted into notes of only six livres each would have amounted to seven thousand one hundred and thirtythree livres  i went on with great alacrity but the rain being incessant and attended with a chilling air i grew i cannot say ill but impatient and gloomy in this situation i took a wrong method i thought as i had found upon all occasions facing an enemy to be the surest way of getting rid of him fancy never failing to magnify fear so i changed my ground and in proportion as i grew melancholy indulged my sadness by working in the chapel and once or twice i was fool hardy enough to try the experiment of my speaking figure adding to it a new movement in the nature of an alarm clock by which it spoke at any given distance of time  this last experiment i most heartily repented for it threw me into such a dejection of spirits that i greatly feared i should have all the horror of the first rainy season to go over again i therefore determined to put up the autologon for good and all nothing however could keep me out of the chapel where though dreadfully dejected i was greatly relieved by prayer and the consciousness that the all seeing eye of the creator was benignly regarding me in a sacred place which i had most uprightly consecrated to his honor  these considerations at times greatly relieved me and in particular gave me some little comfort by enabling me to argue with myself why thought i should any fear however awful depress my spirits am i now to learn that i am alone in a world which it is not material to myself or to creation whether i leave now or when age and deformity shall have rendered my life still more a burden  what shall i do when the pangs of death are on me when i am sinking to that rest which alone can be the oblivion of my cares should i not betray a mind grovling and unworthy were i to weep that i have no kind friend to comfort me no trembling hand to close my dying eyes no devout priest to administer comfort to my parting soul or sing a requiem over my grave no charitable sexton to hide my perishable remains  rather let me in this as in all other exigencies provide for the solemn occasion and having to the glory of that creator who permitted me to exist exercised those endowments he mercifully gave me to prolong my existence so let me meet death with the fortitude that i have endured life  let me expect the dreadful and consoling moment when this world and all its glories shall pass away from me should it be prompt it will be but one pang should it be lingering let me with piety and resignation endure what cannot be averted and when at last the icy hand of death shall chill my forehead let me retire to some modest tomb suited to receive such humble remains  it is inconceivable how this last idea possessed me i determined at once to execute the design i had formed and after a few days during which space i would sit and muse for six or eight hours at a time indulging my sad yet pleasing melancholy i began my work and in a week more had erected a plain neat tomb ornamented with suitable decorations and an impressive inscription referring to the fatal chest for further information  into this tomb which was lined with black i conveyed a couch with a kind of canopy ornamented with such artificial leaves and flowers as bespoke my character like poor ophelia i had pansies for remembrance and i had rue the heliotrope bespoke my constancy a whithered laurel denoted my unavailing desire of fame an olive described me at peace with all the world camomile expressed my patient endurance of injury the ephemeron my transient hope and the xeranthemum my never ending despair  here did i determine if my strength and resolution should permit me to enclose myself whenever i should find my dissolution approach after which whether my retreat were ever to be discovered or to remain a secret from all the world i should have done a becoming duty toward god and toward man  i never achieved any thing of this extraordinary kind but it consoled me i now begin to think of death as calmly as i had formerly indulged the idea distractedly and for several days i was in a temper to resign my life without a sigh the next thing that struck me was that poor hewit merited a tribute of respect at my hands and as i had placed my tomb on one side of the altar i resolved to erect one for him on the other this i also accomplished but had scarcely done so before i was well convinced i had better have let it alone  my mind that i had flattered with false hopes was not consoled it was deceived and while i delusively fancied i had been administering relief to my despair i was only confirming it i had not noticed in the eagerness of my employment that too great an exertion of resolution impaired my health that every sigh as it came from my heart affected my lungs in short under the idea of a cough i felt at last every symptom of an approaching consumption  i lost strength every day and by the time the rainy season was over i was a perfect skeleton having now an opportunity of taking the fresh air with all those beautiful advantages that i have formerly described though wasting perceptibly i hoped i might yet recover still mindful however desirous of death it was my duty to prolong my life by every means in my power  i had an idea that if i could frequently take the air on the mountain it might lend some help toward restoring me but how to get there i could no more have climbed the mountain than have flown to it at last it struck me that leo should convey me for which purpose i mounted a garden chair upon a carriage and having put him on a beautiful silk harness the good creature whose very look conveyed affection and fidelity drew me with an air so proud and majestic that i seemed some deity in her car alas it was only in appearance for had the deity felt so weak and so emaciated as i did she would have preferred annihilation to immortality  our journies were long or short according to circumstances sometimes we merely took an airing and sometimes we stayed all day and took provision with us one day having been on a long tour as we returned toward the evening i saw something struggling in a thicket and alighting i discovered that it was a young buffalo it instantly occurred to me that veal broth was a very nourishing thing and proper for a person in a consumption and had no doubt especially as i had tasted nothing of that kind for such a length a time it might greatly contribute toward my recovery so flattering is the nature of that complaint that it catches more at straws than any other  i disentangled the poor creature and began to deliberate about killing it but i plainly found i should make but a very indifferent butcher leo indeed if i had given the word would have lain him dead in an instant not else for i verily believe unless by my command which was to him a fiat he would not unless pressed by hunger have killed a fly at all adventures i thought it was better to postpone so disagreeable a business till we should get home so i made a halter for the poor trembling thing and led him on behind my carriage  it being late i penned my calf up till the morning when after considering the matter the major part of the night i was fallying forth to release him and to trust to chance for my cure uttering as i went along no life is as precious in that creature as it is in me let me preserve his life and trust to providence to restore mine  no sooner had these words issued from my mouth when i heard an uncommon bellowing it was the mother of the poor creature who had traced his footsteps from the mountain oh how did i here exult how much more nutritious than veal broth was milk how much more proper for a consumptive complaint and then i should take away no life truly here had virtue its reward i had been merciful to the calf and heaven in return had been merciful to me well charming sbakespeare have thou sweetly said that mercy is twice blessed i have often considered that passage as one of the most sublime in all the works of our great bard nay i am extremely deceived if the celebrated miss seward is not of the same opinion for if i recollect right one of her poems which describes some character full of benignity has this line  with all the twice blessed angel in her eye   after i had permitted the calf to suck its fill and thus continued to prolong life instead of destroying it i milked the mother i then permitted her to graze about the lawn being under no apprehension of losing her while i confined her young one thus after a short time she became very tractable and suffered herself to be milked twice a day as regularly as an alderney cow  in the mean time the milk very sensibly gained upon my disorder and in about six weeks from the time i first drank it i found myself in a convalescent state but though i had no doubt with care i should recover still a nasty hectic fever lurked about me my flesh perpetually burnt i had a weak low and quick pulse my sleep was no manner of refreshment but on the contrary was attended with startings and frightful dreams  had i not known that this fever was an attendant on a consumption and that these dreams were symptoms of it i should have been tempted to believe some awful event was at hand for i scarcely ever slept but some mysterious vision appeared to me hewit my brother binns walmesley sourby were perpetually swimming before me in so many fantastic shapes that when i awoke i seemed to be on the verge of madness nay at last i began to think very seriously of these extraordinary warnings and felt a mixed sensation of hope and dread that my disorder would return and that the next rainy season or perhaps a shorter period would find me silently reclined in my tomb  my consumption certainly went off and with it all the symptoms of the fever except the dreams which increased in a most wonderful manner willing however to consult my senses and my reason and thus attribute these visitations to their natural cause i concluded that as in consequence of being convalescent i had grown more plethoric from thence had arisen those horrid dreams which certainly were now become of a more sanguinary kind and related to nothing but wounds and murder  under this idea i abstained from too much food that had milk in it or any other ingredient likely to engender blood too fast this seemed actually to have its effect and for a fortnight i slept much less disturbed and found myself in better health  i had come home one evening pretty tired and having made rather a heartier meal than usual i rested the first part of the night very sound toward the morning i dreamt i saw poor leo full of wounds and breathing his last i was crying for the loss of him when john hewit knelt by my side and with a thousand soft and tender expressions entreated me to go with him to where he said we should both be happy  there was something so winning yet so repugnant as i thought to my wishes in his solicitations that i alternately repulsed and carressed him at last my mind being wrought up to a violent conflict i awoke when hardly knowing where i was and doubting whether what i had seen and heard was a dream or reality a hollow voice like that i had heard in my dream cried out  a ow i luv u anna  upon hearing these sounds uttered so unexpectedly i screamed and fell into strong hysterics which though i was in my senses the whole time and knew they had been uttered by the speaking figure in consequence of my having by mistake set the alarm movement the night before instead of taking it off lasted me a complete hour and when i recovered though i found leo safe and that the sounds had been caused by my own imprudent negligence i was so shocked that i continued ill the whole day and was obliged to muster up all my firmness and to call to mind how many reiterated resolutions i had made to rely on the protection of providence before i could prevail on myself to go to bed at night  my spirits were so unsettled that my horrid dreams began to return i dreamt that the owners of the french eastindiaman came to strip me of all i had and told me i must restore my goods to their rightful possessors in a state of distraction i thought i flew into the chapel where the skulls of monsieur and madame doliviere spoke to me crying out listen to us we are oracles you shall be translated to heaven and reap a just reward for all your sufferings then they thanked me for my pious care of their remains then flew to kiss me oh what a nauseous sensation it awoke me i feel the clamy pressure of their hollow jaws at this moment  from this night i determined to bid adieu to sleep yet what was to sustain nature no matter the sooner my existence terminated the better this might be impiety but i could bear no more than the mind i possessed permitted i was a mortal and therefore could boast no more than the imbecility of a mortal the string of my resolution had been wound up until it had cracked the music of hope was turned to the dissonance of despair  chap ix hannahs distress becomes more and more poignant she meets with a most affecting loss and afterward takes her leave of the world i had continued in this dreadful despondency ten or twelve days now shivering with apprehension now wild with terror now lowered with sullen melancholy now melted into tears the whole time not daring to sleep but at fits and starts when nature oppressed me and i settled into a kind of serene sadness  i had taken the matter every way and nothing could convince me but that my fate was at hand i therefore sat down camly to expect it having brought my mind to this nothing could exceed the tranquillity in which i felt myself i indulged the idea i feasted on it as on luxury which received such a zest from reflections on my blameless life that i chid the tedious hours which stood between me and the moment when i should find heaven and john hewit  i took an examination of my life from the moment of my birth up to that day and while i regarded the scenes i had taken from it which hung round me in my saloon i had fresh reason for exultation  here as the triumph of my virtue hung a portrait of the gallant binns rescuing me from the violent hands of the villain sourby there as an eternal reproach to the world and its follies were hewit and i in our new ridiculous dresses gazed at like meteors as we drove round the ring in hyde park further on as a useful lesson to fallen pride and a picture of conjugal affection and honest industry were we sallying forth he as a razor grinder and i selling trinkets and leading an humble ass bearing my two children in paniers  my receiving the fatal letter from whence originated all my sufferings the death of my poor suspected infant my embarking for india my meeting with my brother my parting from him my being shipwrecked my being torn from my companions my finding trout to be sourby his just fate my escape from the lioness leos exulation at having rescued me from the monkey all gave some proof of tenderness or resolution or affection or fortitude or some other quality which taught me i had deserved to live and therefore was prepared to die  those merits that had depended on myself led me into a reflection on the miseries i had been afflicted with and which had depended on providence not conscious that from my own neglect i had merited affliction though i did not dare arraign providence i modestly took leave to scrutinize its motives and having fairly weighed every consideration and reflected that virtue can never be punished by a power all just all good all beneficent but for its own sake i calmly concluded that providence had made this world my scourge my woe my misery that i might the better relish those joys which were preparing for me in the next  thus deeply reflecting sedately weighing and i am afraid absurdly judging what i had shunned in sleep followed me waking my life was all a dream or rather madness for instead of my being shocked at horrid images the more horrid the image the more i was delighted  my only disturbance was the parting with leo i would look at him and talk to him as if he had been endowed with reason and indeed if actions are a proof of it so he was never did i trace in the noble creature an unworthy motive would i could say so much of humanity ah my poor leo would i cry  while a flood of tears gushed from my eyes  i shall leave thee in a troublesome world i was the only inhabitant of this island of my kind now thou will be the only one of thine thou have followed me watched me and protected me may thy blameless life never know a pang alas he is delighted with my carresses he tries to recall me to life my good my worthy my faithful leo it is too late we shall part indeed we shall very very soon  finding in all this time no material alteration in my health for with the other qualities of madness i had cunning enough to eat and drink i grew impatient come said i leo one day let us go out and seek that fate that will not come home to us so saying i sallied forth  oh would i had not  my ever faithful leo proudly following me  i had wildly strayed to a considerable distance when chance led me to the verge of the promontory where i grew so disordered that i had almost made up my mind to leap forward at this instant a hideous baboon rushed from the very brake whence the lioness had formerly flown to seize me leo delighted with being permitted to follow me was scampering over the lawn he saw in a moment my danger and flew like lightening to my assistance he roared his eyes flashed fire his rage was ungovernable he darted at his prey which venturing to avoid him to the very edge of the promontory they both fell over and oh miserable miserable hour my poor leo shared the fate of his mother  it was a mercy i did not follow him i ran i rambled i ventured into the most imminent danger to lend him assistance my shrieks and lamentations all the while reverberated by a hundred echos but in vain he was dead on a jet of the rock that no human art could approach he lay stretched by the side of his mother whose carcass had been a prey to the birds and whose skeleton had whitened in the sun  now was i completely overcome the terrible accident happening in my sight in my behalf in my defense unaccustomed as i was to kindness and meltingly susceptible of gratitude my feelings added to the complication of conflicting sensations with which i was before distracted drove me to something more than madness as i wandered i scarcely knew where i screamed i laughed i sung and exhibited every shocking distraction of a miserable lunatic  all this while my feet as much misled as my senses i erred further and further from my home and in proportion as i found myself astray my distraction increased my ears were assailed with a thousand noises the winds seemed to whistle with the harmony of fifty eolian harps i heard voices i answered them i fancied myself in the company of angels till accident having placed me in the path that led to my house possessed with an idea that the awful hour was approaching when the mercy of heaven would snatch me from the miseries of earth i solemnly walked on entered my building bid a formal adieu to every object that had been interesting to me went into my chapel knelt at the altar put up a pathetic prayer embraced the skulls kissed the name of john hewit in the bible entered my tomb enclosed myself reclined upon my couch and instantly in death lost the world and all its vanities  end of the fifth book hannah hewit book vi the adventures of hannah hewit from the moment she had a glimpse of hope to the completion of her happiness chap i in which hannah hewit and the reader are introduced to some old acquaintance death did i well call the sleep into which i had fallen on my entering my tomb it lasted me till the next morning when i was awoke by a confused noise that issued from every apartment it is astonishing how self preservation actuates the mind my distraction was gone my recollection was completely returned i knew where i was and knew there was some cause at hand that demanded vigourous resolution  i thanked fortune that had led me to this tomb perhaps to preserve me i plainly heard human voices and resolved to remain quiet that i might discover the truth if those i heard were friends i had cause to thank heaven that gave me an assylum to offer them if enemies respect for the dead would secure me an assylum in the silent tomb  i had not long to deliberate before two men entered the chapel why hollo jack cried one we are aboard a church i told you said the other we should be brought up at last you would not believe what i told you yesterday you thought as i had got too much beer aboard but the thing was as i said  you see i was strolling about to see how the land lay thinking upon jen williams when i thinks thinks i that there before me is either a ghost or a devil or a woman in a white gown now do you see except a ship under sail i does not think that the world can produce you a sight so lovely as a woman in a white gown  well you see i gave chase and for a time stood after her pretty well but she having a better chart of the course than i hauled her wind and stood for some new cut that i had not the skill to to weather so being obliged to double a point of land i made so many trips that at last i found   my eyes said the other what a place this is well what did you find why said the first i found that i had lost my prize and was out of my latitude  well that being the case said his companion you say you can read tell us what does they ciphers there mean upon that booby hutch in the corner why its somebody that is buried there said the other read yes i believe i can or else i should never have been quartermaster stay let me take a little bacco now for it sacred sacred dont you hear you see we are in a sacred place is your hat off that is right but come let us go on sacred to the memory of who john hewit whew who was shipwrecked on this coast june        the devil he was come along messmate why this is a pretty joke said the other let us find the captain so without further ceremony they went out of the chapel  my situation here the reader will easily conceive i soon found i had no cause of alarm for this discovery convinced me there must be some english ship upon the coast and that i could be in no danger from my own countrymen especially with such a story as i had to tell i was resolved however to keep concealed till i had heard every thing and in proportion as this interesting conversation between the sailors advanced so my anxiety increased but when i noticed the surprise and those equivocal expressions of the sailors concerning my husband i thought my heart would have throbbed through my bosom being accustomed however to check every thing like hope i still had the fortitude to remain silent  these observations passed over and this resolution was taken as transient as a gleam of lightning i found my whole place taken possession of and voices issuing from every part where where presently cried one and then as several persons entered the chapel one of them came up to my tomb and read with great eagerness sacred to the memory of hannah hewit and was going on when a voice cried out with great vehemence thou maw detestable gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth and then instantly in a tone of distraction another voice uttered oh heaven have i lived to see this day  the first i thought was the voice of binns the second of walmesley and the last i knew to be that of my husband i could hold no longer tearing open the doors of the tomb and presenting myself to their astonished sight i flew to his arms fell upon his neck and burst into tears of joy and gratitude while walmesley flew about the room like a bedlamite crying out she lives she breathes and we shall still be blessed our kind propitious stars overpay us now for all our sorrows past  the scene that followed nor tongue nor pen nor pencil can describe surprise pleasute anxiety curiosity every body felt but nobody gratified one affectionate enquiry was answered by another all was confusion and incoherence binns was delighted hewit was entranced i was silently putting up a prayer to heaven and walmesley in the language of shakespeare row and otway was invoking all the powers that protect virtue to shower down blessings on our heads when to complete the groupe entered to my unspeakable delight and astonishment my brother  what could i think of all this i knew my heart knew by a thousand nameless and consoling pleasures that i held hewit in my arms his heart palpitated in unison with mine binns appeared the affectionate friendly creature i had ever known him poor walmesley who knew no pleasure but the happiness of his friends uttered through his memory the delight which his heart dictated and my brothers manly soul stood confessed in his eyes as he beheld his loved his long lost sister  it was not however in the power of our best resolution for a long time to give us collection enough to elucidate the cause of this extraordinary meeting their wonder at finding me upon a desolate island in the midst of plenty my astonishment at seeing so many friends some of whom appeared to have arisen from their graves collected together seemed such a delusion that had we been under the power of enchantment we could not have exhibited a more striking picture of doubtful certainty  the questions of how can this be possible by what accident could this happen what power could have preserved you on their side and how could you escape shipwreck how did you meet together what chance brought you here on mine being uttered almost all in a breath each of which required a long and substantial answer we found after we had wearied ourselves with inquiries which it would take so much time to resolve we should reap very little satisfaction till our prudence had got the better of our wonder  certain therefore of the fact thankful to providence for it convinced that this was the heavenly reward for my sufferings so mysteriously promised me i proposed that we should for a short time wave all curiosity and instead of enquiring how we had become happy thank that being in whose presence we stood and who had deigned to witness our union that through his gracious goodness we had thus miraculously met together  in this proposal every one willingly joined hewit clasped me to his heart my brother said i was still his angel of a sister binns lifted his eyes to heaven walmesley vociferated then there are gods and virtue is their care and the poor sailors said they did not mind praying for a week together if they had such a chaplain and after this so sweet a calm came across our minds that we were in a state deliberately to discuss the particulars of all our fortunes  they agreed very willingly that my anxiety should be gratified first and as of course the adventures of my husband were of the greatest moment to me i was very eager to hear them we therefore adjourned from the chapel into the saloon where after we had taken some refreshment and had exchanged such general intelligence as that i had been cast away in the grosvenor and escaped in an extraordinary manner to that island where i had not seen a human creature alive for more than three years and that they had met together in india were now bound in a dane to europe and had by accident put in there for water hewit was preparing to gratify my curiosity when my brother who had been whispering binns said that as there was nothing in hewits adventures he was a stranger to he had better go aboard and see how matters were going on there  binns took the sailors with him and i was left with my brother walmesley and hewit who now at my earnest desire proceeded to relate a long train of adventures having in answer to my anxious enquiry first satisfied me that my son was alive and in perfect health  chap ii hewits story my brother asked me if i had any such thing as a pipe and being answered in the negative said no matter he had a sagar in his pocket which having lighted and made a bowl of arrack punch he told hewit to leave off fondling and begin desiring walmesley to pay attention who answered that he could sit all night to hear good counsel  hewit who knew exactly how much i had learnt from my brother said my dear hannah will recollect in what distraction of mind i wrote that letter to captain higgins in which i mentioned that i was fully convinced of her innocence through the information of her wretched brother who unnatural as he had been certainly as his end approached appeared desirous of attoning for the misery he had brought upon a sister who had no fault but the possession of that honor to which he had ever been a stranger  but said he let us not dwell on that whatever might be his crimes they were expiated by the forfeiture of his life they were said walmsley i saw him die no action of his life became him like the leaving it  it was through him continued hewit that sourby had by means of mrs vint found out the circumstance of your being situated in a lodging near town and if he had not been taken up some diabolical scheme would certainly have been set on foot against your honor  having however enough to turn his thoughts to he of course desisted and as that good lady could not or would not inform him exactly where you were because not to mince the matter she was determined only to assist his designs against you in proportion as she succeeded in her designs against me he never was particularly acquainted with your residence and therefore you may be assured i was not  if i could have put on the character of sourby i might perhaps have made an instrument of mrs vint to have discovered you but as my return to her fulsome love was invective and contemptuousness i gained nothing by this half intelligence and it is probable that till this moment i should have been utterly in the dark concerning you had not the strangest accident in the world conducted me but not till it was too late to your lodgings  being perpetually upon the look out near town in hopes that some fortunate accident might guide me to you i fell in at strombolo gardens near chelsea with a surgeon of the name of greenhead who sailed aboard your brother he went afterward as surgeon to a man of war and had now a family and was settled very reputably at chelsea  this gentleman knew me only by the name of walmesley and in consequence of the regard he had for your brother and the many gales we had weathered together he received me very cordially i knew him said i he is as good a creature as ever existed i will convince you in a minute said hewit that we mean the same man  i called on him one day and finding him in his study where he had a kind of museum i noticed in a frame the figure of a coffin lid i began to joke the doctor and allude to the servant who understanding consequences upon being sent for the apothecary brought the surgeon the physician the parson and the the undertaker  if you knew the story of that business said he you would not jest i would not take an hundred guineas for it the lady it concerns is now on her way to india the device was done by her pencil and the inscription is in her own hand writing she drew and wrote it as a pattern for the undertaker to make a coffin plate who buried her child  and my child said i as i approached it and saw a cypress near an urn on which there was an inscription in your own hand writing let me read it  hannah why you are mad said my friend your child my child answered i distractedly i murdered it i broke her heart by my infamous suspicions who was as immaculate as innocence drove her to penury and want and then this inoffensive little one the victim of my folly became a prey to poverty and disease  no no said greenhead that never would have been the case while it had a mother who was one of the most ingenius and industrious woman that ever existed add said i the most amiable and the most wronged i am afraid so answered he for though her delicacy and prudence prevented her from complaining it was evident she had a husband who little deserved so much virtue and goodness but mr walmesley said he i had no idea when i took you by the hand as an old friend who i had known to possess all the manly honor of a true tar that i should be obliged to upbraid you with having under the feigned name of hewit betrayed and abandoned a woman that would have done honor to the first abilities and the first distinction  i told him his reproach did him credit and me justice i accused myself of the most egregious folly and rashness but assured him that if he would have the patience to listen to me he would find there was nothing villainous nor dishonorable in what i had done i then entered into every thing told him my real name was hewit and my feigned name walmesley acquainted with my reasons for my conduct in that business and this brought out to his astonishment that you were the sister of captain higgins in short i concealed nothing from him not even my being undeceived by your brother nor my advertisements in the newspapers and finished by saying that i had been now upon the look out near to n for your residence more than four months which i should never perhaps have discovered if it had not been for this extraordinary accident  he heartily pitied me said it gave him particular pleasure to find himself so agreeably undeceived and promised me every friendship and assistance in his power he lamented very much that he had not discovered your being the sister of captain higgins in which case he said you should have been in his own house and he would have acted the part of a brother by you until he could have given you into the hands of a repentant husband but added he she was so reserved and so cautious that it would have been highly improper and indeed totally useless to have exacted from her more than she was willing to disclose so i chose to prove myself a friend by attention and respect instead of being curious about what i had no right to know and which i was sure by the propriety of her conduct she had both a delicate and an honorable motive for concealing  greenhead and i that very day paid a visit to your lodgings where the good woman of the house understanding who i was gave me a very severe lecture for which i thanked her most sincerely she confirmed the intelligence of your being on your way to india informed me that she herself had seen you aboard and said god would bless and protect you wherever you went for that you was a thousand times better than any husband deserved and as for me if i was to take a hundred years to repent i could not be good enough to merit such a wife  this good lady conducted us to mr morriss house where i got another scolding which i not only bore with patience but received with gratitude when they found how infamously i had been deceived and how proper my intentions were they gave me every intelligence they could respecting you and really as i had no doubt of finding you with your brother who you know i had long persuaded you to join i began to entertain hopes that a few months would again unite us  as soon as the season came round i made an early application to get out to india but could not succeed on board any ship bound to surat i therefore was obliged to put up with a birth in the london bound to madras where i safely arrived the  th of august      then said i you arrived safely in the london at madras on the very day i was shipwrecked in the grosvenor on the coast of africa  my sweet hannah said hewit what thou have endured would i could have added it to the severe hardships which have been my lot since that day but if a life of love and repentance   avast avast said my brother keep your love and repentance till you get alone i suppose you can let us turn in here hannah oh yes said i i have plenty of accommodation for you all and any provisions plenty that is enough jack go on with your story i want to hear here is  well continued hewit from the moment i fet my foot ashore in india i was unlucky in every thing i undertook as the most rational mode of proceeding i took a passage in a coaster and in eleven weeks arrived at surat there by a letter left for me by your brother with one enclosed from you i learnt every thing i wanted to know and as you conjured me to return immediately to england i long determined never again to do any thing but obey your wishes sought for a ship without delay  it unluckily happened that the english ships had all returned which were bound from the malabar coast and as we were at war with france at least the news of the peace had not reached india i thought i should find it difficult to get a passage in a frenchman besides you know i dont much stomach the people  it was however no time for me to be nice week after week passed away and i grew at last very impatient till hearing that the entrepreneur a french eastindiaman from rajahpore to bordeaux was ready to sail from the dutch port of cannonore i signified to an old skipper your brother knew that i should be glad to work my passage in her he who was a linguist and knew the trim of these things undertook to bring me through the business i passed among the dutch for a frenchman and among the french for a dutch man but finding the matter more difficult than i apprehended i was upon the point of giving it up when an accident most unexpectedly brought it about for me  i met a lady one day whom i thought i had somewhere seen she stopped under the same idea to look at me binns in the playhouse lobby said i but i will not be jealous no my sweet hannah said he you have too much good sense to be guilty of any such egregious solly for egregious it was as you will find when you know all  well we soon knew each other you remember i had the good fortune in paris to save the life of a little boy whom i snatched from under the wheels of a coach which a moment later would have gone over him his danger was first announced by the screams of his sister madmoiselle dupont said i i have thought of it an hundred times as one of the many providental circumstances that have come to my knowledge well it was madmoiselle dupont you met i recollect she went to india she did said hewit not after an unkind unworthy husband as you did but to find a kind and a worthy one his name was doliviere  doliviere said i gracious heaven then rising and opening the door that led to the chapel do you see that altar those skulls they are the skulls of that wretched couple the ways of heaven said walmesley are dark and intricate puzzled with mazes and perplexed with errors why where are we got said my brother one would think this was lapland and that we were among the witches well but said hewit in astonishment if this is the case   be calm said i and go on with your story i shall astonish you more before i have done  well said hewit this lady introduced me to her husband who learning the nature of her obligations to me though only a passenger himself and of course without power aboard said he had no doubt but he could prevail upon the captain to take me this he did i was to work my passage and this good lady and gentleman promised to show me every attention in their power which promise they faithfully kept  and now began my troubles with a witness we had not two days in succession that we could call good weather for almost four months we were for ever scudding just as the wind thought proper to kick us at last in the toughest gale i ever saw or i hope ever shall we got bump ashore    between those rocks said i here said hewit why what a fine reckoning we kept then to be sure we had not seen fun nor moon nor hardly one another for six or eight days we all thought we were near the cape oh it was most shocking work i fired the first signal of distress you did said i you noted it in your signal book and wished that i might be praying for you when at that very moment i was on my knees invoking every power to bless and protect you  divine creature said hewit is it possible i could be so near happiness and yet deprived of every blessing but i had not suffered enough my crime was not sufficiently punished well after firing three or four times more our signals were answered by a blaze of light from the shore which proceeded from a pile of wood that i had set fire to said i i felt i almost knew you were there and my love for my husband inspired the thought go on  finding continued hewit that at every signal the flame increased we agreed to lay by till daylight and then venture ashore in our boats in the first that was hoisted out i got a place it was then scarcely day and with all our skill we could not make the shore but being by the surge driven round the point of a rock we presently found ourselves out at sea  there were nineteen in the boat seven of whom including myself after beating about at the mercy of the elements for six days without any provision but which had been snatched up at the moment of leaving the ship were taken up by the adventure a brig bound to the south seas upon discoveries of the remainder some were washed overboard and others died of fatigue or hunger  what became therefore of the rest of the crew and passengers of the entrepeneur i knew not they all said i perished in my sight except ten who remained on board the wreck their bodies i afterward found and consigned to the grave among these were monsieur and madame doliviere whose bones and skulls i preserved in sacred remembrance of a husband and wife who died in each others arms  chap iii hewits story concluded i now begin said my brother to see how you came by your geer and all this plenty about you i did not know what to think of it at first but pray who built this fine palace of yours i did said i well said he you shall tell us all about it upon my soul if i did not know you to be my sister i should take you to be some queen of the fairies in the arabian nights entertainments this looks more like magic than reality  well said i let hewit finish his story and then i will convince you however wonderful appearances may seem under the guidance of providence that has graciously protected me every thing here has been created by the suggestions of my fancy and the labor of my hands where shall my wonder or my praise begin said walmesley wet your whistle and go on with your story jack said my brother hannah here is god bless thee my girl  the adventure as i told you said hewit was bound on a voyage of discoveries her orders were to get if possible eighteen degrees beyond the antartic circle it seems that some notable discoverer had proved in a long treatise to the satisfaction of the royal society that there was certainly an untouched continent in the south sea which when it should be once taken possession of would make all those in numerable islands tributary to it just as almost imperceptible gobules of quicksilver are swept into one large body so to find this continent in nubibus they sailed and that they might do the thing in a seamanlike manner they stood away from england for the azores and thence directly across the atlantic to daviss straits upon this principle that as columbus in looking for the east indies found out the west so by keeping to the north they should have the whole south before them or said i as dogs get to that hedge opposite to the weather that they may better snuff up the air of the whole field  our captain lent me the whole treatise and to be sure it contained some of the most curious reasoning that ever entered the imagination of a bedlamite and all to prove that this continent was easily discoverable i must give you one instance of it  all the world knows says this reasoner thanks to sir isaac newton that the world is not exactly spherical but i shall hazard a much stronger opinion which if it prove truth may perhaps take in not only the various errors in relation to the longitude but all errors and variations of every description and show the origin of winds tides currents vortexes and every other species of natural phenomenae to be matters as self evident as daylight  my conjecture is this the globe is not only flatted at the poles but regularly all over like a circular building in cants making     00 square degrees thus the french philosophers measured a short degree toward the pole and a long one at the equator not however because there is any real difference between two given degrees but because i beg i may be attended to they hit at one place upon the two opposite points of a quadrangle and at the other they measured from parallel to parallel which is also the boundary of the square so that sir isaac newton this admitted triumphed by accident for had the angular measurement been taken at the pole and the parallel at the equator cassini would have reaped an honor which chance at which out of love to my dear country i rejoice conferred on our immortal englishman  thus like the spiculae in the circulation of mercury which are as it were so many weapons that enable the quicksilver to fight with its natural enemy the disease are the points of these angles a well imagined defense to combat with winds meteors and other elementary foes and i should hope no one will be absurd enough to contradict so reasonable a doctrine since every creature has its means of defense from a gnat to a rhinorceros and a man must be mad indeed to contend that nature who gave bristles to the hedgehog and quils to the porcupine could be so scandalously improvident as to send the world into such a war of elements unarmed  besides i shall go further the moon is unquestionably armed in the same manner and what is called her horns are no other than those very angles the poets indeed by this expression have taken leave to say that the earth and the moon are a lantern to each other but they have mistaken the truth they are a mirror to each other or rather a multitude of square mirrors regularly framed otherwise how could they convey so strong a light by reflection a diamond emits the best reflected brilliancy of any object known to us but even that gem gives it not in perfection till it has been in the hands of the lapidary therefore without any great stretch of probability it is not hard to believe that an unpolished lump of land and water could convey so cheerful a light at such an immense distance and that merely by reflection had not nature turned lapidary and given it this exquisite polish which was perhaps the change it underwent when it arose out of chaos nay did not the suns warmth contradict me i should say that the difference of his luster compared to the luster of the moon arose merely from this circumstance that one was slightly polished in the manner of a table diamond and the other highly like a brilliant  encouraged by all this fine reasoning to find out a continent in the south sea was the adventure pelting on as i said before toward the antartic circle for my part i should have been better pleased if she had been bound for england but it was not my business to start difficulties with people who had just saved my life  they were glad enough to get us aboard being rather barren of hands three of the crew having died of the scurvy one having been knocked out the boat by the tail of a grampus four left upon a desolate island because they excited a mutiny and two poor devils having been killed and eaten by savages  i dont know what sort of advantage people propose to themselves in these voyages of discovery i soon for one thing discovered that we were all a set of fools at one place where we landed we were pleased enough to scamper back again as hard as we could drive for fear of being knocked in the head and at other places we were glad to come off without being roasted or devoured by crocodiles  to be sure as a mighty affair we did take possession of a barren island and after having buried with great solemnity a queen annes farthing an irish harp and a scotch bank note we set up a post with a writing on it in large characters just as you put up steel traps and spring guns to inform all those phaenecians malayans japanese and other inhabitants of that quarter of the globe who happened to understand english that this lump of sand which we had dignified by the title of new britain was from that date to be considered as a part of the english territories  we penetrated as far as we could southward and landed at several places which were certainly islands or pieces of floating ice at last being very short of provisions and eaten up with the scurvy we were obliged to return as wise as we went and having in our way back bought feathers frogs and flying cats which we paid for with tenpenny nails and having besides collected a prodigious number of humming birds shells snakes eggs fish down crocodiles teeth crabs eyes together with two and twenty classes of animalculae and numberless other articles after being out a year and a half all which time we were never within sixty degrees of the line we arrived in a most crazy condition at manilla  i was now in the most curious place i had ever touch at in my life for the people being of all nations and persuasions revile trick and laugh at one another the chinese cheat the malays the malays the ethiopians the pintendos rob the portugese while all join together to elude the vigilence of the spaniards who in their turn laugh at the english for suffering them to sit down quietly in their government though they never paid more than half their ransom  being refitted and well victualed for our captain had good credentials to show both from government and the royal society we sailed with a fair wind to edify the english with the wonderful discoveries we had made but scarcely had we passed the gulf of siam and got into the straights of mallacca when we were captured by a french pirate of considerable force which was bound to pekin with a cargo of jesuits on board  these jesuits having confiscated some religious treasure had determined to transport themselves from france to avoid the fury of the government the government however was too cunning for them for getting scent of their fraud and not wishing to brand them publicly in france on account of the veil they think it politic to throw over the peculations of priests the captain of the vessel which the jesuits had hired received a private order from the general of the police to deprive them of their ill gotten wealth when they should arrive in a certain latitude to fix a mark of infamy upon their shoulders and then leave them ashore on the coast of africa  when they came to the place where this scene was to be acted one of the jesuits having overheard a conversation between the captain and his chief mate saw into the whole business upon which a private counsel was held among the jesuits and a motion was carried to throw the captain and the mate overboard and seize the ship this was executed almost as soon as resolved the captain the mate and two or three others were hustled into the sea and the rest expeditiously battened down below where they were told their treatment would depend upon their conduct  after a long parley it was agreed that the sailors should be at liberty to trade upon their own bottoms as pirates the jesuits only desiring to be landed safely with their property at china and it was in their way there they had met with and captured us we had now our choice either to turn pirates and cruise in company or to be set ashore on the first desolate island to become a prey to wild beasts  two of the french men were yet alive who had been saved out of the entrepreneur these begged they might accompany the jesuits and join in their laudable plan of converting the inhabitants of china to the true faith this being agreed to they were decorated with a mock tonsor and enveloped in a piece of old black baize in this situation they took an oath to adhere to the interests of the fraternity and to keep its secrets which the jesuits swore was the only ceremony of induction they had ever gone through  as to the captain myself and the rest of the crew by way of choosing the least of two evils we agreed to join the pirates and thus every body being satisfied we proceeded toward china with a fair wind  being now all rogues alike it was agreed that every man should relate his adventures the sailors had very little more to say than that they had made a number of voyages the profits of which they had spent as soon as possible after their arrival in port and that they had been perpetually the dupes of prostitutes and false friends none of whom would acknowledge them whenever they came home in distress  as for the jesuits their lives were curious enough if it will not tire you i will repeat some of the particulars i begged he would one of them said he was the left hand son of one nobleman and had been page to another from whose family he was driven out for theft after this rather than starve he amused himself with picking pockets in the churches while he was kneeling for a benediction but being detected one day by a priest who had stood in admiration of his dexterity he had got him admitted as porter to a convent of carthusian monks and having qualified himself in every respect for trading upon his own foundation he was admitted into the brotherhood where he had procured as much wealth to be left to the church that is to say to him and his fraternity as had occasioned the ruin of forty individuals he had absolved several sinners of sacrilege upon condition they gave him back their plunder he had had thirteen children though he had taken the vow of celibacy whom he had bred up the boys being eight in number till they were of a proper age to send as a venture to the new world and made the girls nuns in a certain convent where he had connived at the destruction of their virtue to enrich himself with the contributions of their seducers  he said in the commission of these and innumerable other pranks equally attrocious he had taken care to lead a life of the most edifying sanctity till the reputation of his superior cunning had attracted the notice of the jesuits who had invited him to become a member of their order in which situation he had acted to their advantage and his own  a second said that having been a captain of dragoons and killed a man in a duel he had fled to the church for sanctuary where being admitted till the matter could be hushed up he liked the conversation of the priests so well that under a pretense of sorrow for having committed murder he had prevailed upon them to admit him a member of their society  he said he had been guilty with very little variation of all the crimes related by his holy brother but having a forwarder and more open degree of impudence than his companions one of whom took upon him to be very lavish of his admonitions he was determined to be revenged when finding his sanctified preceptor rather too familiar with a certain abbess of whose favors he himself had been a partaker he took the liberty of chucking the gentleman out of the window which was so resented by the order that the consequence would have been fatal to himself but for the abbess who would not give him up  this spirited conduct of the lady added he who they knew if they accused would recriminate brought about a parley when it was agreed that under a new appelation i should take the ensigns of another order and that they would give out that i had been put to death in private for the murder of the friar by a particular inquisitorial mandate which they actually obtained for that purpose the jesuits he said had received him amongst them and what had passed since was not unknown to the company  a third said he could prove his lineal descent from the very priest who had the immortal honor or as some say execration of proposing the first expedition to the holy land his own birth was indeed rather obscure being son to a man who got his bread by making crucifixes and painting flames upon the black baize used at every auta de fe  he said that being twelve years old he was made a sort of runner to a prison of the inquisition where being observed to have a particular taste for augmenting the misery of the victims he was early promoted to be one of the torturers in which religious practice he would be bold to say he had introduced more ingenious refinements than one would think the wit of man could invent or the heart permit him to exercise and all this he said he found the more necessary because people under the influence of that holy court were tortured to confess sins they had never committed the jesuits however he said cajoled him from this situation though so extremely pleasant and comfortable well knowing that a man so brought up would be a considerable acquisition to their community  a fourth said he had been a jew but having ridiculed some of the ceremonies of that religion and in particular their abstinence from pork he had been anathematized and his hair toe nails spine marrow kidneys midriff brains arteries skin lungs teeth bowels muscles head heels and every other part about him solemnly and formally damned to all eternity  thus deserted by his own religion he thought he could not do better than place himself under the protection of some other he therefore turned mohammedan and was soon after the principal projector of the largest fire that ever happened among the jewish inhabitants of constantinople  at this fire he said he got pretty warm but fearing he should be found out as the ringleader of the mischief he took the earliest opportunity of leaving that part of the world the riches however that he had saved out of the fire went as merrily as they came for falling in with a rover he was carried into algiers and sold for a slave he however contrived in conjunction with two roman catholic priests to raise an insurrection and having murdered their master and his family and seized one of his ships they released the crews of two galleys and finally arrived at a spanish in port safety  here he said being received within the pale of the church of rome he was soon after admitted among the jesuits of whose holy body he hoped he had not proved an unworthy member  a fifth had been one of the people called quakers but having been detected in a falsity upon an affirmation he had been as thoroughly excommunicated though not so violently as the jew  knowing it would be to no purpose to seek a reconciliation with the faithful he turned methodist in which situation he had sent seven old women to bedlam induced one miserable sinner to poison himself that he might have a freer communication with his wife and made several others become bankrupts to the ruin of their families  he was whipped and transported from england branded in holland punished with the single knout in russia and banished to the copper mines in siberia whence he escaped in company with eight other slaves namely a philosopher a bigot a priest a jew a french trooper an italian singer a portugese bravo and an english traveller the latter of whom when their distresses became intolerable politely hung himself that they might eat him  having traveled he said through a prodigious tract of country during which time they suffered innumerable hardships they arrived at eastern tartary where by the priests advice they converted a hord of savages and afterward plundered them to procure the means of their escape into europe where after a time having arrived in safety his friend the priest had procured him admission into the community of the jesuits  having given you said hewet this sample of these holy hypocrites you will not wonder that the captain of the adventure and i formed a scheme to get out of their clutches the pirates had at first put one of their own people to command our ship and distributed our crew among their own but after a time they did not think this precaution necessary for finding that we met them half way in every thing and that we were more anxious for plunder when we fell in with a prize than they all which conduct was put on as a point of honor and a proof of their confidence they reinstated the captain in his command and gave the crew precisely their former situations  the pirates had formed a design to rob the jesuits before they should come to port in which design we pretended to agree and the jesuits on their part had concerted a plan to give up the pirates to justice and make the ship and cargo their own how they managed however i neither know nor care as soon as an opportunity offered we gave them the slip in the night exactly as walmesley and i had tricked the attorney and the butcher and in about a month afterward now four months ago i had the good fortune to join company with captain higgins walmesley and a few other friends at bengal  with them i embarked in a dane for europe and being for once in my life under the power of a guardian angel my punishments are past and i am at last in your arms rewarded for my constancy and perseverance and now my dear hannah so may i prosper as i solemnly and sacredly adhere to every desire of yours swear said walmesley i do said hewit to obey whatever she desires as i would the command of some superior power on whose pleasure my life and happiness depended  well perhaps i may put you to the trial said i do said hewit never will i indulge an idea a wish or a desire but what shall be dictated by you it is deeply sworn said walmesley if he should break it now said my brother come come cried hewit i cannot bear a jest on this subject i should be the most infamous of all villains could i do otherwise than implicitly study the wishes of so much goodness and virtue  chap iv hannahs story hewit having finished his story i was very solicitous to hear what had happened to the rest and particularly to binns the mystery of whose long absence and various adventures which of course they could unravel excited in me the highest curiosity my brother however insisted upon having every thing in order nor could i even prevail on them to tell me how walmesley came alive who as we had been over and over again informed died in ireland  my brother said that binns would relate his own story which i should find interesting enough and as to walmesley he should give us his the next morning at breakfast for that there would hardly be time enough to hear mine that night and he was determined not to turn in till he had learnt every particular  finding i had nothing else for it i did as he desired me taking up my story from the time i sailed in the grosvenor every thing that had passed before being of course known to them through him from whom i had concealed no part of my adventures the dreadful hardships i had with my poor companions sustained on the coast of africa excited the tenderest interest in the breast of hewit and my brother and as to poor walmesley he was every now and then stalking about and uttering by day and night but this is wondrous strange or some other quotation from a play  but when i came to speak of sourby and his carrying me off i thought poor hewit would have fallen from his seat oh the villain said he born to thwart my happiness in every part of the world tell me my dear hannah   make yourself easy said i my honor was preserved by mdaniel the carpenters mate who you knew brother  i did know him said my brother he was always a good lad  what is become of him he landed with me said i on this island but he did not survive an hour he had received his death blow from sourby what an infernal villain said my brother well all the poor lad wished was to provide for his aged mother i know where to find her and i will take care for his sake she shall never want  but what became of sourby said my husband hastily are there no bolts in heaven said walmesley do tell me said my brother that the horrible scoundrel was blasted by a flash of lightning or that the devil fetched him away alive or some thing or other to ease my curiosity he was swallowed in my presence said i by a shark  thats right that is right said my brother gracious just and merciful god said hewit thy hand was there well but said walmesley that shark was a cannibal owing i suppose said my brother to his being bred up upon the coast of africa he must have had a delicious meal it would have given me pleasure to have minced it for him a little beforehand  well well said i but if you interrupt me in this manner i shall never get to the end of my story and you will please to recollect i am anxious to hear yours i beg your pardon said my brother it is your fault jack you are so cursedly impatient  go on hannah then taking up the bowl here is may the devil be merciful to him and that is more than he deserves  i now methodized all i had already told them and then went regularly on with what i had further to say they commiserated the fate of poor mdaniel wondered at my astonishing perseverence could scarcely conceive how i had kept my senses in the midst of so many and such extraordinary trials admired the secundity of my genius in which i had found so many various and comfortable resources all which they could scarcely have credited had they not well known my abilities and the wonderful fortitude with which heaven had endowed me  the whole business of the shipwreck and the ingenious means by which i had supplied myself with whatever i wanted were next subjects of their admiration after this i came to my wonderful escape from the lioness my return to the cavern the particulars of those documents i had found in hewits chest my domesticating the young lion which almost excited in hewit another fit of jealously for i told him i had had a companion whose worth and fidelity i should ever regret that he had watched me valued me and loved me that he was my constant companion my faithful friend and my generous protector that at last he lost his life in defense of my honor and that no tears were ever more poignant or more sincere than those i had shed at his death  he answered generously to this that he held my honor in so sacred a light that he would answer with his life for the propriety of my conduct whatever it might turn out upon an explanation i told him he did me justice and that he would deplore the loss of the noble creature i had alluded to as much as i did  i then explained myself and they were delighted at the circumstance which i was charmed to find they did not consider as any thing extraordinary my brother said that a lascar used to traverse the wilds of arabia as a messenger from the different armies with no other guide or protector than a lion from whose carcass he had plucked a poisoned arrow and by sucking the wound had cured it and he might still said he have had the generous creature for his guide but that a certain nabob thought it expedient to hang the lascar to prevent his telling tales leo however revenged him for though he came too late to save his benefactors life to the astonishment of the populace he flew at the executioner and tore him to pieces and perhaps he might have done the same by the nabob if he could have got at him and no harm into the bargain  hewit said that leos mother was the most harmless creature that ever was seen for that the officer who had the care of her used to play with her like a cat and as to walmesley he said he would rather trust a lion than a man at any time for said he trust not a man he is by nature false dissembling fickle cruel and ungrateful but a lion oh the gentle monster why i once at a country fair put my head into a lions mouth out of a bit of fun  indeed indeed said i hewit you must forgive me if i think of leo as long as i live with the greatest tenderness he was my faithful friend my kind companion my willing assistant he was sent me by providence to lessen my labors to alleviate my distresses to preserve my honor to be my generous guardian my valiant safeguard my noble champion till heaven should restore my natural protector  laud we the gods said walmesley and let our crooked smoke climb to their nostrils be quiet you walmesley said my brother and let her go on and you hewit who had tenderly caught me in his arms and swore that it should be the business of his life to love and oblige me cannot you have done with your raptures come hannah let us hear a little more poor leo well next to a shark i shall in future like a lion  having by their interruptions obliged me to tell my story in this disjointed way i was under the necessity of recapitulating many circumstances over and over again my brother in particular made me dwell upon the expedients i had used and the methods i had pursued to erect decorate and furnish such a building which i explained to him so satisfactorily that he wondered no longer at any thing but my courage and perseverance  having finished all i had to say in the best manner that i could with so many interruptions we began to think of supper and while i was bestirring myself for that purpose hewit my brother and walmesley paid a visit to every part of my mansion as i was cooking i could not avoid hearing their remarks the cabin is convenient said walmesley there you are jack said my brother razors to grind scissars to grind how the jade loves you well though she is my sister i dont think her equal is to be met with upon the face of the earth  her equal said hewit see in future whether all the treachery of hell shall make a fool of me again see with what pains she has traced her various fortunes with her pencil all marked with some affectionate proof that though i idiot as i was had forsaken her she had nobly forgiven the wrong and still loved the unworthy author of her sufferings but her mind was always superior to mine and by all that is just she shall implicitly guide me to my last gasp  see see said my brother here is walmesley at the begging grate of leicester goal who calls on achmet said walmesley you may well say that said my brother the words are coming out of your mouth  after these and other remarks in the saloon they entered the chapel where the different inscriptions on the urns excited in them the tenderest sensations nor could they read so many tributes of esteem to their remembrance so many grateful acknowledgements of the bounty of providence so many moral and religious proofs of pious resignation without being deeply impressed with admiration at the sacred and holy sense in which i held my duty toward my creator  they contemplated the skulls with awful veneration and when hewit took up the bible i saw him in an agony the tears wet his manly cheeks his sighs seemed to rend his very heart his eyes were lifted to heaven till at length in a burst of fervid admiration he fell on his knees at the altar and entreated that the heaviest judgment of heaven might be showered on his head if he should ever again give me cause to heave a single sigh  the tombs were next visited in hewits tomb was deposited the chest which contained all those documents i have already mentioned besides the history of my sad life up to the period of those reflections just before i lost poor leo that induced me to believe my latter end was approaching these i had carefully arranged in hopes that time might one day bring them to light for the information and i flattered myself edification of the world little expecting i should have so complete a catastrophe to add to my adventures  at the end of the inscription on my own tomb i referred the reader for further information to the chest that thus there might be no mistake all this method and regularity they very much admired they then examined the inside of my tomb and were wonderfully struck with all they saw but particularly the allegorical allusions contained in the artificial flowers there is rue for you hewit said walmesley well then upon my soul this is too much said my brother too much sir said walmesley why thought and affiiction passion hell itself she turns to favor and to prettiness  i now summoned them all to supper and had the pleasure to receive their compliments on my cookery which together with all the rest according to them was admirable we were very comfortable my brother in particular who at last having drank arrack punch pretty plentifully grew quite facecious he told hewit he was a happy rascal talked of wedding nights of making up for lost time and other inoffensive jokes kindly meant and kindly taken at last we prevailed on him to go to bed walmesley followed his example and now after an absence of five years i retired to the arms of my husband  chap v walmesleys story while i prepared breakfast next morning the three friends walked out to examine the beauties around my dwelling and when they returned were of course very lavish in the praises of all they had seen how should you like to live here said i my brother answered that for a life ashore he should like it very well walmesley said it was a paradise of never ending sweets and hewit said any place would be a paradise with me  breakfast being over i reminded walmesley that it was now his turn to tell his story come said i mr walmesley dont you think i am impatient to her how you could make such a blunder as to come here after dying in ireland dying said walmesley oh no no such thing they buried me to be sure but i was not dead i took care of that  curious enough certainly it was  you see there was a poor pains taking fellow with a wife in a consumption an old mother and a sick child so because he could not pay a debt of thirteen pounds for no reason upon earth but that he had not a single halfpenny in the world they took the bed from under these poor devils for they had but one among them did you ever hear of such a set of rascals  well thinks i to myself what is to be done now suppose thou let them have thy bed said good nature hold said churlishness what art thou to do thyself manage in the best manner thou can said generosity charity begins at home said prudence a good deed finds its own reward said virtue if you get sick who is to pay the doctor said illnature  at last my conscience hanging about the neck of my heart ladies or gentlemen said i or whatever you are that keep this pother over my head since you are equal in your opinions upon this subject if you will permit me i will have a casting vote and as i never valued myself nor ever shall when i could or can oblige any body else which by the way is an iriscism for the true way of valuing oneself is to oblige any body else that vote shall be that the people have the bed  who knows but i may be in the same situation myself i have taken one step toward it already i am without a bed i want nothing now but the wife in a consumption the old mother and the sick child  so i gave them the bed i lie i sold it to them they paid me for it by a smile and a tear valuable enough to have purchased a whole upholsterers shop it must be confessed that i caught a devil of a cold by lying on the ground and the apothecary advised me to have my bed back again saying that if i had not he could not answer for the consequence slave said i i have set my life upon a cast and i will stand the hazard of the die  the apothecary said very truly that he could not answer for the consequence my cold introduced an old acquaintance to me called the rheumatism i cod i had it now hip and thigh the doctor plied me with physic by wholesale but one day having informed me that he should send a cordial mixture for me to take and an embrocation to rub myself with he made a blunder which was natural enough you know being an irishman and labelled the bottles wrong so that i swallowed the embrocation and rubbed myself with the cordial mixture  the consequence of all this was that the embrocation having in it a plentiful quantity of opium set me to sleep this sleep they mistook for death it is a pity but i had been a roman catholic i should have been waked and being put into my coffin and afterward into my grave just as the words ashes to ashes and dust to dust were repeated and the sexton had thrown a shovel of dirt upon me whether from the noise or the cold or whether the influence of the opiate had ceased i know not but i awoke knocked pretty stoutly and was let out  it turned out a glorious thing the manager doubled my salary under an idea that my story would excite curiosity he had it made into a farce where i acted a dead man to the life i got a good benefit grew quite a favorite why sir my death immortalized me  about this time one messink had an offer to manage the theater at calcutta i fancy this was just about when you returned from france he made me a very liberal proposal to take me with him as his factotem and under an idea that i should find captain higgins there after maturely weighing all consequences after considering that i had not a friend nor an acquaintance upon the face of the earth except yourselves that cared three farthings whether i made my exit off the stage or out of the world i determined to try my fortune among savages and men of inde  after boxing the compass and buffetting the billows for eight or nine months i arrived in the kingdom of bengal messink first took possession of the theater and i in quality of treasurer prompter property man and occasionally performer in short the scrub of the family according to dr johnsons explanation of factotum began to enter upon my vocation  my next idea was to enquire after captain higgins but lord how did i know that surat was on the other side of the indian peninsula i had taken it in my head that it was only a stones throw from calcutta well said i travelers must be content so on we went astonishing the nabobs well well said i these rupees are no bad things  thus time wore on there were we lolling in eastern luxury still all i thought of was somehow or other to get at the captain i ventured two letters but i found afterward they never reached him at last like cleopatra on the river cydnus her galley down the silver cydnus rolled purple the sails the streamers waved with gold comes the captain sailing up the ganges as stately as a swan upon the thames played sergeant kite for my benefit all the gentlemen used to play at calcutta oh how i have heard them tear a passion to rags a better thing for me than the blacksmith at birmingham  i never was so rejoiced in my life well we had talk enough about you this was just after your brother had put you on board the grosvenor for england you see said my brother that i had no intention of going higher on the coramandal coast than madras but finding i should not be able to get my credentials so properly from the nabob and meeting with an advantageous offer to carry a freight i was prevailed upon to stand on for calcutta it was curious enough that jack he wit should have quitted madras only a week by his account before i arrived at it not that it would have made any difference for if i had met with him instead of his going to surat i should have sent him packing after you  indeed said i it would have made a material difference for in that case i certainly should not have seen him here nor would any thing perhaps have turned out as it has i have remarked with astonishment the steps that have led to this wonderful meeting and my mind is completely made up the hand of providence is in it all  but go on mr walmesley  faith maam said walmesley there is not much to say i could divide and subdivide all the little nonsenses that make up a life so frivolous and insignificant as mine but it would be only to retail the former narrative which made you laugh so at wolverhampton actors either off or on the stage like mill horses go on the same dull round another and another still succeeds and the last fools as stupid as the former  your brother would fain have had me scamper with him over the red sea but hold you hold you said i i cod there may be mischief enough done without i i am a restless spirit they may want to lay me an obvious joke a foolish figure but farewell it for i will be brief  captain higgins finding i would not accompany him made me faithfully promise him to wait until his return telling me that we would then take a trip to england where he had no doubt but we should find you and hewit happy and comfortable and then said he well lay all our hulks in a convenient birth where when the voyage of life shall be at an end we may take a spell of sleep out of which we shall never wake till the angel gabriel pipes all hands  i was charmed with this for i love to cope with him in these humors for then he is full of matter so being a devil of a fellow at promise he found me when he came back exactly in the same place where he left me stuck as fast as if i had been one of the twelve caesars done by a sealcutter i found him exactly the same creature smoked as many sagars drank as much grog cracked as many jokes and did as many good natured things as ever  away we went to work sold our ship and cargo sacked the rupees and prepared all matters for our return to the land of beef and pudding every thing now appeared as if it was coming to a climax we seemed as if we were all to meet together like players at the end of the last act one morning as captain higgins and i were going along we met captain higgins   why what a stupid fellow you are said my brother how could i meet myself you mean hewit  no i dont we did not meet hewit till three days afterward i mean oh lord i mean mr binns that is the gentlemans name i think so you see binns and the young gentleman that is to say hewit no higgins come come said i mr walmesley you are going to give us the second edition of the prince and the fisherman no i ent said walmesley there was no fisherman in the case the gentleman is  but here is jack meggot who does not wish you to know it will tell you the whole story in two minutes while i have been half an hour explaining it and you dont know any thing about it yet  the fact is said my brother we met with binns and afterward with hewit and a friend or two more and having agreed with a dane to bring us to europe here we all are and i hope you are glad to see us what do you say to that hannah  nothing said i nothing can come of nothing said walmesley speak again if i did said i it would answer no purpose there is certainly some mystery behind and as i have had enough within these last four and twenty hours to put my resolution to the test you are right to manage my feelings lest they should be too much overcome only said i let me know the complexion of what i am yet to hear  we have nothing to disclose to you my dear hannah said hewit but what will give you pleasure and here comes a proof of it at these words a most charming young man entered the room and falling at my feet asked my blessing  chap vi containing the history of an exemplary young man some pertinent observations and a further discovery no one but a mother can judge of the sensations i felt when i strained in my arms the very pratler now grown into manhood who used to delight me on my little island where in the midst of prosperity i would retire to get rid of the worlds impertinence  i had early traced an understanding in this dear boy most uncommonly penetrating for his years which increased astonishingly as he grew up his mind pursued every thing with such avidity that his intelligence was unbounded and his discrimination was so nice and perspicuous that in all my observation and my reading i never met such a reasoner  as a proof of his capacity he taught himself arabic and the language of the hindoos on his passage out to india and it was through these advantages that he was appointed though little more than a child to a considerable situation up the country  in addition to these advantages his manners were the most winning in the world to the sweetest and evenest temper he added the most solicitous and conciliating attention he was as brave as fortitude without rashness and as mild as humility without meanness what joy then to behold after so long an absence such a son such a treasure i can only say my joy unaccustomed as i was to pleasure was immoderate and if in the fullness of my heart i now recall it upon paper let no one but a parent comment on it those who are not parents may think i have said too much every parent will wonder i could say so little  my son at my earnest desire related the particulars of his fortune which might make a little novel by itself and be called the progress of industry for never were there talents so worthily employed pursuits so sensibly planned so resolutely undertaken or so laudably pursued it spoke him the true englishman of oppulence with spirit abilities and accomplishments to repel a foe regulate a counting house or ornament a senate  were the country invaded he did his duty bravely in the field were the produce of the east to be wasted across the pacific ocean to agrandize his native country he estimated the honorable average of loss and gain and and regulated account between merchant and merchant if the exigencies of the state rendered it necessary to call in superior abilities his voice was the most eloquent in the counsel in short he was a pattern for what a young man should be and what almost any young man tolerably gifted may be by nothing more than keeping this one simple maxim in view never to be indolent  would not one imagine with such admirable talents such true rectitude that this dear youth was not wherever he came an object of esteem and respect nothing like it he was the perpetual object of envy and calumny every poltroon envied his bravery every knave his integrity and every fool his understanding he was tracherously stabbed by a cowardly assasin who fancying he had killed him took the honor to himself of a glorious action the sweet youth had nobly performed false accounts had been surreptiously foisted into some bills of lading of which he had the regulation by a swindling adventurer with a view to impeach his honor and a charge of intention to innovate and new mould the state had subjected him to a trial for having uttered an oration that for eloquence might have honored demosthenes and for wisdom have given reputation to solon  thus an honor to human nature human nature did every thing it could to dishonor him his good sense was shrewdness and a disguise for knavery his modesty slyness and cloak for hypocrisy if he was humble it was dissimulation if manly it was temerity in short we were mother and son and having perhaps our minds a little better stored than our neighbors they poor creatures seemed to have nothing for it but to lower our faculties to the level of theirs  the best trait of his mind was that though a misanthrope he was not a man hater he did not despise his fellow creatures he pitied them all which in a young man no more than one and twenty may be considered as presumption and perhaps impertinence but when it is recollected that this young man of one and twenty had thought more and to better purpose in any given month than many an old man of sixty does during his whole life the wonder will be with all the strong affections and antipathies of youth to stimulate his choice his mind did not harden into hate rather than soften into pity  yet ought not his ill treatment to prevent any young man from aspiring knowledge is a most charming companion and upon the principle which the proverb holds out that a contented mind is a continual feast so an accomplished mind is a continual amusement besides there is a great consolation in not deserving to be ill treated and the calumny of the world will little affect a man of good sense while the rectitude of his heart contradicts it  besides the consideration reaches farther benefits arising from the gifts of nature induce gratitude gratitude inspires every other virtue and thus the human mind has a succession of pleasures within itself and every pleasure the result of reffection but i entreat the reader to pardon me for this intrusion i could not avoid recommending this valuable conduct so exemplified in my own son and explaining its advantages that young men may see however envy may pursue industrious merit it cannot lesson its sterling value whereas the vice and folly that springs from indolence however men of sense may pity is the but of every fool and the prey of every knave  during my sons relation of his story which he delivered in modest and eloquent language i could not help noticing that he continually alluded to the obligations he was under to his uncle notwithstanding my brother was at no part of the time in the way to do him any personal service i therefore concluded that he had set agents about him to watch his conduct and be of occasional assistance to him  this i hinted and was very thankful to my brother for his tender care of his nephew avast said my brother put the saddle upon the right horse i knew very little about my nephew nay to own the truth as i never love to make the worst of any thing what i told you at surat about his situation at benares was only hearsay  i had many vague and strange conjectures concerning my nephew at that time but to have tormented you with them would not only have been unnecessary but cruel for if he was in a situation to need friends or assistance your interference could have done him no service i therefore amused you with what i thought would most console you without making you wretched about your son when you were already sufficiently wretched about your husband  but however said he it came upon its legs in the end for though i did not get the news till my return from the red sea had i staid but a fortnight longer before i sailed on that voyage i should not only have known that the flying report of his being well situated at benares was truth but to what uncle he had been so much obliged  what uncle said i in astonishment but bless me here are ladies and with them a gentleman i never saw before well said domine said my brother he sticks close to the women yes said walmesley but he is honest for all he wears black give me leave good folks to introduce you said my brother this my dear sister is the reverend mr gray this is you will be charmed to know who this is this is little britannia she married a fine fellow one dick lovejoy who sailed with me and she came over with him as in duty bound to india where he died and left her to my care hewit knew him and you have heard of him hannah it was the very man who turned amanuensis for hewit alias walmesley when he sent you an account of the vigo business but to proceed this is your niece and a sweet girl she is though i say it and though last not least in love this is mrs higgins  here my old friend whom i had known by the name of binns came up and warmly saluted me calling me her dear sister heavens said i what am i to think of this brother are you married and to my dear old friend too and suppose i was said my brother should you be angry hannah no indeed said i i should be delighted  well then i am sorry i cannot obblige you this time said my brother she deserves every thing she is lovely and she is amiable but though the world cannot produce you a fellow that more admires the beauty or would sooner defend the honor of your sex i would not marry the person of venus with the virtue of diana tacked to it no that he would not said walmesley though every god did seemed to set his seal to give the world assurance of a woman  she belongs added my brother to a noble fellow for whom you have an affection and an esteem to a man whom all the world must admire to a man in whose praise for i love valor and generosity i could talk for this half hour but that here he comes and i dont like to praise people to their faces  mr binns said i looking round me no lord said walmesley captain higgins the very captain higgins we met only you would insist upon his being a prince and a fisherman nay nay said i  it is truth said binns catching me in his arms my dear hannah i am your brother  chap vii the story of binns being a little recovered from the astonishment into which i had been thrown i expressed myself to my friends around me in terms of the warmest gratitude for the thoughtful the delicate manner in which they had introduced this succession of discoveries which strong as my mind was had they been more abrupt might have been attended with the worst consequences and what endeared their conduct doubly to me was that it could arise from no motive but tender and kind consideration  what a reverse of fortune did i now experience i had not only a husband restored to me who had been the object of all my pain and pleasure during my life but i had a son that i could proudly own i had one brother of whose fraternal affection i had received a thousand proofs and another who had proved himself every way a brother at the time i knew him sor no other than a kind and disinterested friend besides my tender friend who i had long loved was now my sister and no wonder if such unlooked for happiness required the exertion of my utmost sortitude  after a peal of congratulations and many suitable remarks on the wonderful chain of events that had so miraculously brought us together my new brother at my particular request related his story with which it is now high time i should acquaint the reader  you all know said my brother that a person of the name of binns lived in coalbrook dale who though he was himself of an idle and a profligate character had for a wife a most worthy and amiable woman i have heard mr williams when i believed her to have been my mother speak of her in terms of the highest praise and well he might if she bore the slightest resemblance to her daughter whose virtues when i thought her my sister were ever the objects of my admiration and since she has been my wife now eighteen years they have manifested themselves in so many tender and attentive instances of affectionate kindness which heaven knows have been rigourously put to the test that i must be which i hope is not in my nature most dishonorable and ungrateful if i did not through life make her happiness my study  you have heard that in the year      there was an explosion in a coal mine this unfortunate woman with several other persons and particularly a brother of yours called peter were killed but this was not the fact for it was my wifes brother that was killed and not yours i am your brother and the extraordinary circumstance of my being brought up as the son of binns arose from nothing more than that having lost his son and knowing that the countenance and support of his sister would wholly depend on the chance of her having a male heir to keep up her name he stole me who happened to be on the spot though unhurt carried me home passed me for his son which deceit my age and complexion favored and thus accomplished his designs against the purse of his sister  good heaven said i what art yes madam said walmesley and thus you see the ear of denmark was abused with a feigned story of his death  mrs binns continued my brother when she made her will at which time she fancied i was her nephew restricted both me and her daughter from assisting her brother to the injury of our own circumstances this however did not prevent his levying contributions on us both until at last his conduct was so arrogant that had i not supposed him my father i should have broke up all sort of communication with him which he saw and i could plainly perceive he was bent on some sort of revenge  about this time a clerk of our worthy brother the lawyer called upon me and said he had something to communicate that nearly concerned me i was shy of him at first but finding that the confedracy for whom he often perjured himself had marked him for destruction on account of some discoveries he had made which put them a good deal in his power i had no farther doubt that he meant to serve me especially as my own ears were to be witnesses of what he wanted me to believe  he told me that the mischief which threatened me was planned by his master and my reputed father that he did not know the nature of it but instructed me where to place myself so as to hear a conversation between them he said he certainly had an eye to reward but would not accept a halfpenny until i was convinced he deserved it  this was so fair that i concealed him until i had satisfied myself and having done so i gave him money for the purpose of affecting his escape what i learnt was the secret of my being your brother and this consultation between binns and the lawyer was to see how they could make it turn to their mutual account they had no doubt when i found that i had no pretension to any part of mr binnss fortune but i should be glad enough to come into any proposal that they might hold out to me  a variety of schemes were hit upon at last a most fortunate one as they thought suggested itself which was that my supposed father should make me acquainted with the truth and advise me to agree with him in saying that i was not the impostor but that his daughter was in which case i might insist upon the whole property half of which he was to receive as a reward for his treachery in my behalf  the lawyer was not to appear in it but he and his friends with whom mr binns seemed to have been pretty well acquainted were to have a fellow feeling apprized as i was of all that was to follow i had made up my mind as to how i should act having heard the proposal i begged to consider of it and after a time appeared reluctantly to yield to it  in the mean time it was extremely difficult to say what ought to be my real conduct i was determined certainly not to conceal a tittle of the truth but it struck me that if i managed adroitly i might get at the knowledge of some of those honorable practices in which my dear brother the lawyer and his worthy confederate sourby were engaged  with this view i played with the business and it turned out as i expected mr binns not being so artful as the rest of the fraternity soon made me acquainted with a few transactions which as i had wished for a full revenge on sourby gave me a particular pleasure i promised him mountains and which was greatly to his taste that i would conceal a large part of the property and make it appear less than it was in order that he might with the greater facility cheat his friends out of their share in short said i one night as i let him out of the garden succeed in this meaning a further discovery and i will make your fortune  which mysterious words said i my dear siser and i construed into a proof of your guilt i know it said my brother indeed all my conduct must have appeared very strange to you at that time my turning from the lover to the friend and brother my solicitude in favor of hewit all which i declare delighted me more than any satisfaction i had ever felt in my life and then the prospect i had of exposing and perhaps punishing sourby all filled my mind even though my whole fortune should have been the sacrifice with reflections that my honor approved  i hope i ever had a pleasure in showing myself a disinterested character and among the rest it was from this motive that i seized the opportunity with so much alacrity of going to town at the time we received the false intelligence that one of our correspondents had stopped payment but i little dreamed that from mr binnss tardiness the worthy knot growing suspicious had not only chose to remove me out of the way that i might be suspected of having committed the fraud of the notes which they were then meditating but their worthy friend also that under an idea we were father and son we might mutually be subject to the same suspicion in wolverhampton to exonerate them  the remainder of my fortune which i shall relate in as summary a way as possible is of another complexion i had scarcely alighted at an inn in the borough when i was forced into a house in st georges fields by some kidnappers i was then in the night conveyed to gravesend put on board an indiaman afterward taken to portsmouth and from thence the ship went to sea nor did i get rid of my handcuffs which had been put on me under the idea that i was a deserter till we cleared the channel  being arrived in india i was put into the ranks and as i had been sent abroad with a bad character i was pretty handsomely disciplined i bore it however with what fortitude i could and it was not long before an officer of some consideration seeing something about me above my condition paid me attention and in in a short time got me promoted to a halbert  i was now glad that i had an opportunity of serving the poor soldiers who having been for the most part kidnapped in the same manner that i had were exclusive of the inconvenience of struggling with a strange climate subject to many hardships which they had no right to experience  one day i saw two men chained together at a distance and asking who they were was informed that they were two notorious rogues whom the soldiers were bringing to me that i might represent their case to the officer under the idea that i could serve two fellow creatures i was charmed at an opportunity of investigating the crime laid to their charge which i imagined as usual was instigated to get smart money from them but judge my astonishment when i learnt that they were accused of no less than an intention of betraying me at the head of a serjeants guard to the enemy on the very next morning when i was to have been on duty on a reconnoitering party and how that astonishment was increased when i found them to be binns and dark  my situation at this moment was very critical i had certainly no affection for dark but could not bear that one i had so long considered as my father and who in reality was the father of her i had been accustomed to love and esteem as my sister should suffer at my instance an ignominious death for it was my duty to become his accuser i therefore ordered that they might be remanded and said that i should inform the commanding officer of their crime and issue his orders accordingly  in the mean time as i had not owned them and they dared not own me they thought in a consultation together they might turn the tables and by accusing me save themselves which would answer all their original purpose for the moment they had found i was in the camp and their superior in rank thinking because they would have served me so that as soon as i discovered them i should take care right or wrong to have them punished they concerted this scheme to get me out of the way  little however suspecting this i went to the officer who had promoted me and honestly informed him who they were and my wishes concerning them i asked his advice as to how i ought to act upon so delicate an occasion and entreated him as far as he could properly to indulge my feelings which he himself applauded he promised to do every thing becoming in the business and advised me without reserve to acquaint the commanding officer with what i had been told concerning them without introducing any thing relative to myself or appearing to be in any respect interested  i did as i was desired but the next morning i was surrounded by six men deprived of my sword and made a prisoner i was immediately tried by a court martial binns and dark were my accusers who swore i had inveigled them to assist in betraying my guard to the enemy with whom i had concerted a plan to surprise the camp which after putting the picquets to the sword they had no doubt led on by me apparently a friend they should completely rout and thus at least disconcert our measures for the whole campaign  this testimony was corroborated by a corporal a shocking fellow who i certainly hated because of his cruelty to the men and over whose head i had become a sergeant my patron and benefactor said what he could for me certainly but after all he himself had no positive knowledge of me and if i had deceived him it only proved the consummate art i must have been master of in short the story was so well told and so artfully conducted that i was found guilty of an intention of betraying the english troops to the enemy and sentenced to be shot the very next morning  the awful preparations were making the coffin was brought into my cell the flannel waistcoat was prepared the drums were muffled and every other ceremony usual upon such occasions was going forward when my friend the officer rushed in struck off my fetters and told me i was pardoned  it seems on the evening of the day i was tried the officers had met in a counsel of war when it was reported that the sergeant who had undertaken the post of honor i was to have commanded in the morning and which by the way was a matter concerted between my patron and i as a guide to my further promotion had been surrendered and taken by the enemy but that a quarter guard coming up they were rescued and the enemy made prisoners in return this appeared at first to corroborate my guilt but it was afterward clearly found that binns and dark had concerted the whole business and had been in the enemys camp to give them intelligence and particularly cautioned them not to expect my participation in the plan for on the contrary their wisest way would be to execute me immediately lest something sinister should follow which i was capable of planning and bold enough to execute and in consequence of this they were actually going to hang the poor sergeant my substitute when as i said before the quarter guard came up and surrounded them  binns and dark were immediately sent for and told that their iniquity was discovered my friend who was now charmed to have an opportunity of investigating whether i deserved his favor or not upon the faith of my story acquainted them with all those particulars relative to me which happened at wolverhampton when upon offering to produce evidence to substantiate every tittle of what he alleged they fell on their knees and implored for mercy we were however in such a situation that no mercy could be granted to such offenders and they were both condemned to suffer that death to which i had before been unjustly sentenced  i was still very wretched my friend the officer saw it and promised to do what he could to save the life of binns this to be brief he accomplished dark was shot and binns drummed out of the regiment his fate however was only postponed for being afterward received in a regiment of seapoys he was put to death by a faithful lascar in the moment of attempting for plunder the life of that very officer who at my solicitation had generously saved his  while binns and dark were under sentence of death i learnt from them how they had been served by their kind friends in england binns was kidnapped about the time i was but they continued to make an instrument of dark till he had written you that letter in which he told you my father and i were great rogues and then he was handcuffed and sent to keep company with his friends  why sir said walmesley these tools do such rogues most service in the end for when they have drained what they need it is but squeezing them and sponge they are dry again well said walmesley cried my elder brother from dark also i learnt continued my brother peter that it was to sourby he betrayed you in lovelane and now having disposed of them i shall proceed to other matters  my conduct was so well approved of during that campaign that i obtained a pair of colors and after it was over a lieutenancy but to my great misfortune i lost my noble friend he and i and a few others were surrounded i did what i could to defend him and narrowly escaped death myself but we were so outnumbered that though a party came and saved what few the conflict had left alive he after performing prodigies of valor fell covered with wounds and glory  during a truce our regiment happened to be at calcutta where being frequently invited to the houses of large factors and other oppulent settlers i was told one day i should be introduced to some young ladies who had come over to india to get husbands one of them in particular said my friend would suit you exactly as you are a soldier of fortune for she is very rich already and makes no scruple to declare that she came purposely in search of some person not so fortunately off now whether she means any particular person i cannot say but if she does not and any handsome young man of address and understanding will serve her turn i dont see why you should not stand as good a chance as another  i thanked him for his compliment and said that such disinterestedness was a charming feature in a wife after which company coming in we talked of different matters my friend was soon after called out and presently sent a servant for me zounds said he you are a lucky fellow i have received a letter from the lady i spoke of by way of excuse for her not attending us but it appears to me that you are the cause for my letter encloses one to you which she begs i would deliver to you having heard you were to be here this evening and not knowing otherwise how to direct to you  i am then the cause said i as i opened the letter and the happiest man that ever existed excuse me to the company i will call on you tomorrow so saying without further ceremony i left him  the letter contained these words  if captain higgins will have the goodness to call this evening at the house of messrs charteris and co he will see an old friend who wishes particularly to speak with him  who do you think wrote that letter the dear author of it is by your side and the motive of that and every other part of her conduct is so flattering so endearing to me that no hewit dearly hannah as he may love you and worthily as you may deserve him shall ever outdo me in tenderness and attention  i knew the hand writing of course the moment i saw it but how she could know me by the name of higgins i could not conceive indeed she little imagined she was writing to me but having heard from some friends who were of the party that one captain higgins was to be there she under an idea that it was my brother thomas was impatient to see him in hopes of gathering some sort of intelligence from him and feared if she put those questions to him in a mixed company it might interest her too much  this caution happened to be very necessary for our interview was tender enough as you may conceive her delight at finding that i was not her brother and my gratitude at hearing that she had left her own country to risk the chance of hearing of me were of too interesting a nature to be expressed before witnesses in short as we had loved one another tenderly as brother and sister so every bar being now removed we vowed a few days afterward at the altar to love one another tenderly as man and wife  we were soon torn however from each others arms my honor as a soldier raised as i was from the ranks and respect to his memory to whom my promotion was owing would not suffer me to sell out i served several campaigns with the usual success of others who said walmesley such the bubble reputation in the cannons mouth exactly said my brother and many a bitter pang while i have been on this endless search has my absence caused her whose tenderness deserved more attention at length for a service i was fortunate enough to perform i was sent express to england where by a most extraordinary accident i saw you sister and by another as extraordinary lost an opportunity of explaining what would have prevented every trouble you have since experienced  my stay in england was only three weeks where with the approbation of the east india company i resigned my military employ and accepted a civil one in the residency of benares for which place on my arrival in india i set out with my wife and daughter  i had been at benares three years when i heard of the great merit of a young man at oude whose name was hewit and with what address he had defended himself against his enemies who jealous of such abilities in such a youth had often attempted his overthrow i had also heard of some brave actions that he had performed in the field but as i knew several of the same name as i had never heard that you had a son nor could conceive if you had through what channel he could be in india though pleased with what i had heard in his praise as i should be to hear the commendation of any other extraordinary young man i did not attempt at any communication with him and to prove that this is natural he had heard and thought of me in the same manner  i had been at benares about two years after this when in common with others i had heard of a most serious charge that was about to be exhibited against this young man who was represented as so enterprizing as to have formed a plan of giving up a part of the country to the ravages of a certain adjacent rajah the circumstance struck me as a matter of so extraordinary a nature that i interested myself i knew not why in the business and fortunately came at the whole diabolical plot which had it succeeded would have crushed him i set out to oude with my documents and just as his enemies were on the point of prevailing against him begged leave to be heard my defense of him was so sound so complete that he was honorably acquitted and those who had planned his destruction were attached  he considered me as a guardian angel sent to save him and in the course of his modest acknowledgments for the service i had rendered him we discovered we were uncle and nephew finding that nothing could induce him to have any thing further to do with public affairs and indeed being heartily tired myself of mixing with people who were not contented without multiplying their fortune through the medium of rapine and plunder which neither he nor i ever practiced i invited him to benares where he resided with me the last three years when having some time giving up my employ at the earnest solicitation of my wife i agreed to leave india with a view to pass the remainder of our lives in england  being arrived at calcutta we called on our friend charteris of whom enquiring for a ship for england we had the good fortune to be introduced to my brother thomas and now my dear sister said my elder brother you really have heard all our budget of news to every word i have heard said i i have something to reply but let us devote this day to enjoyment tomorrow you shall fully become acquainted with my opinion and my resolution  chap viii which might be called if the term could be so far strained the living apotheosis of hannah hewit as soon as we had breakfasted and were seated on the lawn before my door in view of all those beautiful and picturesque objects which i have so frequently described my company manifested some impatience to hear those remarks on their various fortunes which i told them i had to make and for which i had severally prepared them as far as it was necessary on the preceding day  the position on which i meant to animadvert and which i begged to be allowed was that so many extraordinary and unheard of circumstances could not have combined in so remote a part of the world to bring a number of friends together friends so dear to each other friends who out of that small circle had nothing upon earth of value without the express intervention of providence  if am answered said i that nothing is more common than for natives of england to go to india and that many friendships have been formed there which afterward grew and improved at home i shall answer that it does not apply in the present case we none of us voluntarily went to india we were impelled beckoned there and by an irresistible impulse but said i what brought us here a miracle performed if we are wise to complete our happiness  the labrynth of our lives has been so impervious and the clue so difficult to find that if the whole had been invented and written down it could not have been managed with more art is it not wonderful that my brother peter no farther explained himself in the lobby of the playhouse and that all further explanation was prevented by our setting out the next morning to france  again notwithstanding my wretched brother in acquainting my husband of sourbys detestable plot against our peace must have mentioned over and over again that the person called binns was my brother is it not astonishing that all the documents in the chest speak of every thing in such general terms that i did not become acquainted with the circumstance until it was related yesterday by my brother himself no the ecclairissement was to take place here here we were to meet here we were to compare notes here we were to consult upon what footing to ensure our future happiness  take up any one of our stories in almost any part of it and you will find it a kind of index pointing to this day whenever we have been within a hairs breadth of individual happiness some singular event has prevented it why that we might now be happy together nor could this happiness be accomplished till the malignant fiends that were perpetually thwarting our hopes and refining our virtue like gold in the fire were no more  when this event was confirmed though at so many distant parts of the world fate called us together as a shepherd calls his sheep into the fold will you say this was chance was it chance that i have been three years on this desolate island as it were to expect you was it chance that my husband was hurried to different parts of the world for the same three years to touch at calcutta was it chance that mr walmesley should be the same three years resident there was it chance that my brother peter after he had found my son and saved his reputation should reside the same three years at benares and then bring him to the same spot was it chance that brought so many friends to the same place in one mind with one determination though no one of them individually knew of anothers intention and lastly when this band of friends were all met together was it chance that sent them to discover in so remote so desolate a spot the only object that would complete their happiness  was this chance miracles do not happen by chance no we are a set whose uncommon trials have never warped us from our moral duties our lives have been watched by that eye that regards virtue with benignity and this happy meeting is the reward of our truth and fidelity  let us now see how to be thankful for this blessing i have contemplated i have weighed i have considered and i think indeed i know there is but one way nor let my observation be disregarded contemplation is more nearly allied to prophecy than is generally imagined beings estranged from a converse with the world if they cherish virtue almost commune with the deity and conclusions beam across such minds as rational as truth and as certain as fate  i never yet mistook the salutary warnings conveyed in such sensations nor can i those which earnestly assail me at this moment dear friends so long lost so lately found so necessary to one anothers happiness do not cast from you the certain the valuable treasure you possess i conjure you to seize the only opportunity you have ever had in your power of securing permanent bliss  would you be completely blessed would ye never know care nor anxiety nor sorrow would ye escape the viles of treachery the practice of villainy the malignity of envy and all the accumulated miseries and misfortunes certain to attend a communication with society tempt not the world again let us enjoy a happiness which our first parents sorfeited by indulging a fatal curiosity we have here an eden it will be our own faults if we do not make it a paradise  why ay said walmesley a man may rot even here and why not said i mr walmesley have you found any thing in the world so very grateful so very thankful in return for all your labor in vain goodness and generosity that should induce you to run the risk of getting into gaol again or being buried alive for those who did not care if you were buried in good earnest oh no said walmesley you misunderstand me i think with you in such a shabby ragged rascally world the post of honor is a private station  well but hannah said my brother thomas though certainly your harrangue is full of eloquence and happens to be every word truth you dont seriously i hope think of giving up the world  can you tell me brother said i in what station happiness is to be found is it in the cottage no the poor peasant shall toil out a laborious and wearisome life in penury and want a stranger even to that plenty lavished on his masters hounds is it on the throne no the king shall be a pattern of goodness and virtue shall love his subjects like his children shall stimulate them to honor by his example shall watch their interest study their welfare conciliate and cherish their affections and by gracious great and godlike qualities manifest himself as the vicegerent of the deity yet shall some diabolical fiend some lurking traitor some dark assasin some malignant foe to order morality and every social virtue be continually disturbing his repose and cowardly terrifying his amiable consort and his lovely progeny with the perpetual glare of a dagger  is this a world then in which a reasonable being should covet a residence where envy and her malignant train are perpetually upon the watch to blast every bud of virtue in such a world to be accused is to be condemned and but for conscious rectitude which to the world carries no letter of recommendation a man may as well be hanged at tyburn as be honorably acquitted at the old bailey  let us then not sully our happiness by mixing with a world where virtue itself can find no safety we are all mortals and here at least are sure that no temptation can corrupt us for the human mind is mutable and like wax is capable of receiving various impressions and my reflections have convinced me that perfection will continue so long as it is secluded from the world but too often when it is mixed with the world like a drop of milk in a sink it will be lost and confounded partaking of the color stench and quality of that loathsome filth in which it is absorbed  for my own part said my brother thomas i certainly shall not take your advice but we are pretty nearly of a mind for all that you choose your world in one spot i find mine wherever i go those you know you wish to consider as friends i only want acquaintance though i believe you will all do me the justice to say my heart is pretty warm too but i will tell you one reason for this whim of mine i dont like any thing to touch me too nearly it would make me a milksop therefore while you refine on pleasures i take mine as they come and this will be the consequence your enjoyments will be more perfect than mine but you will find a bitterer pang than i shall at parting from them  heaven forbid said i my dear brother that i should use any arguments to induce you to do that of which you would repent or wish that any fears with which i may be possessed should shake whatever resolution you may have made that would be to arraign the very providence in which i so implicitly put my trust should i tell you that i have been once shipwrecked and therefore dare not venture in a ship again you would laugh at my womanish apprehensions  indeed i should said my brother if you are afraid for me on that account i thank you for your love but give yourself no concern i am none of your unfortunate adventurers who like dutchmen are always ashore some where or other my way is to arrive safe ship and cargo no no old boreas has too great a regard for me to do me any harm  at this instant i know not why i burst into a flood of tears nay nay said my brother my dear hannah but you know this is  i beg your pardon said i the sensation was involuntary i assure you i would not give you a moments uneasiness  well well said he taking me tenderly by the hand dont let your concern for me afflict you i shall arrive safe in old england never fear and so i hope will you for all your apprehensions  as for me said i i solemnly vow to end my days in this place my dear husband has promised to stay with me and now though i have thought it a duty a most tender a most necessary a most sacred duty to offer what i have said to all your reflections i will not utter another word to influence any of your determinations not even that of my son a choice of so serious a nature should be made from conviction not from persuasion  for me said my brother peter to my mind conviction has followed every word you have uttered sacred truth has fallen from your tongue and i have felt the force of your arguments like inspiration certainly every part of the world is new to us and without your society we could be no where perfectly happy i therefore most solemnly declare that if upon reflection my wife and daughter find nothing in it repugnant to their inclinations i shall consent to your proposal upon your own principle of choosing rational happiness  as to me my love said my sister my first happiness in life from the moment i could remember was yourself to this moment i have not altered my opinion and therefore as there can be no world for me but where you are so that part of the world must be most agreeable to me where i have most of your company and particularly in the society of a sister i have ever tenderly loved  my niece was now consulted who sweetly answered that she should be implicitly guided by her father and mother well then said my brother thomas if that is the case my nephew jack will stay of course at these words my son and my niece blushed and looked confounded that is right faid my brother dont be ashamed of that old diogenes said that a blush was the color of virtue the fact is and i suppose you have all seen it that they love each other we do said my son with the most tender the most honorable affection that said my brother is what i call honesty well since that is the case let domine tack them together there is another stroke of providence for you sister he came here on purpose my dear brother said i  i beg your pardon said he you know i must have my joke if the ship was sinking  well walmesley continued my brother what say you you will not stay i am sure yes but i will though said walmesley my fate cries out why lord if i dont stay they will have nothing to laugh at then turning to me go on i will follow thee i will be even with you then said my brother britannia shall go with me i am determined and would you said walmesley leave me all alone like a turtle to bemoan the absence of my mate a single stocking half a pair of sheers  no no said my brother you shall stay and study philosophy hang up philosophy said walmesley unless philosophy could make a juliet and so you are in love said i mr walmesley yes madam a thing of my own a poor humor of mine to take that which no man else will trip audrey where is sir oliver martext  well said my brother to use your own manner i dont like my favors to come hard from me britannia has made me her guardian and i consent to your marrying her and so you see it all falls right since you are determined to have a little england of your own you ought to have a britannia among you and if the lion had lived the resemblance would have been perfect  ah my poor leo said i well well said my brother jack hewit will protect you from the monkies better than he did and now since it mun be so as the mayors son said at nottingham let domine do his duty and then people your island as fast as possible  that said i shall go as chance may direct it oh lord said my brother chance will direct it very well it will be very hard indeed if you cannot people this island when the same number of persons once peopled the whole world  chap ix in which hannah having brought up the lee way of her life captain higgins sails and the history concludes with a moral reflection it was not long before i found that every argument i used might have been spared for as it is unconceivable what a heavenly place we were in so the propriety of making it a medium of never ending happiness became more apparent to every mind in proportion as their ideas were expanded by its beauty i own this delighted me to owe their pleasure to their own election not tomy persuasion was a satisfaction to me doubly and trebly welcome for i should have been miserable indeed had there been a chance of a single sigh among my friends at the expense of their forced consent in complaisance to me  i nevertheless went over the whole ground again and finding them firmly attached to their resolution i from that moment considered every thing like common business my brother thomas consented to stay a fortnight to celebrate the double wedding of my son and my niece and of walmesley and britannia  this interval it was agreed i should employ in finishing my history which he faithfully promised to get published telling me that as he did not much understand those matters domine should stand by and see fair play and take care being a man of letters to correct the press  finding that nothing would shake our determination he now bent his whole attention to make us comfortable he landed from the dane some fine arabian horses a mare with foal three goats two kids and several chinese pigs all which kindness however he would very often interlard with observations of how rueful we should look when we once lost sight of him and what a glorious laugh he should have against us when we got tired and sought our fortune in a skiff of our own building  i let him jest while i wrote mean while my husband my brother my son and walmesley were all cutting out business and planning pleasure for us all while my sister my niece and britannia were delighted to see their husbands so rationally employed and studying what way they could make their persons and their conduct most agreeable to them in short we began already to find our place a little heaven upon earth and i could plainly see the only emulation among us would be who should most endeavor to realize that idea  in the evenings i used to read to them what i had written in the course of the day in which they all agreed i had given a faithful representation of their characters and their fortunes the comments arising from what they heard were expressions of wonder and confirmations of their resolution which as usual produced a new effort to ensnare my brother into our plan to which we generally received some satirical compliment on our having minds superior to the rest of our fellow creatures and some such arch remark as that he should try what he could to establish a commercial treaty between great britain and her new colony but added he i dont see any thing at present you have to export but monkies and we have plenty of those already  we on our side did not fail to rally him when he asked us what he should do with our money take it said walmesley we have sold you poison you have sold us none hewit told him that by the time he had emptied his purse in satisfying those sharks the landlords laying to for painted galleys and relieving the distresses of honest fellows he would begin to think of his friends in the south seas well said my brother if it should be so i have made a good observation i know where to find you and i am sure you will give me a snug birth in that case too i shall not only be able to bring hannah an account of her life in print but shall be able to tell her how many converts her pains to reform the world will have produced though between ourselves jack i think without any of her prophetic pretensions i could tell her that now no no she has a strong mind but i dont think it herculean enough to cleanse that augean stable the world  i told him that i had no hope of accomplishing any such impossible task if the vice i had painted appeared ugly and the virtue beautiful it was all i had a right to expect that done men must think for themselves there is no telling mankind said i how to be right nor how to be happy that knowledge is born with us and we feel insulted at hearing an explanation of what we already know but it is not simply to be happy it is to be happy by rule by mode by taste thus pleasure leads to folly folly to vice and vice to misfortune yet nothing is so easy as to avoid the evil and choose the good but it all arises from the perverseness of human nature and if jupiters tubs were promiscuously presented to mortals for sale i know not whether the plagues would not turn out more marketable than the pleasures  but my history is arrived at the very moment in which i am writing i must therefore arrange it and deposit it with every necessary document in hewits chest that my brother may have every possible proof on his publishing it that all the particulars it contains are true and genuine  tomorrow we shall all have the painful task of parting with that dear that valuable relation the ship will then be underweigh heaven send that it may arriver at its destined port many a tear will witness our separation many a wish will be wafted in a sigh that the gale may be propitious of what my feelings will be at parting the reader must form an idea just as a painter conceals a face his pencil cannot express and leaves that description of the torn heart it ought to convey to the imagination of the spectator  and now gentle reader if i pant for peace for ease for tranquillity after so much turbulence and trouble if i prefer content and retirement to restleness and bustle a quiet spot to a busy world an unknown obscure corner to my own magnificent and flourishing country think me not lost to ambition to pride to curiosity to popularity i am a mortal and possess them all  rather commend me that made up of passions in common with my fellow creatures i am content to wage no future war with destiny look at my fortune and confess me born not for myself but for an example to others blame me not if i have learnt to know that in the world friendship is a name fame a bubble honor a jest merit a but for envy beauty the ridicule of impudence and virtue the prey of slander be not hard with me if i grieve that from the moment of my obscure birth to the moment of my sequestration from the world i never found except in my dear brother and those who retire with me a single disinterested friend  let unprecedented considerations excuse unprecedented conduct and if at last i err and in my error embrace my fate let it induce for my consolation and for your pity a recollection of his divine words who has benificently taught us that there is an especial providence in the fall of a sparrow  the end
