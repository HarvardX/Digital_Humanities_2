the chimera or the french way of paying national debts laid open being an impartial account of the proceedings in france for raising a paper credit and settling the mississipi stock  london printed for t warner at the blackboy in paternoster row    0 price one shilling  an impartial acccount etc it was many years ago since the french court regretted very much the hight of the public credit in england they looked upon it as the great and perhaps the only advantage that england had over them in the war namely that by the established reputatation of the public funds here and the authority of parliamentary credit whatever sum of money was voted in england though the funds did not produce it in many years and though the loans were prodigiouslp great yet the pnblick could command the money in a few days perhaps in a few hours five and twenty hundred thousand pound sterling an immense sum told out into french livres has been subscribed to the engraftment of the bank in a few hours lotteries of a million have been filled before the lottery it self could be passed in parliament and before it could be imagined possible to crowd into the office the tickets have been all subscribed and the money all immediately paid in  this was as much the terror of our neighbors as it was the honor and advantage of england and foreigners have been heard to say that there was no getting the better of england by battle no though victory was always on their side that while we had thus an inexhaustible storehouse of money no superiority in the field could be a match for this superiority of treasure for money being the basis of the war in the modern way of carrying such things on in the world it had long since been a received maxim in the case of war that the longest purse not the longest sword would be sure to conquer at last as in two mens boxing not always he that had the strongest arm but he that had the longest breath would be sure to have the better of his enemy  it was in vain that the late king of france though he had an absolute command of the greatest and at first the wealthiest nation in the world tried all the methods all the arts that human wit could invent to raise a fund of credit in his kingdom and could never bring it to pass the whole council of france could never dictate to him the method how it should be done this coy mistress called credit could never be wooed the more he pursued her or the farther he followed her the faster she fled from him and he had the continual mortification to see his national credit fall even by the same methods which made our national credit rise and as our credit here grew daily and at last increased to such a hight that from paying twelve and fourteen per cent for money and struggling with infinite difficulties to get it brought in we came to reducing the interst from six per cent to five per cent and now to have the public command of what money they pleased at four per cent and have it brought in faster than they could take it or had any occasion for it  it is not possible to set down here the schemes projects and infinite arts and secret practices which the king of france used to command credit all which were disappointed and blown up by the frequent exigences of the public affairs forcing him to violate the faith and honor of his edicts declaring such or such a fund of interest to be sacred and unalterable and not to be stopped upon any account whatever and the next year or perhaps sooner breaking through all those sacred edicts suppressing the payment and leaving the lenders to starve whereas in england one parliament always voted the making good the deficiencies of another and no misapplication of money could be made but every fund was kept sacred to its particular special appropriation so that no man whatever having lent his money to the government on the credit of a parliamentary fund has been desrauded of his property  thus the arbitrary government of the king of france the property of every man being entirely at his dispose destroyed the very reason and nature of public credit and the limited power of greatbritains crown the strings of the purse being in the hands of the parliament whose appropriations if i may be allowed to speak so plain even our kings themselves durst not break in upon has been the reason and foundation of such an immense boundless credit that nothing can hurt or destroy unless the parliament should invert their way of acting and take into their hands the same absolute power which it is their business to restrain and wound and injure themselves that is to say the people whom they represent  but fate and the fortune of france has now turned the tables upon us and we see the same arbitrary power that in the late reign in france plunged them into an insuperable debt and into an irrecoverable state of deficiency and discount i say the same arbitrary power has raised an inconceivable species of mere air and shadow realizing fancies and imaginations visions and apparitions and making the mere speculations of things act all the parts and perform all the offices of the things themselves and thus in a moment their debts are all vanished the substance is answered by the shadow and the people of france are made the instruments of putting the cheat upon themselves the name of the thing is made an equivalent to the thing it self transposing the debts from the king to themselves and being contented to discharge the public owe the money to one another  as this is the mere consequence of a boundless power in the king by which he is made able to put every scheme however impracticable in other places in a course of opperation there so that very limitation of power which is in other cases our glory and advantage is the reason why let our credit be what it will our debts remain and must be wasted or diminished off by the slow fire of parliamentary proceedings and by no other way  and thus for once in the world tyranny has the whip hand of liberty for nothing can be done in england like this even the parliament it self is limited and there are its redeemable and unredeemable funds the last of which are a burden nothing but the number ninety nine years can put an end to but in france they have an unbounded liberty to act as they please  let no man mistake me here as if i were bewailing the encumbrances of national privileges and suggesting that it was pity we should be a nation of liberty with such a burden of debt on the other hand let us be say i a free nation deep in debt rather than a nation of slaves owing nothing and indeed even in this the condition of france and england stands in a posture much to our advantage when compared together namely france a kingdom immensely rich as a government wretchedly poor as a people england a government embarrassd in debt exhausted of funds and not able easily to get out of debt but as a people immensely rich rich in the particular and private wealths of the subjects poor that is to say encumbred in debt speaking of the public state of things as a government and yet with all this while the public credit remains we can never be said to be poor but of that in another place and on another occasion  it remains now that we look into this slagrant delusion of paying a nations debts as it is practicing upon the ignorant people in france never in my opinion was any number of people so hooked in to put a sham upon themselves and then call it paying off the kings debts or the public debts for as above it is no more and no less than a parcel of fools discharging the king of his debts and owing it to one another and this is another reason of this piece of magic in france for the very want of credit in france has been the reason of their obtaining the credit of paying their debts this paradox shall be unriddled immediately thus had not the public credit been bad had not the state bills that is to say the public credit run at sixty to sixty three per cent discount the people would never have brought themselves to part with them for the bonds or shares in a new company a brat of state which has its life in the kings breath and must die whenever that breath pleases to determine it that live by the favor of the king and consequently always lives at his mercy just thus turn the tables again i say just thus stands the case in england reverst the goodness of the public credit in england is the reason why we shall never be out of debt for where is the man that haing lent his money to the public on the credit of parliamentary security will upon a whim discharge that fund and take a precarious company of private men for the money  the funds are our security and we are satisfied fully in the safety of those funds because made sacred by the authority of parliament this is our advantage who are private men and have our estates there but this is a blow to the very possibility of paying the public debts because no man is out of love with his security and because no better security can be proposed by any man  from these premises i come down to the very extraordinary mr laws a man who being first acquainted with the solid immovable state of credit in england and seeing the fluctuating manner of things in france plainly saw also how easy it was to push those things there which he could not so much as think of in england without apprehensions of being pulled in pieces by the rabble  the first thing mr laws did who wisely concluded that a foundation of credit must be laid before any sufficient project could be founded upon it i say the first thing mr laws did was to contemplate the raising a royal bank in france this he effected by the concurrence of the king whose sanction there as the parliament would be here was absolutely necessary for such a work  now let the schemes engrafted since or then designed to be engrafted upon the foot of this beginning be what they will whether knavish or sincere as i will not take upon me here to determine yet i say let it be one way or other it is evident mr laws made a right judgment and that nothing could be projected for the public service of any kind without an established credit to center some where  as i have said already it was impossible this should be granted upon the government the endeavors to bring it to pass before having been rendered abortive by the frequent exigencies of that government forcing them to break in upon themselves mortgage faith and honor royal edicts and royal promises the strongest engagements that could at that time be made by which means the few men that had any money were made cautious and were grown too wise to put it into hands which they could not depend upon for the demand of it again when it should be wanted  it remained then to resolve that credit could now be only raised upon the forming societies of private men who were masters of cash and able to support the credit they took with whom it might be safe to venture the deposite of money and who by an exact currency of payments might in consequence and by degrees obtain the name or title of a safe fund and become the center of proper credit for the whole kingdom a thing at that time greatly wanted for the advantage of trade in france as well as for the purpose designed by mr laws this almost by the nature of the thing would be called a bank and would be managed by the first adventuters in their own right and independent of the king or of any branch of the government so that except by mere plunder even all one as by rifling the city of paris the king could never lay his hand upon any thing which was put into their keeping  this was a well laid design had there been no more intended than was pretended for upon the credit and capital stock of the first subscribers there was immediately a clear prospect of a current running cash established upon just foundations and sufficient to answer all the business of france i mean such business as was fit for the managment of a bank  when this scheme was showed to the regent he was too penetrating not to see immediately that it was too beneficial a thing not to be encouraged as well for the credit of the nation in general as for the use of the government in particular and therefore received it with open arms and assured mr laws of his favor and protection but this was not all for every day giving new lights into the thing it self and new prospects arrising every day the regent who begun even then to see that there was nothing which might not be hoped for from such a design as well for the service of the government as the advantage of commerce in general and of private persons interested in it in particular for really a face of public credit was a new thing in france and had so long been desired and so often endeavored without success that it looked like a dream and that man that pretended to undertake it was like an angel come from heaven to bring them good tidings from this time forward mr laws as he well deserved was received with great distinction and admitted to such privacies as became necessary by the importance of his undertaking and as they found his first scheme fruitful of great improvement he was encouraged to apply his thoughts effectually to those improvements that something might be brought to pass for the public good and especially to restore credit to france a thing the whole kingdom but especially as a government had suffered many year for the want of  in prosecution of this confidence the bank was established the patents or charter as we would call it here were expedited for its foundation the king begins the subscription the duke regent follows and innumerable others they are empowered to take in a hundred millions original stock and to give out bills for current cash payable at demand and to the bearer just after the manner in england and from that time to this they have acted just as ours do here are managed by a court of directors for the governing daily every incident that may happen and having preserved their credit in payments inviolably it is not easy to concieve what stocks of money they have brought into their hands and to what monstrous degree of credit they are already arrived  their business is just as it is with our bank here they receive and pay vast sums of money for the king and their bills pass in the royal treasury at ready money they have built a new bureau or office and it was a prodigy not often seen in paris to see about three hundred carriages laden with silver and gold carried under the guard of a pary of dragoons through the streets to the new house where they made a large vault which they call the charter house for the keeping it safe and preserving with it their writings pledges etc  they lend money upon jewels plate and things of real value not perishable by keeping and upon mortgage of lands at three per cent interest they discount bills and take in money issuing bills of credit payable at demand and it is inconcievable the mighty increase of business they have upon their hands in so little time and the immense sums of money they have by them in specie  mr laws having thus successfully finished this great affair was at leisure to enquire what further projects might be founded upon this of a royal bank he was too knowing not to have in his head the general idea of all those things which have happened since though not perhaps of the success they have met with which i cannot but believe have exceeded his own expectation but he that knew that nothing could be done without a fund of credit first established knew also that such a fund of credit being once thoroughly established nothing could miscarry that was founded upon it for as half the projects in the world fail and become abortive for want of ready money and credit so when once a project is backed and supported with a flush of ready money they must be weak mannagers indeed if they miscarry for being well backed the execution is in a manner secured  the first thing of moment he went upon was the planting a collony in the west indies or in north america not that mr laws did not know that the planting the louisiania or the country on the river missisippi would not produce any great effects at least in his time for the settling a collony however prosperous in its beginning is a work of time and must take up not many years only but ages of years and that the utmost he could have before him in such an undertaking was to die in the faith of its success and to have the satisfaction of having his name very much talked of when he was dead  but mr laws like a man of just reach and penetration knew that two things would be absolutely necessary to his design i to have the king approve and embark in his designs and   to make his scheme popular to have something in view that should look capital have a view and prospect of success beyond not only what he could manage but even beyond what he ever intended in the proposal  having started the project of mississippi he branched it out in a different manner from all projects for he did not descend from the mississippi scheme as the general to the subsequent things as the particulars but he ascended from the mississippi scheme as a particular to a west india company as the general and a general it was fruitful of many particulars every one in themselves capable of as great things and perhaps greater than the planting the colonies of mississippi was in it self  when the company was thus formed his next work was to propose the foundation on which they were to be established and this was a subscription of stock and here he showed his first masterly stroke and that he had concerted all the steps and measures of his management from the beginning the public credit in france was still low nor did the rising credit of the royal bank add any thing to it but rather diminished it and let the world see that private credit in france might revive but public credit could not the state bills and credits annuities on the townhouse loans and all the public papers which the government had drawn the people in to part with their money to purchase were at this time exceeding low namely from    to    per cent loss and like to be more it was the eassiest thing in the world to establish a fund for any new undertaking that was but tollerablypromising where the subscribers could be allowed to subscribe these dying credits at a par and put that into stock at  00 livres which cost the purchaser but    to  0 livres per cent and this thing alone filled his subscription which at first consisted of  00 millions and was very quickly full  the first bite mr laws may be said to put upon the country was to give out by way of premio ten thousand piftoles or thereabouts at the rate of  per cent for the refusing of the mississippi or west india stock now subscribed and full at  00 livres each action for a years time this was what we call the baying of the bearskin and was a dear bear skin to those that sold it as we shall hear presently  this was the time they begun to banter mr laws some said he was mad and knew not what to do with his money others laughed at him and said he was not in england where he could hedge one way to day and another way to morrow could give in the morning and take in the afternoon and thus they took the money greedily not considering what might be hid under the management of a man whose talent they had not yet tried  i purposely pass over here the many movements which mr laws made in this part to secure to himself the advance he should get by the rise of his stock for he who had the power of adding credit to his project whenever he pleased had nothing to do but to make sure of the profits of the first rise to himself and therefore he took care to give out his whole sum as i have heard of  0000 pistoles before he set his other wheels at work and after this let us see how he went on  he had now a bank of current cash established on one hand this he has kept free and unconcerned in all adventures or projects as what might one way or other shake their credit but he kept them perfectly unincumbred always able to answer all demands upon them and to resist every shock that might be made upon them by the force of their ready money in specie none of which he would suffer to be diminished except by loans on sufficient securities and i shall give presently an account how this method was their real security and how they had been overthrown at once by the chicannry of their and his enemies if this course had not been taken of which by and by  he had on the other hand a subscription of adventurers as they might truly be called and as the nature of the thing indeed imported whose stock did not cost them much being bought as above with what cost them not above    to  0 per cent and even was not indeed very current at that price neither these therefore were fit to run any reasonable risque to embark in any probable undertaking to advance the credit of that undertaking and if possible to raise their imaginary stock for it was no more at first to a real stock of  00 livres in value for  00 livres subscription and the way how to do this therefore was the next proper business of the company to consider  the first thing to be inquired was to find out something to do something to trade in for as to planting in messissippi though that was to be kept going on as the denominating business of the whole yet it was plain that mr laws never designed a hundred millions of livres should be employed in peopleing a wilderness he therefore turns back to the king from whom he received the life of the whole and by whose authority and business all the wheels were to be set to work  the public was a large field were one man has no credit and another great credit it is easy to see who of the two should be the gainer by the other he that has no credit can do nothing without money he that has credit wants no money though he has none  a government sunk into debt and her securities bought at  0 per cent discount gives room for vast advantages where the party has money to work with in a word the business was to buy low and then bring up the price of what was bought namely to buy at  0 per cent cost and then fell at a par as we now see is since done  the king i say was their first merchant they had to deal with and these were the goods he had to sell  viz state bills of several kinds annuities interests on loans rents of the townhouse and the like and here i must observe that the performing this wonder i am now to speak of  viz of restoring the public credit so as to bring a sum so monstrously great as fifteen hundred millions and sunk so very low as from  0 to    per cent discount to be saleable at a par nay to  0  0 and  0 per cent advance for that they would have been at but mr laws himself checked it i say the entertaining a thought that such a scheme was practicable and laying a scheme to do it was as great a testimony of mr laws genius and capacity as the performance has been of his good fortune  it was a sea so full of dangerous shoals and rocks so subject to sudden storms and hurricanes in a word so threatening of certain shipwreck that no pilot but this alone would ever have ventured to have launched out in it  but we must cease the wondering and go back beyond wonder it self mr laws had begun well the bank was established and began to gain upon the world the credit of it as i have already observed appeared openly and seemed to be invulnerable it was founded upon a substantial basis nay indeed the only basis that could support public credit  viz it always had the money in specie and in its own keeping sufficient to answer all demands upon this almost any thing might be undertaken  but here i must not only give another instance of the masterly genius of mr laws the contriver of all these things but must let the world see that as no design however good in it self and adapted for the general good of our country can be without enemies envy constantly opposing itself to the best designs so it was here this bank had a formidable attack made upon it by a set of merchants in paris some said they were jews of amsterdam others that they were dutch merchants dwelling in paris and others that they were french be that as it will possibly they might be some of all the three sorts for it could not be done by a few the sum they appeared with being no less than twenty five millions the plot in a few words was to muster up a large number of bills to be demanded altogether and if possible to give a blow to the credit in a word and to express it in our terms to make a run upon the bank the particulars of the story are related thus  it was a little after the first advance of the credit of the royal bank at paris of which mr laws was the principal director as he really was the father and author of it some merchants in paris it was reported to be a plot originally laid at amsterdam or more properly in holland whether it was so or not we do not affirm but this is certain that they were chiefly dutch merchants who appeared in it at paris we say some merchants at paris having some time before concerted their measures to give a blow to the bank treasured up a number of bank bills to the sum of twenty five millions as some say others twenty two millions of livres and appear altogether though in several forms as of separate persons and interest at the bank just at the same hour to demand the money for those bills  the clarks at the bank surpised with the appearance of so many eminent merchants and with such great demands answered that they should be paid but desired them to wait a little till they could send to mr laws the director that they might have his orders how to proceed in paying them accordingly they immediately acquainted mr laws with the thing he paused a while at the thing and without any supprize after a little consideration bid them go back and tell the merchants they should all be paid and bid the clarks begin the payment and to pay them all in lowes dors or pistoles and that he would come immediately to the office which he did having first been to tell the regent his scheme and had the assistance of the royal treasury and of the general farmers for about one hundred fifty thousand pistoles in specie if he had wanted them which however he did not  accordingly the clarks begun the payment and it held till the next day afternoon by which time as we have the story an edict was procured and actually made public to reduce the lowis dors from    to    livres which loss fell instantly upon the merchants while they had above a million and a quarter of pistoles in their hands in specie and the bank having stood its ground had most of those pistoles in their csh again in a few days  this was a home thrust at the bank but as it was parryd with so much art and the loss of it turned upon the contrivers it established the very foundation which it was formed to shake and gave such a credit not only to the bank but to mr laws the principal manager and director in that exigence that it secured them both from any future attempts of that nature it also let the world see that not only they were strong in the substance of their cash and able to answer all demands and not only that they had a superior genius at the head of their management which was always able to counteract their projects but that they had the government hard and fast to support them upon all occasions and this indeed was such a foundation that when the mississipi or west india company was first formed it was apparent that though there was little or nothing in the thing itself yet there were other engraftments to be made upon it by the government that it could not miss of success and that in a word that mississipi was only the name but that the thing was intended to be a fund of credit upon which the sinking fortunes of the government were to rise again  the first thing we found gave life to the company was the coinage the next was the farm of tobacco either of these were things of a magnitude sufficient to have given credit to any new fund but seemed to be but trifes in the hand of the company who apparently aimed at the general management of the revenues of france however as the undertaking of the coinage was a vast thing in its nature so the manner of the contract the prudence with which the company engaged in it the visible advantage which the company would make by it and above all the advance which they were to make to the king for it were such great things that it startled the world and they began to talk of the west india company as of an opulent powerful body that being headed by an enterprising man who apparently had undertaken what never man before him undertook and perfectly understood what he had undertaken had more in it than was at first imagined and would arrive to some greater hight than had been thought possible  upon these thoughts and the reputation of the companys undertaking beginning to be popular every body enquired into it and the farther they looked into it the better they began to like it and this set people first upon buying the stock and the number of the yers by the mere nature of the thing would rise the value  now it appeared every day more and more that mr laws had laid his measures right when he gave away his pistoles as i have said above to have the refusal of the stock at  00 per cent for on a sudden the stock jumpt up to par and in three or four days more to   0 had mr laws stayed the full time and not demanded the stock till it was advanced as we now see it risen he must in all probability have lost the advantage he had due to him seeing very few of the persons he had contracted with would have been able to make good a difference of a stock risen from under a hundred to a thousand but as he showed his moderation in demanding the stock within the advance of about  00 per cent the persons who lost that money to him were soon made amends if they had any stock by finding it still rising upon their hands to a prodigious degree in a few days  we must take the liberty to make a digression here to the volatile temper of the french nation whose levity only can account for what we are now to take notice of and the warmth of the french temper must indeed be answerable for the running up an imaginary stock for except about    or  0 livres upon a  00 in the first subscription it was no other to such a sudden and such an unaccountable extravagant hight  this warmth of the french temper which prompts them to push things up to the extremity was certainly the reason i mean the original reason of the sudden advance of these things for as yet there was no weight in the things themselves that could bear any proportion to the new credit they assumed the company had indeed engaged with the government and had taken the coinage of the king as above and in nine years it was calculated they would get near fifty millions by their contract provided also the government kept their word with them and made no new alterations in the coin to their detriment but even this in an arbitrary administration such as that of france is known to be was not so certain but that the risque of it was worth something to ensure and all the doubt that could be justly raised on that head pleaded in abatement to the credit of the company  it must therefore i say be placed to the account of the sluttering rash disposition of the people of france that a thing who had yet no farther or greater prospect than that of the coinage should in a few days mount up its credit to near  00 per cent upon the value  but as we are immediately to see things more prodigious than this let us discharge our selves of this particular first that we may clear things as they go the arret for granting to the company the coinage as above will fully describe the circumstances of their contract and the view of advantages they had by it and therefore i cannot go on till i have given it at large as follows  july         extract of the registers of the council of state the king having by his letters patents of the month of august      established a trading company under the name of the west company and by his edict in may last reunited to the said company the trade of the east india china etc his majesty sees with satisfaction that that company takes the best measures for securing the success of its establishment that they send a great number of inhabitants to the country of louisiana which was granted them that many private persons make settlements in that colony and send thither husbandmen tillers and other handicraftmen to manure and improve the land sow corn plant tobacco breed silkworms and do whatever is necessary to improve that country furthermore his majesty being informed that the india company is at great charges for transporting the said inhabitants and furnishing the colony with meal and other necessaries till the land afford a sufficient quantity of provision for their subsistence that the said company sends thither all sorts of goods and merchandise to render the life of the inhabitants more comfortable and that for preventing abuses too frequent in colonies they have taken care to settle the price thereof at a moderate rate by a general tariff which they have sent thither to be affixed in their storehouses and magazines that they have ordered the biasters or pieces of eight to be received by their officers on the foot of five livres and the other silver bullion in proportion which dispositions have appeared so wise and necessary that his majesty has resolved to favor the execution thereof and knowing that the exchanging of goods not being sufficient to carry on commerce to its full extent and that it is necessary in the beginning of establishments of this nature to give them all possible protection and countenance his majesty has resolved to supply the said company with a sum of bank bills to enable the inhabitants of louisiana to trade amongst themselves and bring into france the fruits of their labor economy and industry without any risque or charge and his majesty being willing to indemnify the said company for the price of the pieces of eight in the louisina and for the expenses they are at for the establishment and support of that colony he has thought fit to order all the pieces of eight and other bullion that shall be imported by the said company from the louisiana to be received at his mints at their full value therefore his majesty being in the council with the advice of monsieur the duke of orleans regent has ordered and orders etc  the articles of this arrest are to the following effect   that the treasurer of the bank shall deliver to the india company the sum of twenty five millions of livres in bank bills taking a receipt of the cashier of the said company to be sent to the louisiana   that in order that the said bills be distinguished from others the numbers shall be kept by the treasurer of the bank and the said bills shall be sealed with the seal of the india company instead of the seal of the bank   that the said bills being returned to france shall be paid as well as other bank bills by the receivers of the kings revenues and afterward acquitted by the cashier of the company and by him brought to the treasurer of the bank who shall deliver them new bank bills to be sent to the louisiana to the value of the others   the owners of the said bills must take the precaution to indorse them that they may not be paid to any other but such who are to receive the payment thereof but in case they are lost by shipwreck or stolen etc the owner upon making a declaration thereof to the cashier of the company who is to enter the number of the bills lost or supposed to be lost shall receive the value thereof at the expiration of five years according to the declaration of the  th of december        and in order to indemnify the said company for the charges they are at for settling the plantations in louisiana and for the prices they give for the pieces of eight his majesty orders that the said pieces of eight brought from those plantations be received at his mint at the rate of sixty livres per mark and in case of alteration in the price of the coin of the kingdom the value of the said pieces of eight shall be paid weight for weight in the species that shall be coined or reformed without any diminution for the charges thereof and thereof as to the other bullion the same shall be received and paid at the mint at the same price as the pieces of eight upon producing a certificate from the general directors of the said company that the said pieces of eight and other bullion were shipped off in the country of louisiana and belong to the said company done in the council of state july          signed fleurian  july         abstract of the registers of the council of state the king having ordered in council his edict in may      whereby new species of gold and silver are ordered to be made to be laid before him and his majesty being informed that besides the good effects the coining thereof has produced other considerable advantages may be expected from the particular attention to be given to its continuation among the several proposals that have been made to him on this matter none has appeared more advantageous than the proposition of the directors of the india company who offer to pay to his majesty fifty millions of livres in specie in fifteen equal successive payments from month to month the first beginning on the first of october next and the last the first of december    0 upon condition that the said company shall enjoy for nine years together to begin from the first of august next the benefit and advantage arising from the old species and bullion that shall be brought to the kings mints to be coined into new species his majesty is so much the more inclined to accept the proposals of the said company because they may better and more and conveniently than private men import species and bullion out of foreign countries and that consequently they may get a greater advantage thereby than his majesty could get if the coinage of the new species was continued upon his own account and furthermore considering that the profit that will arise out of the same will be divided between great numbers of his majestys subjects concerned in the said company and that a supply so certain and ready will enable his majesty to pay the arrears of pensions and other expenses his majesty with the advice of monsieur the duke of orleans regent has ordained and ordains as follows  this arrest contains four articles which are to this effect   his majesty accepts the offer made by the india company of the sum of fifty millions of livres to be paid in fifteen successive months to begin from the first of october next at the rate of           livres   pence   deniers per month and orders that the same be brought to his royal treasury and that the receipt given by the keeper thereof be a sufficient discharge to the said company without being accountable to the chamber of accounts   besides the said sum of fifty millions the company is to be at all the charges of the coinage remittance etc such as the king does actually pay   up on these conditions the king grants to the said company all the profits and advantages that shall accrue from the coining into new species of gold and silver in his mints the old species of france the species of foreign countries and bullion that shall be imported what sum soever they may amount to on the foot and manner regulated by the edict of may      for nine years together to begin from the first of august next   his majesty declares that during the said nine years he will not make any augmentation in the price of the species nor lessen the standard of his coin upon any pretense whatsoever and that in case of any diminution he will lower the bullion and old species proportionably done in the council of state july          it was some weeks that the credit of the company fed upon this undertaking and mr laws who prudently gave every thing time to work let it run on some time upon this view only till the people began to talk a little dubious about it that it was true the company would get money by the coinage but it must be in a length of time and that this was not so considerable that the stock should mount up to such a hight upon that advantage only  when these things began to be the subject of discourse mr laws began to think of playing another mine for i am to suppose all along this gentleman to have built his whole fabric in his imagination at once and to have digested every part even from the beginning in his thoughts but resolved to bring every thing about by just degrees and to give every thing that he started into the world its full scope to extend it self to the utmost  on a sudden then for all his motions were like mines sprung from beneath not the least notice being given of any thing till it burst out like a sudden fire i say on a sudden he declares at his levee which now began to be as great as that of a public minister that the king had united the east india company to that of mississippi or the west india and immediately after that is to say the next morning an arret of the kings council appeared by which the two com panies were united and the stock of the east india company ingrafted into the other company as by the arret it self is best explained and which has in it several clauses infinitely to the advantage of the company in trade as well as in credit though even in this conjunction and all the advantages of a commerce to the east indies increased as they might be able to increase it were in themselves but remote things and could produce no great things for some years to come and therefore could not be an addition of an intrinsic worth on which to raise such an immense inexpressible fund of credit as immediately appeared but let us go on gradually and first look into the arret it self that we may the better judge of what it is the company enjoy and what they ought to be valued at upon that particular account the arret is as follows  extract of the registers of the council of state upon the representation made to the king in council by directors of the india company in name of the said company that if the king was pleased to vacate and make void the lease or contract of the general farms made in favor of aymart lambert for fix years which begun on the first of october      and of which the first year will expire on the first of october next and to substitute the said company in the of the said lambert under the name of such person as they shall think fit under the security of the company for the remaining five years of the lease aforesaid and to grant to the said company four other years which will make a lease of nine years to begin from the first of october next and end on the first of october      with power to the said company to continue or vacate the leases made by the said lambert as they shall think fit the said company will give over and above what was given by the said lambert three millions five hundred thousand livres for every year during the said term of nine years insomuch that instead of forty eight millions five hundred thousand livres the said lambert paid every year for the said general farms the said company will pay yearly fifty two millions and besides will perform all the clauses and conditions contained in the lease granted to the said lambert that the better to show to his majesty the desire of the said india company to contribute by their credit to the ease of the state they offer to lend to the king twelve hundred millions of livres at the yearly interest of three per cent to be employed toward the reimbursing and redeeming the perpetual rents or annuities and other debts assigned on the aids and gabells the tailles the general receipts of the revenues the comptrolling or registring of acts passed by notaries and exploits and on the revenues of the post office together with the reimbursements of the rents or shares on the farms the statebills bills of the common cash and the sums advanced for the offices already suppressed or to be suppressed which are not or shall not be assigned upon any one fund in particular that in order to enable the said company to advance the said twelve hundred millions of livres his majesty is desired to authorize and empower the said company to borrow twelve hundred millions of livres for which they will deliver out shares of rents to the bearer to be paid by the said company or contracts of annuities or rents at the yearly interest of three per cent which shall be advanced to them and paid by the cashier of the company to begin from the first of january next following the order of the numbers of the shares and the date of the contracts that after the company had furnished the twelve hundred millions aforesaid commissioners appointed by his majesty for that purpose shall make and deliver to the said company one or more contracts of perpetual rent at three per cent per annum for the sum of twelve hundred millions of livres aforesaid which rents shall be assigned on the general farms to begin from the first of january    0 that therefore the said company shall reserve and keep in their own hands the annual sum of thirty six millions of livres for the payment of the said rents or annuities during the term of the nine years of their lease and after the expiration thereof the farmers of the general farms shall be obliged in case the company does not renew and continue their lease to pay to the said india company the said thirty six millions of livres every year by monthly payments at the rate of three millions per month and lastly his majesty is desired to be pleased to grant the continuation for fifty years of all the privileges that have been granted to the said company and of those granted to the several companies that have been reunited to it whereupon the king in his council with the advice of monsieur the duke of orleans regent has accepted and accepts the offers of the india company to his majesty etc and in consideration thereof has ordained and ordrans etc the arrest contains seven articles whereby all the demands of the company are granted and their privileges are continued for fifty years which are to end on the first of january    0 upon condition that the company shall fully pay all the debts of the old company both in france and the indies etc  it is not to be expressed with what surprise and even astonishment the world looked on at these steps of mr laws his fame for an enterprizing man was now established and those who had before run pretty much upon his crdit and talked to his prejudice among the common people began to say now he was vne habile homme and that he was capable of great things for the noise of this new east india company spread like a clap of thunder far and wide and people began to see a new world of profit attending it the east india trade being carried on in great britain and in holland to such a magnitude and to so much advantage as we all know it to be done  all this while the on looking world regarded in their calculations nothing but the profits of trade and the advantages the company might make by great returns having a capital stock and a good economy in their affairs keeping their eyes upon the number of ships to be sent annually to the east indies the extent of their colonies and plantations in the louisiana and on the banks of the mississppi what rents in time shall accrue to the stock and what annual incoms the company would receive whereby they would be enabled to make dividends propottiond to   0 per cent upon their subscriptions as they were then advanced not imagining what was yet behind  but mr laws whose views lay another way regarded all these things only as they tended to raise fund of credit at home which was from the beginning the point he aimed at leaving all other things to work their own way not but the remotest prospects concurred to answer the same end and a complication of advantages however remote served to bring about the great point viz the making the credit of the whole to rise beyond imagination and sufficient to answer all the great things he had still in view  the stock was now risen to an excessive hight from     to   0 per cent and now was the time for mr laws to let the world see what a fund of credit is able to do and to make good the undoubted maxim that a fund of credit is a fund of money and able to make it self equal to all the money in the world for now was the time to strike the blow that coup declat which should surprise and astonish the world and which will for ever be spoken of as an action that the world never heard of the like before  nor did mr laws bring it out all at once but suffered it to be discoursed of gradually that the company was about to take upon them the management of the kings revenue in a few days after for mr laws never suffered the town to be master of his measures before they were ripe but it had not been long spoken of that the company would take upon them the management of the revenue when at once just as before and arrest was published dissolving the leases of the general farmers of the revennue though their leases had five years to run and vesting the whole collection in the new eastindsa company  as an inducement to this the company undertake to increase the payment to the king no less than four millions a year a sum too considerable not to be vallued but at the end of this comes a clause which none but such a man as mr laws could have ventured upon a thing posterity will look back upon as a romance and which no history can give any thing like it namely the paying the kings debts that is to say the company to take upon them at once the discharging all the kings debts upon whatsoever doubtful funds upon whatever precarious circumstances they stood whatever discounts they were at all are to be transferred at once from the royal treasury where they would never have been able to discharge them to the treasury of the company where they are to be paid at demand  two things make this undertaking a prodigy of management the like of which was never heard of before   the kings debts amounted to about fifteen hundred millions   the company had not any fund of money or the value of money to pay them with   but before i go on i must go back to the arrests or proclamations directing the execution of this unparalled contract which by mistake is already placed page    but should have come in here  here is such a blow struck as the world never heard of before and in this very stroke we may behold the power of credit and what immense structures may be built and mr laws has built upon this single foundation by which he has restored a government overwhelmed with debt and which was turned bankrupt to the people and has delivered a nation oppressed with taxes in such a manner and in so short a time that posterity will never believe the relation but will all look like a fable or romance in their eyes  the arret or act of the kings council above mentioned for the settling this point tells us expressly what the company are to do and expresses the sum which they are to lend the king for the doing it  viz that they should lend the king twelve hundred millions of livres at   per cent and afterward they added three millions more for the paying off all the public debts and strictly ties them down to so punctual a discharge of those debts and of all the sallaries of the officers etc that it shall be wholly in the choice of the persons who are to be paid whether they will accept of the companys bonds or have their ready money paid them but the arrets do not at all meddle with the method by which the company shall raise such an infinite mass of money to pay but supposes the money shall all be actually ready in cash in specie to pay only gives the company power to borrow such a sum that is to say if any one will lend it for they do not oblige any one to lend much less to accept the companys security for the debt for that would but have been exchanging the government for the company and leaving the debt still in being  nor on the other hand was here the least consideration to the company for so great an advantage to the government as that of clearing them at once of all the public debts had the company reserved but the small advantage of one per cent on the interest as they were empowered to borrow the   00 millions at   per cent had the government paid   per cent which had been just   per cent gain there had been then some visible profit  viz there had been twelve millions per annum in the companys pocket to have enabled them or helped at least to make some proportioned dividends to the monstrous advance of their stock  but the whole scene may be one continued prodigy they seek no advantage they demand no more than three per cent and propose to borrow if they want it at three per cent acting in every part of it upon the foundation of public service without gain to themselves  but neither is this all for we shall presently see them not only take no surplus of interest no gain of interest more than they pay but we shall see the credit rising to an immense hight and the company growing powerful by the assistance of the government and the management of mr laws their director i say we shall see the following mysteries or indeed miracles wrought in the compass of a few weeks things as incredible as the greatest impossibility in nature could be thought to be things which now they are done they are as a dream even to those that see them even the people who have the money in their hands and who has received their ancient debts fo long given over so effectually despaired of they look amazed and consider again and again whether they are awake or asleep they handle it weigh it and roll it about as if they would try whether it is really gold or air whether there is no magic no necromancy in it or not and i am told of one to whom the government owed ten thousand crowns which he would have been glad to have sold for two thousand five hundred being an arrear for secret service only that caused an iron chest to be bought and put the money into it then drove posts into the ground in his cellar and chained the iron chest down to the stakes then chained it also to the wall and barricadoed the doors and window of the cellar with iron and all for fear not of thieves to steal the money but for fear the money chest and all should fly away into the air for he said he could never believe it was money but to return to the particulars which i say have been done by this company subsequent to this new arret of paying the public debts we have seen them since that do strange things indeed    we have seen them bring the people to refuse payment or decline payment of what they would before have given half the debt to be secured of   the state bills that were before little better than wast paper made worth  0 per cent and  0 per cent above par   we have seen them gain thirteen hundred and fifty millions of money in less than a months time by selling the air and putting a real value upon an imaginary value   we have seen the kings revenue augmented to millions a year by abating the taxes to the people   we have seen the general farms raised four millions a year to the king and yet twelve millions a year paid less by the people   we have seen them pay fifteen hundred millions of debt for the king without one penny of money   lastly we have seen a private gentleman raise himself by the dexterity of this management to be the greatest subject in the world to have all the nobility the princes the public ministers and even the government it self at his beck and above  00 coaches in a morning at his levee himself behaving with all the modesty and humility imaginable not elevated by his good fortune not hurried or discomposed by the application to so much business but calm and cool always present to himself answering briefly and pertinently to every new discourse receiving six or seven hundred gentlemen in a morning dispatching every business with a readiness inimimitable perfectly composed and retired and every day producing new wonders in the great affair of the public which is upon his hands i return to the stock and the proceeding of the company as the advantages of public business thus flowed in the credit of the stock necessarily advanced and we were surpised in england to find that every post the price started up whole hundreds in a day till at length we saw the stock up at    0 per cent   00 and since that to  0 0 per cent  now was the juncture of mr laws to give the blow he had in view the multitude of people who came every hour to paris and run their money into the stock made his project not rational only but natural viz that they might enlarge the capital stock by engrafting a farther subscription and that the new subscribers might have encouragement to subscribe they should be allowed to subscribe at  000 livres each original stock  pursuant to this resolution an arrest was published empowering the company to take new subscriptions upon the first foot of the stock for  0 millions the subcribers paying  0000 livres each and that i may explain it as i go you are to understand that for the ten thousand livres the subscribers has credit in the companies books for one action or share that is to say for one hundred livres original stock  this being the case it is easy to calculate what the companys gain by by this new subscription but of that in its place in the mean time it is to observed that so eager were the people to throng in their money into the stock that they were ready to tread one another to death to get to the books and it was the greatest favor in the world to be admitted so that the books were not only filled up in about six hours but if there had been room for two hundred millions it would have been filled up at the same time  no sooner was the subscription declared full and no more hands to be taken but those who could not get in their money falls to work with those that had and buy of them part of what they had subscribed and this raised the price so that the new stock rise immediately  00 per cent even the same day that it was subscribed  as this had been closed with so eagerly and with so much ardour by the people mr laws who knew very well how to make his advantage of the temper of the people obtains a second order for  0 millions more and in a word had it filled with the same eagerness and forwardness as before and after this a third of  0 millions the arrest of these subscriptions are public in our papers and will show something of the proof of what i have affirmed of the forwardness of subscribers they are indeed too long to be copied here neither is it of great use to us to see the form which is only what is usual in the public acts on like occasions  it is now proper to examine what immense gain accrues to the company by these subscriptions as also the original stock as then advanced i begin with the subscriptions which as above were taken in at a  000 livres upon each  00 livres original stock  if then the subscription was for fifty millions stock at  00 livres each subscription this advanced to a  000 livres each stock amounts to no less than  00 millions of livres so that the company receiving  000 millions of livres for  0 millions original stock advance and are clear gainers by the subscription no less than   0 millions of livres and this doubled by the second subscription of  0 millions make the companys gain amount to  00 millions of livres and that to a third it makes it    0 millions  add to this the first stock of the company was much of it subscribed by the government itself by the king by mr laws as in the companys name and being sold since at  000 and   00 per cent has put as i am credibly informed above  00 millions into their pockets besides what mr laws is said to have gained for his private account  it will now be no longer a wonder how and with what coin the company should undertake to pay off   00 millions of debt or how they could begin to pay as was the case four months before the appointed time for here is    0 millions clearly gained tout dune coup at one blow to go on upon the payment with whenever they pleased besides what was to come and no body then doubted but that mr laws would set up a third subscription but he found it convenient to stop here for the present and not only not to take a farther subscription but to put that out of doubt he obtained a public arret declaring that there should be no new subscriptions granted  but in this new experiment mr laws found himself a little embarrassd for there being such a run for their new subscriptions there were consequently no buyers or fewer buyers than before for the old stock every one having as we say in england a penny for a new shop neither was this all but as the new subscribers paid but  00 livres down upon their subscription the rest being allowed to be paid in by qual payments in nine months  00  per month it was with much  scribd because they paid as   00 livres for an action  bought an old one was obliged to pay  000 livres down this carried away the buyers from the old stock but this likewise was not all for those who had a mind to subscribe to the new stock on purpose to sell out again and jobb them about sold out the old stock because for two old actions for which when sold the seller received  000 livres he might with that money subscribe or buy subscriptions for  0 shares or actions in the new and laying down the first payment get to quinquampoix street the exchangealley of paris and selling them again at   00 livres each put  000 livres in his pocket and be just where he was  these things had their influence upon the old stock and there being abundance wanted to sell and few to buy the price fell at once and indeed began to fall so considerably that from    0 it fell to   0 which was a threatening article but mr laws gave a new life to it all at once for he perceiving it and knowing it would run too fast for him to stop it if it was not taken in time applied an immediate remedy to it which could not fail to answer his end this was to publish and fix it up at the door of the bank and at other public places of the city that the company would take in all the old shares that any man was willing to part with at  00 livres per share  this was another testimony of the masterly genius of mr laws for as soon as ever this publication was made the old stock mounted again and sold currently for  0 0 and  0 0 or thereabout no body coming or but few to sell them  thus he warded off the blow but this was one reason why he durst not venture to form any additional subscriptions and a good reason too but from this time forward the stock is grown up to a prodigy of  0 0 per cent it is true it has sunk a little on the approach of the time of payment for the first three months which is to be paid in the first of january viz  00 livres per share and this for want of money has sunk the stock to about    0 but mr law that never wants a remedy for these diseases immediately calls a meeting of the directors and agrees to declare a dividend of profits to amount to   per cent upon the stock which though it be a trif on the present advanced price yet was really considerable in it self and amounts to a very great sum no less than six millions and upwards however it is agreed that the company have really gained near  00 millions extraordinary by selling her own subscriptions and buying and selling her own stock so that they may very easily divide  0 per cent on the  st stock which would have been   per cent upon the present advance but of this hereafter this is a brief account of the prodigious rise and greatness of the east india stock and of its present state and condition  it remains to give some account of its progress and the steps mr law is taking to establish the trade which it has in view for though indeed the trading part has been the least of mr laws design yet as it is the denominating quallity of the company and they are called the mississippi and east india company he pushes this part also  the proceeding of the mississippi part is partly seen in the arret of the council misplaced by mistake page    and which ought to have been placed here wherein the bank gives or rather lends the company    millions in bankbills for small sums to be current in the colony of louisania or mississippi and partly in the multitude of people which are every day all for planting sent thither  as for the east india trade we find them launching out into a prodigious trade that way and sending out about twenty ships with soldiers and vast cargoes to make settlements and place factories in the east indies and all the twenty ships to come home laden with things proper for the trade they are upon  these are great things it must be confessed but as i have said these are not the chief end in view mr laws aims are at popularity and keeping up the imaginary part which is raised to such a degree as the profit of ten east india trades could not support and which never can be supported without something that can bring in a profit equal to   or   per cent per annum upon the  000 per cent which it stands advanced  to bring this to pass we find he does every thing and the government in his behalf does every thing that can recommend them to the people and particularly acts of generous charity public spirited muneficence taking off the heavy taxes upon the ordinary necessaries of life and convenience by which the poor who are more senfible of those things are touched and engage to bless both the person and the undertaking  innumerable projects are in his head for public good he has already caused all the turnpikes and tolebars at the entrance into the streets of paris to be taken down an innumerable number of collectors and officers that teizd the poor for money upon every trifle that enter the city of paris are  missed the people pay nothing  coals or wood or turff to hay or oats or straw for horses flesh or fish herbs or garden stuff and fruits or wine to drink all things go free into paris so that the families live a fifth part cheaper than they did before the very duty on fish which is now abolished brought in to the king two millions a year but now as the rents of the townhouse of paris are reimbursed and they have no more annuities to pay they have likewise no taxes to levy and all is made free  besides these things which are the consequence of paying the public debts he has new projects of so many kinds that it would require a large book to give an account of them  he has undertaken a new canal from the river loyer to the seine to bring more water into the latter by the river loyng and answerable to the canal de briare so to bring vessels of large burdens down those rivers and bring wine and brandy and all bulky goods quite from nants in bretaign and from the sea as well as from the inland country about orleans  he has laid a scheme to reduce the river seine to a narrower channel between paris and roan that so the channel may be deepend and kept clear by which means ships of good burden shall come up even to paris it self and to roan ships of  00 tuns burden shall come freely up to the town key  he has designed to make roan the capital of all france for commerce navigation and manufactures all his east india and mississipi tradede shall be carried on there and the magazines warehouses and places for public sales shall be fixed and built there and as the city of roan itself is not sufficient for the number of people that will be drawn together by these things and by the woollen manufactures and silk manufactures which he designs to settle there he has projected as fame reports a new city on the other side the seine over against roan and a stone bridge of a most magnificent structure and which must be prodigious strong the water there being very deep and rapid  this tract would be far too short to give a full scheme even of this one design a thing of such a magnitude as no private man ever undertook or any stock less than that of a prince or of a nation accomplished  but all these things seem to me to be rather amusements to alarm the world and make the company famous among foreigners than that they are to be really executed  and they have their end for foreigners are amused and all the world seems to be running to paris the prodigious sums strangers lay out in the stock and the numbers that come to negotiate there has filled paris with money and with people and consequently with trade and they tell us there is nothing to be seen but new coaches new equipages new liveries and buying new furniture innumerable families having been enriched by this surprising advance of stock in a word they write from thence that there are   00 new coaches set up in paris and half a million of people come to the city more than was there before so that no lodgings are to be had and they build new houses and streets in every place where they have room  when i begun this work it was not possible to imagine but i might have given some account of the ebb as i have of the flood of this phantosme for i can call it yet no more its fate without question must come ere long since there is no foundation equal to the structure that now stands upon it  but the time is not yet the little decrease or fall which happened a few days ago is not of the kind of that which must blow up the machine but it stopped as above by the appearance of an approaching dividend of profits but this cannot support it long it must fall at last and all i can say of it at present can be only this that when it comes great will be the fall of it  finis
