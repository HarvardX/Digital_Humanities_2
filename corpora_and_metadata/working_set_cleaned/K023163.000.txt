of the knowledge and characters of men  an epistle to the right honorable richard lord viscount cobham  london printed in the year mdccxxxiv  an epistle to the right honorable richard lord visct cobham yes you despise the man to books confined who from his study rails at human kind though what he learns he speaks and may advance some general maxims or be right by chance the coxcomb bird so talkative and grave that from his cage cries cuckold whore and knave though many a passenger he rightly call you hold him no philosopher at all and yet the fate of all extremes is such men may be read as well as books too much to observations which our selves we make we grow more partial for the observers sake to written wisdom as anothers less maxims are drawn from notions those from guess there is some peculiar in each leaf and grain some unmarked fiber or some varying vein shall only man be taken in the gross grant but as many sorts of mind as there are above  00 sorts of moss observed by naturalists moss that each from other differs first confess next that he varies from himself no less add natures customs reasons passions strife and all opinions colors cast on life yet more the difference is as great between the optics seeing as the objects seen all manners take a tincture from our own or come discolored through our passions shown or fancys beam inlarges multiplies contracts inverts and gives ten thousand dies our depths who fathoms or our shallows finds quick whirs and shifting eddies of our minds lifes stream for observation will not stay it hurries all too fast to mark their way in vain sedate reflections we would make when half our knowledge we must snatch not take on human actions reason though you can it may be reason but it is not man his principle of action once explore that instant it is his principle no more like following life through creatures you dissect you lose it in the moment you detect often in the passions wild rotation tossed our spring of action to our selves is lost tired not determined to the last we yield and what comes then is master of the field as the last image of that troubled heap when sense subsides and fancy sports in sleep though past the recollection of the thought becomes the stuff of which our dream is wrought something as dim to our internal view is thus perhaps the cause of all we do in vain the grave with retrospective eye would from the apparent what conclude the why infer the motive from the deed and show that what we chanced was what we meant to do behold if fortune or a mistress frowns some plunge in business others shave their crowns to ease the soul of one oppressive weight this quits an empire that embroils a state the same adust complexion has impelled charles v philip ii charles to the convent philip to the field not always actions show the man we find who does a kindness is not therefore kind perhaps prosperity becalmed his breast perhaps the wind just shifted from the east not always humble he who seeks retreat pride guides his steps and bids him shun the great who combats bravely is not therefore brave he dreads a deathbed like the meanest slave who reasons wisely is not therefore wise his pride in reasoning not in acting lies but grant that actions best discover man take the most strong and sort them as you can the few that glare each character must mark you balance not the many in the dark what will you do with such as disagree suppress them or miscal them policy must then at once the character to save a plain rough hero turn a crafty knave alas in truth the man but changed his mind perhaps was sick in love or had not dined ask how from britain caesar made retreat caesar perhaps had told you he was beat the mighty czar what moved to wed a punk the mighty czar might answer he was dunk but sage historians it is your task to prove one action conduct one heroic love it is from high life high characters are drawn a saint in crape is twice a saint in lawn a judge is just a chanclor juster still a gownman learned a bishop what you will wise if a minister but if a king more wise more learned more just more every thing courtvirtues bear like gems the highest rate born where heavens influence scarce can penetrate in lifes low vale the soil the virtues like they please as beauties here as wonders strike though the same sun with alldiffusive rays blush in the rose and in the diamond blaze we prize the stronger effort of his power and always set the gem above the flower it is education forms the vulgar mind just as the twig is bent the trees inclined boastful and rough your first son is a squire the next a tradesman meek and much a liar tom struts a soldier open bold and brave will sneaks a scrivner an exceeding knave is he a churchman then he is fond of power a quaker fly a presbyterian sour a smart freethinker all things in an hour true some are open and to all men known others so very close they are hid from none so darkness fills the eye no less than light thus gracious chandos is beloved at sight and every child hates shylock though his soul still sits at squate and peeps not from its hole at half mankind when generous manly raves all know it is virtue for he thinks them knaves when universal homage umbra pays all see it is vice and itch of vulgar praise who but detests the endearments of courtine while one there is who charms us with his spleen but these plain characters we rarely find though strong the bent yet quick the turns of mind here puzzling contraries confound the whole there affectations quite reverse the soul the dull flat falsehood serves for policy and in the cunning truth itselfs a lie unthought of frailties cheat us in the wise the fool lies hid in inconsistencies see the same man in vigor in the gout alone in company in place or out early at business and at hazard late mad at a foxchase wise at a debate drunk at a borough civil at a ball friendly at hackney faithless at whitehall catius is ever moral ever grave thinks who endures a knave is next a knave save just a dinner  then prefers no doubt a rogue with venson to a saint without who would not praise patritios high desert his hand unstained his uncorrupted heart his comprehensive head all interests weighed all europe saved yet britain not betrayed he thanks you not his pride was in piquette newmarketfame and judgment at a bett what made say montagne or more sage charron otho a warrior cromwell a buffoon a perjured prince a leaden saint revere a godless regent tremble at a star the throne a bigot keep a genius quit faithless through piety and dupd through wit europe a woman child or dotard rule and just her ablest monarch made a fool know god and nature only are the same in man the judgment shoots at flying game a bird of passage lost as soon as found now in the moon perhaps now under ground ask mens opinions j   n now shall tell how trade increases and the world goes well strike off his pension by the setting sun and britain if not europe is undone manners with fortunes humors change with climes tenets with books and principles with times judge we by nature habit can efface interest overcome or policy take place by actions those un certainty divides by passions these dissimulation hides affections they still take a wider range find if you can in what you cannot change it is in the ruli ng passion there alone the wild are constant and the cunning known the fool consistent and the false sincere priests princes women no dissemblers here this clue once found unravels all the rest the prospect clears and clodio stands confessed clodio the scorn and wonder of our days whose ruling passion was the lust of praise born with whatever could win it from the wise women and fools must like him or he dies though wondering senates hung on all he spoke the club must hail him master of the joke shall parts so various aim at nothing new he will shine a tully and a wilmot too then turns repentant and his god adores with the same spirit that he drinks and whores enough if all around him but admire and now the punk applaud and now the fryr thus with each gift of nature and of art and wanting nothing but an honest heart grown all to  from no one vice exempt and most contemptible to shun contempt his passion still to covet general praise his life to forfeit it a thousand ways his constant bounty no one friend has made his angel tongue no mortal can persuade a fool with more of wit than half mankind too rash for thought for action too refined a tyrant to the wife his heart approves a rebel to the very king he loves he dies sad outcast of each church and sat and harder still flagitious yet not great ask you why clodio broke through every rule twas all for fear the knaves should call him fool nature well known no miracles remain comets are regular and clodio plain yet in the search the wisest may mistake if second qualities for first they take when catiline by rapine swelled his store when caesar made a noble dame a whore in this the lust in that the avarice were means not ends ambition was the vice that very caesar born in scipios days had aimed like him by chastity at praise lucullus when frugality could charm had roasted turnips in the sabin farm in vain the observer eyes the builders toil but quite mistakes the scaffold for the pile in this one passion man can strength enjoy as fits give vigor just when they destroy time that on all things lays his lenient hand yet tames not this it sticks to our last sand consistent in our follies and our sins here honest nature ends as she begins behold a reverend sire whom want of grace has made the father of a nameless race crawl through the street should on or rudely pressed by his own sons that pass him by unblessd still to his wench he creeps on knocking knees and envies every sparrow that he sees a salmons belly helluo was thy fate the doctor called declares all help too late mercy cries helluo mercy on my soul is there no hope alas  then bring the jowl  odious in woollen twoud a saint provoke were the last words that poor naroissa spoke  no let a charming chintz and brussels lace  wrap my cold limbs and shade my lifeless face  one would not sure be frightful when ones dead   and betty give this cheek a little red old politicians chew on wisdom past and blunder on in business to the last as weak as earnest and as gravely out as sober l   w dancing in the gout the courtier smooth who forty years had shined an humble servant to all human kind just brought out this when scarce his tongue could stir  if  where i am going  i could serve you sir  i give and i devise old euclio said and sighed my lands and tenements to ned your money sir my money sir what all  why  if i must  then wept i give it paul the manor sir  the manor hold he cried  not that  i cannot part with that  and died and you brave cobham to the latest breath shall feel your ruling passion strong in death such in those moments as in all the past  oh save my country heaven shall be your last finis
