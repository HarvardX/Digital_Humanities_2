the history of the norfolk steward  in two parts  the history of the norfolk steward continued  in two parts  part i containing an account of mr lyns private character and the methods by which he grew rich  part ii containing some farther account of mr lyns management and also of his stating and ballancing accounts   anacreon quocunque modo rem hor london printed and dublin reprinted in the year mdccxxviii  preface the following historical essays were written as a sequel to one bearing the same title published some time since in the craftsman and communicated to that author but he having neglected to give them to the public i have thought fit to become the editor myself whether mr d anvers esteems other subjects more seasonable at this time whether he has been intimidated with prosecutions or softened with applications i do not take upon me to determine i have the pleasure only to assure the reader that i have faithfully collected the facts that are related in these little tracts as they have fallen out from time to time and shall continue to have a watchful eye over the actions of our steward and to record them for the benefit of posterity that those who come after us at least may be deterred by this example from intrusting the management of their estates to bad hands the memorialist furnishes materials for the historian and so far he has a right to share in his fame perhaps the character of this most remarkable steward may by my means be preserved thus to future times the indulgence of this vanity and the consciousness of having done what was in my power to expose a corrupt servant is all the reward i claim as a man has some little pretense to merit from the public who only cries out stop thief  but before i take leave of my readers i humbly entreat as they desire to be thought candid or courteous or to be obliged with any other epithets that the most complaisant writer ever gave them that they will be so good not to force the letters in the following pages to convey to them any other meanings than what they stand for in the order they are there placed it being the nature of the twentyfour letters in our alphabet as i am informed when they are transposed to give to the reader what ideas the transposer pleases so large is the field of innuendos this caution might perhaps at any other time or place than this appear ridiculous but as some people are very tender and others very censorious i thought this not an unnecessary advertisement  to caleb d anvers esquire sir i have the happiness to be tenant to sir george english and there is not one among them who has a more hearty affection for him and his whole family than i have when this estate which he now enjoys and which heaven grant he and his may long enjoy was first left to him by the general attornment of the tenants and the consent and act of brave sir william his ancestor i had the pleasure as a witness and a tenant to sign the instrument my self i saw good sir william ratify it i beheld him soon after expire and could discern a pleasing satisfaction in his features rising from the comfort he received in having finished what he believed must make his tenants the happiest and most easy of any people in our whole county you will forgive me sir that i thus dwell on the praise of my good old master sir william he was a man who loved his whole species who had a general benevolence to mankind he did not think any man was born for himself alone nor could he bear to see any of his neighboring landlords use their tenants ill or rack them too high and more than once he has engaged himself in expensive lawsuits to deliver them from the hands of the oppressor mr lyn of whom i now complain to you sir was one of the tenants and though his little copyhold was then not much in repair and a little incumbered with debts however it has been since improved he professed himself very zealous as well as the rest of us in the interest of our landlord and continued so some years but time proves every thing and a very little while after he was appointed steward to our old master he began to show himself and though the affairs of sir george grew every day worse and worse under his management the affairs of mr lyn grew better and better every day he began to look plump and round his little farm was clear of all encumbrances his family his friends his relations his acquaintance all grew plump likewise and flourished under his influence he had indeed been very liberal to them not out of his own money but his masters he put them into all the employments he could find in the several manors and very frequently when there was no employment ready or open or unenjoyd by any relation friend or dependent of his he was ready to erect an office and to give it a name and an appointment out of his masters rents without any consideration how much his master was in debt how detrimental it must prove to his estate or how ungrateful it was to the tenants who saw and murmured to see that their farms were racked to the highest to support the family and other selfinterests of mr lyn well sir our steward grew rich he grew ambitious and vain and haughty and humorous and now took it into his head that he was as accomplished a gentleman even as sir george himself and would needs be styled his companion he dressed himself up in blue and used to strut about in pearl color stockings a silk doublet and a cap and feather and fancied he had enrolled himself among heroes and gods so hard it is for a man in prosperity to check the folly of a vain mind some time before this whim of bedecking himself in taffaty and blue he had a fancy to appear in red and accordingly one morning with a very solemn and grave countenance he told several of his intimate that now he was grown rich he was resolved to devote himself to the service of religion as a knight errant that he would rescue virgins protect orphans destroy giants and do every thing praiseworthy and becoming the great office of true chivalry he exhorted his friends likewise who were very honest men and meant well to do the same and told them their habiliments ought to be all alike viz red taffaty spurs feathers caps faulchions etc so said so done they dressed themselves they swore on the evangelists to be good and true knights they marched in an affected stagestrut round the town and made a show in their whimsical dresses that set all the parish in a gape now one would imagine that mr lyn was about to make amends for all his mismanagement and that the world as it had been the worse for him would be the better too but this was only a joke it seems for as soon as ever he had persuaded his companions to this on a sudden he whipped off his red taffaty doublet and put on a blue one as i have said and called himself his masters fellow to the great surprise of every one but these frolicks you will say might only take birth from the jocund levities of a head a little giddy with prosperity the plaisom gaities the dulce desipere of a heart swollen with joy and power we will go on then to consider him only in his character of steward  mr lyn was no sooner got into the stewardship but he with very great assurance told his master that none of his tenants had any hearty affection for him but himself and his sons his brother townly and his sons with their relations and intimates that if it were not for his and their management sir george would not be able to make any thing of the estate and isaac tombrel a relation to a relation of mr lyns by marriage had the assurance to affirm before young squire english sir georges eldest son at dinner at the mansion house in leicestershire that the preservation of sir georges whole estate was owing to mr lyn for which and other unmannerly and indecent expressions he was rebuked disgraced and sent back into norfolk indeed mr lyn used frequently in public to applaud himself for his good management of the estate and to pronounce himself with great authority the only man in england who knew how to keep a rental he went farther and frequently declared that was it not for him and his great art and skill the tenants would not pay their rents that they would forget all respect and duty to sir george or join with squire welsh in the lawsuit against him though squire welsh and his lawsuit and prentensions were very low and despised and almost forgot by every body yet mr lyn always endeavored to make his court to his master by assuring him that several of his tenants those i mean who held the largest farms and whose hearts were always with sir george were secretly favorers of the pretensions of mr welsh this sir indeed appears to me one of mr lyns greatest iniquities as i think a pickthank in a family is most odious character but he was resolved to support his power at the expense of every thing and now finding himself as he imagined at least in trust and confidence with his master which we his poor tenants hope is not really the case he raised his crest and threw out his natural bronze and as insolence is ever the mark of a little mind though conscious to himself of more crimes than any man but himself can discover he slighted his superiors and despised his opponents the parishofficers the assessors and collectors of the land tax the constables portreve and jurymen were all his creatures relations dependents or subdependents such whose corruption and consciences he could depend upon thus furnished thus guarded and supported he ventured on he levied money upon the tenants on the most ridiculous pretense an old bridge was to be repaired a new one to be built the parish wanted a set of bells a new pair of stocks must be provided he made them contribute to the keeping several packs of hounds and sometimes master lyn would demand a round sum of money for private uses and such as were by no means proper to be known to the tenants  sir george has a park where his tenants have time out of mind been permitted to recreate and refresh at leisure hours as often as they pleased and through this park many of them are obliged to pass every day to their grounds mr lyn who valued himself on his genius for raising money ordered his own man to stand before the parkgate and levy a penny for the passage of every man when business or diversions obliged him to pass that way and this too under the pretense of setting up a pair of gates only though the money levied would new pale the whole park and this i mention only to show you how ready he is at undertakings of this kind  however notwithstanding all the discouragements that the tenants lay under they might have thriven even under the stewardship of mr lyn if he had not with the utmost art and application labored to prevent it the two greatest and known enemies to industry and trade are luxury and gaming these he carefully encouraged and in order to this he invited the tenants to a large gamingtable which had been erected indeed in another robinocracy in the very middle of the marketplace to this gamingtable the tenants when they had disposed of their wool their corn etc all hurried and as there is in most men a lust after inordidinate gain many of them played and every day left behind them the labors of their industry but mr lyn ever provident for himself took care that this should turn to his advantage for though he never appeared there himself he always employed a few faithful confidents to play for him and allowed them to share in some parts of the spoil it was always his method when he played thus by deputy to use loaded dice either high or low as he fancied and when some of the tenants who by dear experience were now grown very peery observed mr lyns dice in play they would very artfully as they imagined set their dice accordingly that is if they observed mr lyn used high dice they set expecting them to run high and so low when they saw his dice run low but when the stakes were deep enough to invite mr lyns acceptance they were always invisibly changed upon them and he was by this ingenious artifice master of part of the property of the tenants and as often as he pleased by this he amassed wealth by this means the manufactures of our country are very much hurt and our trade decreases this is at present the case under our most righteous steward and they tell me there is nothing he delights in at this hour so much as gaming by proxy and foxhunting  to caleb d anvers esquire the history of the norfolk steward part ii containing a farther account of mr lyns management and also of his method of stating and ballancing accounts sir i believe my last has convinced you that mr lyns management of sir georges domestic affairs was full as extraordinary as that of his lawsuits with his neighbors but perhaps you will wonder that he should be suffered to go on so long in these practices that he has not been constantly presented every courtday for so many repeated misdoings or that even all the tenants of the manor do not unanimously make it their request to sir george whose ears are always open to their complaints that he would be pleased to remove a steward whose mananagement is generally disliked and complained of by all the tenants but your surprise will vanish when you recollect what i have told you in both my former letters that all the prime officers both of the parish and the manor as well as most of the jurymen were his own relations or creatures that a great number of the principal tenants were bribed into his interest and that many others who had honest intentions were afraid to oppose a man who had it in his power to raise their rent distrain their goods or turn them out of their farms at pleasure by representing them as bad tenants or enemies to their landlord though these very people were the best affected to their landlord though they paid their rents punctually and had no other demerit but that they faithfully adhered to what they conceived to be the true interest of sir george in short it is the peculiar character of mr lyn that when he took up a prejudice however unreasonable against any of the tenants he always made it a point as he called it to ruin them with sir george and stuck at nothing to compass his end  yet notwithstanding all this power and this extravagant use of it there are many persons of considerable interest and figure in the manor who have constantly opposed him in all these proceedings and have at present the pleasure to see a general spirit of resentment rising against him the number of his opponents increases daily whilst many some even of those who are obliged to act with him are frequently heard to murmur against his proceedings in public as well as private and others who eat his bread as he is insolently pleased to call it sir georges bread the tenants bread he means hang down their heads and conscious of their crime in not opposing his measures plead guilty to the charge against him in their silence  the freemen of the town where sir george lives himself are heartily almost universally incensed against him on diverse accounts particularly for having introduced several new customs amongst them for always interposing his authority in their elections of parishofficers for making them pay more for their fuel than the rest of the tenants for refusing to read a letter written in their behalf on this account and replying with an insolent air that he did not care a f  t for the whole town  great numbers of poor tradesmen who supplied the late sir george with necessaries are ready to starve for want of the money he died in arrear to them on that account which is the more extraordinary because sir george had always a sufficient income to keep a noble houfe and pay every body as indeed he seemed always inclinable to do from whence they conclude that mr lyn embezzled great sums himself and squandered away others for his own vanity and grandeur amongst a worse kind of tradesmen than they are nay what adds to the provocation is that mr lyn will not satisfy them whether they shall ever be paid or not  the neighboring country gentlemen complain of him for engrossing the game and forbidding them to hunt or ride in sir georges parks as they used to do  the clergy charging him with recommending men of slow parts for preferment in the church to old sir george when any livings fell of which there was a great number during his life and the stewardship of mr lyn  the yeomanry grumble for want of money the manufacturers for want of business and the poor laborers for want of bread and all impute their misfortunes i think after what has been said not very unjustly to mr lyn by engaging old sir george in a needless expensive and chimerical lawsuit and thereby preventing the usual circulation of money in commerce by diverting it into other channels  in short all ranks of men except a few particular creatures of his own seem to have their respective complaints against him and unite in their wishes for a new steward  nay we have a current report about the country that our present landlord who is a gentleman of great penetration and applies himself very much to business has been for some time of the same opinion with his tenants and although it may not be convenient to discharge him at present at least till his accounts which are in the utmost confusion are audited and settled yet it is certain that he has already clipped his wings and so short too that he is unable to take his former flights  this has a little sunk his crest and softened his behavior to his fellowtenants though he still endeavors to keep up his usual spirit of defiance but we can easily observe from the frequent tremulation of his voice the faultring of his accents his loss of temper and confusion in his sentences that he is inwardly very much chagrined and disturbed  you may remember i told you in my first that sir georges estate when he came to it was charged with an heavy debt and that when mr lyn was called upon to give an account of the great sums of money which had passed through his hands he always refused to do it and endeavored to make a jest of those who demanded it but at length the general clamor obliged him to consent to some examination upon which it appears even by his own account that his masters estate is so far from being the better for his management according to his former repeated declarations that it is several hundred pounds more in debt than it was before he came into the stewardship notwithstanding the great sums which ought to have been yearly applied toward paying it off  but his manner of stating accounts is so very extraordinary that i believe you will think it worth relating  mr lyn has always boasted that the familydebt was very much diminished within these ten or eleven years past and defied his enemies to prove the contrary now in order to see whether this was true or not it was proposed first to state the debt as it stood eleven years ago is all its branches then to deduct from it the several yearly sums which have or ought to have been paid out of a certain strong box where the savings from the rents after the expenses of the family were paid were constantly laid up to discharge part of the mortgage upon the estate as it was appointed to do since that time and afterward to compute the whole debt of every kind which the family owes at present it was agreed i think that the debt eleven years ago amounted to about   000 l the strong box was said to have produced since that time about  000 l which reduces the debt had no farther debt been incurred as the phrase in vogue is to   000 and in whatever degree the present debt should appear to be less than that sum so much and no more ought to be allowed to be really diminished since that time by the management of mr lyn since he could not pretend to arrogate to himself the merit of paying any sums which would have paid themselves had he let them alone  this seemed to be a fair proposal as it was generally esteemed but fair as it was mr lyn demurred to it at first indeed he cracked blusterd and defied as usual at length with much difficulty he agreed to give in some account accordingly he gave in his own state of the account and a day was appointed for the enquiry when that came he made a considerable alteration in his own account and having afterward acknowledged that he had quite forgot several other considerable sums of the debt contracted he run his usual circle he asserted affirmed denied was positive was every thing but intelligible he talked in short till he had not only made himself but many of his hearers giddy there is not perhaps so great a master in europe of the grand art of bambousle as mr lyn the debt said he is incurred but not increased there are real debts and nominal debts there are real nominal debts and nominal real debts there were real debts and personal debts which the family must pay there are debts neverstated tho incurred and debts which though incurred and stated might never be paid so that upon the whole you see i have paid off a considerable part of the mortgage upon sir georges estate but when he was told that though it was true that part of the norfolk mortgage was paid off yet sir george was really now as much in debt as before because mr lyn to perform this mighty deed had borrowed just as much upon sir georges estate in leicestershire as he had paid off in norfolk so that the balance continued as before he broke into a loud laugh and told the tenants they knew nothing of accounts nor the difference between a debt incurred and a debt increased  by the help of these distinctions and this jumble of sophistries he struck off one article of above three thousand pounds which he asserted to be a very good bargain to the family another of almost two thousand because it was owing to very bad management and a third of one thousand for no other reason that i could hear than that he did not know how to justify the contracting of it or in what manner to provide for its payment  he had also the modesty to place another considerable sum amongst the debts discharged within that time which ought really to have been placed amongst those incurred  it is likewise worth observing that mr lyn had previously taken care to puzzle and perplex the accounts as much as possible in order to secure himself from detection by chopping and changing the securities into different hands borrowing of one to pay off another turning interest into principal and principal into interest with a thousand other arts and stratagems of the same kind so that he had a manifest advantage over those who were not in the secret  nay what is still more extraordinary he stated his account of debts contracted to christmas last only whereas he calculated the sum of debts discharged to lady day next a method of stating and ballancing accounts which was never before practiced or heard of in these parts  and yet after all these finesses and fallacies and arbitrary postulata the present familydebt evidently appeared to be just as it was eleven years ago fifty one thousand pounds or thereabouts  though it is generally believed here that this affair will not redound much to the credit of mr lyn yet it must be confessed that his arithmetical capacity is really admirable and that he has proved himself beyond all contradiction to be a complete master of addition as well as substraction  to be continued as the steward goes on  finis
