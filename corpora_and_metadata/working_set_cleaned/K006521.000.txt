ode to mr pinchbeck upon his newly invented patent candlesnuffers by malcolm mcgreggor esquire author of the heroic epistle to sir william chambers and the heroic postscript  quosque ergo frustra pascemus ignigenum istum apuleii met lib   why should a patent be granted to this candlesnuffer in vain the second edition  london printed for j almon opposite burlingtonhouse piccadilly  mdcclxxvi  price sixpence  advertisement ever since my first pulication the curiosity not to say anxiety of the world concerning my name has been so great that it has frequently given me pain to conceal what the world will now see it was not possibly in my power to discover  in short i had no name till the royal favor lately restored my very ancient and honorable clan to its pristine title and honors i was therefore in the same deplorable case with a certain nameless lady whom i have long had the honor to call my neighbor and who i sincerely hope will soon by the same favor be restored to that title which upon my honor i believe she has erroneously and not intentionally forfeited  i have only to add that now when the public is in possession of my real name it will not i hope suffer any national prejudice to prevent it from receiving this my first lyrical attempt with its former candor but i must needs say that if this ode does not sell as well as mr cumberlands i shall be apt to impute it not to any inferiority of lyrical ordonance but merely to its having been written by a scotchman  knightsbridge may        ode to mr pinchbeck i illustrious pinchbeck condescend thou wellbelovd and best kingsfriend these lyric lines to view o may they prompt thee ever too late to snuff the candle of the state that burns a little blue ii it once had got a stately wick when in its patentcandlestick the revolution put it as white as wax we saw it shine through two whole lengths of brunswicks line till b  first dared to smut it iii since then  but wherefore tell the tale enough that now it burns pale and sorely wastes its tallow nay if thy poet rightly weens though little skilled in ways and means its saveall is but shallow iv come then ingenious artist come and put thy finger and thy thumb into each polished handle on thee alone our hopes depend thy kings and eke thy countrys friend to trim old englands candle v but first we pray for its relief pluck from its wick each tory thief it else must quickly rue it these initials like those in the banns of marriage published between n and m may be filled up at the readers pleasure vide common prayer book while n  and m  sputter there thou wilt never prevent with all thy care the melting of the suet vi there is twitcher too that old hewitch sticks in his bole as black as pitch our ingenious inventors snuffer are peculiarly calculated to remedy this evil to which indeed all candles are more or less subject see the patentees advertisement and makes a silthy pother when cursed with such a sorry fiend and lighted too at either end twill soon be in a smother vii i fear me much in sucha plight those tapers blessed would lose their light canadian fanes that deck which pious    ordains to blaze and gild with their established rays our lady of quebec viii it is humbly presumed that the classical reader will here perceive a boldness of transition only to be equalled by pindar and perhaps by horace in some of his sublimer odes his arms thou hallowed image bless and surely thou can do no less he is thy faiths defender thou owe thy place to him alone as other jacobites have done and not to the pretender ix haste then and quash the hot turmoil that flames in bostons angry soil and frights the mothernation know lady if its rage you stop pinchbeck shall send you from his shop a most superb oblation x his patentsnuffers in a dish of burnished gold if more you wish his cyclops shall bestir their brawny stumps and for thy sake of pinchbecks own mixtmetal make a huge extinguisher xi to form the mass thy

will yield materials large enough to mold the mighty cone but how transport it when it is cast across the deep atlantic vast twill weigh some thousand stone xiv leave that to me our lady cries however gigantic be its size i have a scheme in petto i will fly with it from shore to shore safe as my sooty sister bore her cottage to loretto xv swift to the congress with my freight i will speed and on their heads its weight souse with such skill and care that puttnam washington beneath and grasping lee shall wish to breathe  this great philosopher has lately discovered a method of fabricating a new species of air of so infinitely superior salubrity and duration to that vulgar atmospherical air which for want of better we have been obliged to breathe for upwards of five thousand years that it is to be supposed that no macaroni savoir vivre or in plain english no body that knows what is what will in future condescend to respire any air that is not sealed with the doctors own arms and signed with his own handwriting it is to be feared however that his pneumatic vials will be liable to be counterfeited as our philosopher has not interest enough at court to procure a patent indeed were such a patent granted it might supersede mr pinchbecks because that in this air a candle is found to burn with so bright and continued a flame that it could never want snuffing  see vol ii of dr priestleys
