an epistle to the right honorable sir robert walpole   quae censet amiculus ut si caecus iter monstrare velit  hor london printed for j walthoe over against the royal exchange in cornhill      price   d  an epistle to the right honorable sir robert walpole though strength of genius by experience taught gives thee to found the depths of human thought to trace the various workings of the mind and rule the secret springs that rule mankind rare gifts yet walpole will thou condescend to listen if thy unexperienced friend can ought of use impart though void of skill and win attention by sincere good will for friendship sometimes want of parts supplies the heart may furnish what the head denies as when the rapid rhone over swelling tides to grace old oceans court in triumph rides though rich his source he drains a thousand springs nor scorns the tribute each small rivlet brings so thou shall hence absorb each feeble ray each dawn of meaning in thy brighter day shall like or where thou can not like excuse since no mean interest shall profane the muse no malice wrapped in truths disguise offend nor flattery taint the freedom of the friend when first a generous mind surveys the great and views the crowds that on their fortune wait pleased with the show though little understood he only seeks the power to do the good thinks till he tries it is godlike to dispose and gratitude still springs where bounty flows that every grant sincere affection wins and where our wants have end our love begins but those who long the paths of state have trod learn from the clamours of the murmuring crowd which crammed yet craving still their gates besiege it is easier far to give than to oblige this of thy conduct seems the nicest part the chief perfection of the statesmans art to give to fair assent a fairer face and soften a refusal into grace but few there are that can be truly kind or know to fix their favors on the mind hence some whenever they would oblige offend and while they make the fortune lose the friend still give unthankd still squander not bestow for great men want not what to give but how the race of men that follow courts it is true think all they get and more than all their due still ask but never consult their own deserts and measure by their interest not their parts from this mistake so many men we see but ill become the thing they wished to be hence discontent and fresh demands arise more power more favor in the great mans eyes all feel a want though none the cause suspects and hate their patron for their own defects such none can please but who reforms their hearts and when he gives them places gives them parts as these oerprize their worth so sure the great may sell their favor at too dear a rate when merit pines while clamor is preferred and long attachment waits among the herd when no distinction where distinctions due marks from the many the superior few when strong cabal constrains them to be just and makes them give at last  because they must what hopes that men of real worth should prize what neither friendship gives nor merit buys the man who justly over the whole presides his well weighed choice with wise affections guides knows when to stop with grace and when advance nor gives from importunity or chance but thinks how little gratitude is owed when favors are extorted not bestowed when safe on shore ourselves we see the crowd surround the great importunate and loud through such a tumult it is no easy task to drive the man of real worth to ask surrounded thus and giddy with the show it is hard for great men rightly to bestow from hence so few are skilled in either case to ask with dignity or give with grace sometimes the great seduced by love of parts consult our genius but neglect our hearts pleased with the glittering sparks that genius flings they lift us cowring on their eagles wings mark out the flights by which themselves begun and teach our dazzled eyes to bear the sun till we forget the hand that made us great and grow to envy not to emulate to emulate a general warmth implies to reach the virtues that make great men rise but envy wears a mean malignant face and aims not at their virtues but their place such to oblige how vain is the pretense when every favor is a fresh offense by which superior power is still implied and while it helps their fortune hurts their pride slight is the hate neglect or hardships breed but those who hate from envy hate indeed since so perplexed the choice whom shall we trust methinks i hear thee cry the brave and just the man by no mean fears or hopes controlled who serves thee from affection not for gold who love the honest and esteem the brave despise the coxcomb but detest the knave no show of parts the truly wise seduce to think that knaves can be of real use the man who contradicts the public voice and strives to dignify a worthless choice attempts a task that on that choice reflects and lends us light to point out new defects one worthless man that gains what he pretends disgusts a thousand unpretending friends and since no art can make a counter pass or add the weight of gold to mimick brass when princes to bad oar their image join they more debase the stamp than raise the coin be thine the care true merit to reward and gain the good  nor will that task be hard souls formed alike so quick by nature blend an honest man is more than half thy friend him no mean views or haste to rise shall sway thy choice to sully or thy trust betray ambition here shall at due distance stand nor is wit dangerous in an honest hand besides if failings at the bottom lie we view those failings with a lovers eye though small his genius let him do his best our wishes and relief supply the rest let others barter servile faith for gold his friendship is not to be bought or sold fierce opposition he unmoved shall face modest in favor daring in disgrace to share thy adverse fate alone pretend in power a servant out of power a friend here pour thy favors in an ample flood indulge thy boundless thirst of doing good nor think that good to him alone confined such to oblige is to oblige mankind if thus thy mighty masters steps thou trace the brave to cherish and the good to grace long shall thou stand from rage and faction free and teach us long to love the king through thee or fall a victim dangerous to the foe and make him tremble when he strikes the blow while honor gratitude affection join to deck thy close and brighten thy decline illustrious doom the great when thus displaced with friendship guarded and with virtue graced in awful ruin like romes senate fall the prey and worship of the wondering gaul no doubt to genius some reward is due excluding that were satyrizing you but yet believe thy undesigning friend when truth and genius for thy choice contend though both have weight when in the balance cast let probity be first and parts the last on these foundations if thou durst be great and check the growth of folly and deceit when party rage shall droop through length of days and calumny be ripened into praise then future times shall to thy worth allow that fame which envy would call flattery now thus far
