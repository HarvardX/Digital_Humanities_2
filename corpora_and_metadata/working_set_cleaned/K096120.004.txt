m dcc lxxxix  travels through siberia and tartary provinces of the russian empire by s pallas m d professor of natural history etc part iii continued i shall now speak of the jugrian and obdirian samojedes mr surjef having had an opportunity in the above northern tour of seeing a good deal of them yet the accounts he brought are in some measure imperfect as but few samojedes live in the districts of obdorskaja and the rest having partly mixed themselves with the eastjaiks by marriage  the samojedes who call themselves chasowa or ghosovo that is men were made tributary to the russian empire so early as      whereas the other nations of siberia were not conquered till the   th century they inhabit the coasts of the frozen sea from the   th degree of northlatitude to the seashore that is all the northern districts of russia and siberia as far as to the jenisei but are within this district divided into many tribes different even in their dialects probably all those to whom the russians give the name of samojedes are not of the same origin what is said here is meant of those samojedes who live between the river ob and the jugrian mountains  nothing more probable can be concluded but that the whole of this people must originally have been one nation expelled by war from their abodes and who settled on the extreme boundaries of the northern hemisphere this nation must long have inhabited a cold and mountainous country and have there lived a wandering life otherwise they would have been unable to have continued in so rude a climate where others can hardly bear the winter sheltered in commodious dwellings neither could they have preserved the use of moveable huts if they had not originally been wanderers add to this there are in the eastern parts of siberia about the jenisei where the country according to every appearance and token has been once more populous a posterity of that nation in the neighboring sajanian mountains in the koibals kamatschinzes matores sojetes and karagassians who all speak the samojede language this nation indeed does not recollect that it came from the east but it is natural to suppose that their troublesome and dangerous mode of living may have effaced in a few ages such a remembrance from their memory  the most northern part of the district of beresowa inhabited by the samojedes is divided by the gulf of the river ob into two districts of which the western or kamennaja is bounded by the district of pusdoserskaja lying from archangel to the source of the river sob along the jugrian mountains karskoi the other called nisowaja runs eastward from the gulf of the ob and is bounded by the district of the juriakian samojedes dependent on mangasei  the european samojedes says took extend from the white sea or rather from the river mesen to mount ural the asiatic samojedes occupy the countries between mount ural and the environs of the lena to beyond the jenisei those of european russia live separately those of siberia are settled partly in the vicinage of the eastjaiks or mixed with them the countries they occupy are marshy and full of rocks so that from the   th degree of latitude there are no trees of any kind and that cold which prevails in these climates prevents vegetation to such a point that even the little brushwood here and there to be seen dwindles away to nothing as we advance toward the north although they do not inhabit nova zembla situated over against the mouth of the ob nevertheless to the eastward of the jenesei the shores along which their little settlements extend reach to the   th degree of north latitude for which reason their vast territories are the thinnest of inhabitants the rudest and the most barren and wild of any of the known regions of the terrestrial globe  the samojedes are in appearance and language entirely different from the eastjaiks the latter being in physiognomy more like the russians and most like the finlanders but the samojedes have almost the look of a tunguse round broad and flat faces very fine in the women pouching broad lips a flat and open nose little or no beard and black coarse hair their stature is rather short than middling but wellproportioned and more nervous and fleshy than the eastjaiks in their manners they are much more savage more uncivilized and ungovernable in their open and distant wilds than the eastjaiks who are much improved by their frequent intercourse with the russians  samojedes   the mans dress differs but little from that of the eastjaiks some shave their heads partially some wholly and some not at all some wear but one whisker on one side and others on both sides the chin the womens dress is singular they go always bareheaded and barefaced and are in other respects very impudent their hair is braided into two tresses which hang down behind and are never opened in their ears they wear short bead pendants the breast and backpieces of their garments are made of the furs of young reindeer and the rest pieces of cloth sewed together the whole bordered with fur and made to lap over before and there tied with a girdle instead of a breastpin they have a large iron ring on which both ends of the girdle are tied they also wear breeches of died reindeer skins but they do not follow the ridiculous custom of the eastjaik women which i have mentioned and wear the willowtent and worop in this dress the samojede women remain day and night but the men sleep without any clothes and but for these breeches would be quite naked  as the samojedes live an unsettled life both in summer and winter and are always roving about with their tents covered with reindeer skins in woodless plains their uncleanliness is not so observable in winter as among the stinking eastjaiks yet they are in no wise less filthy in their persons and manner of eating each samojede keeps his own reindeer and he and his family watch them themselves the more wealthy ones hire poor people as shepherds these domestic animals are chiefly employed to transport their tents and effects on sledges they do not know how to milk them and their numbers are too small to kill them indeed their possessors are too covetous to do it their chief living is hunting like many nations of north america especially that of wild reindeer which they catch in many different ways as shall be mentioned below the wild reindeer furnishes the samojede with every necessary he wants viz food roofs spades which they make of the horn clothes and sinews for thread etc etc when they live near the sea they have sufficient subsistence from the seabears that come on shore dead whales thrown up by the waves and other animals which they eat indiscriminately dogs cats ermines squirrels and snakes in short whatever they can kill or find dead nothing comes amiss to them they sometimes fish in the gulf and lakes with small nets made of willowbast and ropes of willowrods in autumn they hunt icefoxes which are not only caught by the men in traps and sometimes pursued but even dug out of their holes by their wives and killed there are wealthy samojedes who for the sake of fishing will take up their summerabode on the river ob and leave the care of their flocks to their children and shepherds yet when the time of hunting approaches will return to their old way of living when a samojede has killed a reindeer nothing is lost they first cut off the animals ears this is done on the spot where he is killed and throw them away as an offering to their gods to obtain future good luck in hunting the leg bones are taken out split with a knife and the marrow is eaten raw so do they eat raw the warm and bloody brains and consider them as a great dainty the eyes are buried in a certain spot and no woman or girl is suffered to pass over this spot lest it should destroy their success in hunting in the spring when the reindeer has new horns which are knotty and rough they will eat these horns only singeing off the hair and even the old horns they will bruise and boil and make strong glue of by mixing it with the blood of the same animal when more families are boiling for they have but one kettle among four or five families the rest of the meat is boiled and every one eats his portion of in his own tent the wife however cannot eat with her husband but is contented with what he leaves  the female sex is in general used worse by the samojedes than the eastjaiks they have every domestic business to perform to put the luggage on the sledges etc and notwithstanding they are quite slaves to their husbands the latter are continually scolding and cursing them except a few evenings in the year when love for a moment softens their savage breasts nothwithstanding this the women are considerd by their husbands as impure creatures when a woman has erected a tent she dares not enter it till she has smoked herself and every thing she sits on and even the sledge she carries into the hut with reindeer hair when she unloads the sledge by untying the cloths upon it she cannot do it from above but must creep under the shafts and do it so on a journey no woman can cross a train or row of reindeer sledges following each other but must either run round the whole or creep underneath the shafts even in the hut a staff is erected behind the fire the limits of which she dares not pass for they deem the fire sacred and think a woman going round it would profane it to do her domestic work if she wants to go from one side of the hut to the other she must go round about for the samojedes absolutely believe that if a woman is at liberty to go about the whole tent a wolf will certainly devour a reindeer the same night and the eastjaiks who keep reindeer have adopted the same superstitious notions for no woman or marriageable girl is suffered to eat of the head of a reindeer in the time of their menses they are plagued beyond measure they must often undergo purification by smoking themselves with reindeer hair or castor nor are they suffered at such times to dress any food for their husbands or hand them the least thing it is the same after lyingin the husband does not cohabit with his wife for two months at this period she is not to eat any provisions freshkilled but must put up with old provisions but the worst of all customs is this the least pain in childbirth causes an immediate suspicion that she has had some illicit connection with other men and she is therefore left to suffer in order to extort a confession from her a european dame would despise this but the poor samojede in order to have assistance will confess an intrigue she was perhaps never concerned in this confession however has no bad consequence if the delinquent be a near relation the woman does not name him but the husband immediately guesses the person and makes him accountable whether innocent or guilty if it be any one else she names him and he is called upon to defray the consequent expenses of that assistance he put his friend to without being applied to for it  when a samojede wants a wife he looks for one in some other family than his own he never cares for beauty but chooses one equal to himself in rank and property having appointed a negociator of the business from among his own friends whom it is customary to reward with a reindeer for his trouble with this man and his relations he goes to the habitation of the girls father and being arrived no one presumes to enter the hut but ranging all their sledges in a row each man sitting on his own while the negociator waits upon the father of the young woman and enquires whether the young man can have her if the father refuses which is but seldom the case he gives the negociator a basket which is the token of refusal and nothing more is said the whole suite return as they came but if the father accepts the proposal the negociator settles the kalym or price to be paid which is attended with more difficulty than among the eastjaiks for such shall be the covetousness of the father that he will keep the whole train a long time on their sledges that he may get as much for his daughter as he can the kalym generally consists in a variety of clothes household necessaries reindeer and little matters purchased from the russians the father indeed can keep but part of this kalym to himself it being usual to give some of it to his relations  as soon as the youth has paid the kalym the fatherinlaw loads him and his company with reindeer meat and during the feast the young man and the brides father sing to each other the father advising in his song the son to love his wife and the son recommending himself as well as he can to his new father it is then settled when the brides portion is to be paid and when the bride shall be ready to give her hand for a father always gives with his daughter in marriage a certain quantity of clothes on the day appointed the bridegroom waits on his bride with a number of strange women to fetch her on this occasion small presents are demanded from those relations that share the kalym the bride is then forcibly placed on a sledge by these women tied on and all the sledges with the presents and gifts the first three or four of which the father must cover with good cloth and the rest with reindeer skins then set off the brides sledge first and all the rest following and return to the young mans hut where it is the business of the bride to make his bed in which she sleeps by her husband but undisturbed for the first month both eastjaiks and samojedes make the brides mother a present if it turns out that her daughter when married was a virgin  some time after marriage the young wife pays a visit to her father and stays with him a few weeks during which time she has the liberty to receive her husband at their taking leave the father must make her a number of presents and do the same at every visit so that the young woman for a length of time shall have no occasion to apply to her husband for any thing in cases of divorce the kalym is returned should the woman die soon after her marriage the widower claims a return of the kalym if respect to the deceased does not prevent it  the samojedes have very easy labors the afterbirth is either buried or placed in some remote place where no cattle or wild animal can approach it at the time of a womans delivery her husband keeps a good knife ready with which the attendant on the mother cuts the navelstring of the child and keeps the knife as a reward all present take the child as soon as born and caress it like the eastjaiks they lay it upon rotten wood or soft moss and so tie it that the mother may readily carry it at her back  when a boy is two years old his father gives him a name which he keeps till he is fifteen then gives him another of his own choosing or borrows one from some friend after the death of their relations for the names are sacredly kept in the family and should a samojede give his son the name of another person without the consent of that persons relations it would expose him to bloodshed a girl never has any money when married her husband calls her ne that is wife and she calls her husband chosowa that is man  the names generally given to boys have some significant meaning as for example chanchara sledges and larchwood nerme opening in the ice laatscha hillock lakeer hillyland naemale broken bones warpts lightheaded eptukai goose foot and the like  the samojedes inter their dead very soon have no certain burialground but carry the corpse to a height or hill they dress the body in as many of its new clothes as they can put on laying what is left about the corpse and put the head into a boiler from an opinion that after the head is decayed the soul will there remain all this done they wrap up the body in the cover of a tent of reindeer skins bind it round with ropes and drag it out of the tent headforemost not out at the door but from under the covering of the tent the man inhabited which they raise for the purpose for they idly think if it is taken through the door the deceased will return and soon fetch away some other of the family when brought to the place of interment if in summertime they dig a very shallow pit not above eighteen inches deep cover the corpse with wild bushes and then throw the ground upon it in wintertime they erect a hut with timber and bushes place the deceased in it give him an axe knife bow and arrows tobacco a pipe spoon and cups and then leave him the reindeer that drew the corpse are killed and put with all their furniture into the grave rich people kill also those reindeer with which the deceased used to hunt and the whole in winter is covered with straw in summer with moss and straw of course samojede graves are a banquet prepared for icefoxes hyenas and other wild beasts  during the interment they send for a magician who is often fetched from a great distance in honor of the deceased on such occasions these magicians have recourse to the drum and put on a particular kind of robe ornamented with figures in ironplates their business is to persuade the spirit of the dead not to molest those he has left behind him nor fetch them away but to leave his lucky huntingdays to his relations at these times they sacrifice a reindeer and dress it on the spot but neither the wife nor husband of the deceased is at liberty to eat out of the common boiler without being first purified by washing and smoking themselves with castor should a samojede pass the grave of an ear relation even ten years afterward he must sacrifice a reindeer in memory of the deceased and eat it with his attendants leaving the head and horns upon the grave the name of the deceased is no more to be mentioned but by allusion or circumlocution he that would pronounce the name would become a declared enemy of the relations but after a length of time the same name may be revived in the second or third generation and given to children to keep up its remembrance  mourning for the dead consists in not tying up their furboots nor girding their bodies with willows undoing the tresses of the hair letting it go dishevelled for some time and afterward braiding it for life into three tresses letting the third hang on one side over the ear  i must not omit to mention that many samojedes especially magicians are occasionally panicstruck partly owing to lax fibers the effects of a northern climate and their manner of living and partly to fancy weakened by superstition we see this also among the laplanders tunguse and the inhabitants of kamschatka major islenief assured me he had heard this among the jakutes and in a less degree i met with it among the tartars about the jenisei and the buscats  we have read of the same among the laplanders an unexpected touch a sudden call whistling or a fearful and sudden appearance will throw these people into a state of fury the samojedes and jakutes who seem more to be affected in this way carry the matter so far that forgetting what they are about they will take the first axe knife or other offensive weapon that lies in their way and would wound or kill the object of their terror if not prevented by force and the weapon taken from them and if so interrupted will beat themselves about the hands and feet scream out roll upon the ground and rave the samojedes and eastjaiks have an infallible remedy to bring such persons to themselves which is to set fire to a reindeer skin or a sack of reindeer hair and let it smoke under the patients nose this occasions a faintness and a quiet slumber often for the space of twentyfour hours  in the district of the river ob mr surjef saw a female magician who had quitted her way of life on account of her advanced age this woman was not only terrified by whistling but even by the noise of the wind there was also among the samojedes who accompanied him on his journey to the frozen sea a woman who was terribly frightened at every trifle in      in their travels through mangasei they met with a young samojede sorcerer whom mr surjef no sooner approached than he imagined he was going to be killed and on holding a finger out to him he seized it with both hands and took that opportunity to run off however after many persuasions of the interpreter that no harm was designed him he recovered himself they then put on him a black glove and immediately his eyes rolled he stared steadfastly at the glove and fell into such a fit of madness that he would have committed some murder with an axe that lay in his way had it not been secured disappointed of his weapon he ran about raving screaming and shaking his hand in order to get off the glove which he took to be the claw of a bear and which he was afraid to touch with the other hand till the byestanders laid hold of him forcibly and pulled it off on which he recovered  the samojede magicians are skillful in their art besides the drum which they use as do the laplanders they wear a particular dress according to mr gmelins account they are tolerable jugglers some have the art of plunging a knife into the body without making a wound and apparently wringing off their heads by fastening a cord round their necks and suffering two persons to draw it tight and afterward setting it on again but these tricks are seen only among those magicians who require but little art to deceive their countrymen and indeed to speak seriously such a siberian juggler would cut but a very indifferent figure at a european fair  i could learn nothing authentic about their idols yet i know that each man has in his house a pagod which is often some particular stone or some other inanimate body which the samojede ties upon his sledge and considers as sacred  i will say a few words about their amusements and then leave them when many assemble upon any joyous occasion they divert themselves with fighting and running over certain limits they also dance with their wives by couples in circles throw themselves into a variety of attitudes and make a number of grimaces all to musical measure and often for want of music will keep time by snorting and other nasal sounds in which the women in the same way bear a chorus and reply  i will proceed to their fisheries and manner of hunting about the river ob equally practiced by eastjaiks and samojedes  took who speaks from gmelin is a little more particular respecting the persons of the samojedes he says the men are about five feet high some few are seen only four feet they seem all of a heap have short legs small neck a large head flat nose and face with the lower part of the face projecting outward large mouth and ears small black eyes but wide eyelids small lips and little feet their skin is of a deepish yellow hue and they have seldom any beard at all their hair grows in very small quantity but small as it is both sexes take great pains to eradicate it every where except on their heads where it is black and has the appearance of silk the women are shorter than the men have a more slender shape and are softer in their features at the same time they are far from handsome and a pretty female is as extraordinary as a fine man their breasts are small and flat and their maturity very early many of them being mothers at twelve years of age and sometimes at eleven they are not however very prolific and after thirty years of age seldom bear children  the constitution of this country has always been and still is that of the infancy of the world they never had an idea of any prince or superior except the elders of their branches their historic songs perpetuate only the remembrance of some ancestor who gloried in his courage and skill in hunting or who was the founder of their families or of their magic priests since their conquest by the russians little forts or places of confinement have been built in their territories to keep them in order and receive their tribute and at first they were bold enough to oppose these establishments but they now pay their tribute or taxes with great cheerfulness and at the places destined for that purpose this moderate tribute is left to themselves to proportion and consists of the skins of wild beasts  having now described the persons of the samojedes let us speak of their fisheries and manner of hunting in and about the river ob in which the eastjaiks and samojedes agree  there is no large river in all russia and siberia where such a quantity of all kind of fish of passage comes up from the sea as in the ob of whitings coregoni it contains several unknown species but trout salmon and several other sorts of fish caught in other large rivers of russia and siberia are wanting here which may be ascribed to the nature of the water its slow course and the sliminess of the ground the siberian omul salmo autumnalis found in the jenisei angara baikal tubal and the lake madshour is not seen here though it is common in the frozen sea nor is the little trout salmo eriox abundantly caught on the jugrian coast and on the river petschora to be found in the river ob but the sturgeon and huso who like a soft ground are larger and more abundant yet of a worse taste in the ob than in such rivers as are stony  the fishes of passage peculiar to the ob and seen no where else are the muksun salmo lavareto affinis the soroch salmo wimba the nelma large quabs pike perch shad and barbel the muksun nelma and some others crowd up the ob in spring as soon as the ice is dissolved reach beresowa about june and then proceed further into the jenisei and tom but in september chiefly return into the ocean before the riverwater under the ice begins to stink this disagreeable change of water only happens in little slowflowing rivers not in the larger ones in the district of beresowa nor even in the ob after the month of december some rivers which flow from the mountains into the ob and have strong and rapid streams as the sob and others are free from this defect and of course are fuller of fish in wintertime but in the ob fish commonly live in such places where the sweet water rivers empty themselves and where fresh and strong rivulets run into it in such places the finny tribes assemble so plenteously that they are caught in quantities during the whole winter where there is foul or dead water it does not freshen and become sweet till spring when the melted snows adds to it  the springfishery in the ob does not begin before june when the river opens again and shoals of fish push their way up and fill all its branches just at this period the ob is too deep and broad to be fished and it has been known that at such floodtimes as happened in    0 and      the eastjaiks who have made no provision have been almost starved those who are prudent make a greater provision than merely for the winter and find themselves very well rewarded for their care  besides dragnets made use of from june to october the eastjaiks have various other ways of fishing one is with a net called kylidan it is like a bag ten feet broad and seven long its lower edge is stretched upon a pole at the middle of which a stone is fixed in order to sink it flat on the ground near the stone is fastened a rope which goes through a ring fastened on the upper edge of the net which the fisherman rowing takes hold of and drags the net after him a few inches below the upper edge of the net are some strings fastened to it which the man holds between his fingers and hereby feels when any large fish strikes against the net when he immediately lets go the string and pulls the rope tight which draws the bottom and top of the net together and imprisons all that is within the bag with these nets they catch from june to september sturgeon white salmon quab muksun and schagur  through the summer they also catch a quantity of fish with garths and baskets and also in winter when the ice is solid and they use ropes with hooks on them called snasts as in the wolga they fish at night with fishprongs in the siderivers by the light of kindled birchbark erected upon poles and when the rivers are shut up will make openings with huts over them and let down baits cut out in wood and made to resemble small fishes in doing which they are clever and when these baits draw fishes toward them catch them with their prongs such a quantity of sturgeon is caught at beresowa that a pud weight will not sell for more than  0 copecs and the fat at  0 per pud and never for more than a ruble  there is a kind of dolphin met with in the gulf of the river ob and is occasionally seen at certain distances up the river in pursuit of fishes of passage these are the fish which the russians call bjelugas which mr gmelin has given some account of and which are mentioned by muller and also by professor kraschenini in his natural history of kamschatka anderson and crantz in their accounts of greenland give a particular description of this dolphin which they call the white dolphin and what they say of its teeth corresponds with what i have myself observed in the head of this fish nothing is more true than the suppositions in mullers collection that the sea bjeluga is no other than the white dolphin of the greenlanders mr surjef four miles beyond obdorskaja found several heads of this fish in a pagan place of sacrifice from a variety of accounts which i have collected from those who are well acquainted with the seabjeluga and from a head which i received quite entire i am capable of resolving every doubt respecting this animal and i take upon me to aver that this marine bjeluga belongs to the genus of dolphins having like the whale two heartpits lungs warm blood external genital parts and teats and that it cannot have any communication with the bjeluga of the caspian and black seas nor have any similarity to it but in the name form and white color the white dolphin resembles a quadruped so much particularly the seadog that the samojedes take it rather for a wateranimal than a fish it is never above    feet in length its head is oblong and in respect to the body very small conically flat above and about the snout obtuse soft and round it is eyes are small round and project from the head it has no nostrils in the snout but has a venthole in the forehead through which when it swims on the top of the water it throws up a great deal of water as a spout its earholes are very distinguishable its mouth with the lips not much wider than a reindeer which if it wants to bite it can open wide and both jaws have on each side a row of short and very blunt teeth the distinguishable mark of this fish from all other of its genus is that it has no gills when it swims it bends its tail like a crab beats the water impetuously back and thus darts forward as rapid as an arrow its skin is white moist without hair as soft as human skin underneath its belly the female genitals are very visible and close by are two teats like those of a cow full of white milk the penis of the male is about ten inches long without cartilage or bone thick as ones arm and pointed at the end like that of a bullock the samojedes say its flesh is as black as soot and the whole body is covered with a white sward the young ones are more black or gray than the mother and follow her swimming in general white dolphins gather in little flocks together and when they are observed in the gulf of the ob the samojedes assemble in large numbers drive them on the shallows and kill them dr baden residentphysician of the regency of tobolskoi dissected one and compares its intestines to those of a calf  hunting is very general in all the districts situated north of beresowa the animals that abound most in the woodless wilds the farthest north are blue and white icefoxes common foxes white and gray wolves hyenas and reindeer in the adjacent woody parts elks lynxes sables ermines otters beavers and a few black bears and on the seacoast white bears but not so abundant as on the icefields of the ocean about obdorskaja they are very rare but not so rare about the jenisei as far as mangasei it having been observed that icefoxes follow the mice in certain years to eastward they are at such times found in great quantities in mangasei and the hunting then has not been so good upon the ob  their methods of catching these animals are the same as those practiced in russia and siberia besides shootinginstruments and catchclefts they have selfshooting bows for bears lynxes wolves hyenas and the common game wolves and foxes are caught with poisonous baits of crowseyes and sublimate and by falltraps of the latter the eastjaiks make a kind which they call kuromsess set up with a block on which the bait is tied and the animal endeavoring to move the block to take off the bait is killed by its fall such traps as are used in russia for ermines and polecats are made use of by the samojedes but of a larger size for icefoxes and sometimes they fix selfshooting bows on forks in the deep snow against snowhills in which such foxes hide pieces of fish  sables are of little value here and are either shot by the peasants with arrows or driven into nets if found sleeping in their holes a bagnet is placed before them into which the sable is driven and entangled  beavers are sometimes seen in crowds about the uninhabited districts of the rivers but in general are sound single in woody borders hunters go in search of their holes in winter and having found them encompass them with pales on the waterside then open the venthole large enough to let a dog in who takes the beaver by the teeth and he is then drawn out by the hunter by the hindlegs others are pursued and killed sometimes by dogs and sometimes by springbows placed by the waterside that go off and shoot the animal when the bait fixed on it is touched they encompass woody places with pales leaving here and there a way out and fix snares and springbows at such openings they catch elks and reindeer by the same method but in the marshy plains near the sea where this cannot be done successfully the samojedes have found out another method of getting at the wild reindeer who rove there in winter in herds of ten a hundred and two hundred at a time when there are many samojedes together and they see such a herd of wild reindeer they place some tame ones and sledges at a distance upon a piece of flat high land to windward and stick from thence in the snow toward the herd long sticks with goosewings tied on them and which the reindeer easily move at the distance of ten fathoms from each other and on the other side to leeward or under the wind about  0 fathoms from the sledges they stick poles as before and continue them on till they have passed the herd which are all this time searching for food underneath the snow too attentive to look about and prevented from that by their great beams when all is ready the samojedes divide part hide themselves behind the sledges and part called wardar lie concealed with bows and arrows in the opening on the leeside near the sledges others at the same time run and drive the herd toward the winged poles which shaking in the wind alarms them and impelled by fear they run among the tame reindeer standing by the sledges they are soon however driven from this place and seeing no winged poles where the wardar lie attempt to force their way through and there many of them meet their death but as such a mode of hunting requires a great number of people they have other inventions to deceive the reindeer having trained up four or five of their tame female reindeer so as to walk in order with the huntsman he fastens a long cord about each of their horns and ties the other end to his girdle that he may have the command of them in case of confusion or disappointment these female reindeer have the fawns running about them the hunter is thus surrounded by the whole and with this cavalcade can approach the wild deer near enough to shoot the one he likes  in autumn at ruttingtime the samojedes will take a strong buck and go with it in search of wild herds and meeting one will wind a cord about the bucks beams or horns extending it from one horn to the other and there fasten it so armed he is turned loose the hot animal rushes among the herd and is there attacked by the wild buck who during the contest is entangled by the horns in the ropes fastened about those of the tame one when the huntsman runs in and kills him they catch their deer also with great ease when they come down in summer to the cool brooks and in wintertime in deep snows by pursuing them in their snowscates  when on the seacoast the samojedes employ themselves in catching seals or seacalves that prowl about the cliffs or ice and seadogs that come up from the water through small holes which they make in the ice by constantly lying on one spot the samojedes lay a board near such holes to which they fasten a rope and hiding themselves behind the large pieces of ice till the seal comes up out of the water through the hole they draw the board over the hole which prevents its return and of course it is soon killed see plate samojedes  having described their fishing and hunting i must not omit their fowling which begins in spring in the district of the river ob as the snow melts they look out for such spots where the snowwater forms little lakes as the fowls arrive with the first thaw and settle in such lakes they erect small huts near them where they can lie concealed and within reach of a shot and in order to decoy geese and ducks they stuff out the skins of geese and ducks with hay and fix them near this hut and it is curious to see how wild swans and geese will soar over these stuffed baits and unfeather them with their bills  later in spring they catch them in flyingnets hung up in an avenue made through a wood as i have already described elsewhere nay they catch them here in broad day as the fowlers conceal themselves in huts erected for the purpose they catch wild geese also on the flat sandbanks with such a net as fowlers use in england to catch small birds for in these northern countries the people take no notice of small waterfowl they catch only the larger kind and the quantity here is so great that the russian inhabitants might provide themselves well with it for the whole year and have plenty to throw away in the ensuing spring which brings fresh supplies  i came back to krasnojarskaja to winter on the   th of february      mr georgi assistant to professor falk arrived from tomskoi with three other gentlemen sent by him to accompany me his infirm state of health not suffering him to travel on in return i was to send one of the gentlemen i had with me who was to go on from him to petersburgh he set off for tomskoi on the  th of march and by him i sent to petersburgh best part of the natural curiosities i had collected in the course of the last year there being nothing now to prevent my prosecuting my intended journey into the eastern parts of siberia and my health being restored i set out on the  th of march from krasnojarsk on my road to irkuzkaja a distance of     miles where i removed on the   th of march this road is tolerably passable sometimes we traveled on sledges and sometimes on wagons poststations are here erected at proper distances with horses and good warm and white painted rooms for the reception of travelers and the country is all along inhabited by siberians or russian colonists that i might miss nothing worthy notice or observation i left mr kaschkaref at krasnojarsk to explore the vegetable kingdom in the neighboring mountains as the spring opened and sent mr surjef as he was more accustomed to traveling in the north to jeniseikaja and from thence by water to mangasei and further northwards to get all the knowledge he could of the siberian productions in the frigid zone  we reached the town irkuzkaja on the   th at eleven at night our horses being very much fatigued the many curiosities i had here to see the many useful accounts i had to collect respecting the unknown district on the opposite side of the baikal and the kind attention of his excellency lieutenant general de brill governor of this town so engrossed my time for the whole week i staid that i could not think of giving a description of this fine place of course left it to the pen of mr georgi who was to stay here till the ice left the baikal which would at least be two months longer first giving him my instructions to guide him in the journey he was to take along the coasts of that sea  through the favor of general brill i shared an uncommon curiosity which richly deserves mentioning during the winter the inhabitants of this town being out a hunting found on the river wilui the body of an unknown large animal and brought the head of it with a fore and hind foot well preserved to this place the person who sent it and the annexed account dates his letter jan         and mentions that the carcass of the animal had been found in december about  0 miles up the river on the sandy borders about   feet from the water and    feet from a higher and steeper border halfcovered with sand that it was measured on the spot and found to be   feet long and its height   feet the whole body had still its natural thick leather skin but had been so decayed that nothing could be taken off whole but the head and feet which he had sent to irkuzkaja as a curiosity on the first appearance these parts showed that they belonged to a rhinoceros the head was still covered with its natural skin and therefore the more distinguishable on the skin was on one side short hairs and almost every where the external organization of the skin was well preserved even the eyelids did not appear to be decayed underneath the skin lay here and there a loamy substance the remnant of some decayed soft parts about the feet were besides the skin strong remains of joints and sinews the horn of the mouth and the hoofs of the feet were wanting but the situation of the former and the border of the skin round it were like the cloven hind and forefoot  unquestionable marks of this animal  having written a special treatise on this wonderful discovery which may be found in the writings of the imperial academy of sciences i shall not repeat the cause that may have brought such an animal to the most northern districts of the lena and so many other remains of strange animals all over siberia i shall only mention some circumstances which occurred to me and acquaint the reader with the district where these remains were found and preserved for such a length of time the country about the wilui is mountainous and contains either strata of sand or limy slates with some soft layers of loam upon the banks are also broken stonecoal of which there must be some bed higher up the wilui the brook kemtendoi on which is a whole mountain of selenites and rocksalt in the neighborhood of an alabaster mountain lies     miles higher up the wilui from the spot where the rhinoceros was discovered right toward that spot lies upon the wilui a sandy mountain whose height is near    fathoms near which the body of the animal was found tolerably deep in gravel and was preserved by the frost as the ground never thaws about the wilui to a considerable depth the warmest sandy and elevated tracts are indeed softened by the rays of the sun to the distance of some feet underground but in the valleys where the earth is mixed with loam and sand we find even at the end of the summer every thing freezes at a foot deep but for this it would have been impossible that the animal should have been so far preserved whose transposition from a southern native soil into the frigid zone cannot be of later date than the general deluge as the oldest annals of men speak of no later change of the earth and to this change may probably be ascribed this variety of contents in the earth the remains of the rhinoceros and the bones of elephants dispersed throughout siberia  on account of the warm weather we saw now about irkuzkaja the last passage of the snowlarks alauda alpestris and black sparrows fringilla flavirostris and there was also arriving a kind of particolored jackdaw which spends the winter in china or the warmer part of the states of the mogul corvus dauricus  the winterroad we were to travel was over the frozen lakes and shore of the baikal and in our way on the   d of march a most violent frigid storm blew behind us so that the sledgeleaders could not keep their ground but were blown many fathoms about the sledge on the slippery ice and nothing could fix them or save them from the danger of being blown into the deep chinks between the ice and being frozen to death but sticking their knives into the ice and holding fast by them these chinks are in many places so large and so deep that no one durst venture to cross the ice in such weather as the storm increased we were obliged to halt and take up our abode in this cold spot till the next day not daring to cross the lake before us several persons were here preparing to catch seadogs which prowl up from the baikal to these warmer places to sleep bask in the sunshine and enjoy themselves they come up to these animals readily in little sledges before which they extend a white sail which the seadogs take for a piece of ice and are thus surrounded and shot with balls there is generally a beaten road over these lakes and the seacoast in winter and men will travel it in preference to one that is less dangerous but farther round nay will even pass chinks by putting boards across over which the horses and sledges will pass  approaching nearer the shore of the baikal i saw a particular kind of fishingbasket consisting of a little enclosure of bushes extending from the shore some feet into the water at the end of which was another enclosure that formed two rooms whose entrance is the angle which each room forms with the enclosure when any fish approaches the enclosure they go into these rooms or places from which they cannot return here i stopped to put one of my wagons upon wheels for they were so contrived as occasionally to be converted into sledges for the purpose of traveling over the ice and snow we traveled on at the rate of about    miles a day but with difficulty sometimes on sledges sometimes on wheels but without any material accident passing many villages in our way till we reached the town of selenginskaja on the   st of march where i met mr sokalof whom i had sent forward in the beginning of the year  the district about this place is encompassed by sandy mountains and so warm that spring begins here sooner than in the mountains about the baikal on the  0th of february the air was very temperate and toward the end of this month the snow melted entirely upon the hills and all sorts of birds of passage were arriving on the  0th of march i shot the first waterwagtail and a great many little birds now entered the woods  on the  d of april the snow being entirely melted i made a little tour to the distance of  0 miles up the brook tschikoi to see the mongalian pagoda that was erected here about    years ago i chose this time being informed that the three days of prayer appointed monthly by the mongols and burats are on the   th   th and   th days of the new moon so that i might see here the idolatry of the lamas and compare it with that of the kalmucks i reached it on the  th of april this pagoda is situated in a sandy plain and is the largest belonging to the russian mongols besides the chief pagoda and six smaller ones there is here erected a good mansion belonging to the chief of the clergy of lama in this district whom they call bandidichambolama and two houses one inhabited by a military clerk and the other by a christened mongol in the service of the cossack regiments there are also about the north west and east sides of the pagoda several enclosures in which the principal clergy if they come here to the service of the temple erect their felt tents some on the ground and others on a platform raised with planks above the ground all the buildings are of wood and built by russian carpenters according to the direction of the highpriest chambolama who endeavored to imitate the form and ornaments of the pagodas of thibet which he had seen in his youth it would be a superfluous repetition to enter here into a circumstantial description of these temples as i preserve these and other accounts for a particular treatise on the manners customs and religion of the mongols and kalmucks which i mean to publish hereafter  kjachta twentyseven miles from this place stands kjachta which is the frontier fortress and center of all commerce between russia and china where there is a guard of customhouse officers to prevent smuggling this place is situated in an even elevated plain in a wide valley intersected by the brook kjachta and encompassed with high rocky and woody mountains the most considerable of which is called by the mongols burgultei eaglemountain it lies so close to the fortress on the southern side as to command the same and yields a fine prospect in every street and part of the fortress and also of the chinese fortress adjoining it since the last marking out of the boundaries the chinese probably conscious of the advantage the mountain may afford have claimed it as their own under the frivolous pretense of its containing some holy sepulchers of their ancestors for the russian frontierline formerly ran across it the whole mountain however is now left with them and the boundaries are drawn more to the north over the bottom on a western and adjacent mountain stand the russian and chinese marks of boundary the former is a heap of stones and earth with a cross the latter of stones only set up one on another so as to leave a hollow place within something like a kalmuck tent or tartarian jourt  the fortress consists of a quadrangle of pallisadoes fortified on the curtains with four wooden corner bastions and batteries it has three gates one on the northern side one on the south toward the chinese frontiertown which i am going to describe and a third on the west on the brook kjachta within the fortress is a fine woodbuilt church with bells a spacious barteringhouse with  0 shops which is to be made still more extensive on a new plan and built of stone in the center of which is laid the foundation of a little chapel which is to be built also of stone here is also a house for the commander a customhouse an old guardhouse and a great number of offices and houses belonging to merchants besides dwellings for the soldiers the suburbs which are encompassed with a wooden wall have not more than about   0 houses very irregularly built the gates however to this place are guarded as are the gates of the fortress  kjachta is supplied with nothing so ill as with water for the brook is in summertime so shallow as scarce to be above the shoes and the water so thick as to be unfit to drink many wells have been sunk but they are so impregnated with lime and a bitter salt that all the inhabitants who are people of property and fond of tea send for water with leave of the chinese to a spring in their territory  their soil is equally bad and consists mostly of sand and rocks quite unfit for gardening had the line of boundary been placed a little further toward china by a neighboring brook as appears to have been marked out by nature the situation of this fortress would have been better there would have been abundance of good water plenty of fish and a fertile plain behind it  advantages which the chinese at present enjoy  the garrison consists of a company of soldiers and a number of cossacks settled here the commander is an officer of rank who decides all little quarrels and disputes that arise among the principal russian and chinese merchants and who in cases of more importance appeals to a neighboring court of limits and the governor of irkazkaja  the most opulent inhabitants of kjachta are russian merchants and commissioners of considerable houses at petersburgh and other russian places of note and are as civilized and hospitable as in any town in siberia except irkazkaja their company would still be more pleasing if they did not trouble strangers with so much drinking of tea for every merchant prides himself in producing as many samples of boiled tea as he has in possession  the boundaries between these two countries are carried on a considerable way from east to west with chevauxdefrize which prevents cattle being smuggled into either country every guardstation westward as far as the regency of tobolskoi and five other ports eastwards are subordinate to the commander of kjachta but those beyond the mountain are under the commander of aschinskaja it will not be unuseful nor unpleasant to those who are fond of geography to know where the line of partition runs i will therefore point it out westwards from kjachta toward the regency of tobolskoi follow the frontier ports in the following order  utschinskoikaraul    miles from kjachta upon the selenga in an open mountainous district  zaganussunskoi five miles from the latter also on the river selenga  bossinskoi    miles further on the river dshida which the line follows upwards  silturinskoi    miles where on the right the brook silturna falls into the dshida and the country grows more mountainous  chuldazkoi    miles further  charazanskoi    miles to which are several roads and where there are many fields in the valleys which the villagers on the dshida do not use now the mountains become on the right of the dshida especially toward mongalia so very wild and high that no one can go to the following ports but on horseback and this in summer only especially in wet weather without danger of their lives  zeskinskoi    miles from charazan where on the right the brook sodski falls into the dshida  modenkolskoi    miles natschitunskoi  0 miles and thence to dotoshinskoi nine miles a wild district after which follows an unhabitable impervious snowmountain between the sources of the dshida and dshonmurin that to a distance of   0 miles to tunkinskoiostrog between dshonmurin and the bay of baikal or kultak not a place could be found for a frontierpost and from tunkinskoiostrog the mountain continues so high and steep as far as to the jenisei that they could place but two guardstations in the distance of  0 miles and from thence it is   0 miles to the first frontierpost in the regency of tobolskoi  eastwards of kjachta the stations are situated along the tschikoi the first kiranskoi    miles the second kudarinskoi    miles the third at the distance of    miles from the latter the next at    miles distance and the last at  0 miles where the tschikoi leaves the frontiers the line thence runs on the river mansa and the next station is monshinskoi at a distance of     miles then follow the high mountains that divide the rivers of baikal from those of the amur from whence it is   0 miles to the next post on the balskikan dependant on akschinskaja  i will now give as complete a description as i can of the chinese frontier and commercial town which is called by the russians kitaiskaja sloboda the chinese borough the place having properly speaking no name of its own the chinese name is maimutschin composed of nikanian and manshurian words maima and tschin or tschen the former of which implies commerce and the latter a place surrounded with walls the town lies not more than  0 fathoms from the southern wall of the fortress kjachta on a fine and even spot quite sequestered from the brook kjachta and consists of  00 dwellings in the middle between the two towns stand two boundaryposts  0 feet high one with a russian inscription and the other with a manshurian the chinese borough has no other fortifications than a square wooden wall which in      during the last kalmuck war with the choitian prince amursaran when this frontierplace was threatened with fire and sword by a mongol who revolted against their prince schadir wang was erected in haste with a ditch scarce three feet broad this fortification if it can be so called is flanked by a long space from east to west whose longest side is   0 fathoms and the shortest  00 fathoms each wall has in the middle a principal gate opening into the chief streets over each gate is a wooden centinelbox where part of the chinese garrison which consists of ragged mongols with clubs stands on guard at night before the gates on the russian side are wooden walls erected in the chinese way    feet from the gates to prevent any persons looking into the town the houses are built in regular direct lines and compose two principal streets from    to    feet wide crossing each other in the center of the place and two other sidestreets running from north to south they are not paved but gravelled have drains in the middle and are kept very clean  the houses are spacious and each occupies a long oblong place covered with gravel and kept very clean having to the street a large long portico or passage leading to the yard with sidedoors and storerooms the rest of the house consists of dwellingrooms storerooms and a kitchen all the buildings are uniform not more than    feet high without stories built of wood plastered with loam and painted white the roofs are flat and boarded and supported by pillars but the roofs of the common houses are made with cross poles and covered with turf in all buildings the windows are large and made in the european way but as glass and isinglass are too dear are covered with paper except a few of the dwellingrooms of which the windows are glazed paperwindows are commonly ornamented with little pictures one of the rooms serves as a shop and contains samples of every merchandise the proprietor deals in the floors are bricked and the walls papered as in england and within are proper screens to keep off the dust round half the room is a broad painted bench two feet high on which the family eats and sleeps on this bench is also a square brick oven two or three feet high with a perpendicular cylindrical opening like a fireplace in which they burn wood the smoke from this fireplace is carried from above downwards by a pipe underneath the bench and conveyed out of the room into the street and there carried up in a perpendicular chimney not raised higher than the roof this fireplace makes the bench and walls so warm in winter that if the head is laid next the wall the person cannot sleep within the room is no other furniture than two little low tables standing on a bench on which is always placed a pan of burning coals which emits no vapor and serves to light their tobaccopipes in a particular niche screened by silk curtains are some elegant pagods drawn on paper before which on festivals they place burning lamps and candles and a curious cinderbox made of metal or stone in which the ashes and droppings of the incensecandles are preserved with many little ornaments and bouquets of artificial flowers  their kitchens surpass the best european ones in cleanliness and order and have besides the broad bench on which the servants sleep and the fireplace upon it two other fireplaces in which iron or stoneboilers are fixed they have nothing particular in their kitchenfurniture but broad knives with which they mince and press their meat into moulds before it is served up the blades are near six inches square made of polished steel with a wooden handle whose cutting edge is as sharp as a razor the cook takes one of these knives in each hand minces the meat without touching it and then presses it into moulds  this is all i can say of the chinese houses the public buildings of their towns on the frontiers are no other than the mansion of the surgutschei or chief of the merchants and a little mahomedan metsched in those places where the bucharians live  one of the pagodas of this frontiertown is built in the middle of the place where both the principal streets cross each other it is in the form of a chinese tower through which passengers can pass into both streets the opening beingin the form of a cross above this portico the building is square with a covered gallery round it the roof supported with pillars in another story above this the building is octangular and has eight bells which are easily moved with the wind and give a pleasing sound and round this part is another gallery like the one below in the lower story of this building stands the image of the god tjen which according to the accounts given me by the most enlightened of the chinese i met with reigns over    heavens the manshours call him abcho and the mongols tingeru that is heaven or a god of heaven it sits with nothing on its head but hair encompassed with a glory like the images of christ a straight sword in his right hand and his left lifted as if giving his blessing this figure of the pagod with the romancatholic images of the redeemer is perhaps the cause of the chinese surgutschei through whose favor i got a sight of this temple assuring me that the jesuits and their sectaries who lived in so great respect and authority at the court of peking worshipped it equally with the chinese probably these holy fathers may have given the resemblance of the chinese tjen to their representations of christ to excite more the devotion of their new converts near this idol tjen stands on one side two youths and on the other a girl and an old man in the upper story of the building is another idol in a black and white chequered cap also accompanied by a venerable old man and three young people neither in this or the other part of the building are any altars or ornaments but these round the pagodas their temples are only opened on feastdays and strangers cannot enter without permission yet the chinese show these idols no more reverence than those in the greater pagoda  the great pagoda is far more splendid and spacious and stands near the southern principalgate before the mansion of the surgutschei strangers may see it almost every hour of the day by applying to an underpriest who resides for this purpose in the forecourt the entrance to which is fortified with cheveuxdefrize we are conducted through two little elegant gates divided by a small building opposite these gates stands a little painted theater near which are erected on each side two high poles on which they spread on festivals large flags with chinese characters and on some peculiar festivals on this theater are exhibited little burlettas in honor of the idols where the merchants clerks are the principal actors the spectators standing in the street  in the little building between the gates of the first court of the temple within grates are two saddlehorses molded in clay as large as life and turned toward the south one is a sorrel bay represented as leaping and the other of a dun color with a black mane and tail walking each as led by two men dressed like grooms and sculptured with great skill near each horse stands a yellow silkflag painted with silver dragons but no further ornaments just within the gates of the first court are two covered scaffolds encompassed with a gallery on one hangs a large bell of cast iron pulled by a wooden club and on the other two enormous tymbals like those in kalmuck pagodas there are also here two other front buildings that serve as dwellings for the servants of the priests  from this outward court we enter through one large and two little painted and carved gates into the innermost temple which has small buildings on both sides divided into pagodas like alcoves with grated doors whose walls within are ornamented with pictures representing the actions of the gods thence we go to the hall of the temple which like the temple itself is surrounded with pillars varnished gilt and carved with an elegant chinese roof a gallery and little bells hanging round it this hall represents an armory in it along the walls on ledges or scaffolds are all sorts of gigantic and ancient arms and warlike emblems as spears scythes broad blades fastened on many spearpoles morningstars shields banners with hinds and dragons heads elegantly gilt opposite the foredoor is an enormous yellow flag embroidered with silver dragons and leafwork underneath which stand all kinds of altars skreened and several oblong tables standing on pedestals with chinese inscriptions from the gate behind this place passing a court about ten fathoms long and five broad we come to the temple itself through a short uncovered gallery decorated with flowerpots in the gallery before the temple supported by a row of pillars stand right and left of the entrance at some distance from the gates two bordered tables of black slate seven feet high on which is engraved a long detail of the foundation of the temple before the pedestal of the western table there is in a small case a little frightful image about six inches high the temple within is beautifully ornamented and exhibits on the walls many warlike adventures and marches of the chief idol all the idols are modelled in clay skilfully executed in gigantic shape and placed on pedestals four feet high on three niches which occupy the whole northern wall the niches are decorated with a great deal of carving and gilt ornaments the chief idol that occupies the niche in the center between two pillars wreathed with gilt dragons is gedsur or gessur khan called by the chinese coujil or the first and eldest by the manshours guanloe the chief god and to his history the abovementioned horses allude this figure represented splendidly sitting and dressed has a gilt beard a crown on his head and is in size four times as large as a man his clothes are not modelled in clay like the rest of the idols but are made of silk and elegantly formed he holds in his hands before him a board as if reading with earnestness on his right and left are two little female figures representing children of thirteen years of age one of whom holds a paper roll before this figure which represents nothing more than some peaceable prince or judge lie on the right seven golden arrows and on the the left a bow the mongols and kalmucks do not worship it as an idol but acknowledge it to be some great hero who lived near the source of the river choango and who like the bacchus and hercules of eastern tartary vanquished many monsters and they have in their language a long history of his heroic deeds before this idol is a spacious place encompassed with shrines and in the midst stands an altar with strips of narrow silk hanging over it as in mongalian temples about the altar are four standing figures in couples turning their faces to each other representing ancient counselors and generals of the deified gessur khan all the figures are of colossal size but not so large as the idol itself those that stood next these pagodas were dressed like judges and held boards in their hands like the gessur khan one had a white beard and seemed as if singing and of the two others one on the left was dressed in armor wore a kind of turban and carried a large sheathed sword on the left shoulder the handle upwards the other was clothed also in warlike dress very corpulent with a horrid redbrown face having in his right hand a spearpole with a broad blade at the end  in each sidedivision are two idols seated one in a military dress and one in that of a mandarin all four shorter than gessur khan but still of gigantic size  the warlike figure on the right represents the god masuang or the otschirboni of the mongols whose very look is frightful it is habited in armor and has a lookingglass on its breast one eye in its navel and on the head three faces of such a darkbrown color as to be almost black it has six arms two of which hold bent swords across the head the next figure on the right has also a lookingglass the next on the left something square resembling a piece of ivory but in its hands a bent bow as if going to shoot  the god that sits near him is called by the chinese zausching or the gold and silver god and by the mongols zagandsambola it has a black cap on the head with two obtuse corners in its hand a box filled with jewels and is dressed in rich chinese robes of state on one side stand two small figures one of which held a branch of a tree two similar figures accompany also the former one having an arrow in his hand and the other an animal in a division on the left is the god chusko or in the manshour dialect chuaaschan whom the mongols call galdi or firegod with a frightful fiery face in complete armor holding in his hand a drawn sword and though sitting appears as if suddenly rising one of his satellites is represented as if crying out the other bearing in his hand a bird like a duck another idol on this side is the god of bullocks niuo he is represented as quietly sitting in mandarine robes a crown on his head and like all the preceding ones with a round lookingglass on his breast the chinese take him to be the same with the jamandaga of the mongols his manshour name is said to be chainkillowa but the mongols call him barsbatir tygerhero the chinese are so suspicious that the most affable will refuse to give you the names of their idols and if they see any one attempt to write them down will give them a fictitious name of course i cannot take upon me to warrant all the names i here give particularly those of the chinese  the idol niuo has his table also on which they serve him on festivals with all sorts of baked meats dried fruits and other dainties besides other victuals even meat and whole carcasses of sheep before him are placed urns frankincense waxcandles and lamps some of which before the principal pagod are kept burning night and day among other things we see a vessel resembling a quiver filled with a great many long flat sticks made of split canes upon which are written little chinese mottos which foretell the fate of any one the ensuing year that shall draw out an arrow from the quiver on newyearsday at the east end of the table lies a hollow wooden black varnished helmet on which those who assemble for the sake of devotion in the temple knock with a beater no stranger dare knock this helmet though he is allowed to touch every other thing on the pagoda and examine the idols as near as he pleases  there is very little to be said of the rest of their public buildings the house of the surgutschei or director of the merchants stands on a great deal of ground and is very neatly furnished but has nothing peculiar except two flagpoles erected at the gate which are its distinctive marks and the solemn tribunal which stands in the hall the quarter where the bucharians live is in the southeast corner of the town where they have a little plain metsched or chapel built of wood the bucharians who imitate the chinese in their dress are badly and shabbily lodged notwithstanding their considerable commerce with the court of peking which is supplied by bucharian merchants who come here annually for that purpose whatever goods such a bucharian merchant or commissioner from peking wants to buy cannot be sold to any other chinese merchant on pain of severe punishment till the former has accomplished his purchase though the other should offer a much higher price  we will now speak of the chinese themselves and of the trade of that nation the merchants who reside here are chiefly nikanians or natives from the northern provinces of china especially from peking santchuen and some other cities they dwell here like travelers without their families for in the whole chinese market towns no woman is to be seen those however who feel their oriental blood are very galant customers to the women in kjachta who to the prejudice of their national honor are frail to an excess the chinese are also charged with unnatural crimes at least they are remarked for keeping young finemade shopmen with whom they are very familiar some also spend large sums in the mongalian quarters with females of that nation of whom i shall say more hereafter  all the chinese merchants here residing trade in partnership two or more together relieving each other by turns one conducting the business a whole year in kjachta whilst the other goes home for fresh merchandise on the arrival of the latter the former sets off with the goods bartered for and returns the next year with a new cargo the surgutschei presides with the power of a magistrate over the merchants here residing and not only keeps up a rigid police but directs the trade and gives orders respecting it that no advantage in commerce may be lost he is generally a man of rank and abilities but it sometimes happens that mandarins who have committed in other places certain misdemeanors are sent here to undertake this office for their punishment and reformation his characteristic mark of distinction is a crystal button on his cap and a peacocks feather behind the chinese give him the title of amban commander in chief no one dares approach him but bending his left knee in which posture he remains the whole time he is speaking and until he receives the ambans answer this magistrate has a salary but far inferior to the presents made him by the merchants in china it is the privilege only of high rank to ride in a fourwheeled carriage the surgutschei rides in a covered cart with two wheels only  the persons of the chinese are sufficiently known they are well formed and many young persons have sweet fair faces to which their small black eyes and jetty hair give an agreeable turn yet we frequently meet with broad manshourianlike masks high cheekbones broad noses between the eyes and extraordinary large ears which seems to be national to this people elderly men suffer their black beards to grow but all shave their heads in the manshourian way leaving only one thick lock on the crown which is universally black and which they braid into a tress hence they are good customers to the barbers whose houses are distinguished by little flags hung out at the door  their dress is very uniform and suited to the season they have particular clothes for the summer and winter and others for the intervals of these seasons this difference is most remarkable in their caps in spring and autumn they wear little round covers which barely hide the crown of the head whose standing border is covered with the skin of a seadog or seabear or with velvet having at the top a little button and a tassil of twisted red silk which overspreads the whole hat in summer they go about with wide strawhats resembling a bowl which shade the face these are neatly made cost often from four to six rubles each and have an elegant fringe of long red shining hair taken from wild tangutian cows the bos grunniens of linnaeus which the chinese call sinija the mongols sarlikukyr in winter they wear flat caps edged with foxskins and fringed at the top these do not cover the ears all european nations take off their hat in the presence of persons of rank but it would be a sin against chinese politeness and respect to do the same their garments vary in every season in the thickness of the linen and stuff of which they are made merchants of all ranks wear the same dress which is chiefly shining cotton stuffs kitaika generally black but sometimes dyed of a deep blue this is their dress from spring to autumn and consists of a garment which reaches to the ancles with narrow sleeves behind it is slit open to the waist and ornamented before with buttons the whole length over this they wear something resembling a womans jacket without sleeves passing the arm through a hole and above all a short waistcoat whose sleeves reach to the elbow made of silk and lined with the fur of the paws of sable fox or seabear with the hair outward persons of distinction wear their waistcoats made of curled black sheepskins sables or the seabears of kamschatka the latter articles are of importance are part of the russian trade and worn by the whole court of peking they wear also wide boots covered with black silk the soles of which are heavy half an inch thick and made of coarse cotton stuff daba glued together and are said to last several years on their girdle which fastens their undergarment they carry constantly long silk tobacco pouches and pipes and a case containing knives and the little chopsticks which they use as forks they are always so dressed both at home and abroad their persons and houses are kept with great cleanliness which seems the more surprising as all the domestic business is performed by men they are inured to cold of course their rooms are so little heated in winter that an european would be chilled in them many especially opulent merchants who do not meddle with packing and unpacking of their goods let the nails grow on their fingers to the length of half an inch i saw some whose nails were rolled up and grown into the flesh a european would not be able to imitate this odd custom without difficulty and would often lose his nails before they attained their proper shape and strength  their food is clean very nutritive and suited to the seasons they are remarkably fond of gardenfruits vegetables and sweetmeats and eat a great deal of garlic in summer they supply kjachta with coleworts girkins radishes and frenchbeans and cultivate for their own use spinach celery parsley yellowparsnips and a kind of colewort split like endive as other productions of european gardens do not ripen here they bring with them rice several sorts of peace also dried and in winter frozen fruits among their peace i remarked an oblong little green species called lodou which appears to be the phaseolus radiatus of linnaeus and which they suffer to attain their full growth during winter in water which they often change and then eat them raw instead of sallad the most common fresh fruits which may be had of the chinese are watermelons apples pinsa like green pommes de rennette pears a species of oblong quinces mugha citrons sweet and sour oranges wild chestnuts kidsa large walnuts a little red pentagonal medlars which grow wild in the northern parts of china and of which with sugar they make a cheap jelly called by the russian merchants postila they have also a fruit called alema which seems to be nothing more than a tkaschu apple and brought from the southern provinces they have also a very peculiar species of citron fuischu divided like a lilyroot into    parts without kernel and uncommonly fragrant but these are only distributed as gifts by the surgutschei of dried fruits the chinese have long raisins with a large kernel small black sourish raisins little fruits of a species of elaeagnus with a peculiar kernel called by the bucharians dshigda by the mongols zagda and by the chinese sazusa a species of reddish smoked prunes schuptuga with a kernel like a roller little black plums dried apples oranges squeezed and boiled in sugar preserved ginger black sweetish fruits with many flat kernels choder some of which are brought from persia and are called gorokum a shellfruit with a large round kernel encompassed with a sweet substance exquisitely mellow this substance is pressed together into flat cakes wrapped up in bamboo leaves and used as a cordial sweetmeat it is brought from the southernmost provinces and sold by the name of gaklo they have also other fruits with one or two nutlike kernels whole flat nuts in form of an apricotstone with a bitterish purgative kernel lansu or boigo common almonds pimenti and other cheap spices among their other eatables the chinese have crabs brought from the seacoast and salted which they eat with rice seasnails dried on strings holothuria tremula linnaei in chinese chairsan and a gristly sea production called dshileng with the latter they also brought me some particular dried flowers tschentscheng which they boil in soups and are brought from the southernmost parts they have sometimes also spongy roots of a waterplant consisting of members an inch long the chinese bring also in winter frozen pheasants to kjachta which they find on this side the chinese wall on the southern parts of the mountains which separate the rivers amur and choango but are mostly met with about the latter river they are said to be fond of dogs flesh and that it is publicly sold in the markets at peking but the chinese here will not admit it they also carefully conceal their eating as a dainty the legs of frogs and a species of large wingless grasshopper common about the river selenga probably because they have been laughed at for it by the russians  the usual drink of the chinese is tea which they keep almost the whole day on the fire and drink it whenever they are dry they boil it a second time make it very weak and use little or no sugar their strong liquors are the tarasur which may be compared to english beer mixed with brandy and a kind of brandy called in mongol chantschina many of the chinese are so much addicted to the free use of this and other russian strong liquors that we commonly see the lower class going about the town with chains on their legs the usual punishment for fighting and other excesses committed by people in liquor it is probably owing to this policy that a drunken chinese is seldom seen abroad  they cannot exist without smoking tobacco if at leisure they will never let a quarter of an hour pass without taking a pipe so that they are constantly smoking in the streets as the bowls of their pipes are not much larger than a thimble they have the pleasure of filling and lighting them often  the chinese of this place are affable and hospitable and though they never like to treat a stranger with any thing but tobacco and tea they are in this liberal to every visitor to acquaintances they will present sweetmeats and various sorts of fruits when they visit the russians let them be ever so strange they are impetuous and without paying any regard to rank very bold and often unpolite they will enter houses uninvited with their pipes in their hands sit down unasked and continue sitting as long as they please let the people of the house take it as they will it seems the russians have led them into this unmannerly conduct by their too great indulgence for in presence of their own superiors they always keep a respectful distance they are fond of games and when they have no business to employ them are generally seen playing at draughts at home in their own way or with little chinese cards in their hands  to gratify this passion they frequently buy many russian copper and silver coins to game with and purchase from the russians eatables and other little necessaries the cheaper  persons of distinction play in their hours of leisure with a rosary in their hands and some of the middle class carry such rosaries made of larch resin continually along with them which the sweat of their hands renders as hard and transparent as yellow amber and will fetch a good price among the mongols  in their trade and conduct with the russians they are exceedingly crafty secret and interested and hereby have a great advantage over the persons they deal with who are not a match for them the russians are strictly punctual and exact in trade and are kept to this by the surgutschei who strives all he can to advance its success but the chinese too often render the best regulations fruitless by their selfish giddy and chattering mode of dealing if not kept within bounds by the severe inspection of some commercial chief this has made the chinese wellacquainted with the value of russian productions and enables them to keep their own in a proper balance for the surgutschei punishes those who attempt to spoil anothers bargain by underselling him he also takes care that the markets are not overstocked for as the general rendezvous of the caravans from all the towns and cities of the chinese empire assemble in the mongalian courtquarters on the river tola     miles from kjachta they are only suffered to come from that place in moderate numbers to this frontier town in january may and autumn for this leave they pay a duty of five per cent for all russian goods on return this small duty is what gives the chinese the principal advantage over russian merchants  the goods are mostly brought here on camels yet the chinese make use of a bad kind of cart with two awkward wheels having two cross beams and a third passing the center through which the axletree is fixed and which turns with the wheels when the merchant caravans travel in winter through the step they carry with them felt tents which they erect at night in summer they have fine hutframes made of cane which they sold up together like a fan and put into wooden cases occupying no more room than seven inches in length and four inches in height and breadth and yet when spread out and covered with a sailcloth or mat two persons may sit and sleep therein and be entirely sheltered from the sun and rain they are usually    days on their journey to the next town situate on the great wall called zisongku or schanschiacho by the mongols kalgan or kalcha new gate and from thence to peking four or five days and from kalgan to santschuen about a fortnight  the nikanian tradesmen on the frontiers all understand the mongalian language in which the russian merchants talk to them either themselves or by appointed sworn interpreters many speak broken russ but their pronunciation is so soft and defective that a russian can scarcely understand them they cannot pronounce the letter r at all but sound it as an l they also divide by vowels such syllables which if joined together have more than one mute letter wherein the russ language is very rich these two defects are never observed in tartars mongols kalmucks and other asiatics who learn the russian language  the trade with the chinese is chiefly carried on by barter or exchange of goods the chinese come to the russian mart where samples are laid out and they choose what they like contracts for goods are sometimes made in the market but the chinese generally go home with the russian merchant to his house and there make the agreement at first it is settled what goods the russian merchant can and will take then the quantity and respective value of the goods to be mutually exchanged are agreed on and after having drank tea and both parties having finished their bargain they go to the warehouse where the chinese dealer marks all the bales of goods and other articles he has agreed for which is sometimes the contents of the whole shop this done the russian merchant goes to the house of the chinese dealer and inspects his goods enquires into the value and particularly if they are all perfect and having fixed on what he likes separates them from the rest and leaves a person in charge of them and to take care they are not altered or diminished till an opportunity suits to exchange the goods mutually according to agreement in this exchange the russian merchant rates the value of most chinese goods at a half a third and often at a quarter of the price at which he values his own which he can the readier do as siberian furs may always be bartered at double the price they are frequently bought for and are in goodness and value a very arbitrary merchandise without this advantage it would be impossible for the russian merchants who are at so great an expense for transporting them to pay a customhouse duty of  0 to    per cent for most of the goods they sell to and buy of the chinese hence it seems evident that a wholesale trade of current russian money would be injurious to the state and for this reason the court of petersburg has prohibited it the greatest disadvantage the russian trade labors under is that some merchants who arrive from the distant parts of the russian empire sell to the chinese at a lower valuation in order to be able to make their bargains and return the sooner yet there is a commercial establishment formed by a company of russ merchants in kjachta who by authority fix the prices of merchandise among themselves instruct the traveling merchants of this as soon as they arrive and endeavor to persuade them into what is right yet in spite of all this there being no severity of punishment inflicted on transgressors they cannot always prevent it besides there are many young russ merchants who by babbling when halfdrunk will let the chinese perfectly into all those circumstances which the rest would wish to have concealed  here follows a list of the prices and sorts of some kinds of goods exchanged by the russians and chinese according to a late regulation of the chief commissioner of the frontiers this list contains the highest and lowest prices from    0 to       the chief article of russian goods are furs the chief canadian furs imported by sea and

articles which the chinese are eager to purchase i must mention the isinglass which sells at present at    rubles the pud but formerly when the trade between russia and china was in an infant state a

ell gold gauze with silk flowers    rubles an ell tin    to    copecs per leaf and all sorts of foreign lookingglasses of the lesser sorts   next follow the chinese goods bartered for the above articles and transported throughout russia the silk stuffs which the chinese bring to kjachta are now much inferior in goodness and value to those they used to bring formerly their satins and damasks are also so thin and slimsy that they will scarcely do for russian cities rich and thick satins and other good stuffs are now seldom seen their thin taffeties if made of good silk and not oiled and their kitaika or nankeen may be considered as the best of all the woven goods in china even tea is not so fine and yet dearer than it was formerly the russian merchants however always choose the best sorts the article next in importance is their porcelain or chinaware in which they have evidently imitated the european porcelain in its strength fine forms and painting probably from patterns they must have received from canton i have taken notice of figures painted on their porcelain and on paper habited in european dresses and ornamented with representations of roman idols and regular copies of known copper plates at the house of a chinese i saw painted in colors pygmalion et loiseau en cage two original french prints merchants who sometimes bring german and very indifferent copper plates to kjachta find numberless purchasers among the chinese  i the chief articles brought from china are as follow fine silver in pieces cast and stamped which the chinese use instead of large pieces of money their form which resembles the hoof of a horse was in days of yore introduced into china because a horse by scraping up with his foot some pieces of massive silver discovered the first mine of this metal a pound weight of this silver in barter is valued at    rubles raw silk a capital article not brought in such quantities as the russians wish for a pud of the best sort is valued at   0 rubles or three rubles and a half the pound the inferior sort is sold at    rubles per pud raw and very pure cotton used by the merchants to pack their porcelain in from four rubles  0 copecs the pud

  ii the second chief division of chinese goods are ornaments and vessels of porcelain enamels etc with numberless trifles i will mention some of the principal for it would be as tedious to give a list of the whole as it would of the french fashions for the chinese are full as trifling as the french nation or the people of nuremberg in germany and they find plenty of insipid purchasers  common porcelain dishes with cups and covers at four rubles the dozen coarser ones with or without covers at three to  0 copecs the pair plates and dishes from five copecs to one ruble sweetmeat dishes at

rubles iron strakes for wheels and castiron axletrees two of the latter with boxes  0 copecs and    copecs per cwt for the strakes the chinese would not be able to get rid of these wretched goods and other kinds of iron work if iron after the abolition of the manufactory of irkuzkaja was not become so dear that it was sold in selenginskaja at three copecs per pound and dearer still at irkuzkaja the chinese have begun at the distance of    miles from kjachta to smelt raw iron in handblasts they do not forge any on this account buy their steel very dear from the russians but sell their castiron more advantageously  lacquered shrines with the best varnish from  0 to   0 rubles and more common ones lacquered on wood  0 rubles and upwards little ivory boxes five rubles boxes inlaid

copecs tygerskins seven rubles leopardskins two rubles iii the third division of chinese merchandise comprehends all sorts of tea eatables and a variety of dainties  good green tea or shulan one ruble per pound large boxes    to  0 rubles the best bohea or ladsumei two rubles per pound the tea tairza  0 to  0 copecs per pound lonchowoi tea    rubles per pud bohea called baichowoi five to eight copecs per pound and a variety of other teas at proportionate prices they have a kind of tea called kirpitschnoi tschai or brick tea because this tea is pressed into tables or cakes eight or nine inches long four or five broad and one inch thick it is prepared in the most northern provinces of china for the mongols who like the burats and russians beyond the baikal cannot do without it being an astringent and mixed with bloody water to form it into cakes it is very cloying if taken with milk and butter or as the russians do fasting with oil and flour on these cakes the chinese print or impress the name of the place where it is prepared and an encomium on it the translation of one that sell into my hands is as follows  from the manufactory junzen zedsi in the government of randshin in the second month of spring collected when the dew falls fresh delicate and salubrious tea surpassing the best species of tea suulu pejean contan fynsu jiupan ljuidsan an inhabitant of selenginskaja endeavored in vain to counterfeit this tea with the leaves of the dwarf elm the sasifragae crassifolia et pyrola rotundisolia for his tea was directly known not to be genuine because he had not given his cakes a proper solidity  chinese yellow tobacco or scharr at    copecs per pound sugar candy from  0 to    copecs per pound millet from  0 copecs to two rubles per pud wheatflour from  0 copecs to

copecs the pound chestnuts   to    copecs the pound walnuts  0 to  0 copecs per hundred confectionary and fruit jellies in sugar and honey from five to  0 copecs per pound etc etc etc hence we may see that furs hides some coarse manufactured goods lacquered wares glass and great cattle are transported into china and that raw and manufactured silk and cotton tea tobacco porcelain smallhouse furniture and toys are the objects of commerce with that nation eatables and flour were much dearer formerly than at present and much more sought after by the chinese  some of the poorer mongols have begun to grow wheat about the river orchon they buy still a great many horses and large cattle for the mongols are but yet poor in cattle and their horses are far inferior to the russian horses they buy up terriers mastiffs and all kinds of large dogs with avidity and pay very dear for them the watchtrade will no longer do with them as they seem to have been plentifully supplied with this article through the european seatrade at canton they even sell those watches that are out of order at a very moderate price to the russians at kjachta  the greatest advantage which russia reaps from the chinese trade is its being able to make a good use of those natural productions of the remotest parts of siberia which would not be worth bringing to russia especially those seabeaver skins which will not sell in europe and are now the very life of kamschatka commerce by selling them at high prices to the chinese and getting from them those necessaries which the russians would be otherwise obliged to purchase at an expensive rate and to the disadvantage of their balance in trade the revenue of russia is very much increased by the kjachta trade by the duties on goods sold into china and brought from thence in the year    0 the custom duties at kjachta amounted to no less than   0000 rubles      0l sterling and in both ensuing years not much less the principal goods are settled by a tariff those not so settled are some few furs cattle and victuals which pay    per cent russian manufactured goods    per cent all forts of sables    per cent lookingglasses    rubles per cwt and besides this all goods pay one ruble per cwt to support the customhouse and its officers and some articles   per cwt for the said purpose the following goods are free of customs in going out of the kingdom writingpaper russian lacquers colors fruit brandy and all its preparations and the following are admitted into the kingdom duty free raw and colored cotton glass beads false pearls white lead fans needles preserved ginger and other confectionary rice dogs musical and other instruments china earthen wares enamelled things and a variety of furniture and ornaments  formerly there was a private trade carried on by the crown in caravans which carried into china all fine furs sables black and gray foxes blue and black icefoxes otters beavers and among other articles brought back tobacco but these caravans that formerly went to peking are discontinued and the russian merchants may deal in all the above articles carrying them out without interruption from any private trade except ammunition gold and silver stallions mares reindeer elkhides tanned leather horseskins beaverhair potash resin and linen yarn and may bring in every thing except salt brandies poisons coppercoins and rhubarb which are prohibited of the last article whose purchase the crown has reserved as its prerogative nothing has been brought in from china these two last years but a commission has been lately signed for its introduction in future the contractor is a bucharian called abdusalam and his son abdaula abdusalams father was the first importer of it at kjatchta and monopolized the whole this bucharian family are from the town selin situated south of kokonoor bluesea toward thibet and is with all the towns of little bucharia subject to china the district consists of high barren mountains on which the rhubarb grows northwards from selin as far as kokonoor out of the clefts of the rocks the old good roots are known by their thick stalks are mostly dry in april and may having dug them out they scrape off the earth and hang them about on trees in the neighborhood till the gathering season is over when the tangutians who are the chief rhubarbgatherers take them down and carry them home the leaves are said to be round and to have no very deep incisions of course by this description the rheum palmatum is not the genuine rhubarb but the rheum compactum for i enquired of the bucharians respecting the former and they were unacquainted with the leaves perhaps the rheum undulatum which grows with rotten roots on some of the cold and moist mountains of siberia may grow also on the southern free and drier mountains of thibet and make the noblest rhubarbroots and perhaps this with care might be properly cultivated in some parts of dauria or on the jenisei by frequent transplanting  exportation of the best rhubarb is prohibited in china the mongols call schara modo yellow wood the chinese doncko of course the trade is a kind of smuggling one effected by bribing the superior officers and mixing the good roots with the bad it is brought on camels in woollen bags containing rather more than five puds its brokage reception and payment is under the regulation of a pensioned apothecary in commission at kjachta all the rhubarb is there brought and bored through by sworn workmen in presence of the bucharian merchants scraped and the refuse thrown aside the spongy hollow roots are of no value these are not taken but the good sound roots are received weighed and paid for as by contract the refuse is burnt though it might serve to make extracts and preparations of rhubarb for the hospitals  the bucharians at no small expense of the empress have already twice preserved rhubarbseed but it is unknown to me what species of rheum was produced from the first seeds the last time when a greek officer of the rhubarbcommission at kjachta one simon manuelofsyn skerletof attained seeds from one of his friends a bucharian they produced the known rheum palmatum but some persons who have seen the rhubarb in its native soil describe its leaves quite different as i have mentioned above perhaps this medical plant comes from more than one species of this genus which may be readily found out by experiments in the last parcel sent were some pieces of milkwhite rhubarb whose efficacy was equal to the best but its taste sweetish a selection is designed to be made of this and its true nature and properties enquired into  on the  th of april      i had an opportunity to be an eyewitness of the conduct of the chinese during a lunar eclipse when they idly suppose the moon is attacked by a dragon at night the guards of the police at kjachta made a rattling in the streets every quarter of an hour and every one might if he pleased have done the same this alarm began at dusk soon after the shutting of the towngates and continued incessantly all the time the eclipse lasted besides this noise made with boards and kettles the bell and tymbals at the pagoda were sounded and the barking of dogs stirred up by this noise increased the tumult the next day scarce a chinese was to be seen in the streets though at other times in the day they walk the streets in great numbers for the  th of april was set down in their almanac as an unlucky day in which no kind of business was to be done except bathing it is indeed remarkable that so keen a nation should attend so much to almanac prophecies which besides a deal of superstition point out the business to be done every day the conceit of delivering the moon from the attack of the bad aerial spirit arach ulla by noise clamor and firing of guns might be pardonable in the superstitious and uncivilized mongols but it is not agreeable to the usual prudence and discretion chinese delivering the moon of the chinese less pardonable is their foolish conduct in case of fire of which there have been late examples in kjackta a house accidently took fire and the flames were so rapid as to consume several habitations no chinese would attempt to quench them they stood in crowds about the fire and only sprinkled it occasionally with a few drops of water to appease the god of the fire whom they believe selected these houses as a sacrifice had not the russians on this occasion exerted themselves to the utmost the whole place probably would have been burnt to ashes  but notwithstanding this i do not see that the chinese pay any great reverence to their idols except that on the days of supplication which are appointed on the days of the new and full moon of every month every chinese goes once into the temple and without taking off his cap lays his hands together before his face bowing five times to every pagod and touching with his forehead the pedestal on which the pagod or burchan stands and then goes away on high festivals such as their newyearsday which like the mongols they call the white day and which is that which falls on the new moon in february and continues the whole month they hoist flags before their temples serve up on the pagodtables a great deal of provision which the priests consume at night in the siderooms of the forecourt and in honor of the idols exhibit daily on the theater i have mentioned a comedy satyrising generally unjust judges and magistrates they have also at this time many other entertainments but nevertheless do not neglect their business indeed this month is allowed by the russian merchants to be the best of the whole year for trade because the chinese are then very eager to buy and sell on account of the happy prophecies with which their almanacks are filled during this month  on the  th of april a mongalian taischa or prince arrived at kjachta as an ambassador boschka or commissioner his arrival was made known the night before by the chinese surgutschei for kjachta has also such a chief director of the russian merchants and called by the same name the surgutschei of kjachta received him early in the morning at his house where he equipped him after breakfast with a proper escort of soldiers and horses to conduct him safe to selenginskaja he came from the mongalian headquarters urga on the river tola and was sent merely to surrender some poor tangutians who were under the protection of the russian empire and had transgressed the limits in winter to a distance of    miles for the sake of hunting and had the misfortune to fall into a crowd of mongalian hunters who took them prisoners trifling as this offense may appear the chinese think so much of it that they will on such occasions send a legate or deputy as far as irkuzkaja to make heavy complaints for such an usurpation of right in encroaching on their boundaries this legate his secretary and two other mongols who accompanied him wore as badges of distinction and being on public business a peacocks feather hanging down from the hind part of their caps the button of the legates cap was white crystal those of his companions red glass  on the  th of april i lest kjachta at night and returned to tschikoi where the mongalian high priest promised to meet me and show me the temples i reached that place the next morning and saw here a species of duck not yet described by naturalists with beautiful varicoloured scythe feathers in their wings anas falcata which spend the winter in china and the summer on the daurian rivers building their nests on the lena and jenisei and soaring in little flocks with a whistling and shrilling noise  on the  0th in the afternoon i was enabled to continue my return to selenginskaja on the road we were benighted the unexperienced drivers having driven us out of our way on my arrival at selenginskaja the river selenga was almost free from ice but it shut up the tschikoi and chilok which last river was not open till the  0th of april the sun however was so warm as to cover with green and bloom the heights situated in the south on the   th of april we saw the first windflowers anemone pulsatilla which sprung abundantly from the sand and increased amazingly on the  0th appeared the first flowers of potentilla subacaulis which is the most abundant plant in the sandy plains whose leaves under the snow continue green and become the first food of the hungry flocks of the burats their sheep devour in equal quantities the dry leaves of veronica incana and both species of the sharp windslower which have a purgative property among the cattle and often cures them of the winter itch but their effect on the skin of the human body is the reverse and seems to be so corrosive as to raise blisters  leaving a student in selenginskaja to collect the vernal plants i pursued my way to udinskaja accompanied by mr sokolof my draughtsman and huntsman but did not go the usual road to this place along the selenga and the mountains that run along the side of that river but chose a byeway in order to take a view of the iron ore discovered on the kuitun with which the smiths of this place supply the whole district of selenginskaja with iron and steel i met in my way there with a number of sine skyblue magpies corvus cyanus with black heads and very long tails who come with the approach of spring from mongalia and china and build their nests on the selenga onon and argun common as this bird is we were not able to shoot one out of the numerous crowds we saw owing to their wonderful and frequent change of flight stretching away from the selenga we crossed a stony sandmountain and reached on the   d of april in a deep valley the river chilok which had been only two days free from ice and was very much swolen whilst they prepared the ferry we passed the night upon the shore near a good fire a dark night and a little rain and wind rendering our passage over the river impracticable till the next day when my wagons were brought on barges one after the other to chilokskaja which consists of  0 habitations of which two thirds are colonists of polanders settled here about six years ago they cultivate buckwheat have their land given them and grow plenty of watermelons the situation to the south being warm and the ground sandy the river chilok which is here very broad is so shallow in summer as in many places to be fordable there are a number of villages erected along this river and colonized with poles who have mixed with some few of the natives  we left the chilok crossed a mountain and came to tarbaganteiskaja on the river tarbagantei passing several villages in our road the population of this district amounts to  0  peasants and     new polish colonists all governed by wybornei or elders chosen by the villages and resident in targabanteiskaja from this place we traveled up the kuittun which springs from wild barren mountains truly deserving this appellation for there is not a green leaf to be seen in the whole district the hollow places or depressions had almost every where flowers probably the saltness of the soil may be the real cause of its cold nature increased by an adjacent woody and high mountain though there are colonists here also they cannot bring either slax hemp buckwheat peace or wheat to ripen but the industrious polanders try every means and are not dispirited  dunging the land on these mountains is of no use some polanders have tried it on turnepfields but it was found to wither the corn some of the inhabitants keep a great many sheep of the mongalian breed with black heads the ewes without horns they also keep a great number of goats whose furs are here an important article the flocks of these people seed in summer with those of the burats who will not admit a horned hegoat among the females that the offspring may not have horns to wound each other some of the burats assured me incredible as it is that one hegoat was able to serve  0 females in one day and render them fertile the kalmucks here told me the same among their lambs many have fine curled skins and many of this breed are fold at a great price to the chinese the polish colonists according to a custom in their own country in order to curl their sleece lace the lambs as soon as dropped tight up in linen and wet them the next day with warm water in which condition they leave them three or four weeks under the ewe till they think their tender sleece is sufficiently curled letting the strings looser at different periods as they find them grow and when the lamb becomes too big to keep it thus swathed up they kill it for the sake of the skin  the woods about the kuitun consist of fir and on the highest parts of larches quite covering the adjacent mountain which abounds with elks and other game and is full of iron ore in the neighborhood of this place near the brook katscherga are the remains of a goldmine consisting of some tolerably deep shafts but as the lode soon discontinued it has been deserted these  0 years about five miles from this mine runs another mountain eastward along the katscherga where the ground is richly colored with ochre the vicinity of iron ores the ironmine has been worked but not finding the ore in any great quantities has been left to private smiths who have never been molested nor the duty of  0 rubles for each handblast demanded of them these smiths here dig iron supply the whole district of selenginskaja with it and get near a ruble per pud at the first hand quantities of ore lie above ground and is gathered by the peasants in autumn before the snow falls when the ground is frozen and carried to their houses one man will often collect more than  0 puds in a day  we crossed the uda on the   th of april in the same ferryboat in which we passed the selenga and arrived early at udinskoi where on account of some business i stopped till next day this place is situated on a point of land formed by the union of the uda with the selenga and has now a newbuilt stone church and two wooden ones it is fortified with a timber wall has four towers and one gate behind the town is a fine newbuilt granary which supplies the daurian silverhuts with corn here live some substantial merchants trading chiefly in cattle buratian lambskins and daurian gray furs of which they send annually   or  00000 pieces to kjachta udinskoi and other little adjacent places are well situated for the transport of salt and corn to the daurian huts and the lead brought here from thence  near udinskoi begins the great high road to nertschinskaja that has a verststone every verst is three quarters of a mile like our milestones but has no where any hedges and is entirely left to nature because this road is chiefly used in winter for transporting goods and other public business when the brooks are frozen over from udinskoi we rode through a sandy firwood to the brook beresofka and then came to a dry narrow slope above   0 miles in length with little variation except that of being sometimes intercepted with brooks which flow into the uda has the uda on the left and a chain of mountains on the right the stations from udinskoi to tschitinskaja are well supplied by the chorinzian burats each is obliged to keep  0 horses and some camels in readiness for the use of those who travel on the business of the state and for the transporting of goods here and there is a cossack officer to command and regulate these poststations and the intendantgeneral of the whole resides at udinskoi here i saw for the first time the manner in which the burats broke in young horses for draught they have but few tame horses one of which they put into the shafts of each wagon but should they have more wagons than they have horses used to harness they will force wild horses to draw the tame one being put into the shafts a wild horse is placed on each side and girt over the saddle with a double rope in which there is a short club then lashing another double rope on the wagon they mount the horse and place him so near the wagon that they can wind the rope fixed to the wagon round the club on the saddle thus will the young wild horse run alongside the tame one till he is tired when they have others following the wagon ready to relieve him  near the second buratian post is a lake on whose sandy borders lies a great deal of white nitrous bitter salt which the burats fetch under the name of chudshir and boil it in their tea to make it thicker not every bitter salt will please them for this purpose but that only whose taste is urinous and alkaline and those who inhabit the mountains and cannot get this salt use sharp birchashes schulta as a substitute  in a buratian tent of which there were some here was a young chorinzian sorceress udugun whom i ordered to attend me in her magic dress but i found her so unskilled in her art that the tricks she played are not worth repeating her dress shall be described below her magic drum was carried after her by her husband whose office was to beat it when she returned the proprietor of the habitation took her crutches from her and placed them over the door by raising the felt roof  after traveling about    miles further where the river onon branches into three arms and where i stopped on the   th at lossiowo simowic and sent for foam sorcerers i visited the damba who resides in the neighborhood and is the head of the most numerous chorinzian tribe no sorcerer would appear under a pretense that they were gone to some distant parts to practice their magic art the chorinzian burats who inhabit the country between the chilok and baikal and beyond the mountains on both sides the ingoda to the onon consist of eleven tribes belonging to the regency of nertschinskaja and pay their jassak or tribute in furs most of them are rank heathens devoted to their magicians yet the priests of lama whose zeal for conversion is uncommonly great endeavor to spread among them their better superstition which contains however some moral doctrine they have already among them a geshul with    common lamas or priests some nobles or saissangs and a taischa or prince followers of lamaism  in my way to a mine at the distance of    miles on the  0th of april i stopped at the tents of the buratian saissang schantan to ask him for a guide but in hopes at the same time of meeting with a famous chorinzian sorcerer disappointed of my latter object i went directly to the metallic mine about seven miles further on called the mungut mine the ores here consist of compact massive leadblinde containing per pud about seven pounds of lead and one dram of silver and also an alloy of copper of which more than   000 puds have been dug  it is designed to erect by degrees in this whole road to nertschinskaja russian stationvillages in order to release the burats from the obligation they at present lie under of furnishing horses to travelers about a mile northwest of the village pogromna is a mineral spring which if largely drank of causes a kind of deafness and vomiting and is used by the burats against various inward complaints with great success but it has proved mortal to some russians who have immoderately used it in severe distempers i rode to the place with an intent to examine into it but the spring being frozen over i was obliged to defer it till my return about the spring were many dry bushes stuck in the ground and left by the burats after having drank the water  six miles from the pogromna the burats of the tribe of scharazkaja have a poststation here i ordered a chorinzian sorceress who lived in the neighborhood to be sent for in order to see some of her magic arts her name was labantsika she came accompanied by her husband and two other burats each of whom carried a magic drum she told me she had not the full number of her drums for that on feastdays she used nine she herself carried two crutches sorbi each of which was ornamented at top with a horses head and had many little bells holbuga about her with the same kind of bells in bunches was her leathergarment full from her shoulder to the ground hung down about  0 black and white serpents nutchal made of varicoloured pieces of fur and furs of weasels and ferrets fastened one to another like ribbands among the serpents one at the end was divided into three parts which she called mogoi and which above all things must not be omitted in their magic dress her cap was covered with an iron casque with three branching horns on each side like those of a deer she was at no loss to play off some pieces of witchcraft though it was broad day and seemed skilled in her profession she began with divinations slow in the beginning but violent afterward and began to leap and roar in her incantations at the sound of the magic drums in which she was accompanied by the burats who formed a circle round her during the invocation the sorceress seemed to be convulsed halfswooning and putting often her hand over her face and thus concluded during her first songs she feigned to run out of doors but was prevented by two burats who stood at the door after many other suchlike fantastic ravings she ran always singing toward three burats who were sitting with their drums on the left side of the hut once she took her crutches in both hands and jumped leaping as it were out of the smokehole as if she wanted to draw the aerial spirits with her crutches into the hut afterward she seemed gay and begged to have questions put to her which she answered singing and swinging herself backwards and forwards at last she asked for some brandy and prophesied from behind the liquor that i should be happy and travel much farther by sea and with this she ended  i have given this woman as an instance of the present art and dresses of buratian sorceresses in order that my readers may compare them with those of other nations whose sorceries have been or may be related see the lapland magician etc and judge between them  on may the  th at daybreak a great deal of wet snow sell which with the stony and miry roads made our way almost impassable and extremely toilsome we could scarce travel half a mile without stopping to give the buratian horses which seemed to consist only of hair and bones time to recover breath and strength with the greatest pain however and loss of time we passed the uda and crept over another mountain covered with larches and late in the afternoon found ourselves at the distance only of    miles from the place we left at break of day we were fortunate however to meet here with a deserted winterhut with a slove but without roof door or window where we slept and were sheltered from the snow but our greatest pains were to find wood under the snow which lay an ell deep we collected all the superfluous wood of the hut and thus made a fire but it occasioned so insupportable a smoke that we were obliged to stay without in the snow till the wood was nearly burnt out two of my wagons were not so happy as to reach this wretched smokehole but were obliged to pass the night in different places of the wood though we sent back all the horses we had which were able to move  next morning after a chilling night our desarthabitation looked like a field of battle near it stood our horses and wagons of which we had  0 but    of them having died in the night with the frost and hunger lay stretched out on the snow and had attracted all the crows and ravens of the forest whose cawings rendered the place still more dreadful a spent horse was set at liberty from a wagon and it fell without looking out for a birchbush which is the winterfood of the buratian horses in this district in our wretchedness however the birds of the forest which stimulated by hunger gathered about our hut gave me no little pleasure we threw rubbish out of the hut which still further decoyed them so that we could shoot a great number of rare birds through the windowholes here i got seven new species of unknown birds some of which i never could meet with afterward as they inhabit the innermost and thickest part of the forest and are very shy these were turdus ruficollis and alpinus motacilla cyanura emheriza minuta ruslica chrysocilla et spodocephala toward night we found several little birds in the snow killed by hunger and the frost and a little species of bluetailed hedgesparrow motac cyanurus which though extremely shy flew into our hut for shelter and hopped boldly about  it was a joyful circumstance that the change of the moon on the  th of may brought a serene day which gave us hopes of deliverance from our wretched hermitage where we were blocked up by the snow and whose cold and dripping waters became more and more insupportable i dispatched early in the morning an interpreter on horseback to get fresh horses from the next poststation situated on the great road at the distance of    miles they were brought in the evening but almost as poor and miserable as those which lay dead before us we were able however this day to fetch the wagons left behind us and lying another night in this hovel very scarce in provisions the next morning we proceeded on up to our knees in snow dirt and water in order to lessen the load of the horses through the mountainous wood notwithstanding this help we could not get further with the empty wagons than four miles and a half and were obliged to put them out at the next birchground to give them time to refresh themselves with birchtwigs but with all this we should not have been able to have got much further had not the burats sent us from schaschanoor fresh horses and camels the latter in case of necessity are put before the wagons and a felt rolled up and tied between the poles or shafts is to lie as a yoke betwixt the camels neck and the hunch on his back thus did the camels draw us though slowly yet without stopping through the valleys overflown with mud and snowwater some camels however are so obstinate as not to draw in different spots nor can they be made with the greatest blows nor with the rope drawn through their noses this day we crossed the schibirtu and two brooks which flow into the konda from the schibirtu to the konda the wood is intercepted by a steep track of rocks from which the snowwater rolled in such torrents as to resemble so many rivers and swelled the konda so much that we could not pass it without a bridge and as we could not construct one that day and our posthorses and camels longed for rest we stopped at some buratian tents that were there erected  as soon as the bridge was finished next day over the deepest arm of the river i ordered the wagons to cross and we did the same on the camels but scarcely had we reached the opposite bank but the rising water dragged away the bridge with much difficulty we traveled on every thing seemed overflown with a general flood the smallest brooks were so deep that we durst not pass them had we not contrived a peculiar kind of bridge of distress which was many times afterward very useful to us we sought for example for a spot where the brook was the narrowest and its banks steep then felled down two smooth firtrunks and some burats who were to ford the brook on horseback dragged them across with ropes and as these rested on the two opposite banks our wagons could pass expeditiously on them the axle trees which in this country go round with the wheels turning on these trunks with the wheels and horses in the water after having crossed several frozen rivulets in this manner we came at last to more even ground and got on pretty well but i must not omit mentioning a new species of ducks which i met with in this road anas histrionica which inhabit the east of siberia only on the mountainlakes and torrents and as they seek for the wildest rockwaters the russians call them kamenuschki that is cliffducks they swim quite plunged in the water so that nothing but their necks and breasts appear they dislike flying but dive when apprehensive of danger and do this wonderfully  on the  th of may we reached the bottom of the partition mountain which divides dauria from siberia this mountain rises gradually with a gentle ascent till we come to that steep rocky part which by the name of jablenidaba separates the brooks of the baikal and lena from those of the amur this mountain which is    miles broad consists of granite rock and extends itself from the mongalian boundaries beyond which it runs between the tschikoi and onon with many windings uninterrupted to the eastern ocean its height appears moderate for there are here and there sidemountains which surpass it in loftiness come whose summits during the whole summer are covered with snow though it melts very soon on the partitionmountain but the rapid streams of the waters which run from it to seas so remote are an evident proof of its loftiness it is peculiar that no regular rockstratum is to be met with in the white mountain the pieces of rock lay without regularity large and small together mostly overgrown with moss in which between the cliffs some few trees grew and the wheels of our wagons received great damage it would be in vain to mend this road as the snowwaters which have deprived these ancient mountains long ago of their earthy covering would soon spoil the whole the whole mountain is burnt up and the trees which are larches and birchbushes grow only on the east side with a few pines and furs along the brooks we passed this mountain fortunately but it being eight miles from the top to the next poststation could not reach it before night and as at the bottom the road was bad and our horses fatigued we took up our lodging in the wood and reached the station the next morning where i waited till the  0th of may for some of my people who had stopped in schakschanoor for the sake of hunting  on the   th i continued my journey for titschinskoi the country here became more open and agreeable and only the highest mountains are covered with wood the valleys are gravelly and among the small stones is a great deal of quartz and milkwhite chalcedonlike pebbles i stopped at a village on the river ingoda five miles short of titschinskoi and ordered a raft to be constructed in order to ride down the river as the road alongside of it was quite overflown on the warmer mountains about the ingoda the larchtrees began to put out their leaves the birches were dropping their juice and the rhododendrum dauricum showed its purple bloom  on the   th we got upon the rafts passed titschinskoi and on the   th landed    miles below it near the village charamangut the russians are vulgarly called by the burats manguts which means a goblin and is a lasting mark of the old opinion the burats entertained of them the founder of the village was blackhaired and was therefore called charamangut i e black russian which name the village retains to this day  having slept on shore the preceding night the number of fieldmice on all the plains and even grounds between the ingoda and the argun is incredible they are of a particular black species found in the step of the jenisei mus oeconomicus make just underneath the turf spacious nests with side caves and paths within where they store up winterprovisions filling them with various cleaned roots it is scarce comprehensible how a couple of little animals for there are seldom more than two mice in one winterhabitation should be able to dig out such a quantity of roots from the dry turf carry them to their cells it being often found that one provisioncave has contained eight or ten pounds of cleaned roots and each nest has three or four or more such caves these mice often dig their nests at a great distance from the cave and where they are in great numbers we see little holes in the turf from whence they took out the root they clean them on the spot and then drag them to their home in order to convey them the easier they make flat little paths in the turf on all sides from the opening of their subterranean magazine the roots they collect are the sanguisorba in tunguse schuddu the polygonum viviparum in tunguse mykir and a kind of a meadowplant with flowers similar to the windflower chaerophyllum temulum which from its stupefying poison and dangerous effects cannot be eaten by any human being the tunguse say the mice gather these roots in order to intoxicate themselves on their feastdays and indeed this pernicious little root resembling a turnep is devoured by the mice with the other roots in the higher steps of dauria is a lightgrey species of mouse smaller than these the mus socialis which i have described about the jaik it leads an almost similar life and makes cells about its nest which it fills with the onions or roots of a cinnabarred lily lilium pomponium and a small tasteless leek allium tenuissimum which grows on the sand those about the jaik store up the tuliproot  no where does the industry of these little animals become more useful to men than in dauria and some other districts in the east of siberia where the pagan nations without agriculture act with these poor little creatures as do unjust lords with their tenants they are the peculiar object of the tunguse who by plundering the cells of these fieldmice often live during a whole winter when these animals have filled their caves in autumn the tunguse go in search of their holes which they call urgan and feel with their foot or the handle of their spade where the turf is soft and seldom fail to hit upon the nest or some provisioncell they immediately know all forsaken holes and when they see the little paths not recently made hollow the earthholes not cleaned and no traces of dug roots in their neighborhood they pass them by looking for the wellstored caves of the fugitive mouse and pulling out the poisonous roots carry away the remainder the sanguisorba root is in form like the former but not so tough nor so white and may easily be distinguished from the black sanguisorba which the tunguse are fond of drinking as tea the mice save their lives at least from these robbers but the wild boars who live on roots as do the tunguse and are their rivals in this respect search diligently for these urgans or nests and often devour their benefactors and provisions together  mr gmelin relates something similar of the marmots which abound in dauria but these neither make their holes flat beneath the turf nor do they fill them with roots spending the winter in a state of lethargy  along the whole course of the tura as also in general in the mountainous country between the ingoda and the onon are no russian habitations except a few villages on the former nor is any agriculture going forward though the place is fit for it the chorinzian burats wander about here in summer with their slocks and some poor tunguse tribes not only poor individually but poor in people wishing to get a livelihood about the russian villages are constant inhabitants of this district  none can conceive a more magnificent sight than the woodless and steep mountain along the onon whose southern side was enamelled with the peachcoloured bloom of the wild siberian apricot and its north side with the deeppurple blossoms of the rhododendrum dauricum through my whole travels i never saw so romantic a region on the   th of may i rode along such mountains to akschinskaja where i found a ferryboat ready to carry me across the onon this is a fortress erected in      containing one church the regency some storehouses officers houses and eight caserns the house of the commandingofficer was burnt down last year and is not yet rebuilt as the number of the working garrison is but small the fortifications are not yet completed the common dwellings of which  0 new houses for colonists make the greatest number will according to the plan laid down when they are increased form a regular suburb without the fort which was erected to quarter a number of light troops to keep the country free from several gangs of fugitive mongols famous in this country for robberies committed by them as far as the russian boundary at that time  00 tunguse entered the cossack service who with as many cossacks from nertschinskaja occupy the frontier guard on the onon and argun and on the western side of the partitionmountains the posts are guarded with cossacks from selenginskaja and irkuzkaja and a party of mongols subject to russia of which in case of necessity   00 men must perform regular military duty on the daurian line half of these troops are divided on the frontier guards each commanded by a corporal of militia the other half is together in troops and have their quarters at proper distances in order to be ready and in motion when required by degrees these frontiers like those of the irtish and the ob will be guarded by a line of fortresses and posts wherever the situation of the country will admit of it the plan being at present regularly laid out  i stopped at akschinskaja till the   th in order to acquire some knowledge of the country and of the rattlechace against the stepgoats or antelopes these chaces are the chief delights of the mongols and the daurianstep tunguse the mongols call it ablachu and the russians oblawa they are chiefly performed in an open district toward a mountainriver or wood especially in autumn when the horses are strong parties of  00 or  00 men who ride well and have several horses are all armed with bows and arrows and each has a skilful hound thus making a pack they elect a chief who regulates the chase as long as it continues dispatching in the morning where they mean to throw off three or four sharpsighted men who are to look out for game then follow them and if these see it in flocks they stop till the whole body of hunters join them giving signs by turning their horses to the side where the game is feeding and showing them in the same manner how they are to divide after this signal the body divides into little parties disposing themselves into the form of a large bow one man not more than  0 or  0 fathoms from another the end of this movingbow approaches the place where the game is said to be and the hunters hide themselves as much behind the heights as they can till they have enclosed it then the whole circle draws nearer together and as soon as the game is aware of their danger and takes flight the whole body rushes after it fullgallop drive it together and shouting kill it with whizzingarrows this kind of arrow is called by the russians switstung by the mongols dsi it is a heavy arrow with a rhomboidical sharp iron point five fingers broad at the lower end of which is a hollow bone button which receives the air through holes when such an arrow is shot with it makes a hissing noise through the air and where it falls makes a broad and mortal wound  with this weapon the daurian stepnations perform regular equestrian exercises if in the course of the chase there is any river or woody mountain the sport is the greater for the antelope of this district will never cross any water let the hunters with their hounds be ever so near they will rather try to save themselves by jumping they are almost as shy before a wood as soon as they are driven among the trees they become so bewildered and frightened that they will not run  00 fathoms further but knock their heads and bodies against the trees and sink down breathless the hunters are no losers in either case sometimes wolves and other animals of prey are by chance within the circle and their skins add to the gratification of eager pursuers if the district be all open the whole party must strive to conceal themselves until some have brought the game within the circle with their whizzingarrows  the birdcherry was now may  0th just entering into bloom which will lead my readers to judge of the influence of the daurian climate upon plants  all the rivers which flow through dauria and empty into the amur are plentifully stocked with fish and particularly those fish that are rare in some siberian rivers there are two sorts of scalefish one uncommonly delicious called by the russians kon because it saves itself by its incredible swiftness from the nets small barbels met with throughout siberia are also here the russians call them ssan and their little shape and bitter taste only distinguish them from the wolga carp here is also a small species of shad some and a species of bjeluga which comes singly through the amur into the onon and ingoda and is called here kaluga common pikes are here goldcoloured and variously spotted like indian fish besides these the onon has common sturgeons lenki taimeni and a species of large salmo oxrynchus known in the baikal by the name of morskoi sig crabs and a variety of small fish the common slimemuscle is found here on the lakes of an enormous size i received some shells above half an ell a russian ell is threefourths of an english yard long and between three and four inches thick the onon which flows here over a more stony ground throws out on the banks cornelian and onyx pebbles which would be of great value if large or cleftless pieces could be found pieces of green yellow and striped jasper are quite common of which there must be some in the mountains which the onon breaks through the above cornelian and onyx stones are said to be more abundant and finer about the argun the wilds of gobei in mongalia are most famous for such stones and are considered as their native place  on the   d of may they brought me from the tunguse chase antelopes decren of various breed and age and i busied myself the whole day in dissecting and describing them what is most particular in these animals and which no other species of antelope has is that with the bucks horns the larynx also grows to so enormous a size in all its parts that the old ones look as if they had a large wen they have also underneath the foreskin of their bellies a wide oval bag with a peculiar opening exactly similar to the purse or bag of the moschus except that the antelopes is quite empty perhaps it may be filled with some matter in the brimming season but the above season is late in autumn and they get their young only in june when the sanana or purplelily is in bloom their young if brought up in houses become exceedingly tame so as to run about the house or abroad as they please and will never go away but if pursued by a dog will fly to the house on the open steps however they are very wild and swifter than the saiga and will not suffer the huntsmans approach  the daurian sheep are incontestibly the largest in the world and far surpass the kirguisian they grow and fatten by feeding solely on the rods of the bush robinia caragana which the tunguse call altagana  i meant to sleep on the   th of may in kubuchaiku but having received intelligence by an interpreter i sent on before that the tunguse had killed a stephorse i determined to ride the whole night to save this rare animal from the corruption of the present hot weather my guides took this night a wrong way on the step on which there is no road but where travelers direct their way by the sun we were already seven miles from the fortress toward the mongalian frontiers and seeing the error of my guides i took out my compass and showed them the direction we were to steer before daybreak we arrived at sassutschinskoi karaul where i stopped to breakfast then hastened to the guardstation kulussutai a distance of  0 miles since i last slept here mr sokolof and i parted for i dispatched him on a tour along the argun to make his observations on the vegetable kingdom of that district  in the wild steps about the tarei are continually seen at a distance that species of wild stephorse called by the mongols dshiggetei longear in the mongul country particularly in the wide waterless step of the gobei they are said to be met with in large herds but that within the russian frontiers since so many guardposts have been erected seldom any such herd headed by an old stallion and consisting of from  0 to  0 mares is to be met with but only a fugitive young stallion or mare which has run singly from the mongalian side pursued by the old ones and these are only found on the steps about the tarei and the utmost corner of the district of the argun near abagaitu  these dshiggetei can neither be called horses nor asses they are like mules between both hence it was that messerschmed who first observed this animal came to call them fertile mules mulus dauricus faecundus mules they are not but a genus of their own and have a much siner shape than a mule that kind of stepass called by the western kirguese kulan is not to be taken as such for the latter according to the truest accounts are but wild asses of onagorsof which inhabit the mountainous steps of western tartary as the dshiggetei do the mongalian deserts the latter has certain beauties which render him far preserable to the ass an uncommon light body slender limbs a wild fugitive appearance and finecoloured hair are his advantages over the ass the ears also are better proportioned than those of a mule and being livelily erected suit him well and with these beauties it may be overlooked that his head is rather heavy and his hoofs like those of an ass the straight angular back and the ugly cowtail are it is only deformities it is head is clumsy it is breast large cornered below and somewhat pressed together the backbone is not like that of a horse hollow and round nor as straight and angular as an ass but calflike bent outward or rising in the middle and obtusely angular the ears are longer than those of a horse and shorter than a mules the mane is short wild and perfectly like that of an ass and so are the tail and hoofs the breast and shoulders are narrow and not so fleshy as those of a horse and the flanks and hindquarters are rather lean and thin the limbs slight and tolerably high the color is a lightyellow brown the nose and the inside of the legs of a sallowyellow the mane and tail blackish and along the backbone runs an elegant brown and black stripe broad along the croup and slender toward the tail when the animal stands it carries its head high and if running stretches its nose in the air that which i had an opportunity to dissect and describe at kulussutai was a mare three years old which was catched singly and killed upon the step two young stallions were killed a little before by the tunguse and their flesh which they esteem as the greatest dainty of all game was eaten this animal had now its long and woolly winterhair which looked somewhat more sallow and was very smooth and shining the swiftness of the dshiggetei surpasses all imagination and is therefore become a proverb among the mongols  no horse ever so swift can overtake it it can therefore be only killed from a hidden retreat where the wind is against the huntsman and when the animal comes within reach of his arms the most numerous rattlechace would be incompetent to catch them no sooner does a herd of these animals see any thing suspicious for instance a huntsman lying or creeping on the ground at a distance than the stallion and guide of the herd runs in a large circle twice or thrice round the object of his fear and then with the whole herd takes his flight hence it happens that mares are more seldom killed if the mares lose a stallion the whole herd scatters and divides and thus often fall a prey to the hunters  were there a possibility of taming these animals there would not be better coursers in the world but their wildness is not to be overcome if there had been any means of taming them the mongols and other asiatic nomades into whose hands so many colts fall would have effected it it is remembered that on these frontiers many years ago a cossack of nertschinskaja fed a captive dshiggettei colt and endeavored for several months to tame him but it remained wild and at last killed itself by forcibly jumping yet with proper prudence and care other attempts might be made with very young foals caught a few days after they are dropped which perhaps might not be in vain it would be worth giving a premium to those that should succeed as it would be obtaining a new domestic animal that by its speed might be very useful  mr sokolof left me at kulussutai but i remained here till the   st of may and was so busy in describing the various natural curiosities especially of the animal kind that were brought me that i had scarce time to eat or to sleep the richer the little district toward the argun is in little lakes and marshes the more it abounds in watersowl there are a great many not only common but also indian crows ardea antigone and what they call the numidian virgin ardea virgo demoiselle de numidie also bustards of an enormous size and cocks which are called by the mongols sachaltu on account of their finefeathered beards and having under the tongue the opening of a wenlike waterbag the size of a large gooseegg the bird often weighing above  0 pounds  in these steps resides also a very remarkable little animal which is even more abundantly to be found on the selenga known in dauria by the mongalian name of ogolona it has the greatest similitude to the smallest earthhare lepus pusillus and with the cliffhare lepus alpinus which i have described the difference between these three little animals is much more than between the common hare and the rabbit the daurian earthhare is about the size of the cliffhare but of a paleyellowish gray color its ears resemble both the other species are large and round the head obtuse short feet with the usual divisions and no tail it burrows in the sand like a rabbit and leaves its holes only about noon or night to feed which it does on the bark of the daurian pyrus baccata on which account it inhabits the islands and banks of rivers in the morning and at night we may hear their shrilling and whistling voice where they dwell toward autumn they gather about their holes little round heaps of about one foot in diameter made of all sorts of plants and with the gray mountainspeedwell stuff up all the passages to their holes but fill them again if consumed and the weather be severe this animal is the usual prey for the stepcat so common in dauria  on the  0th of may i entertained myself before my departure with a clever tunguse witch who was at a relations in this neighborhood she came as soon as it was dark near a fire lighted before a tent and some young lads carried her dress magic drums and crutches she had also along with her a great number of young women and girls to assist them in tungtse sorcery singing her dress which she put over her bare skin before the fire was similar to that of the chorinzian sorceress viz a leatherrobe ornamented with a great many iron rattling toys and brass ornaments and from it hung down behind from the shoulders a quantity of variedcoloured serpents or tails each of which had a little bell on her cap were leatherhorns only instead of iron ones and on her shoulders she had also some figures of frogs her drum was more than an ell in diameter and was first warmed over the fire to give it a deeper sound she took it first in hand herself put it down on the north side of the fire ordered the choir of women to sit before her in one row and the men round about in a circle then began turning her face to the north and made her incantations with a terrible voice at last she gave her drum to her husband to beat and began to leap with the crutches in one hand then raved made various contortions during which she pretended to be out of her mind by hiccoughing imitating the voice of the cuckoo and other odd sounds and in the end whilst she was singing a question was read to her which she pretty well guessed after this she asked for brandy and being desired to answer some more questions replied that she could command but three spirits one every evening one of which she said lived toward midnight one toward morning and the third toward evening she could therefore answer no more than two questions she then began her conjurations toward evening and called upon her aerial spirit daroldshe often looking up to the shining moon with her hands over her eyes as if she saw something coming from far when she was to answer the third question she repeated her magic hymns toward morning and all the questions we had made false on purpose to deceive her she guessed so well that it astonished me and made me almost suspect my interpreter had told her how to act beforehand the tunguse said she had not been instructed by any other magician but formed herself and whilst a girl had lived a long time in a foolish melancholy state but the cossacks assured me that her master was an old sorcerer upon the onon to whom it happened that his clothes were stolen away by some professors of the art traveling at that time in this district and that since this he had left off his business  i had now on the   th of june an opportunity of enquiring into the nature of the mineral spring mentioned before on the brook pogromna this well has not been dug more than four or five years and is similar in quality to the seltzer water i shall not determine from any experiments i made myself as the well was not now in perfection but from the experiments of mr georgi made the autumn following at my recommendation  from a variety of experiments then made by this gentleman it may be collected that the mineral spring of pogromna contains a great deal of ether a strong mineral alkali a small degree of iron and a still smaller quantity of chalk such as may be met with in all pure waters and a very little selenites which the sulphurous smell of the residuum on coals demonstrates to the first three ingredients the known efficacy of the water ought to be ascribed and it may arise from the superabundance of ether that the russian peasants who drink this water as do the burats but immoderately as a cure for disorders or whenever they pass this way feel a certain heat and giddiness of head which has given to this spring the name of pjanaja woda ie intoxicating water this effect neither i nor my people perceived who drank of it but afterward we felt an irritation of the nose like that excited by wine or beer rich with ether  the burats use it against all disorders and even to cure lameness and come here annually to bless the well with prayers for seven days three or four times a day drinking it renders them very weak and somewhat severish but many find a cure in all kinds of disorders they know nothing of any pernicious or mortal effect it has and we may readily see in two cases related by the russians that it is only by an immoderate use of it preceded by some disorders that makes it fatal round about the wells have been hung on bushes all sorts of rags and shoulders of sheep and oxenskins on which were written the names of those who had received benefit from the waters their cure and the blessed day of their recovery near one well for there are three or four stood a long staff with two cross sticks on which hung little boards with tangutian prayers which turned with the wind  on the  0th of june at night i reached selenginskaja which lies on the right border of the selenga quite encompassed with sand mountains in all the islands of the selenga of which there are many the little sandbare ogelona was seen in great abundance the mongol boys who are fond of roasting these little animals are peculiarly skilled in catching them and call them alakdaga speckled colt both mongols and burats told me that these rare hares do as they say the common hedgehog does in england and the large housetoad in russia respecting cows and the nightswallow respecting goats that is suck their udders at night this however is certain that they are seen at night among the sheepflocks whom they frighten by their jumps  i now determined to return to kjachta partly to give them an account of what i had met with on the frontiers between russia and china where i had been and partly to examine into the beautiful southern districts about the selenga and tschikoi in this season and to collect the plants that had attained their perfection i took therefore the usual road to petropaulofskajakrepost where is established on the upper frontier a customhouse that collects a duty on all goods carried to kjachta and examines all goods and bales brought from thence that nothing may be carried away without being stamped for this reason the sideroads are stopped against merchants and the corner between the tschikoi and the selenga has a barrier to reach the fortress the tschikoi is to be crossed which a little farther downwards falls into the selenga from whence the fort took its old name strjelka which implies a cape between two united rivers and agrees well with the former situation for it was formerly situated in the very corner where both rivers meet the goods which are brought from kjachta by land pass before this place in barges and are carried down the selenga over the baikal and then farther on on the angara and tunguska into the jenisei and those barges arriving from the angara over the baikal are drawn up the selenga to this place  on the   th of june i left poworotnoi the first station on the road to kjachta at    miles from selenginskaja on the left and went straight toward the selenga to see a mongalian house of prayer erected at the common expense of the three tabungutian tribes and then went on to kjachta the road to which is fenced in on both sides with hedges and where i arrived on the   th i left it again on the   th in order to go to selenginskaja which i reached on the  0th of june two days before i was a spectator of an extraordinary pagan worship ordered by the superior chambolama out of compliment to me it consisted in a formal solemn blessing which he performed himself and assembled on the occasion a great number of his clergy  i was employed some days in selenginskaja in collecting several things relative to natural history and arranging what i had hitherto collected in the mean time i ordered every thing to be ready for my return to krasnojarskaja and was thus able to set out for the baikal on the third of july  mr bykof whom i had left in spring about selenginskaja to collect plants i ordered to remain and if possible to go up the dshida along the frontier guardposts as far as to the high mountains of tunkinskaja to gather every remarkable plant he could find make other observations and wait in selenginskaja the arrival of mr sokolof from dauria and return with him in autumn to krasnojarskaja  before i take my leave however of this district i will add some general observations on it  i must own that upon the whole siberian line from the uralian mountains which may be considered as the line of boundary between europe and asia quite to the baikal i have not been able to collect so many new and curious animals and plants as in that track of land bounded by mongalia and on the north by the baikal it is certain that on the jenisei especially its upper and southern districts which are by nature similar to those of dauria many natural curiosities are to be found especially in the botanical line which are not to be met with in the western parts of siberia or on the loftier parts of the altai mountains but these productions are no where so copious so perfect and genuine as in dauria and all the mountains situated beyond the baikal i say mountains because the whole country is mountainous for even the plains may be considered as broad valleys and are situated on heights toward the west of siberia as the generality of siberian mountainplants which grow even in the lowest valleys incontestibly prove without making any observations with the barometer besides the very high woody mountains which have their greatest breadth from the baikal to the source of the selenga forming with the sajanian mountains about the jendred a mighty chain which spreads more toward the east and joins in one part with the western bay of the baikal but turns with its principal track toward mongalia and goes on over the sources of the jenisei selenga and tola and then divides into those branches which separate partly the brooks of the amur from those of siberia partly its principal rivers naun and scharamurin among themselves and partly the brooks of the amur from the choango besides these towering chief mountains full of numerous cupolas covered with snow and cold woodless summits all the space between the baikal and the frontiers is mostly full of dry open torn and very steep mountains intersected with sandy valleys and plains on which it is clearly evident that the sand originated in the withered small particles of the matrix and was carried away and spread by winds rain snowwater and other streams for most mountains in these parts consist of decayed graniterocks and other very ancient matrices and in some few places strata are to be seen the stratum of all the mountains first appearing northwards from the baikal and in the upper district of the lena  as the mountains both in the district of selenginskaja and dauria are very sleep and rocky and are often nothing more than projecting cliffs and towering pieces of rock they exhibit an awful sight and fine magnificent prospects such a country must afford abundance of curious bushes and shrubs peculiar to such soils and a variety of mountainplants as well growing on the mountains themselves as in the valleys beneath some of which are shady cold and narrow and others open warm and sandy and in many places depressions and low grounds often enriched with saltspots hence also must be ascribed the great difference of the warmer and colder situations in districts adjacent to each other and in the same latitude for example about selenginskaja and kjachta all sorts of gardenstuff even watermelons will prosper in the free and open ground and many rare plants are common which are generally the product only of warm rocks whereas in the country and more to the north situated on the uda not even corn willripen so again upon the baikal under the shadow and cold of the southern adjacent mountain plants grow even to the borders which otherwise are only common to the frigid mountains also trees bud later snow falls sooner and the winter is longer than  00 miles further up the selenga we have read in a description of norway that it shall apparently be winter on the northern side of the lofty mountain of filefield when at the same time it shall be summer on the southern side where it receives the benefit of the sun  this influence of the high situation unsheltered against the cold in the climate of the mountainous districts i have mentioned must be considered as the principal cause of the cast of siberia especially the district south of the baikal being colder than the western countries situated under the same latitude all dauria enjoys a mountainair it lies also exposed to the northern winds which send their chilling blasts from the glacial sea even in summertime through siberia where they cause uncommon cold is it then any wonder that the weather is much sharper here than in the more western parts of europe encompassed by seas which alone renders the air much softer  firs are the most common wood in dauria on the selenga on account of the sandy soil the higher and colder mountains have larches white firs red and white pines birches and asps promiscuously and the underwood consists of birchbushes the bagulnik rhododendrum dauricum and various species of willows the higher cliffs snowclad throughout the year had on their summits some few creeping trees or none at all perhaps some little shrubs of pines cedars larches dwarfbirches and some species of the plane and savintrees and some particular small willows  the consequence of this general description is that dauria and the district of selenginskaja will never become so populous or so general a corncountry as the rest of siberia situated not so much to the north there being every where even in the valleys and plains many tracks nothing but rock and sand which no other people but the mongols and burats can turn to advantage but as these nations will soon scarce find space enough to support themselves owing to their increase as is evident about selenginskaja it would be policy in order to bring agriculture to its highest pitch to remove some part of this people into other districts for example to the sandysaltdesarts about the irtish or the baruba these places being now left to the treacherous kirguese who never will become husbandmen  selenginskaja  i will now say a few words of the town of selenginskaja and its dependencies it lies chiefly on a shallow sandy arm of the selenga fordable in many places behind the town are some high sand mountains from whence the streets now begin to be overflown with sand these mountains are at the same time richly clothed with timber and underwood quite down to the river from the riversside the place makes a good appearance with its three churches and the house of a commissioner of state now uninhabited the place is fortified with four timber ramparts and towers within the angles within the walls is a court of waywodes and a court of boundaries a house for the commandingofficer another for the president and a guardhouse all within a square at the upper end are gardens and a cornmill worked by horses  though this town is advantageously situated for the chinese trade here are but few substantial merchants most of the inhabitants are of the middling class the cause of which probably is their carelessness and inclination to extravagance many of the citizens scatter themselves and live in other places in order to be dutyfree and lead a more indolent life in agriculture and breeding of cattle farms nay villages founded by people of this description may be seen just opposite the town on the left bank of the river many of the townspeople and those of the country round the town show a great mixture of mongalian blood the most substantial of them having long been in the habit of marrying mongalian and buratian women and to make an advantageous alliance with these people some mongols will have their daughters christened there have been instances about this place of the burats themselves embracing the christian faith in order to espouse the daughter of some wealthy russian from such mixedmarriages spring many mulatto children these retain something of the mongalian face and have black shining hair but have at the same time the most regular features and the sweetest countenance called in russ karymki of course the buratian manner of living is almost as much in use in this district as the mongol or mongalian language  under the jurisdiction of the court of waiwodes in this place are the following towns baicharozkaja urluzkaja muchorschibir and tarbagantei also the following places with their districts itanzinskai ostrog with  0 little villages mostly situated on the little river itanza and containing     peasants archangelskai to which belong six villages jlinskoi ostrog and pokrosskaja all together situate in the neighborhood of the selenga and its little brook and containing     peasants kudarinskaja at the mouth of the selenga with seven villages on the adjoining step containing     peasants kubanskoi ostrog with its five villages and     peasants and lastly the district of dshidenskaja containing seven villages besides bainchussun situate on the river dshida also six other towns on the dshida one on the selenga one on the ira of    peasants colonists comprehending all together     peasants to these villages may be added    0 old inhabitants of the towns and      colonists  0  peasants dependant on the convent of terizkaja on the selenga and     depending on that of polsolskaja also near  00 citizens and somewhat above  00 burats and mongols which is the whole population of this district encompassed by the baikal the chinese frontiers and the great partitionmountains bargusinskoi ostrog is also reckoned in this district which contains   00 tunguse paying tribute if to this is added the district of nertschinskaja properly dauria subject to the russian scepter which except   000 burats and tunguse  0000 of whom live in huts round the argun scarce contains    00 men near  000 of whom are colonists sent here within these    years the whole population of the country beyond the baikal which is     miles in length and from   0 to     in breadth amounts only to about   000 fullgrown men  the district of selenginskaja like all others situated about the baikal is sometimes subject to little earthquakes in      two were observed in irkuzkaja one on the   th of march at four in the morning another on the  th of august at four in the afternoon on the   th of october      at eight in the morning they felt a double shock the last pretty strong in      july    about nine in the morning they had a strong earthquake at irkuzkaja and at    oclock the same morning in selenginskaja which was felt also in many places the sphere of these earthquakes are generally not very extensive they are never felt in dauria and the northern parts of the lena so that the cause of them must be hidden in the mountains situated close about the baikal and their warm springs peculiar pebbles and the bitumen which the lakes throw out are evident proofs that there is no want of materials to occasion such subterranean heat and motions probably the earthquakes observed in the altai mountain originate from that spot where the noor saissane is encompassed by mountains  it was noon on the  d day of july before all the horses required for our departure could be brought together and my wagons could cross the selenga i did not take the usual postroad but went straight toward the lake gusinoi osero gooselake to which the deep and sandy valley tojon leads and which commences at the hutmountain behind the selenga we reached the lake just before dark during a violent tempest and deal of rain and took our lodgings at the north end of the lake a number of rare plants decorated the sands which i gathered the next morning and among the rest a peculiar species of robinia hitherto unknown to botanists rob ferox which shot into high bushes and thick branches often seven feet high this species of the false acaciathorn deserves cultivation in europe on account of its usefulness it being very short with long thorns and spreading on the ground would make exceeding good fences through which neither man nor cattle would be able to penetrate the soft points and leaves are also an agreeable food for sheep and its pods which are without number would at least answer the purpose of vetches it is remarkable that this fine bush which displays in spring its numberless sulphuryellow flowers should no where be met with in all the districts beyond the baikal except in the great valley which from the temnik and gusinoi osero extends itself with the selenga as far as the brook ubukun and some valleys as far as the orengoi the mongols and burats give it no other name than what they give to the smallest acaciathorn robinia pygmea viz charagana it grows as well on the moist and saltdepressions or low places as on drier and sandspots though it prefers the former it is said to be very common about peking where all the level country is somewhat moist and salt it was well known to the russians who went there with caravans because the chinese planted this hedge against the walls which surrounded the caravanhouse it being as good as so many sentinels to hinder any one from climbing them  this lake is deep and if the wind blows ever so little carries large billows they say it was much smaller formerly but that about    years ago in the month of may the river temnik which is at a considerable distance swelled by a sudden slow blocked up its own bed with sand and floating wood and made itself a fresh channel changing a neighboring valley into a great lake part of whose waters have added to this lake the new channel which the temnik made is called by the mongols zagan i e white or holy from an awful reverence at having destroyed some of their fine pastures in the low grounds few great mongalian lamas for priests seldom make a bad choice have fixed their residence in this delightful vale and built two fine temples one at the north end and the other at the south a description of these temples and the holy offices performed therein and what i saw when they were going to erect a sacred monument on the mountain on the  th of july will accompany my other accounts collected respecting the mongalian idolatry the whole valley is so flat that when the temnik sought a new channel they feared a general inundation as far as the saltlake solunoi osero  round about this lake which is not above a mile and a half from the one where we took up our nights lodging the ground is white with a bitter salt and full of saltplants its length is about half a mile its form oblong and its greatest diameter lies from east to west many fresh water rivulets flow from the north side into it which lessens its saltness and renders the salt unfit for boiling in summertime the saltveins seem to be within the lake itself for when the water freezes in autumn we see spots where no ice will settle and there the salt water is stronger they tried an experiment on such a spot in      and put down a pipe into such a salt water spring and at the depth of more than seven else found nothing but slime but having felt something hard under this slime they applied a bore and brought up a piece of pure ice and observing afterward that fresh water issued from the place they left it to itself to seek for the real salt veins on the borders of the lake they have made many unsuccessful attempts and wherever they bored fresh water has issued out  the bottom of the lake consists of a blue slime on which when the frost comes a scum several inches thick will settle consisting of pure glaubersalts which when dried in the air crumbles into a white farinaceous substance continual dry weather and summerheats will divide this scum from the salt water and it will then swim in tender scum on the surface of the lake which at a distance in the sunshine has a red appearance and by the motion of the water will sink to the bottom the water is otherwise clear has no red appearance but in summertime will smell like foul mire it is not sufficiently impregnated with salt so as to be fit for boiling till autumn when it has an icecrust upon the surface they begin to boil in november and continue till the middle of march when the snowwater from the mountains diminishes its strength in these four months they procure but  0000 puds of salt there are at present two salthouses with proper pans where they boil salt and they are preparing to erect a third within    hours a pan is completed and yields  00 pails full equal to   00 common pails or about  00 puds of salt the boiled salt is fine white granulous and very pure but is not to be compared in saltness with that of angarskoi even what they scrape from the pans is pure salt this they throw away as rubbish but why i know not the imperial treasury pays on the spot  0 copecs to the boiler for every pud of salt deducting a duty of    per cent when proper agreements are made the salt is transported to the storehouses or wherever it is wanted the wood they use in boiling is felled at the distance of three or four miles from the lake and    miles from the selenga paying    copecs per stack for felling and  0 copecs for carriage this would not make the boiling dear but the iron for the pans is brought from the smithery at kutunskaja at  0 copecs per pud and a pan will not last a whole winter without mending  in      there was a boilinghouse with one pan at the expense of the crown which was soon after sold to a private person from this first proprietor the saltworks became the property of the family of the present possessor michael pacholsof who has besides the boilinghouses two neat houses for his own residence a storehouse in which at present are   000 puds of salt ready to convey away and also some houses for his workmen  when i had viewed these works i made the best of my way to the postroad behind which flows the brook ubukun on which there is a poststation about  0 miles from selenginskaja and seven from the saltlake i did not sleep here but three miles and a half lower down the ubukun in a village of six houses erected on it the road to it is over a moderate mountain where a stonesearcher had dug some tryingpits on account of a demitransparent greenish and amethystcoloured flaming spar which breaks above ground in the spar lay kidneys of yellowish and greyish agate this spot and the whole mountain deserves a stricter examination  at the distance of nine miles from this the river orongoi is passed by a flying bridge at udinskoi  0 miles further where i slept on the  th of july i received a number of letters sent to me to the onon but which there missed me and from this place i sent back my mongalian interpreters having no further occasion for them  beyond udinskoi are several little villages and the step about the lowermost part of the selenga is very fertile and populous indeed one of the most populous districts beyond the baikal containing from   to  00 peasant families and two convents on the  th of july i reached the baikal sea where i met with a number of plants peculiar only to cold mountains for instance cmbra empetrum rignum campanula rotundifolia fumaria impatiens polygonum divaricatum angustisolium et sericeum scrophularia scorodonia dracocephelum nulans lycepsis vsicaria and many others the pyrola rotundifolia which grows so very large in siberia is often here gathered in case of need by the peasants and used as tea these mountainplants which are so generally to be met with on the low shores of the baikal arise from the cold and foggy air in summer from the adjacent high mountains and the effect of the snowclad cliffs which the lofty mountains standing round the kuluk or western bay of the baikal raise above the clouds  baikal  when i arrived at the convent of posolskoi the baikal was covered with such a thick and cold fog as is only to be seen in high mountains which attract the clouds or in seacoast countries during autumn and winter it resembled clouds enclosed within mountains had already continued eight days and lasted till the  0th of july during calm weather amid the breeze of western winds in the mean time there fell such a rain in all the high mountains of dauria also north of the baikal and about the jenisei which never had been remembered in these districts and which continued with very little serene intermission till late in autumn and destroyed the hay and harvest the spring and the first half of summer had been in these parts uncommonly dry and without rain  the western winds which usually continue some time in the baikal gave me but little hopes of crossing over to the mouth of the angara and though the imperial galliot which served here as a packetboat arrived here from the other side almost in the same hour that i did yet the passage seemed almost impracticable for a long while this galliot called the borisogleb is navigated by a pilot from ochozkaja and is at present the only vessel that sails in the baikal the merchants using their dangerous dostschenicks which go with sails before tack winds only or else with rudders a galliot was here stranded in autumn    0 not far from the mouth of the selenga and was lost indeed galliots are not fit for this sea which is so narrow vessels with rudders or demigallies would be of more utility  i occupied myself therefore with collecting of plants and viewing the fisheries usual in summer in the straights of posolskaja till the weather was finer there is a duty on this fishery as on other considerable ones and the convent here receives a certain number of tons as a privilege the fishery is carried on through the whole summer with dragnets  00 fathoms long which as the sea is not very deep on this coast they let out from a barge with a tackling  00 fathoms in length which is afterward taken in by means of a reel fixed on the shore in spring as soon as the ice breaks they catch abundantly the sigi morskye salmo oxyrhinchus and lenki which come upon the sands to spawn in summer this fish seeks the deep and is not caught here but on the northern steep and rocky coast which is very deep at present they caught nothing but what is called the omul which strays at this time in great quantities on the southern banks and toward autumn seeks the mouth of the rivers on this side this fish about the mouth of the selenga is not more than eight or nine inches thick it is these only that are caught annually in the bay of tschiwirkui are remarkable for their size and are caught no where else on the coast of the baikal this is a new proof that fishes like birds of passage return annually to the place of their birth and do not readily spawn or enter any other river than where they first received life the passage of the omuls is known in all districts situated on the opposite side of the baikal or the inhabitants of those places whose slimy rivers do not abound in fish would otherwise want food for fastdays they generally come at the ascension of the virgin and as they advance but slow arrive about the latter end of september near udinskoi prigorud  they never enter the uda or chilok though plentifully caught at the mouth of these rivers but abundantly visit the dshida the tschikoi past irluzkaja and the selenga up to the orgon and when the ice breaks return quite spent and exhausted to the baikal and many lose their life without reaching it the milder the autumn the later they enter the rivers and if the ice breaks soon return early and do not go up into the upper districts the omul comes originally from the glacial sea and not only enters the jenisei but all the rivers of kamschatka through the jenisei it comes into the baikal not only by means of the tunguska and angara but also by the tuba and the large lake madshar on the sajanian mountains having found a wide and deep water in this sea at its return from the upper river it would not go back into the ocean but breeds in this enormous space of water sheltered from all fish of prey  the presence of the seadog in the baikal is much more wonderful as these animals never leave the ocean so far as to enter the rivers and at this time is not observed in the jenisei nor the lower angara therefore must have come here by some great change in the surface of the earth or by some extraordinary and rare accident more rare still is a species of fish quite natural to the baikal called by the russians golomjanka which is said to have been discovered but a few years since though here before and perhaps undiscovered by negligence this fish callyonymus baikalensis has no more solidity than a piece of fat and are absolutely full of an oily substance which if the whole fish is put on a gridiron will melt away to the bones they are never caught in nets nor alive it is supposed and with some probability that they reside only in the deepest recesses of the baikal which in the middle and not far from the northern steep mountaincoast cannot be fathomed with lines of three to four hundred fathoms what cause or change in the sea brings them so high is hard to tell they arc commonly thrown out by violent northern storms on the coast of posolskoi and about the mouth of the selenga in summertime only when a calm succeeds a storm they are seen in many hundreds swimming and ploughing the surface of the sea for many years they were thrown out so abundantly as to lie in heaps on the strand like a rampart and the inhabitants turned them to profit by boiling trainoil from them which the chinese bought up at a great price in june this year but few of them were driven ashore i received some of them twice by means of messengers dispatched occasionally to posolskoi some dried and some preserved in brandy they appeared for the last time on the   th of june and were neither touched by insects nor crows probably on account of the rankness of their fat which melts in a few hours and sometimes in the hand  on the  0th the master of the galliot gave notice that whoever wished to make his passage must go on board every thing to be shipped was put that night on board but during the whole night the wind blew so hard west that the thoughts of crossing was almost despaired of those who navigate the baikal have a particular compass which marks only three winds those that blow between the north east and south called barguim with which the passage from the mouth of the selenga over the lake is easy and ready as they blow all from the same place all the winds between the northwest and southwest which apparently come out from the large baikalbay are called kultuk and those that blow straight north from the mountainous northern coast have the general name of gornoja pagoda mountainwinds last but a short time but are the more dangerous and commonly suddenraging hurricanes which strand the vessels or drive them to pieces on the southern shallow coast and sometimes if the sails are not expeditiously taken in will overset the vessel or dismast it other winds are not so dangerous as the baikal has no sandbank or shoals between the mouths of the selenga and angara except a single one discovered by tradingboats around which the sea is deep the depth of the baikal in the middle and in the northern borders is unfathomable this lake or sea is like a huge cleft opened by the torn mountains in which the adjacent rivers took their mouths the mountainous coast itself shows everywhere marks of the most violent changes and at the same time of the highest antiquity  about    oclock at night rose a good southwest wind by which a skilful seaman could have easily reached the mouth of the angara or pretty near it our master thinking he could do the same the anchor was weighed by his order whilst he lay in bed and a sailor who steered the vessel carried us over but further from the mouth of the selenga than we were when at posolskoi when the master awaked and saluted the morning we found ourselves in the pestschanajaguba sandbay above    miles above listwenischoe simowje to which it is but    miles from posolskoi measured upon the ice and paid for in the packetboat the wind grew more violent and would not suffer us to quit the coast so that our master without further attempts ordered his men to cast anchor and wait for a better wind  this beginning of our unsuccessful navigation was not so disagreeable to me as i had enough to employ me in collecting plants on the rocky coast which were now in full perfection and some of them very rare they also fished the whole day on the sands of the bay on the barest parts of the barren rocks grew plentifully the delicate stoneleek allium altaicum which was greedily eaten by the sailors of all the plants the polypodium fragrans deserves to be mentioned this rare fine and most fragrant fern is collected from the highest rocks where it grows out from the clefts and is called by the burats serlik and is drank by them as a remedy in most scorbutic and paralytic complaints it may as well be drank for its fine taste as if two or three leafstalks are added to it it flavours the common green tea to the highest degree of perfection its smell is so powerful that it will communicate its fragrance to whole bundles of herbs and boxes full of paper  as a small east wind rose toward night we weighed anchor and spread sail but this was scarce done before a westwind blew again and we were obliged to seek a new anchoringplace at the lower end of the bay  on the   th our captain got out his dragtackling and thus hauled the vessel on about  0 miles where we anchored again it was a fine sight about the rocks of the baklanye to see the innumerable crowds of ravens that were building their nests and the whole rock covered with their white dung some of the crew went toward the rock in a boat when the old ravens sluttered above the rock and the young ones that could not fly threw themselves from the rock into the sea on the   th we advanced a little on and a gentle gale springing up about noon we got about    miles further where horses were employed to drag the vessel all the next day when we anchored afresh this miserable vovage now became irksome to me and i would certainly have gone to irkuzkaja by land if there had been any passable road but there being no such thing i got from the master of the packet his small flatbottomed boat which he had in the galliot and ordering a little postwaggon i had with me to be placed across it so that its wheels almost touched the water i manned it partly with my own people and partly with passengers whom i encouraged with a promised reward left the vessel with our baggage on board and rowed for the mouth of the angara this expedition almost proved my last the wind blew west this morning violently and the billows raged still more the sailor who steered our boat and who had crossed a bay and reached the next cape wished to shorten the labor of the rowers instead therefore of keeping round by the shore he attempted to cross a bay more than seven miles over but we had no sooner left the cape than the wind blew so violent and we were carried so far off the coast that it was with the utmost danger and difficulty we could reach the next cape for my part i expected every instant to have been a prey to the waves in order not to be exposed to a similar danger we took a tackle fastened it to the boat and had it dragged along the coast we had still great trouble to get past the projecting rocks of some high mountains which from top to bottom had been apparently soft and seemed kneaded together cemented by large and small pebbles carried all round in the water by a sandy and limy species of stone and convinces me that there must have been some mighty change in the mountains of the baikal these rocks could not otherwise have been formed than by pebbles rolling underneath the water horizontally and afterward by violent convulsions of the earth changed into mountains of more than  00 fathoms perpendicular height  after a good deal of anxiety and labor we reached the mouth of the angara in good time and in good condition on the   th i set out in the evening for irkuzkaja a distance of more than  0 miles in the road to which there are wayhouses every four or five miles and arrived there early on the   th i stopped at this place as long only as it was necessary and on the   d pursued my journey to krasnorjarskaja a distance of     miles the road to which i described when i passed it before  on the oka just below the highest mountain lies okinskoi karaul the outermost guardstation of the district of udinskoi subject to the regency of irkuzkaja it is     miles from the last frontierguard of the district of kjachta and from the frontiermark on the mountain gurban  0  miles but from another situate on the choinraban  0  miles measured from the western frontierguard of winskoi it is     miles in almost all villages from irkuzkaja  00 miles forward i found children inoculated with the smallpox in this month july by the surgeon of irkuzkaja this salutary operation has the most prosperous event in this regency trials have already been made among the burats who reside about irkuzkaja whose diet and way of living is so unwholesome and by this means the smallpox will soon become less dangerous among the heathens whom it frequently carries off  udinskoi  about half way from irkuzkaja to krasnojarskaja is udinskoi ostrog where i arrived on the   th of july it lies on the river uda and though it is a place of little importance has a governor and two frontierguards under the command of the governor of tomskoi here is also an inspector of the district of udinskoi in this district which consists of     men that pay tribute they reckon    little tribes of heathens some of tartarian some of buratian origin these little tribes scattered about on the wild mountains are the offsprings of fugitives the relics of several hordes driven from their possessions in siberia and who have flown here for refuge some seem to be of different origin speaking a mixed language between mongol and tartarian the most remarkable is the tribe of karaskoi which like the koibales and matores on the jenisei have preserved the samjoede language with little mixture though there are only    men there are some small tribes on the mountains who speak their own language but i could gather no accurate account of them the karaskassians live like the rest of the mountaintartars by hunting and have no other domestic cattle than a few reindeer with which they remove their household stuff from one place to another their superstition which though baptized they keep up is the most simple to be met with they have neither idols nor magicians but worship the heavens and the sun they are ignorant of sacrifices except that when they have killed a bear or some other game they raise his head and heart on a piece of bark toward heaven and beg for a good chase in future they also show a kind of reverence like other siberian pagans to certain rivers and mountains feeding the former and carrying on the latter a little rice or tobacco and leaving it on the place they bury their dead on a scaffold of forks and bushes or upon trees with the head toward the east or only cover them with bushes those whom they affectionately love they burn their wretched jurts are covered with hides and they dress themselves in skins seldom continuing more than two or three days on the same spot wandering about in search of the sarana or hilly onion which makes a chief part of their food two bags of sarana or some good cedarnuts which contain about three and a half puds they consider equal in value to a reindeer and after this manner they formerly calculated their tribute which made about  0 rein deer for the whole tribe but at present they do military duty in the frontiers of udinskoi and pay also their jassak or tribute which amounts to about two rubles a man their women wear in summer broad round hats made of twisted reed but no caps and instead of stockings they wrap their legs round with the outer bark of lonicera pyrenaica i shall give a specimen of their language further on when i speak of their dialects  eight miles from udinskoi we were obliged to go down from the heights to the brook kamenka through the narrow dale in which a wagon has scarce room to pass and on the brook we see fine lofty banks where sandrocks are so tender that they may be reduced to powder by squeezing them in the hand  on the   th of july i stopped at rybinskoi chiefly to view the siberian melting of iron by handblasts performed by a smith from the jenisei the ore he uses is one of the most remarkable things in the whole empire and was discovered by a fox that dug up the ground and was caught at that time by a peasant it consists of large and small pieces of petrified wood changed into a rich solid brown ironstone and shows even marks of the bark the smith of this place has discovered this wonderful ore in two spots adjacent to his smithery the one at three miles distance on a flat mountain covered with birchtrees lying in whole trunks extending north and south in a sandymatrix much mixed with ironochre the other at the distance only of three quarters of a mile and lying in the same nature the metalized trunks though of the same appearance will not yield any iron for melting but the smith got a species of raw iron out of it which being coppery is of little value  i reached krasnojarskaja the first week in august and though the bloom in this district was on the decline and most plants in seeds yet through the industry of mr kaschkaref who was here some time before and had made many little excursions to the river mana and the sajanian mountains i received a complete collection of the plants which the mountains of the jenisei yield in summer but these were chiefly rare plants answering in some degree mr gmelins account who says that eastward of the jenisei nature changes at once and has an asiatic bloom of its own my curiosity however was much deceived by this flattering account indeed the district of krasnojarskaja as a dry open and mountainous country has for this very reason several rare mountainplants of its own and some still more rare to be met with in the more southern mountains between the yjus and jenisei etc but no sooner is the jenisei crossed and left than the whole country between the tunguska and the boundarymountains is covered with woods and meadowgrounds where the bloom is little different from that about the ob irtisch and even the uralian chain resembling those of the european alps  i was detained in arranging my observations on the natural curiosities of a five months collection and in the unexpected arrival of mr surjef till the   th of august he had not pursued his journey from mangasei to the frozen ocean but had returned from selakino situated     miles beyond mangasei and about   0 miles from the mainsea his journal contained nothing curious except a heavy description of the navigation i shall therefore abridge it in order not to tire my readers presenting only such things as are most remarkable  in the vicinage of mangasei reside chiefly the baptized jakutians whose number amounts only to     men the tunguse in the jenisei make out in general a nation of  000 men      of whom are within the jurisdiction of mangasei and the rest of jeniseiskaja in the district of mangasei are   0 samojedes     comprehended under the name of eastjaiks and     men immediately from jeniseiskoi  beyond mangasei the river jenisei is of a vast breadth particularly toward selakino where it begins to form bays in some places where there are no islands its breadth is more than eight miles so that the opposite shore is scarcely visible the right border of the river is every where mountainous yet the mountains are not high the left is free from mountains yet very elevated and like the mountainside covered with woods the snow and ice on the border does not melt till the end of june and in the narrow valleys excavated by the snowwater and on the land of the free open heights it thaws only to a small depth for we found often underneath the moss and roots of the little willows which grew on that moss bare ice or hard frozen ground alders larches willows and birches generally bloom there about the end of june other plants show their blossoms much earlier and this is in the   th degree of latitude beyond plachina were found some petrified muscles and above selakino a tooth and some other remains of elephants  the river jenisei in its lower districts is much more peopled with russians than the ob as being more fertile chantaiskoi pogort     miles beyond mangasei has besides a church only four dwellings three of which are the habitations of some russian priests but there are a great many scattered single houses all along the banks of the river as far as the frozen ocean  on the   th of august i left krasnojarskaja and the same afternoon directed my journey to the sajanian mountains and as i was to travel a road that had not been trod for  0 years and was marshy and entirely overgrown with wood i sent people before to clear the way and prepare me passages over rivers and brooks some days i could get on pretty well and some others i could not travel more than about  0 miles  on the morning of the   st of august we had a very difficult road indeed to pass through a bewildered forest many marshy defiles and bogs rendered worse by a twomonths rain we could not cross the mires but by placing faggots every step before us to prevent our sinking yet with all this difficulty we made shift to advance  0 miles we slept in a forest it thundered and rained all the night but the darkness of the night added something to the pleasure we received in the sight of a number of glowworms which were collected in heaps in rotten leaves and sprays which shone every where with great brilliancy they are scarce six lines long somewhat thicker than a horsehair and look like cheesemaggots these woods are also remarkable for a species of nightingale with cinnabarred throats motacilla calliope  on the   th i crossed the yjus and continued my way up the river to kokowo uluss where i spent the night from this place we see higher up on the west side of the yjus a mountain of a peculiar form called by the tartars anlo it is situated about eight or  0 miles from this place about three miles from the left banks of the river and near    miles from karyschkoi rudnick the mountain rises gently on one side to the top and there forms a wide cleft with a square rocky precipice and from the center of the cleft projects a small rock  this square rock is what is properly called aulo and is worshipped by the tartars orix dmittrei wassilief from tomskoi who was exiled in his youth from russia to the huts of barnaul has begun a regular minework on a western adjacent mountain either from whim or some imposing view under a pretense of some treasures being here buried by an ancient mongol khan called altyn according to his own account one samet arschanof a tartar of katschinskaja who had been often sent with imperial dispatches from russia to the mongols under the protection of the chinese had often heard it said and that indeed it was an old saying among them that altynchan had formerly reigned in the district about the yjus and having been obliged to retire had concealed all his riches and jewels in some hidden cavern in the environs of the rock anlo this saying is the only reason of their digging his impostures go still farther pretending that on the river tschulym live some mongol women who possess mongol manuscripts describing all the accesses to the cavern in which the treasures are concealed  hence it must be concluded and from the character of the man that he is an able impostor who by the above pretexts has persuaded some credulous people and some of his own children who are substantial persons to advance him money on this project which allows him to lead an indolent life he has ordered shafts to be dug in two places where this mountain has clefts to the depth of many fathoms and has employed people several winters in this work and still goes on with hired workmen digging into this hard rock and blowing it up with gunpowder a large whiteheaded vulture who once lighted on the top of this mountain after hovering a long time above it and looking down on the spot he took for a messenger sent to point out the treasures on some places are the remains of bones and the teeth of animals and some dead serpents were found in the clefts these are he says the remains of sacrifices offered to the evil spirits when the treasure was deposited and thus given to them these goblins he pretends play him a number of tricks throwing stones at the workmen and extinguishing the light brought to fire the powder and often deceive him and his men by calling and other means and by this method colors his enterprise with the appearance of importance and captivates the belief of the siberian peasants as he writes expeditiously he keeps a journal of suchlike hardships of which whole quires were laid before me  i thought it not worth my attention to inspect any part of the works of this wrongheaded fool but sent mr surjef there on this object employing my time in botanical researches and viewing the bitter saltlakes in the neighborhood where large quantities of salt are prepared and the place guarded by cossacks  on the   th of august i reached the mines of karyschkoi rudnick and staid some days to examine them these were first worked by a private person this man did not dig very deep being contented with the dayores the chief of which were very irony and not knowing how to smelt them he was discouraged and a bargeload of the best ore being sunk in carrying it along the river jenisei he gave the mine up in      counselor kleopin came here and set some men to work but he was tired in the course of one summer some noble metals however breaking into lazulipebbles called the attention of the crown who sent captain mettich of brunswick and he began working it in      and continued it till last year in the several tryingpits made by this gentleman the richest ore broke nestwise and was usually better in the day than in the depth it consisted of fine violet or lazulilike and also palegreen and yellow pebbles partly sprinkled in with and partly breaking into compact and rich nodules with veins of verdigris in a wild and ferruginous matrix at the depth of from eight to nine fathoms this matrix prevailed so much that the works though continued to  0 fathoms were so dull that they are now suspended many thousand puds of ore however have been here dug especially of the abovementioned rich pebbles which on an assay yielded in one way in a hundred pud weight of ore    puds of copper and three pounds    drams of silver and in another  0 pounds rawstone    pounds of refined copper and nine drams of silver per pud with many gold marks in the depth the meanest ironore yielded    puds of rawiron  0 pounds of copper and    drams of silver per cent  another mine adjoining has been opened this year and is now working here is a quartz lode more than seven feet broad which runs toward midnight in it lies a brown ochre in clefts and in nodules and yellow mulm with some verdigris which on an assay yielded from two to three drams of silver per  00 puds no mark of gold has appeared and from the small quantity of silver etc no great things are expected  the best mine is about    miles further off up the jurba in the granite mountains they work there on a quartz lode with coppergreen one fathom strong to which adheres a brown mulm of gold alloy here they extract from  00 puds two and a half to three drams of golddust the varicoloured quartz contains    pounds of copper and six drams of silver the green mixed ochre yields    drams of silver and the ferruginous ochre two drams of silver per  00 puds  between the yjus and jurba are many other tryingpits but this mountain has not been so strictly examined as to give any great hopes  an interpreter whom i wanted for the continuation of my journey being now arrived i left this place on the  st of september taking the same road as last year traveling straight to the south toward the jurba where there are some tartarian jurts of the tribe kaidanaimak this tribe and that of arinskoi has one and the same governor called baschlyk part of these tribes has settled among the tartars about the brooks tess and jurba the tribe kaidanaimak reckons  0 bows and their elder kasnez resides upon the uybat the tribe buk tjin aimak consists of    bows whose kasnez lives on the brook koma the tribe kasan kaidanaimak has but    bows and dwells high in the mountains on the river kyfir these tartars and the koibuls are chiefly employed in hunting of sables in the mountains situate about these rivers and the oi other tartarian tribes may hunt there but with the permission of these and on certain terms  the little river uybat which empties into the abakan serves as a frontierline to the katschinzy tartars and those of the sajaian mountains the former are under the jurisdiction of krasnajarskaja and the latter pay their tribute at kusnezkoi as the step on both sides the uybat is not only very warm in winter on account of the mountains but has scarce any snow the richest of these tartars drive their flocks and herds here in autumn and look on this district as their best winterpasture the sajaian tartars dwell on the right side and the others on the left the step full of old graves is an evident proof that the nomades first settled here and found the district an advantageous situation  on the  th of september i continued my journey farther on the uybat and directed it through the sajaian step toward the little sir on the high fields in dauria the stellaria dichotoma was uncommonly abundant it was now mostly dried up in globular round bushes and rolled every where by the wind for the calyxes of this plant when dry enclose the thick seeds so as not to be shed and nature has by a particular foresight so disposed the flowerstalks pedunculi that they bend backwards like a leg after it has done blossoming that they may not break when the plant rolls upon the ground  about    miles from the sir lies the russian village synowina inhabited by peasants and eight miles from this is a high mountain called by the tartars temir iron which like the kujum two miles further toward the brook dshakdshul is full of ochrenests in a white matrix where the ancient miners tschudaki seem to have been very diligent many new attempts were made to work this mine for the rest of the ochres are mostly serruginous and the copper and silver ore of little value during the modern works they discovered an adit so narrow that a boy could scarce creep through this narrowness must be assisted by time which has squeezed the sides together  between the nyna and sir we left a remarkable lake on our right called by the tartars bulanny kul who say that in winter it makes a certain roar before it freezes as they pass it they leave some spray or stone upon an adjacent mountain as a sacrifice a usual superstitious ceremony of the siberian pagans  on the greater river sir are several tartarian jurts where i learned they had among them a famous kahm or sorcerer whom the spirits had deprived of one foot and yet he jumped well as this man was not at home or had probably concealed himself to avoid the trouble of making his exorcisms before me i ordered his magic dress to be brought to me his drum was uncommonly pretty more than an ell in diameter and was painted green and red except the drum and its beater the whole dress consisted only of a cap made of red cloth edged with foxskin and ornamented with serpents heads having in the top a bush of owls feathers and about the borders were several ornaments of striped stuff erminefurs etc for in sagai sorcerers wear their usual clothes when performing their incantations see the plate tunguse sorcery  they brought also with the drum and cap of this wizzard a bundle of    little sticks of an equal size four inches long burnt at both ends and made of a species of reed a prophetic instrument of the magicians of the place which they call sugge when they prophesy they take these in the left hand sitting before a fire mutter some words over them hold the ends of them in the fire and with loud invocations lift them into the air then divide them suddenly into three parcels between the fingers of the left hand and by such of the sticks as do not pass between the fingers they presage good or bad luck  fifteen miles further on whilst we changed horses we were entertained with another sajan sorcerer called stepan he would have kept his art a secret had not my people found out his drum which he had concealed in another jurt this was a brisk young fellow who beat his drum first kneeling and then sitting before the fire and sung his incantations in a very harmonious tune soon after this they grew more terrible his motions were violent and continued more and more so till he was seemingly in a fit he then bent backwards with his heels and head to the ground making a bow of his body beating his drum at the same time which passed incessantly under this bow from side to side this difficult exercise he repeated several times and was the best part of his performance  i rode this day the  th of september to the mouth of the akysch into the abakan where is an open district a church has been built within the last year of which the baptized sajan tartars are the parishioners here is no building but the church the ministers house and that of the baschlyk or head of the tribe who has embraced the christian faith some time the priest of this place is under the jurisdiction of abakanskoi though the tribe of saja belongs to the district of kusnezkoi these christian tartars contributed to the building the church and the stipend of the minister whilst those who remain pagans adhere to their pagan customs some of them had commenced husbandmen others wander in summertime with their flocks and herds along the brooks into the cool mountains and return in winter to the snowless steps about the abakan the whole consists only of   0 men who pay a tribute or jassack of three rubles per bow their complexion and constitution is not at all similar to those of the tartars of katschinzkoi but are more like the beltirs and other tartars who inhabit the mountains of kusmezkoi few of their faces are like the kalmucks but their features are truly tartarian they are very hairy about the chin and body and their limbs and body are larger and stronger than the katschinzians it seems that these men who inhabit such a wild mountainous district have taken care not to mix their progeny with mongalian blood  the most wealthy of them possess from  0 to  00 horses as many cows and some hundreds of sheep poorer ones have hardly  0 or  0 head of large cattle which among these steppeople are sufficient to maintain a family their sheep like those of the sajan tartars diggingbess reododendron and a wild horse tartars in the jenisei have little fat tails and many differ little from russian sheep and are seldom larger it is peculiar to the northeast of asia that the longtailed breed of sheep has generally such a fat lump besides agriculture the sajan tartars dig also all sorts of roots and plants for food and like the tunguse search for them in the miceholes the following are the roots which the poor tartars in general scattered about the jenisei and kusnezkoimountains collect and almost live on and of which they make a winterprovision  the first is the dogstooth root erythronium called here bess it is the principal business of the women to dig this root in the month of may hence this month is called by the beltir and sajan tartars bessai as these roots lie four or five inches under a tough turf they use a particular pointed spade for digging them they force the spade into the ground with the foot and the root is then easy to come at having cleaned them they put them in water to soak then wind them round with bass and dry them when dressed they are boiled gently in water till they are soft and eaten with milk or cream they resemble in taste the rawness of wheatflour mixed up with water and eggs and are very indigestible another root eaten by the katschinzkoi tartars is that of the common siberian piony this is dried for the winter and is mostly eaten ground in soup with meat and is called ure the use of the common and deep red bunchlilies the former of which lilium martagon is called sary yellow schep the latter lilium pomponium aschep white and the beltirs call the month july in which it is collected aschepai what they do not eat raw they keep and eat roasted in the cinders like chestnuts or boiled in water with milk and butter the sajan tartars collect a great quantity of the red lilyroots from the provisionholes of the gray stepmouse mus socialis or else dig it with the abovementioned spades  they also dig roots of the sanguisorbia the knotty fumitory the large bellflowers camp lilifolia certain thistle carduus seratuloides the viper herb polygonunt viviparum also a kind of herb called sosack which scarce a wild boar will touch i heard of another plant called uskum but had not an opportunity of seeing it nay i have been told that the poor tartars if very hungry will eat the bark of the white pine tree  a dainty which they also dress for winterfood is the birdcherry which they grind kernel and all and eat the coarse meal in milk as a desert it would be idle to mention all the berries they eat in summertime the fresh roots of hips or wild roses they chop and boil for tea they make also a dish with milk and the groats of buckwheat which i was told they did in the following manner after washing the grain in water and taking off such as is light and swims at top which is thrown away they put the rest into a wet bag and let it lie  0 or    hours to soak then dry it a little over an iron stove till it becomes rather hard which they try by the teeth if quite dry when pounded in their mortars which is a hollowed trunk of a tree it would become flour but being a little moist when pounded it becomes groats for having dried them on a stove the husks get loose and in beating come off from the body and are cleared from the body of the grain by the hand or a winnow the grain thus prepared is somewhat transparent of a yellowish color and is much improved in taste  of medicines and other plants for domestic use i observed the following the lychnis chalcedonica which grows in the valleys the flowers of this plant are used as soap and the russians call it tatarskoi muilo tartar soap the onosma echioides which grows in the steps about the abakan the tartar girls use as paint for their cheeks the savintree and the rhododendron chrysanthum which will be mentioned more particularly below are medicines known for the same use among the tartars and russians in the jenisei the tartars also dig the rhaphontic for internal use the most common teaplant here is the saxifraga crassifolia and the astringent decoction of the roots is successfully used by the mountaintartars for looseness of the belly and feverish complaints  amongst the plants of some utility in the pagan tartar economy are the hempnettle and little robinea pygmea of the former they make a coarse yarn for strings of selfshooting bows which they set out in autumn and the tough roots of the latter they use as bast they also gather the autumn leaves of the hemerocallis to make soft mats and saddlecushions which they twist together in a very pretty manner  it is not that all these roots and plants are used by one and the same tribe of tartars but i have thrown them together as used in general by some or other of the tartar tribes for any useful purposes my readers may please to try them  on the fifth of september i continued my journey up the abakan more to the south and to the most remote russian dwellings on the taschtyp as soon as we cross the watery askysch we are in the district of the beltirs whose pastures are along the abakan and who claim the right bank of it six miles from this is the winterresidence of eptisch the present baschlyk of the beltir tartars and the birjusses  the beltirs consist at present of   0 tributary men who altogether pay a jassack of  00 rubles like the sajatartars they are under the jurisdiction of kusnezkoi and have a strong resemblance to them in countenance manner and language many of them are rich in cattle and sheep and most of them follow husbandry september is their harvestmonth which like the germans they call orgokai they thresh their corn abroad in the field and burn the straw on the ground their chief crops are summercorn arysch particularly barley asch of which they make groats the ground is turned up with a pickaxe called by them abyl but some have begun to make use of a plough which they call salda in autumn when they have plenty of milk from which some neighbor or other is always distilling brandy they are seldom to be found sober but in the morning  the rich beltirs have generally two or more wives which is seldom the case among the tartars in the jenisei being substantial men they are obstinate in their way of thinking and could not be brought over to christianity of course are rank heathens and are always with their kamens or sorcerers of all the siberian nations the beltirs and the teleutes of kumezkoi with some few mountaineers are the only tartars who do not bury their dead but put them in coffins and place them in trees in some remote parts of the woods the sajan tartars who are not baptized do this less frequently the beltirs will not confess it and i should perhaps not have found it out if when i was collecting the plants i had not met with such a buryingplace in a forest upon the taschtyp where there was placed a young woman and her mother who died out of a beltir family that spent the winter here the coffins were made of roughhewn boards tied together with ropes and in the same manner a board was placed on the top instead of a cover and over it lay some birchbark the coffins were distant from each other about  0 fathoms tied with ropes over two branches of two old larchtrees so low that a cossack with me could easily climb and look into the coffin though the trunk below the branches was cleared of its boughs the body was in its full dress and all sorts of womens clothes lying near the head on one side was a bag with groats a pot with fat and remnants of dried meat the spade with which they dig roots a crooked knife in a case an axe and a horsewhip with a saddle between her legs that she might be ready to ride in the other world one corpse had the head turned toward the west and the other to the east but this may be no certain rule on the tree next such corpse hung the skin of a horse slaughtered on the occasion with the tail and hoofs hung on a stripped branch the head whole bitted and bridled on another branch into the coffin with a man they put their best clothes bow and quiver and if the deceased was fond of music his threestringed lute kobys and his horizontal harp jattagan and they sacrifice at his death his best horse seven days after among the rich a second horse and a mare are slaughtered and the requiem is twice or thrice a year celebrated by the relations it is solemnized but once to the memory of a poor man and a beltir cemetery on that occasion they hang near the deceased a vessel of brandy and the bones of the victim are carefully burnt the beltirs however are said in certain cases to bury their dead and cover the grave with stones  like the katchinzkoi tartars the beltirs have a custom of hanging up little rags and skins of animals about their tents among some i met also with the buratian rag idols ongon consecrated by the magicians at sacrifices  in this district up the askysch begins that remarkable step which extends between the mountains and the low grounds of the abakan and is covered more than any district on the jenisei with old tombs and monuments of an extraordinary size and appearance among these graves which are surrounded with a square wall of granite rock and raised with the walls partly like a flat earth hillock and partly paved with small granites are many stones ornamented with a rough sculpture of human faces deserving a more particular description which with other stone images on the steps of the jenisei have been erected long before the time of the kirguese a mile and an half above the winterhabitation of the beltir chief stood two very narrow stones seven feet high flat on both sides narrower at the top and truncated which now lie along upon the ground both have at the upper end the features of a human face quite flat cut out on them one of which is about half an ell higher than the other and called by the tartars kuss tasch the daughter and has on the edge of the border on the right of the face carved figures of the twobunched camel from top to bottom and on the other edge the ghastly image of a child  the beltirs call the other stone kusi tasch manstone on its right edge below is cut a man on horseback with his lance before him on which a flag hangs and a little higher is carved a bent bow with an arrow on it tolerably large and plain on the other edge are different figures rendered undistinguishable by time on the top is a lance with a triple flag and farther below some square lines and the form of a boat and at the bottom the figure of a child  some hundred fathoms from these stones on the west side of a large tomb encompassed with granites and surrounded with many others stands a piece of large graniterock as high as a man so edged at the top that its point and carved side turns eastwards to the tomb near the point of this granite is a large female face much more relieved than on other stones having its mouth wide open and very much worn and decayed by time on the middle of the stone on the same side are some square lines and elegant carved drawings but quite insignificant this piece of rock is known among the heathen tartars of this district by the name of kurtejaktasch womans stone or ulu kurtejak the big woman and is industriously invoked for good luck in sablehunting by the heathens that pass this way they feed it devoutly by smearing and filling its mouth with fat or butter  but a mile and an half higher up the abakan is the finest monument i have seen among all siberian antiquities this is a tomb four fathoms high and   0 paces in circumference raised upon an eminence so as to be seen at a great distance four other tumuli lying about northwest and southwest at a good distance form a triangle with the great one in the opening of which westwards from the largest tumulus at  00 paces from it three long squaresided sandrock stones rather narrower at the top are so placed that their flat sides face the north and south each stone standing about four feet from the other on the northernmost of these stones on the edge that faces the east a very long but distinguishable face is sculptured out and much relieved which takes up the length of the stone this is called by the tartars kitschi kurtejak the little woman neither of the other stones have any thing remarkable but their eastern edge being hewn like the scales of a fish on the flat side of the stone ornamented with the face are some drawings a very large stone standing on the west of the abovementioned grave more than three else high and one and an half wide has a great many figures on the south side which as far as i could distinguish are a kind of tartar hieroglyphics as inscriptions drawn or scratched on their tombstones some of these pieces are probably the signmanual of the deceased for the pagans in siberia like the common people in russia who cannot write have a particular signature which they use to writings instead of their name and which is acknowledged as valid by their courts of judicature  among the great number of tombs of the fine winterplains on the abakan there are few but what are injured however as i observed some not dug into and desirous of knowing something of their internal structure i ordered a tent to be erected near the kurtujak tasch determining to pass the night here and wait the opening of one of these hills all the monuments about the abakan are so similar externally that they must have been tombs of the same nation the only difference is that some have the ground flat within the square walls and others raised which may be a distinction only of rank or tribe the granite stones that border these graves lay mostly along with one edge on the ground none set up an end but in the northeast southeast and southwest angles those graves which have the largest stones are not wholly surrounded with them some have only a long stone like a pilaster inclining over the grave on those graves which lie near the mountains there is scarce a stone to be seen as the snow and rain from the mountains have washed the earth over them in some the space within the walls is divided into two or three parts by rows of stones placed on end and running from east to west one of which is generally larger and stands higher than the rest these are apparently graves in which several persons of one family are buried the chief difference in these tombs is that some are paved on the top with granitestone and others only filled up with earth i ordered one of the former which seemed to be one entire hill to be opened but no regular coffin was found only a mixture of decayed bones of several bodies laid with the legs toward each other these relics were found at the depth of four feet and a half and in visible disorder with the bones were found broken pieces of earthen vessels various large cookingbasons a bead of a greenishwhite enamelled substance and among the bones a cheekbone with teeth of moderate size but no other parts of the head or other small bones were to be found in another grave only filled with earth and quite flat at top were found at the depth of not quite four feet and a half some large granitestones lying flat but the earth filled up beneath them yet it was plainly to be seen that there was a long square space made with stones running east and west here were found the bones of a man in such order as to see that he was laid with his head toward the east but of the scull and teeth nothing was remaining and every other bone was very imperfect and soft about the head were some single horse and oxbones on the right an earthen boilingvessel squeezed to pieces by stones laid on it and within it a brown dust was perceptible on the left the undistinguishable remains of some piece of crooked wood but in the very middle near where the head lay a very thin round piece of leafgold as big as half a ruble bent over a raised copper button quite rotten with verdigrease perhaps the button of a womans cap the great decay of these bones in so sandy a soil is an indisputable proof of the high antiquity of these tombs though we discovered but little that was curious yet i wished to open other tombs but having no good diggers or gravesearchers among the peasants that attended me i was obliged to give it up  it is said by the russian gravesearchers here that the common graves contain small gold and silver vessels but are not so rich in other pieces of instructive antiquity as the raised earthtombs indeed i was more pleased with the antiquities found with the bodies of the first tomb we opened than with the piece of gold in the other perhaps those interred in the raised tumuli were of that ancient nation who have left so many traces of their knowledge in metallurgy contented therefore with what i had seen i went on the  th toward the taschtyp at the distance of four miles i crossed the brook isse and changed horses at the kobynzian jurts on the brook tie here i met the elders of three tartarean tribes kobyn kargin and kain who are under the jurisdiction of kunezkoi and who like the beltirs received me with great asfability the tribe kobyn consists of    bows that of kargin of  0 which last with some other tribes of mountaineers bear the common name of birjasses the former once inhabited the mountains and lived wretchedly on hunting but since they have settled on the tie and abakan in the territories of the beltirs they are grown rather substantial by adding the breeding of cattle to their employ of hunting in their language make manners and way of living they do not differ from the beltirs and live like all the tartars about the jenisei in jurts covered in summer with birch bark and in winter with sheepwool felts  there was here in the southern parts of the more open mountains an incredible number of partridges who in winter find abundance of food in the warm and snowless meridional parts of the rocky mountains and who run about in crowds very tame and not the least shy  taschtypkaja is the most remote russian village on the waste part of the mongalian frontiers which from the ob to the jenisei is not yet provided with fortresses and regular troops it is situated at the bottom of the high mountains where woods begin to cover their tops on the left of the taschtyp are five dwellings inhabited by cossacks from krasnojarskaja who voluntarily offered to do the frontierduty which used to be done by tartars this people have found the place excellently adapted for agriculture breeding of cattle and hunting sometimes the corn suffers by early white frosts and sometimes by caterpillars but on the whole the harvest is usually a good one for breeding of cattle they have the finest meadows and it is a rich place for hunting there are indeed but few sables but these they can procure from the poor tartars by giving them bread and groats in exchange in fact this district well deserves numerous population the taschtyp is a large brook which in spring and rainy weather flows so plentifully that on the shallowest spots it is scarcely fordable by horses it flows here between two high chalk mountains which extend further up and down the abakan are from hence covered with larchtrees and firwoods intersected with fine open valleys from the village to its mouth in the abakan it is about    miles on the other side of the frontier which is chinese mongalia no mongols live but a people called sojet that subsist on hunting keep reindeer and in language and blood seem related to the motores on the oi and tuba and of course to the koibales and samojedes before the chinese had any guards on their frontiers there was always here a road of communication between siberia and mongalia  besides the frontiermark of this place there is another eastwards on the jenisei at the mouth of the kenitschuk into that river but there is no getting to it except over the ice in winter  about the taschtyp are tartars of the tribes of kain and kobyn the former has but    military men but the tribe schors further down the masna has  0 as these have no opportunity for agriculture and are poor in cattle their subsistence consists in wild roots and hunting living in wildernesses inaccessible to others and being rank heathens in winter they wander with their little cattle down the taschtyp where the snow does not fall too deep the sables being scarce in this district they go to the wild morasses on the opposite shore of the jenisei in the district of krasnojarskaja to catch this animal in order to pay their tribute but the koibales who pretend to claim that district will not suffer them to hunt with nets but often take their instruments and toils from them  i continued at taschtyp on the  th of september and spent the whole day in climbing the mountains along the brook in search of plants underneath a steep rock after having had the good luck to climb up a young bear by the rattling of a falling stone was moved from his abode took flight and as we by hallooing and shouting frightened him still more he swam through the taschtyp in order to hide himself in an adjacent wood i sent a tartar with this intelligence to the next jurts and in less than half an hour a number of armed tartars on horseback hastened on all sides pursuing the bear close through an open field over which he wanted to take refuge in a distant mountain they killed him in this field and we had the pleasure of surveying the chase from the high mountain and were much astonished at the courage of a tartarean horse which overtook the bear first and beat him down on the rocky ground with his forefeet previous to his being killed  the plants here are common to the districts of dauria and the mountains in the east of siberia on the chalky mountains grows in many places the savintree juniperus sabina this tree is occasionally conveyed to krasnojarskaja and tomskoi as a famous domestic remedy the knowledge of which seems to have originated from the tartars and the name they give it artschin the russians have adopted they use its branches not only superstitiously to smoke off malicious spirits but the same is also serviceable to sick children and in disorders of the head to grown people and if the smoke will not operate with efficacy they swallow some of it it is also said to be of great service for various disorders of the belly  but a more valuable plant still in all chinese disorders is a fine species of snowrose described fully a bear chase in flor sibir vol iv page     tab    which grows here on low bushes as also on the lofty alps and in dauria with sulphuryellow flowerbunches rhododendron chrysanthum and hard and thick leaves like those of lauro crasus this rare plant likes the rocky mossy caps of the snowmountains in dauria where it is called by the common people tschernogrif and kelarsk and has been taken notice of by mr sokolof on the bare summits of the partitionmountains situated between the sources of the kirkun and tschikoi it is gathered here on two lofty mountains on the jenisei where it gows and also abundantly about the roads and paths that lead to the frontiermarks by the cossack soldiers who carry it home to their wives and relations as a fine medicine the tartars call it schu drinking only its leaves boiled in water in moderate quantities as a wholesome tea this tea however has no very sensible operation or efficacy unless made too strong when it attacks the head but if some of its small branches with their leaves are put into a glazed pan covered close down and suffered to boil with water over a stove it makes a strong bitter and brown liquor which if taken internally throws the patient into a feverish drunkenlike state of insensibility during which the internal parts or limbs affected are in an incessant motion this intoxication quits the patient sooner than that of spirituous liquors and leaves no headache nor the least in disposition and commonly after once or twice taking cs the disorder or  part the heat excited by it makes the patient very thirsty and if he drinks any cold water will be attended with violent vomiting but this vomiting is salutary and particularly serviceable in all complaints of the belly the cossacks use it in all rheumatic cases and chronic pains in the limbs which it is said to cure infallibly by a violent and continual twitching in those limbs it is also said to mitigate pains in the limbs arising from that scourge of mankind the venereal disease and i saw living instances in dauria where it cured this disorder however this plant must certainly be classed among the specific strong vegetable remedies and might by care and proper management of able physicians become an excellent application in all podagrical arthritic complaints and internal chronic obstructions of the bowels and deserves therefore every experiment to be made of it the abovementioned effects i wrote down not only on the universal report of numbers of common people who had experienced its virtues but even on the assertion of mr sokolof who used it with success on his return from dauria when he was rendered quite weak and ill by an obstructed diarrhoea i must also add that the cossacks generally culled this plant in autumn when it is in seed and many of its leaves are become yellow how much more efficacious therefore must it be if gathered earlier whilst in bloom it blossoms in the beginning of july and soon loses its beauty like all mountainplants it has been remarked that stags and the siberian muscus devour its leaves without any intoxicating effects i found some in the stomach of the former probably this plant like the kalmia of north america may be detrimental to the stag but not to other domestic animals  the river abakan where we crossed is more than  0 fathoms broad very deep as rapid as an arrow and difficult to pass however having prepared a ferry we effected it and in my way to sajanskoiostrog a distance of    miles i passed the night of the  th of september in the jurts of the koibales about four miles from the jenisei and eight from sajanskoiostrog  the koibales with whom i got acquainted this day are a very different set of people from all the pagan tartars hitherto mentioned not in their persons manner of living and dress but in appearance and language and of course in origin their language is much like that of the samojedes and though rendered confused by a strong mixture of tartar yet it may probably be concluded from the considerable remains of the former language among the koibal hordes motores etc that this and other scattered tribes must be a remnant of the samojede nations driven from their ancient abodes as far as the dolar countries the following list of words is a sufficient proof of the resemblance of the languages of those nations and that of the motores seems to be most like the samojede  words samojede koibalian motore karagassian god chai chudai burkan tere heaven number number orchochairachan tere devil sjudybe staala sedkyr clouds tir kinsiga ti di snow syra sir sir sira

jenisei they reckon    tribes all which contain only     men who pay tribute they are almost all baptized and have laid their pagan customs aside at least publicly aged and fullgrown people they bury in the ground but children when dead they expose on trees as do the beltirs they are not very opulent in cattle but live tolerably well by hunting and agriculture yet some of them will possess a hundred horses they use the russian plough saban sow more grain than they want and sell the overplus to the tartars they gather also more wildflax and nettles than the tartars and make ropes of them many have wooden winterdwellings and even those who wander about in tents keep poultry they hunt in large companies and kill a great many sables beavers and otters which they claim an exclusive right to their first huntingseason is at the end of august in december and january they catch sables beavers otters lynxes and other scarce and dear animals but in march they hunt elks and stags in their snowscates their furs are mostly conveyed by commission to kusnezkoi but they pay their tribute in the hides of elks and stags and make up any deficiency in money they catch the hyena in the following manner this animal is said to follow the track of foxes in order to share their prey they therefore fix traps and selfshooting bows about such tracks to which the hyena falls a victim first when the koibales are hunting in the wintertime on the mountainous wildnernesses where their horses cannot feed on account of the deep snow they search for those stores of hay laid up in considerable heaps under the rocks or about the trees by the little cliffhare lepus alpinus these heaps consist of the most juicy plants and among the rest a great deal of wolfsbane but it does not hurt the horses about these heaps are many deep paths in which these little industrious animals run up and down  there are but few old customs remaining among the koibales their women wear tresses hanging to the shoulders and caps like those of the mongols they are delivered of their children kneeling and supported by some man but a female friend performs the office of the midwife the lyingin woman is fed with a great deal of butter and fat meat and is not suffered to drink any thing cold for the first three days at the expiration of which time she returns to her business but during her state of impurity which is eleven days or a fortnight she must not dress any victuals for her husband in the first seven days she is washed thrice and after this once a month for some time but her last purification is being smoked with the irwen which is the sabin of linnaeus  i will say a few words here of the motores in particular there are scarce  0 families of them the smallpox having twice raged among them formerly there were about  0 who paid tribute and these resided about the mountains beyond sajanskoiostrog till they were removed from the frontiers toward abakanskoi and beyond the tuba their dress and clothes still differ from the koibales they are poor possess but little cattle and live chiefly by hunting and serving the russians the few there are were baptized about  0 years ago and formerly placed their dead between three boards upon trees to keep their tents warm they cover them in winter with hay at other times with birchbark their doors are made in the east side and they either cannot or will not remember their former superstitions  here is a mine also in this neighborhood that contains silver but these works are at present suspended on the   th of september having prepared every thing for crossing the jenisei which is here only  00 fathoms wide we got our wagons over but with difficulty  in the village where we slept i met with an old peasant who was not a searcher of ore but an experienced digger of hidden treasures he made no secret of his art and to him and his assistants am i indebted for several good accounts of the nature of the ancient tombs on the jenisei and am therefore less scrupulous of committing them to paper convinced by viewing freshopened tombs of the truth of what he told me  the ancient tombs he said might be divided into two kinds the first of which consisted of tombs of stone the other of earthhills surrounded with stone in stonegraves bodies are often found described as above their head to the east in a sepulcher or case made of stones the bones of the head are chiefly mouldered into dust on the right side of the head are generally found large earthen basins and relics of common wooden householdfurniture in the principal graves of this kind which differed not externally from the rest except in the size of the stones made use of have been found elegant silver vessels gold plates buttons and other hornaments horsefurniture made of iron inlaid or plated with gold and silver and sometimes though very rare copperfurniture sometimes the bones of burnt bodies have been found in a little space cased with stone  the large gravehills made of earth only are still more remarkable and seem to belong to a very different nation these are in districts separate from those where the stonetombs are raised on certain heights and level ground as numerous and close together as in a churchyard in these are found plain and complete timberwork large but decayed hence it appears that the bodies in these graves were laid in a place lined with thick beams laid upon each other something like the house of a russian peasant and the whole apparently covered with birchbark and other wood which broke in the cover of the sepulcher by its weight in these places have been found the bones of two or three bodies and at the feet several little toys interred with the corpse earth and copper vessels remnants of wooden vessels and ladles copper tools of all sorts daggers and knives with traces of scabbards and other small instruments about the head are found buttons buckles plated with gold and other appearances of dress occasionally in the bestpreserved tombs have been found visible pieces of gold and silk stuff and remains of fablehair in some were found bones of large and small animals and several little angular pyramids of various figures in castcopper representing chessmen or something similar remains of lances and staves of honor are also met with where men have been buried and crutches of cast copper sometimes wreathed with stripes of hammeredgold nay sometimes solid plates of gold have been found probably the ornaments of the neck or arms girdles and the handles of daggers decorated with gold in other sepulchers besides whole bodies are some burnt whose bones lie in a heap together commonly near the sides of the tomb and in such heaps of ashes often lie small plates of gold and other little things in other graves again are seen things whose use or meaning cannot be devised an old digger of these graves however assured me he once found a mans head made hollow of fine porcelainearth almost as large as life painted with green and red leaves and another once found a duck carved in the bark of aspen and thinly covered with gold another made me a present of a wild sheep cast in copper standing on a round pedestal the produce of such a grave they have also found many buttons formed like bells on which the figure of a chamois was engraved as i have mentioned once before every thing in copper was cast some traces of iron have been found one of these men said he once met with a rusty piece of an axe in iron but such metal is very rare  they are of opinion that most of these tombs have been opened and plundered long since as the bones are often seen lying in the greatest confusion and in these graves nothing of any value is found in large tombs are skeletons of horses with remnants of saddles and other horsefurniture without the wooden case but beneath the earth the human bones found are generally of the common size yet they assured me they have found gigantic ones  in the district about the schusch and other places especially east of the jenisei are graves containing a great quantity of confused bones rare lances and the copper points of arrows evident proofs of battles  four miles up the schuner on the jenisei lies sajanskoi ostrog it is a fortress  0 fathoms square the walls timber with towers in the angles and two gates encompassed with a ditch and cheveauxdefrize within are five caserns a provision storehouse a powder magazine and six cannon the garrison consists of seven cossacks and a corporal as the rocky soil of this place will not admit of husbandry the houses of these men are in the adjacent villages and two men only at a time mount guard here to take care of the powder and cannon so that the place looks empty though the buildings are in a good state  i made an attempt to go further up the jenisei by leaving my lightwaggon and going on horseback but could get no farther than about seven miles to the fortress omaitura which lies in a very rocky corner close to the river under the mountains that join the jenisei and stop all further passage by land this place is called by the tartars logina osida the siege of login but why no one can tell before the russian settlement a kirguese horde is said to have taken refuge here in winter to be free from their persecutors till they went on further in spring in the mountains of mongalia when the tryingpits on the oi were worked here was a passage on the river for the workmen the mouth of the oi being just opposite this spot  in my way i saw an innumerable quantity of partridges and quails the adjacent mountains are crowded with them these birds spent the winter here underneath the snow the cause that prevents their wandering to warmer southern climes is the high mountains which are much sooner covered with snow and which as the autumn drives them here from the lowlands blocks up their passage southwards into europe  on the night of the   th rose a violent storm from southwest which continued next day and then changed to northwest and caused a great frost however i continued my journey early in the morning down the jenisei toward krasnojarskaja and at the distance of    miles from where i set out my two wagons were passed over the oi which is here  0 fathoms wide but not without danger as the storm continued the village ustoiskaja on both sides lies not far from its mouth into the jenisei besides the peasants of the place cossacks here reside who do the frontierduty hence we are naturally led    miles up the oi to oikebesch karaul which lies on the very spot where the oi and kebesch unite and which is the middle and most remote frontierpost the next post is    miles further up the oi and is distant from abakanskaja     miles the post next following is    miles but the distance from that to the first frontierguard of winskoi on account of the wildness of the mountains is not known the frontiermarks are visited by three guardstations each of which has garrisons and are distant from oikebeschkaraul    miles from the guardpost lastmentioned the line runs up the kebesch over a high mountain to the brook taradanu and then down the brook along the mountaintrack usimarga to the river us from whose borders the snowmountain chointaban rises sleeply to the skies hence the boundary runs east over the us so that the loftiest mountains about its source which run along the northeast arm of the jenisei giving the selenga its sources belong to mongalia this mountainous district is so wild and dangerous that it cannot be ridden over in the best of seasons we were obliged to travel on foot driving our horses before us not to run the risk of falling every moment down the rocks  being assured that on the high rocks about the us were many of these large chamoises called by the tartars of this place toghe and by the mongols takja which are not now found farther within siberia i had obtained orders for the tartars of udinskoi to endeavor to catch me one in the month of january      but i was lucky enough to receive two frozen ones from udinskoi before i left siberia they had been killed between the uda and birjussa by some karagassians the one was very old and had lost his left horn probably by a fall and the other was a young but fullgrown animal the mountaintartars call the buck toghe the shegoat hima and the young ones bitschinja the size of the siberian chamois is the same in proportion to the helvetian one as the siberian stoneram or argali is to the muslon of corsica his color may be compared with the cabrit of guinea and some deerlike kirguisian shegoats the young buck was more lightcoloured and less black than the old one the general color is a lightbrown gray on the body the hair is not much longer than that of the stag but more like goatshair the forepart of the belly is longhaired and so is the neck hindpart of the head and forehead the longest hair which is rather above four inches is on the breast it has a short deerstail black above and white on the sides a stripe along the breast shoulders thighs and forefeet and a spot between the eyes the beard which was about six inches long in the old chamois was all black but the young one had only some black spots on the feet the joints of the forelegs and the beard the breast belly and feet were otherwise white the horns were bent in form of a scythe very strongly pressed together sideways shorter about the upper edge and strongly knotted or else flat wrinkled and striped the lefthorn of the old one was four inches long and had    knots the feet of this animal are uncommonly strong and solid and the shoulders much more fleshy than the thighs owing to the animals leaping on it is forefeet when it jumps from rock to rock betwixt the hair the chamois has a rich gray fleece all over the back and neck exactly like that of the tamegoat  i shall say nothing of the old smeltingsurnaces and bingplaces met with here and about the tuba but now deserted under the pretense of ore being scarce mr gmelin having mentioned and described them in his tour all i shall observe is that there was found near these bingplaces an old iron ploughshare of a peculiar form  my road led me over the mountain kuna where the way down on the north side is steep on the back of this mountain are two tombs or heaps of stones one near the other to which every tartar who passes this way adds one or throws a bush these tombs are said to have been made when the kirguese inhabited this district the common story among the tartars is that a rich kirguese bey had two fine wives so jealous that he was obliged to have two jurts for them one on each side of the mountain and that he lived on each side himself by turns but it unfortunately happened that these two met together when changing of pastures fought and killed each other and are buried under these heaps of stones  near this place are some tartarian jurts where i remained all night but could not sleep owing to a kusnez of the aimak of tubinskoi remarkable for having a large spot on his head overgrown with white hair which grew so after a sore he had in his head was healed these white spots are always the effect of sores some jakutian and tschulym tartars are born so this man was perfect master of the lute and a real troubadour in telling and singing tales which according to their interpretation were similar to those of ariosto he sung each stanza first to the lute and then repeated it in a droll declaiming tone the harmony of the voices of the katschinzy tartars is much like that of the kalmucks and delightful in the open air their young people spend whole evenings in singing to the lute not songs but some strange insignificant notes for example oidoido tidumdido and with great enthusiasm  katschinzian tartars  i shall here add some observations on these tartars to complete what has been said of them in the preceding year the remark i made of their beardless mongol faces was now more confirmed and herein is this horde distinguished from all other siberian tartars being very rich in cattle they neither profess agriculture nor christianity yet they sow a little siberian buckwheat and barley to make groats like the mongols they are satisfied with one wise often court for three four or five years on which account parents suffer their children to be courted early but some have already abolished the kalym or marriageprice and those who do receive any thing for their daughters get it by instalments the suitor is never suffered to be alone with the bride before the nuptials have been celebrated as it would be highly disgraceful to the lady to have any prior intimacy with her intended husband this however is quite contrary to the custom of the mongols and kalmucks the first nuptialfeast is given by the brides father the next by the bridegroom and for their second feast the bridegrooms father erects a jurt for the young couple but the householdfurniture and garments of the bride are provided by her father after the first courtship the fatherinlaw never sees his sons wife again nor does he enter his sons jurt and should the fatherinlaw meet her by chance custom enjoins her to throw herself prostrate on her face till her fatherinlaw passes which he does with the utmost precipitation the motherinlaw and the brides father may have free access to the young couples tent when they please the bride is often richly presented with cattle on her marriage by her parents and should her husband grow tired of her and send her home after an interval of some years he only returns the number of cattle she brought with her all the children and the increase of her flocks and herds are his own this blameable custom induces many to court rich girls merely to enjoy the produce of her fortune and after several years cohabitation the unhappy female is repudiated should she wish for a divorce on her own account without having had a son she has no return and her parents are liable to refund the husbands kalym both parties are at liberty to marry again after such a divorce daughters are made equal in patrimony to their brothers and where there is no brother the father can give verbally his whole property to his daughter women do not cohabit with their husbands after delivery for one whole month and during the continuance of their impurity which is at least  0 days she is not suffered to do any domestic business at the time of her delivery many women of the neighborhood assemble at her jurt but her father does not leave it the child receives either the name of the first stranger that comes into the jurt after its birth or the father gives it one himself and hence many pagan tartars have russian names  the chief festival celebrated both by the katschinzi tartars and other heathens of that nation is the feast of spring tun when they begin to milk their mares this feast is not celebrated by all at one time but by degrees one family after another through the whole neighborhood it consists in tippling and the host preserves his milk for three days to distill a sufficient quantity of brandy or spirit after the first feast several neighboring tribes meet together go up on a hill and there perform a solenm sacrifice with prayers chudeiga basheraga directed toward the east at other times as in cases of sickness and necessity they offer to their tus or housegod called also aima little animals skins flesh etc at their public sacrifices a kham or sorcerer must be present who consecrates a horse which they call ysik and which according to the injunctions of the schamans must be either a gray foxcoloured or black gelding such a consecration is only performed when a magician thinks proper to bless the flocks of his countrymen this ysik or consecrated horse is washed every spring during the feast of the tun with milk and boiled wormwood irwen and also incensed with that herb decorated with red and white rags about his mane and tail and then turned loose the owner durst not ride him unless some snow has fallen then he is obliged to saddle him and when the snow disappears to turn him loose again when the animal is too old to ride the owner may sell him and get a young one consecrated as his successor if its owner dies the sacred horse is not slaughtered but becomes the property of his heirs  the katschinzi tartars are great cooks and dress their food in the french fashion at present they have two magicians of their own but formerly were obliged to borrow those of the tomskoi tartars of kysil aimak residing near the black yjus i saw the dress of a katschinzian sorcerer at karysch which had been made many years before he entered the holy profession or at least before he wished to pass for a sorcerer his dress as a beginner was but moderate he jobbed about without a cap with particolored leather stockings and on his body a narrow dirty great coat of printed callico over his shoulders he wore a red piece of cloth like a collar from which    ribbands sysim hung down of various colors green yellow red blue and black sewed together and various colored silk and cotton rags some worked through with mock gold so as that no one was like the other instead of the magic drum he held a piece of wood in one hand round in the middle flat at both ends like an oar and ornamented with a little bell on which he tinkled very briskly striking it alternately on each side with a wooden beater many other sorcerers use the same magic instrument saying they are obliged so to do till their spirits will suffer them to beat a drum but the truth is they cannot afford to purchase one and wait for the slaughter of some good horse whose skin they can get to make one for such a sacrifice is requisite to furnish them with a drum  of late years a kind of rage has unhappily seized many girls at the time their menses first makes its appearance and continues for several years it is so violent that they often run out of their tents make frightful faces pluck out their hair and would either hang or kill themselves if they were not prevented these fits last but a few hours but they have an irregular relapse weekly or monthly i saw such girls between the fits very rational and welldisposed  the venereal disease is also become common of late years and breaks out at first in boils on the head body and groin the tartars call it kotur  the smallpox tschetschiak is here only occasionally sometimes not heard of for many years but when once it prevails makes great ravage especially among children and young people when a fear of catching it a bad attendance therein the uncleanliness of the diet and abode and impurity of the blood seldom fail to carry the patient off it raged here about  0 years since  the katschinzy tartars occupy the finest district of the regency of krasnojarskaja which is all the land between the white yjus and the jenisei to the uybat and abakan they are divided into six aimaks each has a presiding kusnez confirmed by the regency of krasnojarskaja who collects the tribute decides little causes and maintains good order but he has no salary and pays his headmoney equally with the lowest of the tribe they amount to      tributary heads or families and pay annually a jassak of      rubles in this district are also settled four other hordes of tartars amounting to      they live like all substantial tartars on the jenisei in felttents in winter only which they stow away in summer in cavities of rocks known only to themselves in order to preserve them dry to cover their jurts again the next autumn for this purpose they collect birchbark about the end of june a season when it is in the best state to keep out wet by boiling they clear it of all gumminess preserving only the resinous parts which renders it smooth and not liable to rot hence the month of june is called toosai birchmonth  i observed among these tartars and beltirs a particular manner of making milkbrandy different from that of the tunguse and the mongol kalmucks yet more like the tunguse brandy or spirit and better than both the still which they use is different and they put a sheeps head into the milk which after distillation is boiled with small minced meat as a soup and which they greedily devour as a great dainty they also pour milk into the curds which they will sometimes eat fresh and sometimes dry in pieces called bischro and take it with them as a provision when they go a hunting  on the   th i crossed the brook koksa and rode down the jenisei along the limits abovementioned to the place where we cross for the abakan here i copied some of the inscriptions already spoken of that were most preserved three of them i laid before major wolassof a gentleman of great erudition and versed in antiquities who was commissioned on frontierbusiness at selenginskaja but the interpreters of this place could not make them out not being written in mongol or manshurian language but with an ancient current character used by some chinese  i had now    miles to karyshkoirudnik where mr surjef waited for me having acquitted himself of the charge i had entrusted him with that of inspecting some bitter saltlakes on the abakan  the autumnal season which every day grew more cold and bad determined me to go back to krasnojarskaja where i had enough to employ me i returned therefore on the   th and arrived there on the   d by the same road i passed last year in order to return from siberia i was obliged to wait for the sledgeseason and the arrival of mr georgi and some gentlemen students i had left behind me in dauria  at krasnojarskaja on the opposite shore of the jenisei they often find elephant bones and i took up myself a grinder of this animal from under a high sandbank a mile or two from the town but could find no mark or traces of marine bodies south of this place to the sajanian mountains  professor pallas has frequently spoken of some great change in the earth evident from the number of such bones found and the marine substances so frequently met with in the low lands of siberia it will be rather interrupting his narrative but i persuade myself it must be gratifying to every philosophic reader to know his opinion on this subject buffon and others have thought that mountains owe their origin to convulsive motions of the earth being thrown up by subterraneous fires pallas was of the same way of thinking till he traversed the extensive wilds of siberia and tartary but on a minute examination of the contents of these mountains and those of the plains below them he is now convinced that the hypothesis is an erroneous one these mountains are a continued chain of solid granite rock extending over a vast continent from sea to sea not found in layers but in blocks and lumps or at least in masses heaped one upon another not discovering the smallest trace of petrifactions or organic impression of course it appears to have been formed prior to all organized nature the highest eminences these rocky mountains form whether in ridges or sharp pikes do not seem to have been covered again by clayey or calcareous layers originally from the sea but to have been there from the earliest periods of time or ever since they obtained their elevated and landed situation above the level of the seas of course we are to suppose that this granite substance which forms these mountains and is also the core of the vastest alps of the known world is the principal materials or substance of the interior of our globe  leaving these chains of mountains we perceive the calcareous beds rapidly tending to the plain taking a horizontal position and becoming abundant in all manner of shells madrepora and other spoils of the ocean the same are met in the lowest valleys at the foot of the mountains the whole extent likewise of great russia is filled with them appearing no less on the hills than in the flat countries sometimes solid as if sown with marine productions at others altogether composed of shells and broken madrepora and that calcareous gravel always found in those latitudes where the sea abounds with such productions  as soon as from the marshes of ingria which form toward the baltic a sort of gulf in low lands we begin to ascend the elevated soil of russia whose declivity makes what is commonly called the mountains of valdais and continually meet with ancient traces of the sea over a country which has visibly suffered from an inundation of the greatest violence these are terrene layers of a depositum strewn with blocks of granite broke from their original rocks vast banks of rolled flints and gravel mixed with petrifactions and even the bones of animals a similar inundation may be traced as far as the lake onega where the mountains from the lapland and swedish alps begin to rise it is sufficient to cast the eye over the map to see in the great number of lakes between the gulf of finland and the whitesea in the isles the rocks and the broken shores of these latitudes the effect of a deluge which has run that way of course it may be concluded that the baltic and whiteseas those great breaches of the continent have been excavated by the same violence  hence it follows that all those vast plains of the russian empire were formerly the bottom of the ocean and that the elevated grounds and high chains of mountains have always been islands and continents much less extensive than at present and that owing probably to the successive effects of volcanoes other subterranean powers and a deluge the seas may have left it  in the sandy and other slimy depositums are found trunks of trees entire and fragments of wood petrified and often mineralized by copper or iron petrified wood is often found in the sandhills on the plains nay in the sandy heights of the sysran on the wolga changed into very fine hone which has preserved the original texture of the wood and is remarkable for the vestiges of those gnawing worms that attack the bottom of ships and other timbers laid in water and whose proper origin is from the indian sea here are also interred the remains of the larger animals of the indies the bones of elephants of rhinocerosses and of monstrous buffaloes are frequently dug up in numbers and are the admiration of the curious these great bones laid in beds mixed with little calcined tellinae bones of fishes etc prove sufficiently that they have been transported by inundations and was what convinced dr pallas of the reality of a deluge that had happened on our earth but the carcass of a rhinoceros which pallas has deposited in the cabinet of the academy of sciences at petersburg and which was found with the skin entire the remains of the tendons ligaments and cartilages in the frozen lands near the banks of the uli is another convincing proof that it must have been a most violent and rapid inundation which could formerly have carried such carcases toward these frozen climes and before putrefaction had time enough to destroy their softer parts  it must then have been that deluge of which almost all the ancient people of asia the chaldeans the persians the indians the thibetans and the chinese have preserved the tradition and fix it within a few years of the general deluge of moses to which subsequent inundations may have added their influence  the greatest curiosity in mineralogy discovered in the district of krasnojarsk is an enermous mass of pure iron weighing  0 puds or near   00lb on which i shall expatiate a little this most curious mass was discovered in    0 on a mountain where they made a tryingpit for ironore and where it lay on the surface but not then thought worthy of notice among the miners who made the discovery was a mr john mettich who gave me the following account of the situation of this ironmass in writing in      a reformed cossack an inhabitant of ubeiskaja announced a hard iron ore at the top of a high mountain describing that where the mass stood this ironore stood lodelike on a little rockshelf turned to the north i was sent to examine it and found it on an assay to have gold alloy the lode stood in a hard chertzlike gray matrix of which the whole mountain seemed to consist about   0 fathoms southwest from this spot i observed at the top of the mountain thinly overgrown with red and white firs a lump of iron apparently above  0 puds in weight full of yellow hard little stones of the size of a cedarnut which could not be knocked out this and the sound appeared to me remarkable yet i cannot say it grew thus naturally or whether it was brought there as it was lying on day on the surface of the ground on a strict examination i found no traces of old mineworks or smeltinghearths throughout the whole extent of the mountain i know that this cossack afterward carried the lump away but what is become of it i cannot tell  all these circumstances were found true after the mountain had been strictly examined the iron ore is a solid blueblack with here and there a magnetic quickstone metal yielding on assay a  0th part of raw iron the cossack who is now a blacksmith could not tell the exact situation or place where this iron lump lay but what he said was probably agreeable to what mr mettich wrote down he averred that it lay quite on the surface on the top of the mountain without being encompassed with any other cliff or strata he also assured me that he never found any mark of an old smelthearth or work neither on this nor on the opposite mountain but as the malleability and whiteness of the iron and the sonorous found of the lump made him suspect it might contain some more noble metal than common iron and his suspicions being still increased by the tartars who considered it as a sacred thing fallen from heaven he endeavored as no works were ordered after having announced this one to convey it to his dwelling at    miles distance which he did with the greatest difficulty  i received information of this piece of massive iron in november      by a tartarean soldier who was very useful to me in collecting matters relative to natural history this soldier entered by chance the house of the above cossack who found the iron and seeing it in his yard it struck him as a curiosity knocking off with great trouble a few little pieces he brought them to me for an assay but as this assay though imperfect seemed very ferruginous i ordered the soldier to go without delay to the village where this man lived which was   0 miles distant from krasnojarskaja and bring me the whole mass which weighed above    puds  the whole seems to have been encompassed by a raw ferruginous crust which was lost by hammering it to knock off some pieces the whole internal part consists of a slender white iron interspersed with little holes or cells like a seasponge and the interstices filled with round and oblong drops of a yellow transparent and pure glass or hyacinthusflux these drops have various oblong round shapes and a very smooth surface with one two three or more flat sides about the truncated part of their rounded bodies which flow often together with other drops this texture and drops are from the size of a grain of hemp seed to a large pea and either of a pure yellow or a yellowbrown or greenish color and are uniform throughout the mass without any appearance of smelting or artificial fire the iron is so tough that three or four smiths were working a whole forenoon to knock off a piece from one of its corners though such piece weighed seldom more than a pound or two except one piece that weighed a pud and was sent for assay to the academy of sciences at petersburgh by the blows the flux is reduced into a kind of glassdust and often falls out in whole drops with which glass might be cut in short the whole mass and each piece cut out from it proves incontestibly that this huge production came out of natures lap but he whose eyes cannot be convinced by the sight of it will find the following remarks not quite useless  it appears that the ancient miners whose bingplaces and smeltinghearths are to be met with in the metallic districts about the jenisei never worked any iron nor had any knowledge of it as all tools even their military weapons and knives were made of cast copper but wherever these tryingpits are seen on ferruginous ochres they had gold alloy in view their bingplaces consist of raw stone and meltcopper pebbles and wherever any iron bingplaces are found it is known that their proceedings were so poor and imperfect probably on account of their unsettled and vagabond way of living that they would never have been able to melt a lump of four puds much less one of  0 puds which would require a very high blast and should this be considered as possible against all probability yet there could be no cause why such a huge mass unfit for smiths work on account of the slux with which it is mixed should have been conveyed from the place where it had been smelted to the lofty and steep top of a mountain destitute in itself and its vicinage of all marks of works or smelting  that such a large mass of iron must have been melted by a very high blast has been the opinion of mons de engelstrom in a discourse he held on the  th of may      in the royal academy of sciences at stockholm occasioned by the description here given of this mass of pure iron published in the petersburgh and other foreign gazettes before i had seen the whole mass i was almost of the same opinion but afterward was very particular in enquiring and examining whether there were any traces of smeltinghearths on the mountain where the lump was found or its environs though its huge size alone showed the incontestible impossibility of its being so produced which i found confirmed by my search mons de engelstrom says the transparent flux intimates a previous smelting he must certainly mean a smelting in the bosom of nature or his reasoning deserves no assent of mine though i never saw any mark of ancient volcanoes in the siberian mountains i would not have him however pin his faith on my credit but on the credit of the whole academy of sciences at petersburgh and many others who have seen bunches of this massive iron not containing the least appearance of coals melted in nor the least mark of fire produced by human hands and the whole mass which weighs still more than    puds and has been brought to petersburgh will be an eternal proof of it in the imperial cabinet of natural history the want of natural iron in the most metallic mountains of sweden is so little a proof against the existence of it elsewhere as against the truth of there being redlead spar in siberia because there has not been any found in foreign mines or of the tin ores in russia because they have not yet been discovered in the uralian and siberian mountains  the true account above given and the following arguments must insure the belief of every one because if all other circumstances were unfavourable and contrary to fact the following reasons must prove that the lump of iron in question is natural and no production of artificial fire iron melted in fire looks blackish dry and not transparent but the flux in the massive iron we have been speaking of is pure transparent looks fattish and falls to pieces if the bunch is put into the fire had the grains been mixed with iron in artificial fire the whole mass would not have so closely been filled up but the iron must have been impure and full of holes there is no artificial fire that can give iron so regular a form resembling a sponge it would have been in grains and rough pieces blown together like impure bings when taken out of the blast all these circumstances put it beyond the shadow of a doubt even to those who have not seen the lump and those who have must be convinced by ocular demonstration  winter began very soon in the present year and spread in december its uncommon chilling blasts throughout the country on the  th and  th of december was the severest cold i ever yet felt in siberia the air was still and as it were thickened by it and in the serene sky the sun looked as if enveloped in a fog the  th in the morning i looked at my hairtube thermometer acknowledged to be an excellent one and it pointed but at     degrees the mercury had retreated into the little globe which this instrument has and some little columns stuck in the tube and stood fast a circumstance i never observed in my thermometer for the eight years i had used it the warmth of a moderately heated room to which i carried it from the gallery of the house occasioned the stopped column of quicksilver to drop instantly and the quicksilver in the little globe rose after the space of half a minute i repeated this experiment different times and always with the same success so that sometimes but one and sometimes more than one little piece of mercury stuck in the tube when the globe was warmed by the fingers the quicksilver rose and we saw plainly that the frozen sticking columns made a long resistance and were finally drawn up by a kind of sudden impulse during this i put into an open basin about a quarter of a pound of mercury which had been thoroughly cleaned by vinegar and leather and also well dried and set it in the cold in the gallery on the north side of my lodging and in less than an hour i found its borders and surface fast frozen and in a few minutes more the whole was condensed by natural cold into a soft and little mass whilst the part beneath the surface was not frozen the frozen part exhibited all sorts of branchlike wrinkles but the most part remained smooth the frozen part of the mercury was more flexible than lead but bent short it was more fragile than tin and in thin plates was somewhat granulous when struck with a hammer if the hammer was sufficiently chilled the quicksilver fell into drops at every blow so it did with the finger whose end when touching the mercury felt as if benumbed in a temperate room it thawed like wax over the fire drop by drop from the surface not melting at once if the frozen mass was broken in the cold the broken pieces stuck to each other and to the basin wherein they lay though the frost seemed to abate a little before night yet the frozen mercury lay unchanged and the same experiment with the thermometer could be always repeated on the  th of september i had an opportunity to make the same observations during the whole day but a few hours after sunset arose a northwest wind which raised the thermometer to     degrees and here the mass of quicksilver began to dissolve  shortly after lieutenant general de brill governor of irkuzkaja assured me he found there on the  th of december at four in the morning that all the mercury in a thermometer and barometer made by the most skilful hand of professor laxmann during his residence in siberia was hard frozen in the barometer it stood at    inches seven lines and was in small pieces of fivelines each to the top toward    in the morning it was fluid again and at one oclock the barometer was    inches seven lines high and at nine at night    inches the thermometer was chilled to     and beneath     was an empty space of nine degrees about    oclock all had entered the globe and about  0 oclock next morning when it thawed again it rose and pointed     and at three oclock and some minutes     all according to de lisle the air the whole day was calm and serene  from mr sokolofs tour along the daurian frontiers which he undertook in pursuance of my directions in the course of the last summer i must not omit mentioning a hot well which he visited on the   th of july famous among the tunguse tartars for its salubrious qualities it lies straight north from the frontierguard on the banks of the balyra at the distance of two good days journey or     miles the water is perfectly clear but a little bluish has the smell and taste of gunpowder or rotten eggs and is so hot that one can scarce bear the hand in it on account of the great heat thick vapors rise from it in summerevenings many rich people come here and bathe in it and are very often radically cured the tunguse adore this spring drink the water with a sacred awe and dare not bathe in it with any part of their clothes on there are other hot baths in this district equally salubrious  not far from altanskoikaraul is one of the highest mountains of dauria called by the russians tschokonda and by the tunguse sochondo mr sokolof traveled on it from the  d of july to the  d of august it is very steep wooded with cedars and larchforests and the underwood consists of birchbushes near the source of aguzakan on this mountain is a very steep cupola or tower where the huge bearded vultures annually build their nests close by is a level ground encompassed by the forest from whence one may overlook every thing below and beyond it we view with awful amazement the steep rocky clifts whose snowclad blue summits are veiled by the clouds it rains here almost every day and the air is in continual motion in the middle the north wind causes snow and white frosts the trees at the same time clothed in their best green the snowcovered clifts occupy a great space below and between which are the sources of brooks that flow down into the rivers beneath there are also two principal clifts running from southwest to northeast with a dreadful deep valley between them in which the river aguza has its origin the nature of these two clifts or summits is extraordinary they consist of enormous bare strata of mouldering granite towering up one over another into the skies mr sokolof was the whole day ascending that at southwest it rises like the other parts of this mountain with huge steep rockshelves of which he counted six resembling broad stairs over each shelf the rocks form a flat space of ground near half a mile broad on which various springs rise and tumble down the cliffs with a frightful roar the utmost summit of the clift which cannot be ascended without danger is very horizontal and flat upon it are two frightful abysses encompassed by steeprock walls at the bottom of each is a little lake formed by the snowwater from the rocks gathering and flowing into them through clefts and thus into the middle of the valley in which the aguza springs the superstitious tunguse worship this mountain as the shrine of the offended gods and for this reason they do not attempt to climb it supposing the ascent impossible of course they stood amazed at mr sokolofs journey on it and his safe return  as no remarkable part of the southern district of siberia was now left unexplored and it would have been useless to have traveled over the district of the lena and the eastern parts of siberia messrs gmelin and steller having gone before me and as it was impracticable to penetrate into mongalia or china i resolved to return this winter in sledges at half the expense i came here and if possible to go as far as to the kama i had now fulfilled my commission and traveled over all the ground pointed out to me by the academy of sciences and having dispatched messrs sokolof and bykof in december to the wolga there to wait to collect the vernal plants on the opening of spring my own departure from krasnojarskaja was fixed for the beginning of january my plan being to wait at tura for the arrival of mr georgi but receiving from this gentleman a proposal to wait for him at krasnojarsk he being detained longer in his tour than he expected i consented to it mr georgi having sailed round that immense lake called the baikal as far as to the mouth of the selenga which he reached in autumn he went out here partly on account of the stormy weather and partly to see the daurian mine at a good season of the year and sent his vessel back to the mouth of the angara mr georgi and his attendant arrived in krasnojarskaja the   d of january and having settled with him our plan of future proceedings i left that place the same night and made the best of my way in sledges to tomskoi a distance of near  00 miles traveling night and day for that purpose and arrived there on the   th  the colonies about tomskoi are in the most wretched state as to people there is every where a want of women so that the young men abandon themselves to all sorts of vice the better class of people who have the first choice are most unreasonable among the number of new colonists i saw many sick and infirm people several madmen and married persons without children and a great many old people of course this must be very unfavourable to population but what is still worse they have taken many fathers from their wives and children and sent them heartbroken broken into these places of wretchedness and those who can forget their families have been constrained to take other wives in order to solace their hours in their employment here many of them told me their stories bathed in a flood of tears and their hearts bleeding at the recollection of having left their children behind under the most intolerable yoke of tyrannic despotism  i remained in tomskoi till the   th that i might not follow my baggage too closely when i set off in the evening for tara or tura a further distance of   0 miles  the tartars on the barabynian step where on occount of the number of lakes there are vast quantities of waterfowls etc are much employed in catching plovers colymbi the silverlike glittering breastskins of which they sell to passengers at from three to five copecs apiece and also in collecting the beautiful violetbluish throats of seaplovers colymbi arctici and the glossy green heads of the wild marchganders which when sewed together have a beautiful appearance and make very splendid muffs for the ladies  in this country particularly about the fortress kainskoi where the brook kainska flows into the river om are numerous colonies settled on account of the great fertility of the soil which yield plenty of corn and flax  i reached tara during the nights of the  d and  th of february and mr georgi a few days after me he brought with him a rare collection of plants minerals and other curiosities which were to be sent on to petersburgh on sledges and we chose this city for business as we could be here well accommodated and i continued here till the   d  tura the city of tura or tara lies on the elevated left border of the irtisch and is two or three miles in extent along the bank of the river this place is to be built by degrees with geometrical exactness and has already above  00 new houses which give it a gay appearance they are increasing these buildings every year the number of houses in all amounts to     and the male inhabitants are      of which     are of bucharian extraction and one descended from the siberian khan kutschum the place has five churches and a cathedral now building with stone this last with a court of waywodes some imperial storehouses the treasury of the fur tributeoffice and the gunpowdermagazine are encompassed with a wooden wall otherwise there are no partitions except the vestiges of some old palisadoes and bastions  tara has a governor a small garrison and a court of waywodes subordinate to tobolskoi to which also belongs the towns omskaja tschernoluzkaja tatmyzkaja tjukalinskaja bergamatskaja ajefskaja usttartaskoipass  0  russian and     tartarian villages the number of tributary tartars in this district including a few cossacks is      among which there are      barabynian tartars and     citizens of bucharian origin  as the district of tara has very extensive wildernesses and in its northern parts some dark valleys it abounds with game the sables here are not even so valuable as those of tomskoi and of course are very bad the other animals are bears wolves foxes martens ermines squirrels beavers otters lynxes and hyenas in the northern woods they catch reindeer and in the barabynian step elks deer and wild boars  this district is also rich in fish and the irtisch abounds with sturgeon husos nelma taimeni and lenki and the lakes of the barabynian and ischimian steps are crowded with pike barbel and whitings plentifully caught during the whole winter notwithstanding the land lies low it contains some remarkable mineral earths  our business being completed on the   d of february mr georgi left me according to a plan agreed on and took his road to tobolskoi he traveled in sledges as far as the iset and in spring went up the mountainous side of that river as far as catharineburgh then down the tschussowaja to its mouth in order to take a view of the habitations betwixt the sylva and kama and then along the ufa and djama to the jaik and so by a new road through the jaikian step to the wolga i went the straightest road through the ischimian step the province of isetskaja and the northern part of the country of the baskirians intending to go the next spring from the kama toward the jaik and through the southernmost part of the deserts situated between that river and the wolga in order to collect such vernal plants as i missed the time before  having traveled the chief part of this road in    0 and      and given my readers every thing worth notice it would be idle to repeat it after traveling over   00 miles of ground we reached sarapul on the   th of march and having in this journey met with the wotiaks and tscheremisses i will here give some account of them  among all the little nations of finnish origin for such are the tscheremisses wotiaks eastjaiks and mordvines the wotiaks are the least dispersed in the russian empire and still inhabit their ancient abodes according to their own account their princes had formerly in the place where askoi prisgorod now stands a fortified residence but the tartars obliged them to quit the same and take refuge in the thick forests toward the wjatka and upper kama which has its name from them kam in wotiak meaning a large river  the wotiaks or oudmurt as they call themselves which signifies man have some characteristic marks which distinguish them from their neighbors the tscheremisses they are more lively more gay and less obstinate both men and women are addicted to tippling which must be attributed to the liberty they formerly had of distilling spirits without any impost being very little mixed with russians or other strangers there are not many tall and wellformed people among them the women in particular are little and of mean appearance no nation is so redhaired as this yet there are some few with black hair and some men have lightcoloured hair on their heads and reddish beards they are not so cleanly as the tartars yet more so than the mordvines and finlanders and in their houses and clothes are similar to the tscheremisses as their vessels and victuals are most disgustfully nasty so is their strong liquor disagreeable to the taste though in the distilleries they spare neither malt nor honey  the headdress of their women is the most peculiar and enormous of all the nations subject to russia they bend a piece of birchbark about six inches broad into the form of half a cylinder so as to fit the wotiaks top of the head it is kept in this form by a bow of wood in the inside and in the opening behind a narrow piece of birchbark is placed on the top of this cylinder they fasten another piece of birchbark bent into a square six inches broad inclining a little forwards like our grenadiers cap the upper part is covered with red and the lower with blue cloth which is usually ornamented with copecs and little tin plates what gives the best appearance to this scaffold is a cloth an ell long sewed on the edge with red blue and brown needle work and has round about it blue red and white fringes three or four inches long this cloth is fastened on the upper border of the birchbark so that the ends hang down on each side having the ornaments visible between them and the rest of the cloth hangs down behind on the back underneath this headdress the women wear their hair twisted on both sides over the ears so as to resemble a thick knot ornamented with beads and jingling toys no married woman will appear before a stranger without such a bonnet and should any one enter a wotiak house at night they will even go to bed in this headdress which they wear also in doing the business of the house widows and very old women free themselves from this encumbrance and wind a cloth like a handkerchief round the head letting the ends which are embroidered with needle work hang down behind  their clothes are also singular their uppergarment is long made of cloth or linenstuff with long sleeves and open like those of the polanders through which they put their arm fastening the narrow end to their girdle behind about the neck is a square falldown cape like a collar they wear shifts embroidered with needle work about the neck and wrists and breeches quite tight to the limbs  girls like the tartars wear round bonnets ornamented with beads and coins with this difference that they hang an embroidered cloth floating down behind with a kind of beadnecklace hanging loosely from one ear to the other across the neck before braiding their hair behind and concealing it beneath these cloths from the girdle hang strings and fringes  the architecture of the wotiaks is but little different from that of the people of tschuwa their houses are scattered without pales or enclosures and contain large sleeping benches and tartar furniture they are good husbandmen keep bees in hollowed trees hunt all the winter and are able shooters  i can say but little of their religion but what has been said in the collections of russian history there are but two heathen villages remaining among them and though the christian wotiaks in the regency of casan chiefly profess paganism clandestinely yet they are afraid to be noticed in so doing by the russian clergy that reside among them i gathered however the following account of these pagans who inhabit the regency of orenburg besides the great god called by them inmar they worship the god of earth and prosperity mu kalzin the god of water wuinmar also the sun as the throne of the supreme deity and other subordinate divinities they call upon these in the hour of necessity especially on their annual festivals and at their solemn sacrifices where an old sacerdotal man called tona says prayers  their keremets or places of sacrifice are in pinewoods especially on a well situated and elevated spot kuss surrounded with white firs and enclosed they celebrate four general feasts in the year the first butschunnunal is in the russian easterweek at which time begins their new year with feastings the second or tulysnunal falls after summer seedtime at which they offer prayers and victims to the god of the earth wissaskonunal is a day of supplication for a good harvest celebrated in one or more houses of a village and in which they sacrifice sparrows kutscho caught in snares and fed for that purpose these they burn in a fire to obtain good weather and easy work keremetnunal is their greatest festival this is celebrated after harvest by the whole village in its keremet with solemn sacrifices on this occasion they consume a horse of any color except black a bullock a sheep a goose and a duck the horse is the last slaughtered animal and this by an assistant of the tona and all are dressed for a sacrificial meal the fat and blood are burnt but the head of the bullock and sheep with the whole skeleton of the horse are suspended on a fir tree in the keremet the skins are taken home and sold the prayers repeated during these sacrifices are directed toward the meridian sun never toward the east  took tells us from this collection of russian histories that the dress of the wotiak men is like that of the russian boors only that it is commonly made of coarse white cloth that their wintercaps are of cloth with a border of a different color that they tie a knife to their girdle and a case for a hatchet  he says they are honest peaceable hospitable and sober but superstitious of cold complexion and extremely simple the women have winking eyes and smile even to ugliness they are short timid very modest chaste laborious and complaisant  these people speak a language of their own derived from the finnish language but have no writings or letters in reckoning they make use of little sticks which they call pos a kind of tally which they notch instead of a signature they use certain marks called handmarks they do not reckon their time by years but give different names to the months in conformity to natural events thus the month of march is named silpron talis i e the month of the breakingup of the ice the like of the rest friday is their sabbath or day of rest with them as with other nations of asiatic russia wednesday is called the day of blood on which day they never undertake any thing of importance  the wotiaks or votiaks as took calls them never compose large towns but live in villages and are always ready to transport their habitations from one place to another as appears eligible the interior disposition of these villages the houses the economy of the people their food taxes and general constitution are like the tscheremisses which will be treated of to the chief of villages they give the name of ellir and to their starosts or elders that of kartlik they are a very retired reserved people and suffer no strangers to come among them and it is very seldom that any litigation is brought before the tribunal of the province  they are assiduous in rural economy and at their leisure hours employ themselves in turning cups spoons shuttles etc and varnishing all kinds of bowls and cups the women employ themselves in sewing making linen coarse cloths and felts making clothes and embroidery there are not many rich among them neither are they poor he who possesses from    to    desettines of land which is a piece of ground   0 feet long and   0 broad with  0 horses and other cattle in proportion passes for a rich man of the first class  their manner of salutation is to give hands and say diesban that is health or prosperity the women instead of embracing strike one another with both hands on the shoulders abusive terms among them are schou ourdam thou walking carcass vistan schaitan thou stupid devil schaitan med bastos the devil take thee  every village has a number of baths here the women lyein on the birth of a child the father sacrifices a white ram to the genius or tutelary angel of the newborn infant at which time they feast and make merry the names of men peculiar to this people are ischmak danabai kamai eltemir etc that of women dalisch bidelet beke akston tschanga which last signifies a crow  wives are purchased some pagan wotiaks buy as many as they can but they seldom have more than one or two the marriagecontract is called yeraschou the price paid yerdoun and which is generally from two to fifteen rubles and the dowry of the bride is always in proportion to the marriageprice they never marry their sons under ten years of age nor their daughters till they are    and it is always interest that determines the choice  on bringing the yerdoun to the fatherinlaw the young man takes back his bride who is delivered to him veiled on his return home he finds guests assembled at his fathers house to whom the bride is presented after being previously taken aside into another room and clothed in the dress of a married woman who whilst the torkai or priest makes the oblation of a cup of beer to the gods sits in the doorway on a piece of cloth laid there for that purpose the object of the offering is to procure bread riches and children to the newmarried couple who drink of the beer blessed by the priest which act may be called the sacerdotal benediction of the nuptials this done one of the bridemaids presents beer or mead to all the guests and the bride kneels down before every one of them till he has drank off the goblet they then eat and drink as much as they can and dance till the young people are put to bed  some weeks after the brides father pays her a visit examines into the housekeeping and pays her husband the remainder of her fortune or in lieu of it gives some pieces of housholdfurniture and takes back his daughter with him whom he keeps from her husband two or three months and sometimes even a whole year during this time of absence she dresses like a virgin and is employed at work for her parents and herself occasionally at the expiration of the determined time the husband comes to demand his wife who shows as much repugnance at following him as she did on the day of her marriage cries as much at leaving home and goes to bed to her husband with the same reluctance she soon however suffers herself to be persuaded and easily admits of consolation the friends of the family are again regaled and make even greater merriment than they did on the wedding day a widows wedding is conducted with much less ceremony they dance to the found of the pipe called bys of the russian balaleika a kind of guitar with only two strings and of another instrument which they call oumkress  before they bury their dead they wash the body and cloth it in complete apparel and as they always carry a knife fastened to their girdles so they give one to the deceased taking care however to break off the point they lay a cake upon his breast and fix a lighted torch by his side at the interment they throw some copecs into the grave and pronounce these words yougt inti sot soui o earth make thou room for him the body is laid in a kind of coffin with some skillets and hatchets lasts for making matshoes on and other useful implements as soon as they have filled up the grave they stick some lighted torches on it then throwing three eggs boiled hard and cut into small pieces on it they say tiogafet medou sos there keep that for thyself on coming from the burial the friends walk over a fire made before the house of the deceased rub their hands in ashes bathe and change their clothes and then make merry these ceremonies are always the same to people of every condition age or sex  on the second day after the interment they celebrate the first commemorative festival called pemiouka at this feast instituted in honor of the dead his friends assemble in his house and partake of cakes and beer a portion of which they carry out into the yard and repeat as before tiogafet medou sos the words are addressed to the deceased but the dogs take care of the provision on the seventh day they sacrifice a sheep on the fortieth a horned beast or a horse all the victims are eaten in memory of their departed friend to whom they send his share on the thursday in passionweek they celebrate a general commemorative festival at which they assemble every one at the tomb of his relation light up torches eat cakes and the flesh of some victim leaving a portion on the grave of his family  it will readily be conceived that amongst such a people there is as much superstition to be met with as among european nations some of the nations of the wotiaks think that wednesday and friday are unlucky days that the flight of a blackbird or a crow across their path a cuckoo perched on the top of a house and the meeting of a hedgehog in motion are so many presages of death or at least of dangerous sickness he who dares to kill a swallow a lapwing a pigeon or a waterwagtail exposes his flock to all sorts of misfortunes they even build nests for the swallows they suppose that a bear that has been wounded in the chase knows his enemy and seeks and pursues him all his life they take great care not to call a bear by his name but maka that is old man if a tree is struck by lightning it was to destroy a devil which had there taken its abode noon is a dangerous time with them from the first appearance of roses to the end of august at every eclipse of the sun or moon they fancy it a metamorphose to which these bodies are subject among the christian wotiaks they attribute the cause of bad harvests to their making no offering to the gods whoever would be sure of crossing the water in safety must first throw a handful of grass into it and say ero koul monae do not hold me they have an astonishing number of similar superstitious opinions too tedious to relate they have also among them vedirs or magicians who they conceive hold correspondence with evil spirits and have even the power of metamorphosing men into animals they call him oubir who has been thus metamorphosed and imagine that after he has undergone this ideal change he must for ever be a vagabond and a wanderer  among the malevolent deities schaitan or satan is the chief he lives in the water and is hence called voumourt or wateryman they have a god named palasmourt or alida the former signifies halfman the latter expresses the idea of a satyr or demon of the forests this god dwells in the woods has but one leg and one eye which is very large and a monstrous nipple to his breast with which he stifles men by thrusting it into their mouths the albaste of the wotiaks is much the same as our ignis fatuus or jackalanthern he plays his tricks holds his wanton revels in deserted houses in bathingrooms and uninhabited villages on which account they burn all the houses and villages they abandon that they may not become a retreat for these wicked phantoms  they imagine a twofold existence after death the first is dounja yougguit a resplendent life the inheritance of the good wherein they enjoy every kind of happiness a wotiak is capable of conceiving in this world the other kouratzin inli or the abode of bitterness containing a vast number of cauldrons of pitch in which the wicked are for ever boiling  whenever any epidemic sickness rages among them they sacrifice a black sheep to inmar that he may prevent the devil from doing them harm the ceremonies of this sacrifice are performed on the bank of some river and whilst the flesh of the victim is making ready every father of a family goes with a stick into all the rooms of his house and beating about him at every stroke cries get out of my house this done they fire off a fowlingpiece or shoot an arrow at a dog or cat of the village which when killed they drag with a cord to the place of sacrifice always going down the stream to it then leaving the animal with the cord fastened to it every one throws his stick into the river and proceeds to the sacrifice to which they give the name of orvas  in general the wotiaks are very zealous in their religious observances are very desirous to obtain the approbation of the gods and use every means to deserve it in a word they are devout and very pious idolaters but notwithstanding this in      there were reckoned       males and       females who had been baptized in the kingdom of casan alone  my account of the tscheremisses who chiefly inhabit the districts about the wjatka and the kama will be much shorter as i could not meet with an opportunity of being better informed they are of a middling size with light fair or red hair especially their beards which are thin their faces are fair with strong features they are weak slothful timid very roguish and more obstinate than any people i ever saw some of their women have fine faces but far inferior to the tartars and their common dress is very unfavourable to beauty their hair they twist into two tails one on the crown of their head the other on the back part the rest of the hair is formed into knots and after all the head is covered with a small cap embroidered with various colored needle work this is the headdress of the married women and when they go abroad they tie a cloth worked in the same manner over the head and under the chin girls who generally go bareheaded braid their hair behind in two floating tails and when they go out tie the same kind of embroidered handkerchief or cloth about their heads but married women are ashamed particularly before their fatherinlaw to go bareheaded all the women wear breeches and shifts of coarse linen and a long outer garment of cloth or linen with close sleeves and a falldown cape like that of the wotiaks the lower seam of the garment is embroidered with various colored thread and ornamented with colored crosses the shift on the bosom is embroidered in the same way and kept together with two or three large brass buckles they often wear armlets or rings on their arms and wrap up their legs to an enormous thickness like the mordvine women  their houses are richer than those of the mordvines wotiaks or finlanders they are scattered about but without enclosures and generally consist of a winter and summer apartment with a portico and stairs their inward construction is wholly tartarian  they are industrious husbandmen rich in corn and in no want of horses or horned cattle they keep also a quantity of bees the tscheremissian heathens of which there are many celebrate some of the russian festivals such as the week after christmas and the carnival but only by banqueting and drinking they have also a strong belief in some russian saint and in the mahomet of the tartars whom they call piambar prophet their own great solemnities are thrice a year the feast of spring similar to the saban a fieldfeast of the tartars is celebrated a little before midsummer every one then cleans himself in a bath puts on clean undergarments and assembles for the general sacrifice when a redbrown horse and a white cow are solemnly slaughtered in the keremet the fat blood and bones of which are burnt and their skins suspended on poles during the general supplication their second festival like that of the wotiaks is called uginda and celebrated before hayharvest its principal object is agebaren the god of plenty and to supplicate his blessing on the harvest the third is the feast of general thanks after harvest they begin their new year with the carnival week in march and this is the commencement of spring  the tscheremisses says took call themselves may men and are settled in the government of casan and nineinovorogod on both shores of the wolga but chiefly along the left side of that great river quite into permia they are of finnish origin and speak a language peculiar to themselves but have no books or writings during the sovreignty of the tartars they were like the wotiaks subject to that people  though i spell the word tartars according to the old pronunciation yet the original word is tatars and the french and german writers have within these few years adopted this orthography but as it will require a better authority than mine to change the spelling i have continued it according to the old method as i have in calling the city moscow which should be pronounced moskva  the tscheremisses though formerly they had princes of their own now have neither princes nor nobles and though in early times they led pastoral lives being confined to a small district they are obliged now to turn their thoughts to agriculture  their farms consist of a hut of only one room for the family a few stables and outhouses in the yard detached from each other and several little magazines built each on a perpendicular bank which serve them also for chambers in the summerseason all these buildings are of wood forming a square the area of which between the different huts is all open their rooms for winter are built at the height of about   or   feet over a cellar to which you ascend by a few clumsy steps under a covering of planks each room contains besides an oven a hearth for culinary purposes and a broad bench for the family to sleep on sometimes the kitchen is in the dwelling house and often is called the blackroom and black enough in truth it is from the smoke which has no chimney or vent the doors of their rooms are very low and instead of a window a hole is made about a foot and a half square covered with a bladder or linen as a substitute for glass their furniture is like that of the russian villagers the woman are employed as are the wotiaks and indeed the two nations resemble each other in their persons manners and way of living  the dress of the men is nearly like that of the russians excepting that they comb their hair straight down from the crown and then cut it all round nearly close to the head the collar waistbands and bosoms of their shirts are embroidered with colored worsted their coat is made of a coarse russian cloth composed of blackwool and the cape like that of an english surtout and an opening in the skirts on each side such also is the dress of the wotiak men  the dress of the married women is the same with that of the unmarried only better worked they wear trowsers and instead of stockings wrap their legs in linen rags and often when they ride with haybands fastening them on with a rush or a piece of packthread wound several times round the calf their shoes are made of the bark of trees cut into slips and matted in summer they wear only a shift which is not tucked into the trowsers but hangs loose all round them it is also at the neck and wrists cut into a shape and comes down to the knees the neck wristbands and seams all covered with a whimsical embroidery of differentcoloured worsted a large buckle holds it together on the bosom and a girdle round the waist when they would be more dressed they put over this shift a habit like a morning gown made of various colored cloths and tolerably fine and edge it with brown fur their caps are in the shape of a cone made of birchbark covered with linen or stuff and ornamented with glassbeads little white shells and flowers from this cap a ribband three inches broad ornamented as the cap falls down the back some wear a broad ribband on the forehead covered with pieces of money and beads instead of the conical cap others wear a number of rings thimbles and all sorts of jingling pendants at their girdles which ornaments reach down to the joint of the knee behind and as they walk thus curiously adorned these trappings are offensive to the ear  the women like the russian countrywomen generaly choose to liein in the bathrooms the first man that visits her after her delivery names the child if it is a boy and the first woman if a girl the children call such persons afterward atai namefather and abai namemother common names of males are sengoul kispelat erbaldi ilmet etc of females pidelet astan nasouke etc husband and wife they call mari and vata  the wife is here purchased as in other tartar nations and the usual price paid is from  0 to  0 rubles some are worth  0 and there are girls that will fetch a  00 as wives are destined to submission and labor it often happens that a rich father buys wives for his sons when they are no more than six years old yet the wives are never younger than fifteen the wifes portion consists of cattle so that a boy tscheremissian fetching his bride married thus early finds themself at the age of maturity often in possession of a numerous flock degrees of kindred are observed among them in their matrimonial contracts and though if one sister dies they make no scruple of marrying the other yet one man never marries two sisters at the same time a boys namefather commonly asks a daughter in marriage for his nameson and when he has concluded the bargain the young people are permitted to visit one another and then perform the ceremony of changing rings which is called schergas vaslaltas  on the day of marriage the bridegroom accompanied by his friends goes to the brides house and as they have musicians playing before them numbers of people join the procession as it passes through the villages the bridegroom then pays the rest of the purchase money distributes presents and after this the whole company sits down to eat and makemerry the next day the bride being covered with a veil he takes her home notwithstanding all the tears she sheds and all the resistance she makes  in the house where the nuptial ceremonies are performed a kart or priest rehearses a prayer before the idol of the house placed on a table the prayer ended a feast and diversion succeeds with songs and dances and the sound of the gousli the schibber and the kobasch during these different amusements they take the bride apart and transform her into a woman that is to say they dress her as a married woman the husband then conducts her into the eatingroom when the kart repeats another prayer the bride kneeling before him after this ceremony she distributes presents often beer or mead to every guest and then returns into her hut in the evening the bride undresses herself but it is not without a deal of resistance that she suffers the bridewomen to put her to bed on the entrance of the bridegroom the door is barricaded and the next morning he that represented the father of the bride enters the nuptial chambers with a whip in his hand if after proper enquiries there appear no token of virginity he shows the bride the whip in a threatening manner and in a day or two after makes her feel the lash of it in this manner according to the degree of crimination they punish the levities and misconduct of their wives and their negligence in the duties of marriage the morrow of the wedding day is spent also in jollity and every one on returning throws into the last cup he takes some copecs as a present to the newmarried folks among the christian tscheremisses almost all the weddings are preceded by this pagan marriage and often a long time prior to their solemnization by the christian priest nor is it uncommon for a tscheremissianrake to take the liberty of dispensing with this ceremony he lays hold of the girl takes her home and as soon as she is with child gives her father as much for her as he thinks proper  interring the dead they dress the deceased in his best clothes and put him into a schupar or coffin the burial is performed on the day of the persons death and the procession consists of persons of both sexes the grave is dug east and west and the head of the corpse is laid to the west as they believe with the generality of the pagans that the existence after death is but a prolongation of their actual life a few particulars excepted the friends of the deceased put a number of copecs into his girdle and furnish him with certain other things that have been neccessary to him in life such as a last for making shoes upon a stick to drive the dogs from him and a little bunch of rosetree twigs for repelling evil spirits as soon as the grave is filled up every one of the company places a little torch on the grave of each of his departed friends throughout the sulugartla or cemetery repeating several times live in harmony and friendship he then takes a cake and having eaten part of it near each of the lighted torches lays three pieces of it on every grave and says this is for thee the ceremony closes with placing over the grave a sheet of linen fastened to a pale like a flag on their return home they bathe and change their clothes throwing away the old clothes of the deceased and hanging out the serviceable ones to be purified in the air like the wotiaks they honor the dead with commemorationfestivals and the whole village every year celebrates a general one  their religion is idolatry and in the performance of it they implicitly follow the precepts of their priests who are also magicians the interpreters of dreams and the foretellers of fortune every community replaces the kart or priest by its own election and they take care to bestow the charge on a man reputed for discretion and respectable for his age and irreproachable manners to every priest is given an oudschou or subpresbyter as an assistant  youma in their language is the general name for god and that the almighty may be completely happy they give him a wife called youmonava mother of the gods they have inferior divinities and conceive them to be the offspring of the two supreme deities and that the government of the world is their proper inheritance as the sons of god some of whom are married and others live in celibacy the men address the gods and the women the goddesses with them the devil whom they call schaitan is the parent and origin of the malevolent god he has his dwelling in the water and disseminates calamities misfortunes and disasters but the object of their greatest fear is koudortscha the god of thunder to whose power they ascribe the fertility of the earth and plenteous harvest they represent him under the figure of a puppet clothed in tscheremissian garments put him into a box made of the bark of birch and place it a corner of the house they like the wotiaks keep festival days on which they sacrifice animals and with similar ceremonies  in the government of casan the number of baptized tscheremisses is calculated from      to      to be    0 males and      females but the greater part of these new converts celebrate secretly the pagan festivals or at least assist at the ceremonies of their heathen brethren as much as they can without being discovered by the clergy and punished for their obstinacy  soon after my arrival in sarapul it began to thaw and as i had planned my summers tour to be by water on the kama and wolga and this place was unfavourable for the preparations necessary i set out the   th of march for casan a distance of  00 miles and proceeded from thence on my return to sarapul on the  th of april as this is not a journey of observation that having been done by professor falk who spent his winter here i forbear saying any thing on the subject  sarapul sarapul which was my residence in spring is so populous a village as to surpass many market towns it lies along the high border of the kama chiefly at the bottom of a height in which there is still a decayed wooden fortress which is said to have been erected during the baskirian troubles a parish church a house for the bailiff a courthouse and a comptoir two wooden churches and     dwelling houses built in very narrow winding streets which are amazingly dirty in spring and autumn through this place flows a brook into the kama  the villages under the jurisdiction of sarapul are mostly inhabited by husbandmen and contain    0 tributary heads the kama supplies the inhabitants with plenty of fine fish particularly the white salmon eriox and the inhabitants call it krasnaja kyba which is usually caught from one and a half archines to two archines long an archine or russian ell is of an english yard the only remarkable small fishes in this river are fishes of passage which come annually up from the wolga among which is the goldfish clupea alosa and the tschechon cyprinus cultratus  between  0 and  0 miles above sarapul are two large ironmanufactories belonging to the crown in which more than  000 casanian peasants and  00 forgemen are employed and where they forge annually from   0 to   0000 puds of bariron which is conveyed down the kama in barges and from thence on the wolga to astrachan and so to petersburgh both these manufactories are so situated as to have inexhaustible woods for fire and great plenty of water i speak here from actual knowledge having visited their works myself  on the   st of april i left sarapul the peasants about the river kama begin now to increase among themselves the linseed or hemp seed of wallachia the first seeds of which were brought there by the colonists from poland it is now planted with success in the southern parts of the district of selenginskaja on the kama it grows three feet and a half high and yields a far finer yarn then that of the common flax  after traveling   0 miles i reached the river samara at sorotschinskaja on the  th of may      the bridge here being not in a proper state to pass over i sent an express to busuluzkaja in order to get proper assistance in this place according to the order i had received for this purpose from the governor of orenburgh i therefore pitched my tent in the plain and dispatched some of my people and they not only brought with them on the  th at night the assistance i wanted but a live wild colt which had been caught about eight days before near tozkajakrepost  the tarpans or wildhorses have increased much within these few years in the steps of this district for as the wild country between the jaik and the wolga has been uninhabited for a considerable time these animals used commonly in summer to advance as much toward the north as they could in order to shelter themselves from the troublesome insects scorching heat and avidity of pasture i am still more and more of opinion that the wild horses found roving in the steps of the jaik don and baraba are chiefly the produce of some bewildred kirguese and kalmuck horses or of the stallions of the nomades belonging to this district with either single mares or whole herds which they carried off hence the variety of color and breed in these horses though the chief are yellow brown or yellowish the colt brought to me was one of this color and was taken from its dam a few hours after it was dropped if compared with a tame colt of the same age it bore the following distinctive marks it was taller stronger limbed a larger head with more hair about the mouth the ears considerably longer and the points bent more forwards he carried his ears generally backward like a biting horse and the forehead was much vaulted the mane appeared to be thicker and extended further on the withers the tail was blackish and not much different the back was less rose a little curved the hoof smaller and more pointed and the fetlocks curled the color was a fallowfawn with a stripe down the back a blackish mane and asscoloured about the mouth it looked like a marecolt or filley and the mother according to the accounts i received from the persons who caught it was in company with seven other mares that composed the suite of a wild stallion of the same color see the representation in the plate with sajan tartar digging bess  as far as i could learn that wild species of horse or ass called by the kirguese and kalmucks kulan or chulan and which was never yet tamed is not only different from these horses naturally wild and called by the kalmucks takja but also from the dshiggetei of the mongols most people described them to me as bluish or asscoloured with a common asscross on the shoulders others report that they are of a yellowbrown color with a black stripe down the back and a double cross stripe over the shoulders with shorter ears than those of asses and a cowtail like the dshiggetei the last description i received from an old cossack who had escaped from kirguese captivity is that the chulan is a medium between the dshiggetei and the ass according to the first account they should be the onagri of the ancients and all agree that the chulan is so wild as not to be tamed and swifter than the fleetest horse these animals go in large troops especially in spring when they wander northwards from the ural to the mountains tumada and when they return in autumn to the warm districts of persia and india  on the   th of may i arrived at jaizkoi gorodok and found the condition of the jaikian cossacks much changed since i was there and by their own fault the former liberty and constitution of their court of waiwodes was no more but lieutenant colonel simanof governor of jaizkoi commanded them and had two of the first starchins or elders whom the fury of the people had spared in the troubles of      for his assessors four battalions of light troops and a certain number of irregular regiments were quartered in forts before the city and within also to keep the peace many cossacks even of the rank of starchin to avoid punishment were obliged to leave their effects and fly and some few who escaped from prison were roving in the street and living upon a miserable subsistence which they obtain by hunting or privily from their friends though matters were not yet settled they were under proper regulations respecting the fisheries and one battalion was quartered on the kirguisian side to prevent any hostile surprise and another as usual attended the fisheries commanded by an officer they called jertaul  the horses and guides being ready for my departure on the   th i set off at noon with an escort of twelve cossacks for sundaef in order to meet mr surjef whom i had sent before to gather the vernal plants on the mountains of indeskoi and arrived there the   st on the   th we left sundaef and took our farewell of the jaik for good directing our journey southeastwards through the desert step and the next day in these wilds i met with an interpreter in his wayfrom astrachan sent with dispatches to orenburgh this was the same person i had met at stauropal in      he was overjoyed to see me and we spent the night with his escort consisting of four kalmucks on the same spot  on the steps of the river kuschum the saigaks or stepgoats were seen sometimes singly and sometimes in large flocks the cossacks in summer when they have nothing else to do go out in small parties to hunt these animals and being unable to consume the flesh or carry it home skin the best of them and carry off such skins and their horns they had also many horns of those that have been killed by wolves or other accidents which they sell to the chinese merchants on the jaik a couple of saigak horns are sold from ten to fifteen copecs but on the chinese frontiers for four times the price the cossacks of the jaik who kill annually a great number of these animals assure me that there some with three horns and two or the cossacks in my escort declared they once killed two that had but one horn each  every where on this step where the titmouse makes a hole is a quantity of muscle and other seashells calcined by the weather by lying on the surface of the ground but underneath the soil in dry loamy ground they are found entire having been so preserved a great number of years since the time that the caspian sea covered this district the whole step along the kuschum is arid and dreary and the soil salt of course unfit for any kind of husbandry or even for rearing of cattle the lowest spots are scarce green in spring and there is not a tree to be seen on this step we took up our nights lodging  whilst we were stopping on the  0th of may on one of the steps to feed our horses some one of our company had kindled a fire and the wind being high blew it among the high grass and set fire to it it burst out with great rage and the flame ran like wildfire so as to set the whole spot in a blaze and we had scarce time to save our wagons and avoid the fire by running from it this day we met some armed people on horseback who were undoubtedly vagabond cossacks from the jaikian district of umno we were obliged to lie all the next night under arms no interruption however ensued and the next day we traveled on reached some quicksand hills and met with between them the first waterpit we had seen and indeed the first water for many days yet notwithstanding we had water with us and a great number of young toads were swimming in these pits we were induced to make our tea with it and found it excellent this same evening we were saluted near the waterpits by that scarce black steplark alauda tartarica which i have spoken of before they flew here either singly or in couples and may be compared in flight and song to the alauda calandra here also in this sandy desert was plenty of those venomous serpents i have mentioned phalangium araneoides and a large species of beetle carabus bucida if it be true as the kalmucks say that the bite of these beetles of prey is sometimes mortal to cattle they may be said to be the buprestis of the ancients this sanddesart which we had just got upon is called by the kalmucks naryn the small sand it begins at    degrees n latitude between the great usen and the saltlake altannnor joins a tract of hills and continues uninterrupted in the middle district between the wolga and the jaik as far as the northern coast of the caspian sea there it forms a cape this sandy desert in general consists of large green sandlayers which rise flat above the salt loams and scattered with high quicksand hills like little mountains  though this sand seems very unfavourable to the growth of vegetables yet the plains are full of green juicy and fine plants the cause of which is the wonderful nature of this district being so full of saltsprings by digging the kalmucks have found large waterpits this sandy desert has some rare and curious plants the high quicksand hills are full of elymus arundo et carex arenaria instead of trees nature has provided these sand heaps with bushes among them is the most rare wonderful and leafless long thinlimbed calligonum polygonoides  this rare plant was quite unknown to me till in my journey i met accidentally with tourneforts voyage au levant where it is described part ii p     and tolerably well represented by the name of polygonoides orientale ephedra facie it is to this first original passage i am indebted for my knowledge of this curiosity which i could never have guessed at by the description given with an improper distinctive mark in gener plant of linnaeus who calls this bush of tournefort calligonum polygonoides i therefore described it before by the name of pterecoccus see the plate given anas mersa etc p   vol iii linnaeus ranges it in his   th class the bush properly blooms about the middle of may the fruit is large and beautiful has green yellow or handsome redshaded wings and the same taste as the branches of the plant if chewed something like that of sourish apples for this reason the kalmucks burn the branches when dry and consider the smoke as beneficial to the eyes the representation given by tournefort in his corollarium is quite false  which has no where been discovered except by me here upon some sandmountains on the southern wolga and about the mouth of the river kama and by tournefort at the bottom of mount ararat it had now on all it is branches full grownfruit which gave a beautiful appearance to the bush seemingly created for a sandy soil and whose roots extend often to the depth of many fathoms as abundantly grew here the artemisia santonicum with thick and woody stalks which rise in autumn to the height of several fathoms here grows also the prenanthes chondrilloides changed into a bush  the oldest and best waterpits in the valleys between the hills are sometimes delightfully shaded with fine narrowleaved willows and the wild olive tree elaeagnus or small white poplarbushes whereof the former become often fine and tall trees  the plants that cloth this sandy desert are many but not being entertaining to a general reader i will not enumerate them of animals this district abounds with wolves foxes antelopes and in reedy valleys wild boars little titmice and racehares of birds none except near some springs and saltmarshes but the bergander common small larks large black ones sparrows in great numbers and stephawks falco lanarius which build their nests on low trees in the valleys i met with but few serpents except the lizardserpent in low grassy valleys lacerta apoda and still fewer vipers  we were several days traveling in this desert encamping on it every night one day we met with some pretty partridges with long pointed wings they have uncommonly short feet and fly almost like pigeons as they drink often they are seldom seen far from the waterpits and when these are dried up they retire about the southern wolga their food is the feeds of the astragalus cicer and alopecuroides but in autumn the saltplants they generally fly single and in pairs but in autumn in whole coveys when they soar they squeak but fly without noise their flesh is good but tough they probably came from more southern districts because they had but just began to breed laying large whiteeggs like pullets eggs  on this desert is a mountain of rocksalt discovered by the kalmucks many years since i went to see it it is about six miles in circumference and divided by a saltvalley making various windings befet on each side with stony hills in a salt spot in this valley mr gmelin when he was here dug a trying pit and found the rocksalt pure as crystal and reaching quite to the day or surface of the ground it cannot be ascertained how far the salt penetrates into the mountain but there is no doubt of its advancing a great way  kundarau tartars   our journey on this scorching sandy step took us ten days and having nothing to drink but the water we carried with us which became foul in the vessels and absolutely stunk i scarce know how to express the pleasure we enjoyed at reaching a river on the further side of the step where we hung over the stream men and horses for a considerable time on the road i had the pleasure of being an eye witness of the gipsey or egyptianlike way of living of a tribe of tartars of cuban extraction they have about one thousand tents and have at present obtained permission to travel with their flocks along the river achtuba from tschigit to near the seaside they call themselves kundurau and are like most cuban tartars what the ancient geographers call hamaxobites  campestres  scythae quorum plaustra vagos rite trahunt domos horace we saw three of their wandering tribes their jurts or tents are in form and structure different from those of the kalmucks and other nomades they cannot be taken to pieces being so interwoven with bushes but being of much lighter structure and scarce twelve feet in diameter can be put upon a large cart the round wall of such a tent is a latticework of very slender rods and the roof a flatted vault of bent rods one end of which is fastened to the latticework and the other to a hoop that forms the smokehole resembling our chickenrips the walls of this tent are covered with a reedmat and over the whole a light felt so that this covering needs not to be removed in order to transport these tents they put them on a cart with two high wheels so as that the wheels are within the tent on which they also load their timber furniture women and children and thus wheel off all together rich men have two or more such tents and carts according to the number of their families and they have also another cart covered in which they sleep with their wives if they do not remain for a length of time in one place they do not remove their tents from the cart but fit underneath it and perform their work in the shade of it and to prevent their young cattle from doing the same they hurdle it in but if they wish to make some stay they unload their carts and hang in the smokehole on the windward side a felt embroidered with the needle in colored worsted partly to prevent the smokes beating down into the tent and partly by way of ornament their appearance is wild and many of them are soon smokedried and so much scorched with the sun that they look like indians their women however when young are pretty in horned cattle they are rich they ride them in preference to horses and draw their carts by two or three oxen yoked in shafts one before the other they formerly paid a small annual tribute to the khan of the kalmucks in cattle butter and other provisions but are now free from every tax and yet are continually robbing the russian inhabitants and travelers in manners dress way of living etc they are like the baskirians those who cannot afford to keep cattle maintain themselves by following the trades of shoemaking tanning and other handicrafts whilst some alleviate their poverty by sheepstealing and other kinds of rapine which they exercise to advantage among their neighbors and the nearer hordes  at selitrenoigorodok on the river achtuba are the remains of two magnificent buildings the most splendid of which has been cleared from the rubbish in which it was buried partly for the saltpeter found therein and with which the saltpetreworks adjoining are supplied and partly with the view of finding hidden treasures the extent of this heap of rubbish which marks the extent of the ancient nogayan city which here stood is a mile and an half the other ruin is supposed to have been some mansion from the many little divisions of rooms in it the former from which has been dug out many valuable things and coffins plated with silver seems to have been the mausoleum of some khans and a temple the whole appears to have been erected in form of a long quadrangle from n n e to s s w and is about    fathoms long and on the south front   fathoms broad i remarked a judicious proportion in the divisions and the burialvaults under the northern one but the more southern front whose foundationwalls are still the highest and are now    feet aboveground and have their foundations threequarters of a yard thick was embellished with gothic pillars and arches the remains of which are still to be seen throughout all the remaining buildings reigns a most regular magnificence of which i never saw an instance in any tartarean ruins the outside of the wall is not only ornamented with colors of green yellow white and blue in triangular forms but in the chief points of the building are the remains of gothic carving and mosaic workmanship time however and the covetousness of the people have many years since converted these relics of antiquity into heaps of stone and rubbish formerly they loaded whole vessels with the bricks and tiles of these ruins and conveyed them to astrachan and in so doing for every  00 bricks they took away they reduced at least  000 into useless rubbish it is reported that many coins and valuable jewels have been here found but i doubt whether any of these objects have fallen into the hands of real amateurs or into that treasure of inland antiquities which the academy of sciences at petersburg has established  a quarter of a mile to the north of this place is a large tumulus that has been dug into and to which the kundurau and other tartars when in this neighborhood come and say their prayers on it from an opinion that a saint of their religion mahomedan was here buried the tartars assert that this saint still performs miracles cures the sick and sometimes appears to them in their sleep the effect of a weak imagination among many other people in unenlightened ages  not being more than about    miles from astrachan i resolved to visit that place accordingly paid off my escort and set off on the  0th of june with posthorses the road to that place is bad and difficult owing to the number of quicksandhills we are obliged to pass the next station eight miles is krugloigorodok or dshamjanowa so called from the kalmuck prince dshamjanowa who lately died here in a fine woodbuilt palace with a chapel and adjoining stables erected for him at the expense of the empress and whose widow and successors still reside in it attended with a lifeguard of cossacks this whole district is rich in saltpeter but i shall not say more on that subject it having been long since described by preceding travelers  i remained in astrachan till the  0th of june and took leave of professor gmelin who was preparing to take his second tour into persia which ended so fatally to him he was seized by a tartar prince and confined under an idea that many tartars were slaves in russia in which confinement he died in my way back i passed through the fortress jenataefskoi or schina balgasun the new city situate on an arm of the wolga  00 miles from astrachan it is a place badly peopled being inhabited only by eight merchants some reformed soldiers cossacks and a few private persons it is a quadrangle with good earthwalls and four bastions within the fort are only imperial buildings a house for the governor a mansion formerly designed for the khan of the kalmucks and a house for the pristaf or chief officer of the kalmuck hordes the mansion of the khan is now inhabited by a kalmuck prince of torgutian extraction who has been baptized by the name of alexei dondukof was brought up among the imperial cadets at petersburg and is advanced to the rank of colonel  near zarizyn the environs of which are become famous by the last and total overthrow of the traitor pugatschef and his wretched followers in august      is a kind of loam which seems to be fit for potters work and becomes in calcining almost as red and tender as the chinese sealingwax some turkish prisoners at zarizyn make of it a variety of little vessels inkstands tobaccopipebowls etc many pieces of selenites are found in the same loam  colony of sarepta within  0 miles of this place on the brook sarpa is a fine colony of moravian brethren established within these eight years and called by the founders sarepta it was erected in the year      and has been endowed by the empress with many distinguished privileges it was begun by five of the brethren deputed by the rest to make choice of a proper spot and to mark out the site of the chief house since this time it has been annually increased by families of the unitas fratrum who voluntarily came here as colonists from germany and holland so that now in      it amounts to   0 persons of both sexes and is yearly increasing by new comers the place is not yet finished according to the plan laid down yet consists of a considerable number of well built houses some of wood and some of birch  the largest and finest building is a new stonebuilt chapel consisting of two stories and a turret with a clock near it stands two large edifices one occupied by the unmarried brethren and the other by the virgin sisters they are all obliged to maintain themselves by their own labor and every week to deposit a certain product of their labor in the hands of their superior these cannot marry without the consent of their superior who seldom grants them this liberty till they are advanced in life among the brethren in the former house are a number of good artisans as tailors shoemakers stockingweavers tanners upholsterers blacksmiths bakers skinners silversmiths etc also a manufactory where they make halfsilks cotton and colored linens stuffs and handkerchiefs and all of quality but according to the custom of all moravian establishments they ask a high price for their goods young women earn their living by needle work spinning cotton bleaching and knitting both buildings have considerable outhouses belonging to them for the various purposes of household business stables cowhouses etc  the other public buildings are an inn with a brandydistillery a tallowchandlery a soapmanufactory a place to make snuff and tobacco a dispensatory with a sawmill a cornmill etc for which the sarpa is dammed up there are no more than ten principal houses to each of which is a small kitchengarden and one house for the physician of the colony without the place along the sarpa are several plantations of tobacco which turn out very profitably  the town is fortified by a rampart ditch and chevauxdefrize with six batteries of two pieces of artillery each and it is otherwise fortified by nature a small garrison of soldiers is quartered here in barracks and relieved from zarizyn  contiguous to the colony they have established a farm on an elevated plain where they breed a great quantity of cattle and close behind this is a plentiful spring of water which by pipes supplies the town a village is likewise begun in the neighborhood the soil is a sandy one and to all appearance no plant can be cultivated to so much advantage as flax the colony has a share in the fisheries of the wolga and the sarpa supplies it with plenty of common fish the springseason yields them rivergame in abundance and winter a number of hares and partridges in      this colony had the misfortune to be plundered by the besarabian tartars who inhabit the step of kuman and the people thus lost great part of their property but the empress has determined to repair their loss and protect them in future  all the buildings here have been erected at the expense of the community and out of the general fund and the proprietors of the house pay a yearly rent of six per cent and as the principal fund consists of a capital of  0000 rubles advanced by the crown without interest for ten years these annual rents will nearly in the said ten years repay the sum advanced at the end of  0 years they are to pay a quitrent of    copecs for every desettine of land assigned them of which they have about  000 each desettine   0 english feet long by   0 wide so that the whole will amount to no more than  000 rubles or   0l sterling such of the colonists as wish to return to their own country before the expiration of the said ten years are obliged to reimburse the sum of    rubles each which the crown advanced them for their journey here after the ten years this    rubles is considered as a present to them  besides these advantages the colony of sarepta enjoys beyond all other german colonies established in this empire the privilege of holding immediately of the chancerywards at petersburg without being dependent on any other province to promote internal harmony and order they have chosen presidents from among themselves and allowed them a handsome stipend their priest has the title of a bishop and the physician and other officers have annual salaries from the general fund they have likewise a male and female warden to preside over the choirs of the unmarried brethren and sisters and maintain that strict discipline for which the sect is characterised to these overseers are given a certain number of assessors selected from their own body who are called counselors these with the pastors administrator and warden of the bachelors compose an assembly called the college of wardens whose office it is to attend the temporal interests of the community to decide disputes and inflict ecclesiastical discipline in short they have a power subject to very few limitations besides this they have a secondary council called the assisting conference before whom matters are brought prior to their being laid before the college lastly there is also an assembly of grownup men that have been admitted to the communion and called the great common council these assemble once a month when every one is at liberty to propose what he pleases and all is determined by a plurality of voices nothing can be altered that is once established but with the concurrence of this other house and the overseers or wardens are obliged to give an account of their administration to the great council at the end of every year  i mention these things only for the information of those readers who are unacquainted with the regulations of this sect of people made by crantz and to amuse them further i will add a short account of their several spiritual meetings  the settled order of their religious assemblies is never interrupted or changed unless for very cogent reasons they are sometimes held in public with the doors open to every comer and sometimes in private for the communicants or for the choirs of unmarried brethren or sisters this private meeting is styled the congregation of the choirs by an established order two assemblies are held every weekday and three or even four on sundays in winter the weekday assemblies do not commence till seven in the evening and when it is public it is called the hour of lecture because they then read aloud some chapters from the bible or a sermon sometimes also the minister preaches particularly on wednesday and sometimes on friday but this assembly is not always general for twice a week and at certain times thrice a week the fraternity of the holy supper hold their assemblies of devotion in which a hymn is constantly sung at times likewise any accounts particularly interesting that may have been received from the brethren spread abroad in other countries are read aloud in summertime this first assembly is transfered to eight in the morning but the second is always at nine in the evening and is called the hour of singing because verses from sacred canticles are sung the sunday assemblies have their order namely the litanies at eight in the morning that is to say one public and solemn prayer at ten a sermon and at eight in the evening another sermon called the hour of commons  the lords supper is celebrated every four weeks and is preceded by a special and very rigid confession and subsequent absolution this private confession is termed the speaking and is heard by the administrator in each of the choirs who exercises in this office the utmost of his authority all the communicants receive the sacrament at the same time and the administering ecclesiastics who are chosen for every assembly by the bishop from the administrators and wardens are then clothed in white surplices whereas at other acts of dvotion they preach in a secular habit of any color sitting at a table  what is called the congregation of choirs for the men and women are divided into different choirs is their hours of prayer or the extraordinary prayers of the unmarried brethren and sisters this is held at the discretion of either division or as the administrator directs the signal for these private assemblies is made by the sound of a horn or trumpet whereas that of public assemblies is by tolling a bell  besides these meetings they have another called a love feast at these times they meet in the hall that serves for a church and are presented with white bread and tea the distribution of which is accompanied by music and spiritual songs exclusion from these agapae is looked on as the second degree of ecclesiastical punishment and is commonly preceded by a prohibition from the communion on the eve of which sacrament they are held as also on those of the principal feast days in these baptisms they use no exorcism the child is brought to the font godfathers and godmothers answer for it as in other churches and the infant is sprinkled three times on the breast who would not suppose that these repeated exercises of piety should enable a man to conquer his passions destroy every vicious affection of the heart and render the members of such a society patterns of true and exemplary holiness yet they often give way to human frailties corrupt manners are but too visible among them and the excellent rules of this sect are always the most favorable side in which it can be viewed  the burial of their dead is attended by no ceremonial rites no sighs no complaints are to be heard nor any mourning seen on the contrary they dress themselves with more than ordinary care on these occasions to indicate the satisfaction they have that another person has run his career of duty and is gone to lay hold of the crown of everlasting life early in the morning on easter day the whole community meets in the churchyard and celebrates an office in honor of the resurrection  the caspian sea on the left or western side of the river sarpa there extends to the southward into the step a ridge of ground describing a number of bays and promontories and which seen from below has the appearance of a chain of hills when in fact it is no more than the slope of a country very much elevated this high bank extends from sarepta along the wolga and thence toward the north as far as the middle elshenka which runs nine miles above the colony into the above river now this sudden elevation of ground the bay and creeks which it forms and especially the saline quality of the low loamstep below whose surface is mixed with vast quantities of muscleshells gives birth to the most probable geographical conjectures not only about the ancient state of the kuman the kalmuck and jaikian steps which are so thoroughly like each other but also concerning the extent of the caspian sea in the remote ages of the world and on the communication it may have had with the euxine sea conjectures which coincide with the opinion of m tournefort who has been ever acknowledged an accurate observer though he might advance and say a great deal with great appearance of truth on the ancient separation of the euxine from the mediterranean on the rise of the waters of the former above the level of the latter and of the influx of this water into the mediterranean probably in the deluge of deucalion  that multitude of shells scattered over all the steps of the jaik the wolga and the kalmucks shells similar in all respects to those found in the caspian sea and never met with in rivers that uniformity of soil in all parts of these steps consisting of nothing else except in places covered with a flying sand than a pure sand connected with such slime as is sound at the bottom of the sea or a yellowish clay without the smallest appearance of turf or any layers of mineral earth till we come to a bed of clay at a very considerable depth that general saline quality of the soil the innumerable flats and lakes of salt water and above all that continued equality of country in all these vast deserts are so many incontestible proofs that they must have been covered formerly by the waters of the caspian sea and though these plains have been forsaken by the sea for a great number of ages yet whether by the effect of the aridity of a hot climate whether in consequence of the saltness inherent to them and maintained by the clayey nature of the inferior stratum in short whether by an effect of that property they have only produced plants requiring a saline earth and water and which by their decay make but little earth and a great deal of salt from whatever cause it be yet these plains have never hitherto been clothed with vegetable earth or turf or by any kind of wood whatever  it is then plain that the elevated ground between the don and wolga as well as the high lands between the wolga and the jaik have been the ancient banks of the hyrcanian sea for it is in these high lands that the disposition of the earth in strata is first discovered that the general saltness of the ground first disappears that its surface is covered with black mould and turf and that the marine productions peculiar to the caspian sea are no where to be met with and if we meet with whole banks of shells and corals higher up the wolga where the lands begin to be more mountainous they must necessarily arise from an inundation of the globe so much the larger and the more remote as all the marine productions contained in these layers are of a nature not to be found either in the caspian sea or in the euxine but only in the depths of the ocean  after saying thus much it may naturally be asked how the caspian sea which acquires from the rivers constantly running into it as much water as it is supposed to lose by evaporation for no sensible reflux has been observed in it for many years how this sea could have lost at one time so great a body of water as to leave dry a space of country doubtless more than    fathoms higher than the actual bed of that sea and of so vast an extent as the plains of the deserts from the lower don to the jaik thence to lake aral and behind this lake to the uralian mountains which are a southern prolongation of the moguldsharian mountains if we admit tourneforts supposition which he has rendered probable namely that the mountains of the thracian bosphorus were in perfect contact and formed a boundary which divided the euxine from the mediterranean so that the former which received into it such great rivers as the danube the dniester the don and the kuban was an immense lake whose level was above that of the mediterranean sea or the ocean but by a rupture of this mighty dam occasioned either by the successive action of the waters or by an earthquake the waters of the euxine rushed into the mediterranean sea to gain its level and that the first influx of this enormous torrent was the reason of these inundations which according to the most ancient records of history deluged a part of greece and the isles of the archipelago we shall be able not only to account for this diminution of the caspian sea but the visible traces that still subsist of the ancient elevation of the caspian will corroborate the opinion of tournefort  it appears that the eastern steps which shows the traces of the retiring of the caspian sea has an open communication by low districts with the crimean step and others situated toward the black sea which steps as far as i could learn are of the same nature with this eastern step and hence if the level of the black sea was many fathoms higher before the waters burst through the channel of constantinople than at present to which perhaps the rivers which flowed in those times from wild woody and moister districts might have much contributed it is a plain probability that the steps of the crimea kuman wolga and jaik and the low countries of great tartary till we pass the lake aral has been one common sea which by a narrow and shallow straight whose marks the river manytsch exhibits flowed round the northern angle of mount caucasus and formed by the present caspian and black seas two vast deep bays at this time the seadogs the several species of sturgeon and other fishes of the black sea the atherina the syngnathus pelagicus and the shells called combs might have been carried into the caspian sea which by its actual situation is too remote from all other seas to permit us to suppose that these different living animals could have come from them  that as soon as the black sea could discharge itself through the propontis into the mediterranean the first fall of its level converted a great part of the flat and shallow sides into salt deserts and the caspian sea having been joined by the euxine or black sea by a shallow straight was in a little time detached from it the level of the euxine being much more lower than the bottom of that straight and of course the caspian sea must have then become a lake confined within the land but as it did not receive such an acquisition of water as the black sea by not having so many and such large rivers emptying into it the rapidity of the current in the channel of constantinople toward archipelago seems to prove that the black sea receives more water from the rivers that flow into it than it loses by evaporation  and as for want of communication with the euxine it received none of its waters this with the natural evaporation must contract the waters of the caspian and leave more land bare and it was at this time perhaps that the communication it had with the lake aral ceased the sandbanks which the waters had left now changing into quicksands which by the wind accumulated into such hills as are met with in the sandy deserts of naryn and the wolga old islands appearing in the dried bottom of the sea as so many little mountains such for example as are those of indeskoi and others and many depressions of the lands after the sea had left the level ground remaining as lakes or salt pits many of which are to be seen upon the steps are all corroborating arguments of the visible decline of the caspian sea  in vain is the objection that travelers relate what they have observed near baku that the sea gained upon the land and had already swallowed up part of the town for if we consider the phlogistic nature of the soil in those parts we shall find infinitely greater reason for admitting a sinking of the earth and of the mountain than an increase of the sea which could not any way be the case whilst on the contrary a bare inspection of all the countries that surround the northern part of the caspian sea leaves no room for doubting that it has undergone a diminution much more considerable than the mediterranean or any other known sea nay it is highly presumable that it is still decreasing every day but even without supposing as we do that the euxine sea was never separated from the mediterranean might we not from the diminution merely which every sea experiences in its waters attribute the separation of the caspian sea from the euxine and from the lake aral as well as the dryingup of the straight of communication and may we not conceive that this communication once stopped the sole disproportion between the body of waters that entered the caspian by the rivers that run into it and what it lost by evaporation might produce the same effect and sink its level much beneath the general plane of the seas  in the extracts of stritter from byzantine authors i find a passage which would make it credible that the low lands or depressions at the northern bottom of mount caucasus through which according to my opinion both the euxine and caspian joined were not quite dry between the fourth and fifth century priscus who was accompanying an embassy sent by theodosius ii emperor of the east in     to attila king of the huns relates memoriae populorum olim ad danubium pontum euxinum paludem moeotidem caucasum mare caspium cet incolentium e scriptoribus historiae byzantinoe erutoe et digestae a j g strittero tom i p      from the mouth of a deputy sent from the emperor of the west whom he met with in his road that which the scythians and huns used to take when they made their inroads into persia that they traveled part through a waste country or step then crossed a marsh which the roman has undoubtedly confounded with that of the maeotis then went over a mountain which was to be traversed as far as into media but let this be mentioned only as an accidental doubtful conjecture the natural marks of the decrease of the caspian are more infallible  on the   th of june i went to tzaratzin or zarizyn here i met mr bykof whom i had sent in winter from siberia to the wolga and who had spent his spring usefully in collecting remarkable plants and insects mr sokolof who came here with mr bykof in the beginning of spring made a tour up the sarpa through the kumanian step and was not yet returned mr kashkerof who had gone by water on the kama arrived here with the wagons just before me  i chose this place for my autumn abode as this district affords many observations in natural history the remainder of this month and the next i was busy in the vicinage of the don and wolga among the kalmucks which gave me an opportunity to examine my account of that nation and set it to rights at the end of july mr sokolof joined me who during his springtour through the kumanian step came not without danger to the cossack town mosdak situate at the bottom of mount caucasus and from thence through kirlac to astrachan and so to zarizyn  there is nothing remarkable in the kumanian step which mr sokolof traveled over but mount caucasus on one of its borders whose snowclad summit was wrapped in the clouds and which begins to rise on the opposite bank of the river terch and the ruins of a considerable city situate in the very angle formed by the like baibalinsky with the river kuma and well known in the regency of astrachan by the name of madshar a proof that this district once was well peopled and deserves population now being a warm climate and favorable for every sort of culture i had requested mr sokolof to visit and describe particularly the abovementioned ruins which the kalmucks call zaghan balgasun white town and also madsharankabalgasun the fine city of madshar and illustrate with many fables of their own invention but the escort which attended him from zarizyn was so small and the danger of vagabond parties of tartars so great at this time in the district of madshar that he was as much afraid to approach them as the cossacks that escorted him  this city is thought to have been the residence of achmet king of grand tartary or the capital of the golden horde and was called by the russians tzarevi podi but there are no remains of any considerable edifice to be found entire the whole being a heap of ruins here and there we met with several kurzans or elevated tombs built with brick and by the side of a fresh waterlake at the foot of a hill is a place where the wife of some king is said formerly to have resided on the summit of the highest hill in all that country they show you the spot whereon they say the palace of their kings stood which the vast extent of its ruins and the great circuit of its courtyards as well as the delightfulness of the situation seem to confirm the ruins of this ancient residence extend to the length of no less than    miles taking in all along the edge of the step whilst in breadth they are only threequarters of a mile the tartars however relate that as they proceed in the step of the jaik to the river of that name they meet with numberless other ruins of small edifices built of brick we know from history that this capital of grand tartary was destroyed in      by the greatduke ivan vassillievitsch grandfather of the czar of that name and that some years afterward it was razed to the very foundations by the nogayan tartars in these ruins we can scarce pass ten steps without stirring up a serpent indeed they are general all over this district whose soil is salt and nitrous their hissings are heard all round but they are only harmless snakes and the black aquatic serpents  whilst i am on the subject of mount caucasus i will say something from the authorities of messrs schloetzer and guldenstadt of the settlements about this chain of mountains which fills the space between the caspian and the euxine seas extending from the west eastwards bordering on persia to the south and on russia to the north it is a territory which the russians are now contending with the turks for and contains a greater diversity of nations and languages than any other country of the same extent in the world here are greeks whose ancestors have dwelt here from the earliest periods of history here are the descendants of those genoese who held possessions with so much authority on the shores of the euxine about the   th century and here are also moravians persians and various colonies of tartars  according to the geographical description of these countries georgia and its provinces occupies the southern side of mount caucasus the kabardines among whom the tscherrkessians commonly called the circassians are a part the southern the leguistans and troughmenians the eastern and the mountaineers in subjection to turkey the western side that is toward the euxine or black sea called the crimea according to my general plan no notice should be taken of countries not under the protection of russia but as they lie so contiguous and the russians claim this territory it may not be improper to say something of it  the troughmenians are the ancient turcomans and occupy the eastern part of the south side of caucasus from the western shore of the caspian sea as far as the province of kaghetia in georgia several of them have their particular princes and others are in subjection to their neighbors  this tribe is unmixed the people from whom they sprung wander still about in their ancient country on the eastern shore of the caspian their possessions extending to the lake aral and touching the frontiers of persia on the south it is now above  0 years since the hordes of this nation fell under the kalmucks of ayouh and being then out of humor with the persians in      they determined to put themselves under the protection of russia to the number of  0000 families but the persian schah prevented them however a considerable number joined themselves to the tartars of orenburgh ufa and astrachan but at the time a party of the kalmuck horde in    0 fled into dsungaria the troughmenians of the river ural obtained their liberty by the sword and are at present free subjects of russia leading a retired life about the mouth of the kuma the reigning khans are brothers and saltans that is sons and princes of nour hali khan of the kirguese  in their figure they resemble the tartars are as well made polite and brave acting like the swiss in time of war and entering into the service of any neighbor that will take them and as they ask no leave they often fight against each other  in short the people of caucasus are but so many different remains of many european and asiatic people which by a succession of many generations have acquired a great resemblance to each other in person constitution and character which border very much on that of the tartars who predominate among them though they are in many respects distinguishable generally speaking the people of caucasus are large wellmade not corpulent of a tawny complexion strong features small nose small eyes and lively thin eyebrows and their hair red or black they are active polished bold and resolute voluptuous very ostentatious in dress and feasts generous and given to dissipation through pride and at the same time severe unjust perfidious and addicted to rapine and revenge  they show great attention to their women who are wellmade more frank and open and more agreeable than tartar women in general the circassians enjoy with justice a preference their beauty vivacity ease and refinement of their manners and the justness of their taste have rendered them famous red hair is thought so great a beauty that such as are not so blessed color their hair with red pomatum the languages spoken here are as various as the people and we find some villages so insulated as to have a language of their own not in the least understood by those of the next village these languages are however so guttural so harsh and dissonant that we have no letters to express the sounds by  all the nations of caucasus together may be able to furnish  00000 cavalry notwithstanding some of them would find it difficult to raise  0 men to march against an enemy all these societies together form a kind of irregular aristocracy composed of many smaller ones every chieftain looks on all the males of his territory capable of bearing arms as his soldiers each of whom is obliged to equip himself and attend his chief when called on some of these people scarce pay any tax whilst others give a fourth of what they possess a tenth is the usual tribute with a certain number of horses and cattle according to the circumstances of the possessor merchants and artisans furnish different sorts of merchandise ammunition etc the administration of justice is conducted in the turkish manner an arbitrary sentence is pronounced immediately often without enquiry and sometimes without crime or any proportion to the fault  many of the caucasians lead a wandering life but the chief part live in villages of from  0 to  0 houses each village has a stone tower for defense in case of attack in which women and children are sheltered from the first assault their ordinary houses are but poor wooden huts and there are many families that dwell in jurts or tents of white felt the mansions of their princes and nobility are built of wood some few of stone all of them badly built and badly furnished and surrounded by the tents and huts of their domestics and attendants stables etc  agriculture and pasturage are their principal occupations though several follow trades and commerce some have plantations of cotton and breed silkworms vines grow on these mountains without culture but they turn their grapes to no account  cattle thrive abundantly with them but their flocks are not numerous their villages being too near each other the horses of caucasus are little inferior to those of arabia and one if properly broke in will fetch  00 ducats for which reason princes and nobles have fine studs they are taught to understand and obey different words of command to kneel down for the rider to mount dismount etc  besides the common trades these people are excellent workmen in iron they make sabres plain and damasked and angular poignards for piercing coats of mail at the joints and to render the wounds they give mortal they make them of arsenical steel they make also all kinds of armor they trade by barter but take the coin of every country by its weight  some of these circassians are so expert in stealing cattle and carrying off women that they make a trade of it their principal endeavors are directed toward carrying off beautiful virgins or handsome women such as they take they keep as concubines or sell them to the armenians who supply the turkish harams making them pass for christians in order to enhance their value what has been published on the subject of this famous commerce with the circassian women is undoubtedly exaggerated though the fact is true they also carry their children to kaffa market with their cattle where they obtain  000 turkish piastres for a young and handsome girl kluman of vienna one of the latest travelers of credit in his voyage to the crimea asserts the same thing these female slaves when brought to market are locked up in a small private apartment when there says he i was desirous of seeing some and spoke to the salesman for that purpose one of them was consequently brought out to me into a room where i was waiting she was welldressed but her face was veiled she kissed my hand agreeable to the eastern custom and her master ordered her to walk to and fro she was elegant to the extreme when she unveiled her face she absolutely enchanted me so inexpressible was her beauty her hair was light her eyes full and blue her nose a little long her lips lovely her features regular her complexion white and soft and her cheeks tinged with a fine carmine she had a long neck and a fine bosom completed the charms of her person she was desired to wipe her face with a white handkerchief circassians brought to market to show me her beauty was not owing to paint she then showed her teeth which were white and regular i was allowed to feel her pulse in order to be convinced of her health after this she was ordered to withdraw the armenian who had the disposal of her assured me she was    years old and yet an unspotted virgin her price was  000 piastres or about    l english which he said was the value of such a slave having viewed this girl another was brought out to me and underwent a similar examination  it is easy to see that none but the rich can make such purchases so that these victims to voluptuousness stand a fair chance of being better provided for than they would have been at home this kind of traffic appears shocking to those of refined sentiments who seek in marriage for a faithful and inseparable companion the equal sharer of their good or bad fortune but in other societies less civilized we find they are considered in no other light than as ministering to the pleasures of sense  all the kobardines and circassians of caucasus when well dressed wear a shirt of fine linen large trowsers moroccoleather boots a long cassock tied by a silk sash and a long upper garment of fine cloth or silk with open sleeves in the eastern style they shave the head and wear mustachios and the beard pointed at the chin the head covered with a scullcap of some rich stuff and over that a cap flattened at top and wider there than at bottom they seldom go abroad without a poignard and a sabre the former in the sash and the sabre in a leather belt the poor wear cloth or cotton stuffs of their own making  the female dress is a shift trowsers a vest and a gown sometimes with sleeves and sometimes without in winter they put on furs reaching to the feet they always wear earrings and a necklace the head is covered with a tastar or tartarean veil which is brought over their faces when they go abroad  they eat like the tartars but their viands are made more relishing at meals they sit on chairs round a table are very fond of strong liquors confining the interdiction of the prophet to wine alone for they are all mahomedans their common drink is mead and a kind of english ale brewed by themselves  polygamy is allowed among them the first wife having many more privileges than the second or third few however have more than one wife and she winks at her husbands intrigues they are too proud to confess that they purchase their wives but call the price paid a nuptial present which they will fix however with as much precision as a tartar  as to their funerals they wrap up the dead in large windingsheets and bury them without a coffin in different places about caucasus we meet with epitaphs crosses and inscriptions which indicate them to have been made by christians probably these are the remains of the greek empire when the seat of it was at byzantium or else of the colony of moravians who quitted their country about the end of the   th century to which they were exposed and sought an asylum here though they are now entirely degenerated and mixed with others preserving only their name and language or they may be vestiges of the zeal of ivan vassillievitsch the great tzar of russia for the conversion of the caucasians  as i shall probably have occasion to mention the circassians again i will say no more of them here  on the  th of august continues dr pallas i made a tour up the wolga in order to visit the german colonies and saw on the heights along the road a great number of watermelon gardens in the open step where this fruit grows very large and fine without watering the watermelons of zarizyn surpass almost those of astrachan the same high grounds and many others as far as dubofka are excellently situated for vineyards and the garden of colonel zipletof governor of zarizyn which has been made but four years is a proof of it as it yields annually near  0 puds of fine grapes  this garden was planted on the spot where there was formerly a wild orchard and is at present not only increased but prodigiously improved it contains various species of fruit trees and vines of hungary and astrachan the upper corner of this garden exhibits a handsome flowers of glaubers which visibly spring from some invisible sources and the adjacent heights have perhaps the same vitriol layers as are observed upon the etshenka  this district between the upper and lower metschetna near the wolga is remarkable for the remains of an old tartarean city which has been almost levelled with the ground among the ruins are the foundation of a great stone building which has been either a caravansera or a mart it is a large square with several alleys and divisions like small chambers here are but few bricks among the rubbish but great quantities of freestone it is said that on the spot where the governors villa stands was originally a metsched and that several valuable things and some golden saddleplates were dug up in the foundations probably the whole has been a suburb of that tartarean metropolis whose remains are found a little lower down than zarizyn on the achtuba  at dubofka about  0 miles from the last place is a fine stonebuilt spacious mansion erected in the gothic taste formerly belonging to ataman porsizky who lived to the age of   0 he founded this town the proprietor did not live till it was quite finished and it now stands waste his successors liking rather to live in their wooden dwellings the cossacks of dubofka were selected in the beginning of this century from those about the don at first they consisted of  0   heads but at present they are reduced to  00 yet have still their atamandjak starchines and stanixatamans they possess a great deal of horned cattle and a great extent of arable land along the wolga and trade much toward the don in boards resin brick tar timber barges and wagons they fix great vessels on rollers and drag them to the place of sale with    or  0 yoke of oxen in summertime many of them will leave their town and travel to the upper districts of the wolga through the kama with all sorts of materials for shipping in order to sell them  about  0 miles higher up is the fortress dmitresskaja or kamyschenka lying in the lower angle which the brook kamyschenka forms with the wolga in a low and moist soil the first fortress erected here in the last century had a far more healthy and advantageous situation the remains of which are still to be seen on a height in the neighborhood the present new fortress is quite commanded by that height and consists of a wooden wall and bastions etc the works enclose a stonebuilt cathedral a well built townhouse the governors mansion and some other dwellings of note the city lies in length down the wolga in long parallel streets of which the principal one consists of of moveable shops and extends from the fortress to the saltmagazines this city has also two wooden churches the shopkeepers here sell a great deal of provisions and waggonerstools on account of the salt that is conveyed through this place formerly a great trade was carried on here with the kalmucks and would be now if that canal was made from this river to the don which peter the great planned i found here professor lowiz and his assistant mr inochodzof employed in taking the level of the country through which this road is to pass it was begun in the reign of peter the great by captain perry an englishman the soft nature of the high grounds which stand in the way and the rivulets of ilowla to which this canal is to run give the greatest hopes to the execution of this project  in order to reach the river jeruslan or ulustan about    miles from the river targun we passed over the step of targun which is arid and barren to the extreme the slime which covers the soil becomes fine dust in summertime rises in the air with the least wind and is very troublesome to travelers add to this the whole district is very unsafe on account of several gangs of kirguese who live by the plunder of incautious travelers that fall in their way the jerusian runs parallel with the wolga a considerable way but where the road leaves it there is a umet or wayhouse where they sell bread and hay and where there is a bridge if the water is high it is just    miles from this place to saratof and as far to the lake some of our people carelessly let some fire drop on the step which kindled the parched grass and the fire spread with such rapidity and violence as to become inextinguishable and we had a great deal of trouble as before to bring off the wagons through the fire which had made a circle round us so that we were in danger of being burnt alive or suffocated by the vapors and smoke yet we saved every thing and got off without any material damage  eleven miles from the jeruslan we pitched our tents on the side of a brook and took up our lodging for the night on the   th of august from the heights situated about this brook we could descry westward the high mountains of selotofsk beyond the wolga and as in this district are situated the lowermost german colonies i intended to visit we had these mountains for our landmark it being    miles to the nearest colony kotschetnaja  this village consisting of    houses mostly romancatholic families from the bishoprics in transylvania belongs to the circle of warenburg well colonized under the direction of one le roi and pictel the above circle contains    colonies planted along the wolga of which the lowermost lies six miles further down the said river and at  0 miles distance from saratof they have taken russian names and the people speak the russ language with uncommon ease and purity these    colonies consist of     families or    0 persons from almost all parts of germany and are of different and partly of mixed religions they have amongst them one lutheran minister and two romish priests the houses throughout all the colonies are wood and built on a new plan so as to unite two habitations under one roof each colonist has a good chamber parlour and kitchen and sometimes a little closet besides these villages are situated along the wolga lowgrounds which supply them with plenty of hay and wood but they are too near each other to afford them all a sufficient quantity of good arable land and though they are rapidly increasing they cannot prosper well unless some change is made and they are separated farther from each other  all round saratof to the distance of  0 or  0 miles along the banks of the wolga and karaman there are a number of colonies either erected by the empress herself or by the agents of le roi pictet and the baron de beauregard    in number besides the    already mentioned comprising      families and  0    persons of different countries germans dutch french etc and different persuasions with lutheran and romish clergy all properly established under certain chiefs and regulations  between saratof and astrachan there are several more colonies pretty near each other in which are manufactories of cloth linen and stuff that of rossoschi consists only of french families and belongs to    others erected by governor bosse and are immediately under the command of the empress the houses here are all built with stone but the inhabitants are dull and slothful  here is also a holstein colony though most of the inhabitants come from the rhenish countries the noah of these colonists or the person who first introduced the plantation of vineyards is one john philip peiler from messingen upon the rhine he has in two gardens belonging to him upwards of  000 bearing vines which yielded him last year more than  0 puds of grapes he does not water his vines though they stand upon a very dry soil it must be ascribed to the saltness of the ground that the grapes though unlike those of astrachan in size beauty and taste yields far better juice which if suffered to stand long in casks becomes a high red light wine equal to some french wines and a nectar compared with that of astrachan  that i might collect a proper account of these colonies i went to the colony of catherinestadt and staid there a whole day the plan of this place was projected for  00 families though it has only     consisting of     people the chief part of whom seem to be mechanics here is a fine lutheran church which has its own preacher also a calvinist and romish chapel but they have no ministers appointed to them to the latter a priest came occasionally to say mass the dwellings are all built of wood in regular streets no colony has better mechanical professions than this and some acquire a good living by its being so near saratof from which it is distant    miles it has at present an upholsterer an able turner some hatters dyers clothiers and weavers carpenters cutlers locksmiths and watchmakers and some of more common trades as tailors shoemakers bakers millers butchers etc even some miners came here but finding no employ they are turned husbandmen if there was more business for these people catherinestadt would soon be a substantial place formerly the planting of tobacco was the best subsistence of the colonists and the kalmuck hordes who used to pass this district in summer purchased almost all they grew but now this commerce is on the decline though connoisseurs esteem the tobacco raised here not inferior to that of virginia in the district of catherinestadt there were more than  0 desettines of land planted with tobacco they attempted here to plant mulberrytrees but the young plants were entirely devoured in winter by the hares an attempt has also been made with success to make dutch and swiss cheese but before i quit these colonies i must mention a kind of vinegar prepared by the inhabitants of catherinestadt from curds for want of a stronger acid they take for this purpose the curds of turned milk put them into a little barrel with the addition of leaven or sour dough or without until they have finished their fermentation when they yield a very strong and pleasant vinegar  saratof from catherinestadt i went on the   th to saratof and arrived there on the   th of august this city was first situated on the left side of the wolga on the brook saratofka where the vestiges of it are to be seen the present city was built about the end of the   th century and is now a considerable place increased within these ten years by the establishment of the german colonies it lies along the steep border of the wolga at the bottom of some high mountains which form a chain along the wolga ilawla and don the place is divided by a deep cleft and an old wall into city and suburbs the low part of the city lies chiefly on level ground has broad and regular streets seven churches one convent of friars and another of nuns here is also a court of waywodes a saltoffice a court of tuition which superintends the colonies and a court of police  the court of waywodes is a stone building and opposite to it are several stonebuilt comptoirs the city has many substantial inhabitants and some lords of adjacent manors have here some fine mansions the great market is built of wood and contains a great number of shops among the inhabitants are about  00 german citizens some of very lucrative trades three miles from the city one verdier has an extensive mulberryplantation but his success in silkworms has not been very considerable saratof receives great benefit from the ships that are here moored laden with hides tallow fish salt and persian goods bound from astrachan and other lower districts to the upper parts of the empire and returning from those parts to astrachan with corn wood earthen and wooden vessels and also from the carts and wagons thousands of which pass this town every week especially in winter conveying salt and fish to the eastern parts of the empire  on the   th of august we went to the elton saltlake called by the kalmucks altannor the golden lake on account of its red luster under the sun the salt in this lake is dug by volunteer workmen who come here in spring and work the whole summer this year there were employed only   0 men but other years they have seldom been less in number than      at times  000 have been employed  at present the lake was very shallow and digging of the salt very difficult they broke it at two miles from the borders and even there the water was not more than three quarters of a yard deep the saltrinds are broke with heavy bars similar to those used in russia to break the ice in rivers having broke it into small pieces they wash off the slime with the salt water and then carry it on shore to a place enclosed with pales each set of saltbreakers sell the salt they dig to the saltconveyers dear or cheap according to the nature of circumstances formerly when there were many workmen and the work was easier the saltconveyers paid them for a waggonload drawn by two bullocks which carries about   0 puds from    to  0 copecs only but during the present year the price rose to  0 or  0 copecs the waggoners or conveyers when arrived at the mart get the carriage paid by the pud the distance from the lake to saratof is computed to be     miles and the carriage is generally six copecs or threehalfpence per pud or   lb but the distance to dmitresskoi being only    miles the carriage is only four copecs per pud from this sum they deduct one denuschka for the repair of bridges and fresh water wells a wagon cannot go more than five or six journeys in a summer to saratof and does not get more for each load with two bullocks than between seven and eight rubles therefore the more beasts of draught a waggoner has the better a saltdew very frequently falls about this lake i found it on the   d of august in the morning upon the reeds in a kind of milky drops very salt to the taste it has been observed that the seeds of watermelons exposed one night to this dew will never grow the borders of the lake are full of all sorts of saltplants  on the   th of august we had to travel over a parched step where no fresh water was to be had it was more than    miles over our horses were so spent that they could scarce lift their feet and though we were within sight of the wolga one of our horses fell from thirst and died the next morning though immediately after he fell it rained a heavy shower which would have relieved him when we reached the river we were told by some fishermen that we were within seven miles of dubofka from which the lake elton lies directly west the next morning the   th we rode to dubofka but found the commander of the cossacks so drunk that we were obliged to wait till the next day for horses to convey us on to zarizyn  zarizyn as i passed the following winter in zarizyn where i met with mr georgi i will give my readers some account of this city the district the weather and its natural productions  next to astrachan zarizyn is the most ancient inhabited and fortified place in the lower district of the wolga it lies just beyond the mouth of the brook zariza on the right hand bank of the wolga the town belongs to the government of astrachan is     miles from it and lies in the latitude of     0 min n latitude as there is no circle dependent on zarizyn it has only a commandants chancery the fortress is an antique structure and consists of a high rampart and bastions the works decayed by age were lately repaired by the turkish prisoners of war and it was so well done that in      when a numerous body of rebellious peasants under pugatschef attempted an attack on this place they found themselves obliged to raise the siege without injuring the fortress at all the heavy cannon in the place were of the greatest service  the buildings within the fort are mean there are but few good dwellinghouses every thing in the city being built of wood except the three churches the marketplace is extensive has many shops and here live many substantial merchants who carry on a great trade with the kalmucks and the numerous travelers that pass this way the smaller number of the inhabitants live by breeding of cattle and raising cucumbers melons and watermelons also by fishing and carrying goods from place to place good trades are very much wanting and of course this is a great advantage to the neighboring colony of sarepta the garrison consists of a batallion of light horse the commander of the fortress was formerly the chief of the citizens and the whole district but in      the empress established a court of waywodes  quitting the fortress there is a suburb belonging to this place inhabited by cossacks it is irregularly built but has a stone church lately erected it was found necessary to set fire to the place when threatened with an attack by pugatschefs party the zarizinian line or boundary consists of a strong wall on the south side with pallisadoes beginning near the fortress and continuing uninterrupted as far as the river don which lies at the distance of    miles from the wolga on this line are four redoubts and between these at proper distances a guardhouse encompassed with chevauxdefrize the whole is guarded by cossacks of the don who receive a pay of    rubles a year and commanded by the governor of zarizyn  six hundred cossacks of the don says gmelin who was there in      quartered at zarizyn are dispatched regularly every year in conjunction with some regular troops to guard this line at such guardhouse    cossacks commanded by a sotnik are lodged in miserable subterranean barracks these posts are only relieved every four months and the service of the line lasts for one or two years  their advanced posts are likewise charged with furnishing travelers that have passports with relays and when they go in boats belonging to the crown the cossacks are obliged to perform the office of rowers if the reader could picture to himself the idea of the most wretched of the human species he would form that of a cossack employed in the lines of zarizyn none are sent there but the poorest and most deplorable of all their race and such as have no condition in life and destitute of either friends or money have no means of avoiding this painful service from the instant they arrive their treatment is such as a pitiless and unfeeling peasant would scarce show to his beast though the unhappy cossack can scarcely obtain a small allowance of bread very hard and very black to assuage his hunger he must yet endure all the extremity of heat and severity of cold with no other covering than the few rags he brought with him or shut himself up in some cavern of the earth with the companions of his wretchedness where it would be impossible for any man not trained to hardship and accustomed to distressful situations from his birth to exist for one minute and brave the putridity of the air as to his horse or two horses which is all his property they must be satisfied with much less provender than the unhappy master can allow them for performing the harrassing service of his landlord to whom every horse of the cossacks is bound when the term of this slavery is expired he goes home with his starved beasts if perchance he has been happy enough to preserve their lives with his own in a poorer plight than he went away if among the number of these poor wretches some should be discovered to have a small matter of money about them the fate of such as are pennyless is perhaps less to be pitied for the money is sure to increase the revenues of the officers of zarizyn and it is well known that every cossack who has any coin however small in value commonly disappears before the expiration of his term their difficult service as rowers may be collected from what mr gmelin further relates he says that when his two companions got into one of the governmentboats on the  0th of september and had only proceeded a few miles on the wolga there arose so furious a tempest from the west that the waves went over the vessel and the boatmen unskilful in their business knew not how to get forwards whilst they were in the greatest distress imaginable they struck perhaps to the saving of their lives on a sandbank from which they could not get loose till toward midnight and this relief of mind did not continue long for soon fresh hurricanes and squalls threw them alternately on the two shores of the river so that before they reached the advanced post the next morning they had been cast on six sandbanks and had delivered themselves from each with the greatest difficulty  this district enjoys plenty of every thing and surpasses the whole country farther down the wolga it is not only excellent as has been before observed for the culture of watermelons but for all sorts of fine fruits here grow wild many productions not to be met with higher up the wolga and in other parts of russia wild pears are in great plenty near dubofka mulberrytrees abound in the low grounds of the achtuba tamarisks begin to grow near zarizyn and wild plums are abundant toward the mantysch and the river kuma i sowed in a watermelon garden near zarizyn some seeds of phaseolus which i received from china and which in sweden will not grow but in the warmest hothouses and they yielded in august the finest blossoms and seed  the weather of this country is as follows heavy frosts generally in january which lower the mercury to   0 and to  00 equal to    and    below the freezingpoint of rheaumurs thermometer when at  00 the weather is stormy and the frost less sensible february is variable has calm frosts sometimes stormy from n w attended with snow and ends with a thawing wind from w s w in      i was able to observe the whole winter and february was exceedingly delightful and sweet about the middle of the month arrived little birds of passage and toward the end swans ducks and other waterfowl february the   th the wolga was freed from ice the same day we had thunder but on the   th to the   th of march we had such continued sharp cold as froze the river again the month of april is incontestibly in this climate the most settled and finest of all months no rain falls but the rivers overflow and water the land at this time the watermelons are sown and the wind which blows constantly from one district viz the east mitigates the heat during the latter days of april in      on the   th of april or the middle of may the wind changes to the south or southwest and brings thunder and warm nightly rains this fine weather lasts generally three or four weeks when the wind changes to south and southeast then begins the dry weather which continues ten or twelve weeks in june it is more supportable as during the time when the water stands high in the wolga which is always highest this month the nightdews are most copious and refresh the earth exceedingly the rest of this month is generally so serene that scarce a cloud the size of a mans hand is to be seen  the hottest and most intolerable of all the summermonths is july when it blows constantly from the arid step and sea s s e or e after this arise the hot winds which though they blow irresistibly so as to sweep off all the dust from the step and carry it through the air are yet as hot as if they came from a fiery furnace these winds usually commence about two in the afternoon and continue till past midnight they seldom last longer during their blowing sheep often drop down dead like flies froth bleed at the mouth or swell and become so suddenly puffed that even their skins are of no use this hot glowing wind is often owing to the burning of the step and is then of longer duration in july      the mercury rose as high in the sun as  0 in de lisles thermometer this is to    in rheaumurs and a thermometerglass filled with spirit of wine burst in the river sarpa so great a number of fish and crabs died that the stench was intolerable soon after it was known that this insupportable hear had risen from the burning of the kumanian step which was set on fire to the circumference of several hundred wersts each werst threequarters of an english mile great numbers of people fell sick by it at other times however it is not uncommon to see the quicksilver in the thermometer rise in this month in the shade up to  0 and above above    in the thermometer of rheaumur higher than the heat of pondicherry and it was observed by dr wier at sarepta for it is from him i had this information to rise in the sun in      on the   th of july and the  st of august to    and on the   th of july in the same year to    and in      it was seen on the   th of july to rise all at once to  0 the air during the sultriness of july is generally so thick that we cannot see far before us on the even step though we imagine by optic error that we see a great way this error or deception is produced by certain undulating vapors visible to the eye arising on the step hills and high grass and giving the appearance of distant high mountains and woods and representing all objects larger than they are shaw niebar and other oriental travelers tell us that in the great deserts of arabia trembling vapors will obscure the horizon and lead the eye to suppose every thing at a distance to be larger than it is in the district of zarizyn during this sultry month it often appears from far as if we saw a hill encompassed with water when we have only an arid step in view the beginning of this month ripens the watermelons and the latter half of it the grapes  in august thunders are frequent arising from s and s w drawing northwards over the wolga and falling away about the sea eastwards so that they describe a semicircle sometimes they are accompanied by so violent a hail and rain as to cause inundations sometimes such tempestuous whirlwinds rise as raise the dust from the blossoms of the several species of wormwood so as to darken the air and leads one to suppose it to be a thick brown yellow smoke or fog i was eyewitness of such a whirlwind in zarizyn and was astonished at the wonderful phenomenon after some thunderclouds had obscured the sereneness of the day and shook the whole district with a dreadful hurricane which only lasted for a quarter of an hour and withdrew with a windcolumn like a cloud over the wolga my tent which was pitched in the open step was suddenly enveloped in a thick brown smoke  september is generally serene clear and temperate the wind changing to s s e and n e october remains always temperate the winds blowing from n e to w which causes a great deal of fog and moist weather in november which they here call the rainmonth in temperate years the rains change toward the end into northeastern storms and snow frost and storms often prevail even in the beginning of this month and the wolga soon drives ice in      the thermometer fell on the  th to   0 degrees and in the night of the   th and   th the ice became quite fixed  when the year is mild the wolga is not frozen till december then after a driving of ice for a week or a fortnight an east wind falls in and fixes it during this month reign continual storms with flakes of snow that continue six or seven days  december and january can be called only in general the wintermonths of this district and they are often so mild that ducks will remain the whole winter in the open waterspots beyond zarizyn larks and partridges will not leave the place but to go to such saltspots as are not covered with snow where they can feed on the seeds of plants partridges which gather here in greatest quantities in september and october are caught in the said months in nets and till december  as soon as a violent frost begins in november the snow larks come into this district as the last birds of passage from the northern zone and reside during the whole winter in the lowest wolga among the field and tuft or crested larks the black steplarks alauda tartarica come from the step when the snow and winter storms rage and take up their residence in the vicinage of villages but never leave the district  other small birds of passage that spend the winter in remote countries come here in september remain whilst the weather continues mild and grow fat by feeding on the seeds of plants the northern duck anser erythropus arrives at the end of september in large flocks and after a short stay draws away southwards those water and strandfowls which do not wander far to the north as the searaven and stephen charadrius gregarius hie to their winterabodes about the end of august in september says gmelin the beebird merops apiaster passes by thousands into other countries we may judge of the quantity by the number of their nests this bird builds in the clay hence it is that the hills which rise one above another along the western bank of the wolga from zarizyn are stuck as thick with them as the cells in a beehive  in spring the birds of passage begin to swarm here in the middle of february in the beginning of this month snowlarks and snowortolans draw abundantly to the north about the   th one sees in the sarpa and achtuba every species of swan and the first wild geese and the dry rushes are plentifully crowded with tomtits parus biarmicus et coeruleus at the end of the month the steps are every where on fire  when the month of march has frost as it had in this year the birds of passage hide themselves this was the season in which during the present year the wagtail and black and white rocknightingale did not appear till the   th on the  d of april arrived the first swallows and about the same time the insects burst into life notwithstanding a cold east wind blew very sharply  between the  th and  0th of april we saw about the sarpa whole flocks of the anser pulchricollis or rednecked geese but these left the district very soon next we saw for the first time the male of the bullfinch fringilla lebs with the linnet fringilla petronia and afterward the woodcock and great numbers of various other species of birds of passage  this shows how early the birds of passage arrive in this district and of course the warmth of the climate on the opposite side of the wolga are a great many saigaks and antelopes which draw northwards in winter also little mountainfoxes or korsaks there is plenty of common red foxes in the heights between the wolga and don and a great many hares which remain also gray during the winter wherever there are any roots there are found the great blind mole and the lesser mole common ermines and weasels are here in plenty and where oaks and hazels grow the fieldmouse quercinus also a great number of race or jumpinghares with three toes  of insects they have the scorpionspider but the pain and ill effects of its bite are soon relieved by the application of oil they have also a very large kind of millepedes or scolo pendia and fleas engender to such an enormous degree that all the flocks and herds and half the human race would not suffice to furnish them with room if a man stops a while in summer on the low grounds about the wolga and in the houses he immediately swarms with these vermin and they fasten to the noses of the unhappy horses in such vast quantities that they seem all black other domestic insects as crickets and moths are here as in other places and the blatta asiatica or little moth of china which begins to be general extends from astrachan to the towns above and will it is feared be shortly troublesome to all russia  there are a number of chalybeate springs about zarizyn some of which are much frequented by the inhabitants on account of their cooling quality and promoting urine but by the use of them i and my company had all our teeth loosened  the district of zarizyn is richer in plants than all the step below but yet only in vernal plants for in may all the grass and herbs on the hills begin to wither and in the two ensuing summermonths every vegetable production is burnt up our author enumerates all these plants but i have omitted them as they would only swell the work and be no entertainment to a general reader they have a good deal of wild asparagus very fine and goodflavoured the natives who are not russians are very fond of it but the russians never notice it very fine tulips of different species grow wild in the step and boys search for and get their bulbous roots with avidity i must observe here that the elm of this country ulma campestris has a purgative quality water in which the gummy leaves gathered in summer or autumn have been some time steeped if drank will open the body like manna  the silkmanufactory belonging to the crown is one of the most useful establishments in this neighborhood mulberrytrees morus tartarica grow in such quantities that there are whole forests of them mixed with other trees these supply the silkworm the only inconvenience is that at the time the chrysalis bursts and the worm is in want of food the rivers here overflow the country and they are obliged to gather the leaves in boats no one can remember the planting of these trees but the ruins of stoneedifices all over the step render it easy to conjecture that they were planted by those tartars who formerly inhabited these deserts and whose tribe was known by the name of the golden horde  it was now the   th of april and notwithstanding the frequent robberies committed in the wild step by the kirguese which rendered the district of the wolga unsafe all the last winter i determined to make a tour along the achtuba the fruit of the wild mulberry which grows along this river is little inferior to that which grows in gardens it ripens in the month of june and may then be gathered in large quantities and its juice has been found by fermentation to yield a very strong spirit which has nearly the smell of hungary water the achtuba had not yet received the waters of the overflowing wolga and it was so shallow that we could cross it without wetting the axletrees of our wagons mulberrytrees grew along the banks of this river to the distance of    miles and counselor rytschkof has established here a very flourishing silkmanufactory  toward night i reached nishnoiachtubinskoigorodok which consists of two villages of that name celebrated for their silkmanufactories on the   th i traveled down the achtuba with an escort of  0 cossacks from the don  on the   th we went partly over sandhills partly through valleys to the saltlake and the mountain bogdo and though we traveled with the same horses they seemed quite fresh and in spirits even after a difficult and heavy journey of several days one of our suite who accompanied the last wagon met with a fall and was so much bruised that he died four days after in strong convulsions and the weather being warm i ordered his interment on the step  this remarkable mountain bogdo oata as the kalmucks call it  bogdo implying royal or sublime has a high eminence which at a distance the kalmucks compare to a lion couchant and from this sometimes called it arslan ula or lions mountain it is strata may be easily counted from its top which has about  0 or    fathoms perpendicular height the limestone stratum at top is gray and hard and breaks away in great stones full of petrifactions of shellfish under this lime it mostly consists of loam mixed with marle or sand    fathoms deep and its top layers are much impregnated with common salt the drains have in several places deeply excavated the loam and formed many subterranean holes so that as i was climbing up the side the ground sunk under me and i fell into a pit up to my arms into these holes the kalmucks are accustomed to throw coin clothes arms etc as gifts or offerings the cleft generally fed thus superstitiously is said to have broke in a little before the kalmuck horde left this district and was filled with water to the depth of several fathoms but at present there are no signs of it on the loam layers is often found felenites and pieces of common salt as pure as crystal and as large as a mans fist the eastern shelf of the mountain has a very peculiar appearance owing to the tenderness of the sandstone probably several little round holes and grottos have been formed by the rapid dashing of the billows whilst this step was covered by the sea for these excavations are not to be seen to the whole height of the shelf and on its level toward the saltlake lay also some bruised rocks scattered which appear to have been wholly covered by the water and near them we find rolled balls of different sizes which if beaten to pieces are partly hollow and contain sand from these circumstances and the mountain being entirely insulated and full of petrified bodies that could have lived no where but at the bottom of the sea it is evident past a doubt that what is now land was formerly covered with water if eastwinds blow violently against the grottowork of this shelf to one that stands at the top a noise is heard seemingly the distant muttering of many hundred people with various voices sounding more or less at different times i observed this plainly today as a violent east wind blew the priests of the kalmucks told the people that the wise old man zaghan ebughan or spirit of the mountain has his residence beneath it where there is an assembly of the blessed who are constantly praying and singing hymns  underneath the sandstone is a highred strongcoloured bole encompassing a sandslate the superstitious kalmucks fetch this bole considering it as the most sacred color and paint their tents with it on the south side of the mountain is a field of alabaster with gypseous rocks and a number of holes sunk by the subterraneous passage of snowwaters on the highest part of the mountain where it consists of sandrocks the kalmucks have erected monuments consisting of high square stonepillars which may be seen at a great distance otherwise we see here but very few traces of their superstition and i examined the whole of the mountain very particularly but four miles and a half from it toward the wolga is an old kalmuck altar erected of reeds and earth the remains of a festival there celebrated  the tartars have the most extravagant notions respecting this mountain and among others say that bogda stood originally on the side of the jaik but that two kalmuck saints took it into their heads to remove it to the banks of the wolga however previous to their undertaking this painful work they passed a considerable time in fasting and prayer this rather weakened them but they soon got it on their shoulders and when they had brought it as far as where it now stands a sinful thought came into the mind of one of them other traditions say that he fell in love with a kalmuck woman and had carnal knowledge of her which so enfeebled him that he could no longer bear the weight which fell on him and crushed him to death and that his blood being shed on the ground produced that red color visible in the mountain as the other was not able to carry it alone it has stood where it fell  the situation of this single stratamountain though peculiarly remarkable has yet within a quarter of a mile of it a no less remarkable object viz an inexhaustible saltlake called bogdoin dabassu its form is oblong from west to east and    miles long toward the western bay its breadth is about five miles and its circumference thirty miles its distance from the next place on the achtuba in a direct line which is to the lower pristan or saltlake is reckoned twentyeight miles and to the fortress tschernojarskaja over all the arms of the wolga    miles carriages drawn by oxen go and return in five days and drawn by horses in three days the western wide part on the west side of the mountain forms a small bay ending in a wide round bay which the saltdiggers call kultuk or seagulph beneath the high border of the lake near the mountain are several little bitter and fresh water springs overgrown with reeds the whole lake is very shallow so that even when the wind blows and raises billows on the shore any man may cross it and not be up to his waist standing near it in the sunshine it has a fine greenish color but at a distance glitters with a silvery white the water is exceedingly pure without any bitterness and even about the springs it has no bad smell the bottom is a sandy slime which sinks in here and there but annually covered with saltrinds or crusts as white as snow being a sediment from the water the salt settled this year was not yet become firm it was however an inch thick very pure white without smell or any mixture of bitter salt and consequently far better than that of the lake elton by autumn the years crust is said to grow full three inches in depth or thickness there are several of these layers one upon another but always separated by a layer of mud the lower kinds are as hard as stone and therefore the saltbreakers to save trouble will only take the salt from the surface which is not crusted  this lake has long since been made known to the russians inhabitants of the wolga by the kalmucks who as long as the salt was free to be collected supplied themselves with it after it became a prerogative of the crown it was conveyed in      to the imperial saltmarts at astrachan and other places they first established a saltmart on the achtuba at the distance of    miles but this mart was afterward removed to a much more distant place    miles for which the carriers received three copecs a pud the chief saltfactor is a merchant of tschernojarskaja and pays at present only two and a half copecs per pud which the carrier must pay the salt is far better than that of the lake elton and more productive to the public revenue  the kalmucks relate in their ridiculous legends that one day their delailama having taken his dinner in this place and thrown on the ground what remained of his salladsauce it produced this lake which has gradually increased ever since and that the mountain has been also enlarged to its present size from delailamas taking his rest thereon by night  immediately at the foot of mount bogdo on the edge of the desert at saikol the troughmenian tartars subject to the kalmucks have their habitations they are said to have been first settled in this country by saissin chorlin who came first into the territory of the moguls in russia in      with  0 000 kibitkas or families and  00 troughmenian families whom he picked up on the way others think it was later  the roundleafed rhapontic or rhubarb grows plentifully on the eastern precipice of this mountain and on the whole alabaster rock the kalmucks seek eagerly for the roots which grow on this sacred spot and often take secret journies to collect them particularly as the plant is not be found west of the river wolga they use it as a tea and take it as a medicine there are also a number of other fine plants too tedious to mention here  not far from this mountain the cossacks of my escort who were moving the stones lying about on the ground brought me the first scorpion that has been seen in the russian empire these conceal themselves among the dry stones are small and of a peculiar species but exactly like those i have seen brought from persia  mr bykof in a botanical excursion he made eastwards from this district to the desert naryn in      at    miles from tologoi kol met with in the step a pyramid built with bricks by the kalmucks but much decayed called by them schorolgunbalgasun the earthen city  having now fulfilled the design for which i was sent out and nearly completed my six years tour i determined to go the nearest way home and make the best of my road to moscow of course the rest of my journal will not contain any thing remarkable having been traveled over and explored by professors gmelin and guldenstadt mr georgi having returned with the last snow through casan i set out for moscow with all my students and attendants on the  th of june      and reached the city of tambof on the  0th tambof is situated on the zna is an episcopal see or provincial regency contains    parishchurches  0000 inhabitants an important annual fair cloth manufactories and excellent tradesmen here i continued three days between this and moscow the country is embellished with the seats of the nobility and gentry in my way we shot a milkwhite bird of that species called blackbird and one black spotted with white on the  d of july i reached moscow and having received my recall by a mandate from the empress sent by the imperial academy to all its absent members then on their travels in quest of physical or geographical knowledge i ordered my wagons to be speedily repaired that i might reach the end of my career which i did on the  0th of july though with an infirm body and a hoary head at the age of    yet in better health and spirits than i was whilst in siberia and full of grateful acknowledgments to providence who had preserved me to this day amid the numberless dangers to which i had been exposed  jamque hoc immensum spatiis confecimus aequor et jam tempus equum
