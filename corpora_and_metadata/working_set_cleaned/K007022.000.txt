 london printed for weaver bickerton at lord bacons head without temple bar       price one shilling  to his serene highness the prince of orange this poem is humbly inscribed by his  most dutiful servant s duck  on the marriage of his serene highness the prince of orange illustrious prince forgive the feeble lay that now aspires to hail your nuptialday nor  a muse the meanest of the nine who brings her humble offering to your shrine and you imperial nymph whose lovely face invites the hero to your chaste embrace vouchsafe a spark of your celestial fire harmonious words and pleasing thoughts inspire soft as your love and tuneful as your lyre so shall my numbers charm the listening ear and even the glad nassau delighted hear nassau has long enriched the book of fame and anna now adorns the noble name nations who saw the light of orange rise with awful splendour in the belgian skies shall soon behold it with new luster shine joined to a glorious star of brunswicks line so where the flowing sambre gently glides the swain delights to view the beauteous tides but when his moreextended eye surveys the shining torrent join the spacious maese both rivers thus with friendly union flow and to the sight superior beauty show whenever the gods a noble race intend they suit the causes to their destined end nor yoke unequal hearts in nuptial love joves valiant bird disdains the fearful dove great minds by native sympathy combine as golden particles the closest join paternal virtues in their bosom roll allied in love by nobleness of soul hence thrones and scepters shine neglected things hence royal ann prefers nassau to kings while britons with united hearts rejoice and willing senators applaud the choice to see their king to honor ever true discharge the debt to sacred william due immortal william by whose prudent cares we yet enjoy the fruits of all our wars our laws religion liberty and peace and even the blessings of the brunswick race nor thou illustrious orange blush to own thy honor thus allied to albions crown blessed with a princess in whose form we trace her fathers majesty and mothers grace bright orbs of power that with propitious ray dispel our clouds and beautify our day not as the comet raging through the air infects the world with pestilence and war but like the sun their beams of goodness glow inspiring life and chearing all below such are the glorious sire and gracious dame from whence the beauteous bride of orange came and shall unerring nature change her kind what lion ever produced a timorous hind the royal eagles royal eagles breed and heroes from heroic sires proceed romes founder thus confessed his race divine thus nassau copies the nassovian line thus annas noble stream of virtue flows high as the regal spring from whence it rose thrice happy nymph with every grace supplied thrice happy prince with such a heavenly bride in whom superior sense with judgment joins her beauty much but more her merit shines how glorious when such worth adorns the great we hear we see admire and imitate virtue in them attracts remotest eyes but in the vulgar soul unheeded lies as radiant phoebus darts superior light while smaller planets shun the watchful sight accomplished thus let her example fire the drooping muse and wake the sounding lyre to aid religion be her chiefest care heaven justly claims the soul it made so fair to stem the torrent of licentious rage and prop the virtues of a sinking age exalting science to her ancient height to raise declining arts and make the rude polite while great nassau whom native glory warms whenever his country calls him forth to arms may fire the belgians in the field of mars consult their peace or animate their wars paint his forefathers to their wondering eye and teach em how to conquer or to die like him who bravely dared to break their chain though held by all the force and fraud of spain for injured liberty the sword he draws resolved to gain or perish in the cause and having long the doubtful combat tried like caesar vanquished and like caesar king williams great grandfather the first great assertor of the belgian liberties assassinated at delph died though different far the motives of their mind that fought to conquer this to save mankind till praised lamented envied and admired the hero patriot and the prince expired oh where did then the guardian angels hide nor watched to turn the guilty ball aside when he whom armed hosts could not withstand now falls a victim to one villains hand but rise ye muses quit the pensive lay nor damp the joys of this auspicious day since yet the glorious name of orange stands since royal anna seals the nuptialbands soon may imperial adolphs rise again again new fredericks thunder on the main rousing the martial youth to wars alarms if proud ierians shine again in arms to guard their country from tyrannic power and be what glorious william was before nor shall the states invading forces fear ere pregnant time the promised heroes bear nor want allies their freedom to defend since brunswick reigns and albion is their friend as branching oaks protect the rural swain secure from summerheat and winterrain so shall our monarch with paternal aid his regal shelter over batavia spread long as the scepter fills his royal hand a true palladium shall insure the land and if the praescient muses guide my lay or future secrets phoebus can display the day shall shine distinguished from the rest that anna dignified and hymen blessed in which augustus fortifies his throne and plans a scheme of union for his son bespeaks allies for princes yet to come new friends to britain and new foes to rome proceed great monarch new allies to gain and with new nuptialleagues our peace maintain so shall thy beauteous nymphs secure with charms that safety other kings defend with arms they venus like could mars himself surprise and awe stern tyrants with their conquering eyes verses to the author in imitation of horaces ode on pindar by a divine applied to the marriage of his highness the prince of orange with ann princess royal of great britain who hopes to rival miltons flame with waxen pinions fondly flies his fall will give the sea a name while he attempts to reach the skies milton is like a flood whose tide swelled with tempestous deluge roars which from some lofty mountains side resistless foams and knows no shores with sacred laurels justly crowned whether in bold unfettered strains his towering muse the common bound superior to all rhyme disdains whether the realms of endless day he fill with wars and rude alarms or set in terrible array seraphic legions clad in arms aloft with all their forests thrown see hills from their foundations razed see angels hurled with vengeance down when the messiahs standard blazed or leads he to conubial bowers the newformd pair the teeming ground smiles with a wilderness of flowers diffusing gales of fragrance round lo adam with majestic mein for empire and command designed consumate beauty crowns his queen with dignity and sweetness joined while he the charming scene displays where innocence and pleasure reigned delighted with his sacred lays we hear it lost and feel it gained his lays inimitably fine with ecstasy each passion move when loud they trumpet war divine or softly warble human love o stephen this britannic swan surmounts the clouds with noble flight while i at distance only can admire him lessening to the sight as the poor be with endless toil to suck the thyme and blooming rose skims over richmonds fragrant soil thus i with pleasing pain compose you with a happy genius blessed in bolder strains shall nassau sing when anna by the graces dressed he to the nuptial dome shall bring anna enriched with various charms by the indulgent care of heaven than whom into his longing arms no greater treasure can be given not though with riches of the east at his command the ganges flow though with full empire he possessed whatever ambition wished below ye nereids with propitious gales the gilded vessel kindly aid let cupids fan the swelling sails and waft him to the royal maid this was written in october last when the prince was expected when thames with floating forests crowned leander safe arrived proclaims and of tumultuous joy the sound shall bid augusta rise in flames loud thunder bursting from her towers shall signalize the sacred day and transport to the belgic shores for blessings which they lent convey around while hymenaeals ring my voice to highest pitch i will raise thrice happy if i can but sing an humble ode to nassaus praise you soaring in heroic verse by native strength of wing upborn his godlike virtues shall rehearse and beauties which the bride adorn he in your lays shall finished rise for council or the embattled field immortals the contested prize to her superior charms shall yield then ravished with prophetic views succeeding glories shall presage and from the genial bed the muse raise princes to improve the age who bravely prodigal of blood shall prove that to set free mankind and conquer for the public good the race of nassau was designed thus great alcides poets feign by labors gained the seats above countries preserved and monsters slain assert the genuine son of jove the answer when i in feeble verse essayed nassau and annas praise a lyrick muse flew over my head and dropped a branch of bays i would have fixed it on my brow but phoebus said forbear it is vanity to touch the bough and sacrilege to wear give it the bard who boldly dares attempt the roman lyre who wisely checks but not impairs the towering pindars fire thus sir to you in phoebus name the laurel wreath i send and since the god denies me fame am glad it crowns my friend finis
