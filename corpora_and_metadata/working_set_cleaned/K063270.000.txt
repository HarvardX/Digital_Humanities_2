village politics  addressed to all the mechanics journeymen and day laborers in great britain  by will chip a country carpenter  manchester j harrop printer mdccxciii  village politics a dialouge between jack anvil the blacksmith and tom hod the mason  jack what is the matter tom why do look so dismal   tom dismal indeed well enough i may   jack what is the old mare dead or work scarce   tom no no works plenty enough if a man had but the heart to go to it   jack what book art reading why do look so like a hang dog   tom looking on his book cause enough why i find here that i am very unhappy and very miserable which i should never have known if i had not had the good luck to meet with this book o it is a precious book   jack a good sign though that you cannot find out youre unhappy without looking into a book for it what is the matter   tom matter why i want liberty   jack liberty what has any one fetched a warrant for thee come man cheer up i will be bound for thee  thou art an honest fellow in the main though thou do tipple and prate a little too much at the rose and crown   tom no no i want a new constitution   jack indeed why i thought thou had been a desperate healthy fellow send for the doctor then   tom i am not sick i want liberty and equality and the rights of man   jack o now i understand thee what thou art a leveller and a republican i warrant   tom i am a friend to the people i want a reform   jack then the shortest way is to mend thyself   tom but i want a general reform   jack then let every one mend one   tom pooh i want freedom and happiness the same as they have got in france   jack what tom we imitate them we follow the french why they only begun all this mischief at first in order to be just what we are already why i would sooner go to the negers to get learning or to the turks to get religion than to the french for freedom and happiness   tom what do you mean by that arnt the french free   jack free tom aye free with a witness they are all so free that there is nobody safe they make free to rob whom they will and kill whom they will if they dont like a mans looks they make free to hang him without judge or jury and the next lamppost does for the gallows so then they call themselves free because you see they have no king to take them up and hang them for it   tom ah but jack didnt their king formerly hang people for nothing too and besides wernt they all papists before the revolution   jack why true enough they had but a poor sort of religion but bad is better than none tom and so was the government bad enough too for they could clap an innocent man into prison and keep him there too as long as they would and never say with your leave or by your leave gentlemen of the jury but what is all that to us   tom to us why dont our governors put many of our poor folks in prison against their will what are all the jails for down with the jails i say all men should be free   jack harkee tom a few rogues in prison keep the rest in order and then honest men go about their business afraid of nobody that is the way to be free and let me tell thee tom thou and i are tried by our peers as much as a lord is why the king cannot send me to prison if i do no harm and if i do there is reason good why i should go there i may go to law with sir john at the great castle yonder and he no more dares lift his little finger against me than if i were his equal a lord is hanged for hanging matter as thou or i should be and if it will be any comfort to thee i myself remember a peer of the realm being hanged for killing his man just the same as the man would have been for killing him lord ferrers was hanged in    0 for killing his steward    tom well that is some comfort  but have you read the rights of man   jack no not i i had rather by half read the whole duty of man i have but little time for reading and such as i should therefore only read a bit of the best   tom dont tell me of those old fashioned notions why should not we have the same fine things they have got in france i am for a constitution and organization and equalization   jack do be quiet now tom only suppose this nonsensical equality was to take place why it would not last while one could say jack robinson or suppose it could  suppose in the general division our new rulers were to give us half an acre of ground apiece we could to be sure raise potatoes on it for the use of our families but as every other man would be equally busy in raising potatoes for his family why then you see if thou wast to break thy spade i should not be able to mend it neighbor snip would have no time to make us a suit of clothes nor the clothier to weave the cloth for all the world would be gone a digging and as to boots and shoes the want of some one to make them for us would be a greater grievance than the tax on leather if we should be sick there would be no doctors stuff for us for doctors would be digging too we could not get a chimney swept or a load of coal from pit for love or money   tom but still i should have no one over my head   jack that is a mistake i am stronger than thou and standish the exciseman is a better scholar so we should not remain equal a minute i should out fight thee and he would out wit thee and if such a sturdy fellow as i am was to come and break down thy hedge for a little firing or to take away the crop from thy ground i am not so sure that these newfangled laws would see thee righted i tell thee tom we have a fine constitution already and our forefathers thought so   tom they were a pack of fools and had never read the rights of man   jack i will tell thee a story when sir john married my lady who is a little fantastical and likes to do every thing like the french begged him to pull down yonder sine old castle and build it up in her frippery way no says sir john what shall i pull down this noble building raised by the wisdom of my brave ancestors which outstood the civil wars and only underwent a little needful repair at the revolution and which all my neighbors come to take a pattern by  shall i pull it all down i say only because there may be a dark closet or an inconvenient room or two in it my lady mumpt and grumbled but the castle was let stand and a glorious building it is though there may be a trifling fault or two and though a few decays may want stopping so now and then they mend a little thing and they will go on mending i dare say as they have leisure to the end of the chapter if they are let alone but no pullmedown works what is it you are crying out for tom   tom why for a perfect government   jack you might as well cry for the moon there is nothing perfect in this world take my word for it   tom i dont see why we are to work like slaves while others roll about in their coaches feed on the fat of the land and do nothing   jack my little maid brought home a storybook from the charityschool the other day in which was a bit of a fable about the belly and the limbs the hands said i will not work any longer to feed this lazy belly who sits in state like a lord and does nothing said the feet i will not walk and tire myself to carry him about let him shift for himself so said all the members just as your levellers and republicans do now and what was the consequence why the belly was pinched to be sure but the hands and the feet and the rest of the members suffered so much for want of their old nourishment that they fell sick pined away and would have died if they had not come to their senses just in time to save their lives as i hope all you will do   tom but the times  but the taxes jack   jack things are dear to be sure but riot and murder is not the way to make them cheap and taxes are high but i am told there is a deal of old scores paying off and by them who did not contract the debt neither tom besides things are mending i hope and what little is done is for us poor people our candles are somewhat cheaper and i dare say if the honest gentleman is not disturbed by you levellers things will mend every day but bear one thing in mind the more we riot the more we shall have to pay mind another thing too that in france the poor paid all the taxes as i have heard em say and the quality paid nothing   tom well i know what is what as well as another and i am as fit to govern    jack no tom no you are indeed as good as another man seeing you have hands to work and a soul to be saved but are all men fit for all kinds of things solomon says how can he be wise whose talk is of oxen every one in his way i am a better judge of a horseshoe than sir john but he has a deal better notion of state affairs than i and i can no more do without him than he can do without me and few are so poor but they may get a vote for a parliament man and so you see the poor have as much share in the government as they well know how to manage   tom but i say all men are equal why should one be above another   jack if that is thy talk tom thou do quarrel with providence and not with government for the woman is below her husband and the children are below their mother and the servant is below his master   tom but the subject is not below the king all kings are crowned ruffians and all governments are wicked for my part i am resolved i will pay no more taxes to any of them   jack tom tom this is thy nonsense if thou did go oftener to church thou would know where it is said render unto caesar the things that are cesars and also fear god honor the king your book tells you that we need obey no government but that of the people and that we may fashion and alter the government according to our whimsies but mine tells me let every one be subject to the higher powers for all power is of god the powers that be are ordained of god whosoever therefore resists the power resists the ordinance of god thou say thou will pay no taxes to any of them do thou know who it was that worked a miracle that he might have money to pay tribute with rather than set you and me an example of disobedience to government   tom i say we shall never be happy till we do as the french have done   jack the french and we contending for liberty tom is just as if thou and i were to pretend to run a race thou to set out from the starting post when i am in already why we have got it man we have no race to run we are there already our constitution is no more like what the french one was than a mug of our taunton beer is like a platter of their soupmaigre   tom i know we shall be undone if we dont get a new constitution  that is all   jack and i know we shall be undone if we do i dont know much about politics but i can see by a little what a great deal means now only to show thee the state of public credit as i think tim standish calls it there is farmer furrow a few years ago he had an odd  0l by him so to keep it out of harms way he put it out to use on government security i think he calls it well the other day he married one of his daughters so he thought he would give her that  0l for a bit of a portion tom as i am a living man when he went to take it out if his fifty pounds was not grown almost to an hundred and would have been a full hundred they say by this time if the gentleman had been let alone   tom well still as the old saying is  i should like to do as they do in france   jack what should like to be murdered with as little ceremony as hackabout the butcher knocks down a calf then for every little bit of tiff a man gets rid of his wife and as to liberty of conscience which they brag so much about why they have driven away their parsons aye and murdered many of em because they would not swear as they would have them and then they talk of liberty of the press why tom only the other day they hanged a man for printing a book against this pretty government of theirs   tom but you said yourself it was sad times in france before they pulled down the old government   jack well and suppose the french were as much in the right as i know them to be in the wrong what does that argue for us because neighbor furrow the other day pulled down a crazy old barn is that a reason why i must set fire to my tight cottage   tom i dont see why one man is to ride in his coach and six while another mends the highway for him   jack i dont see why the man in the coach is to drive over the man on foot or hurt a hair of his head and as to our great folks that you levellers have such a spite against i dont pretend to say they are a bit better than they should be but that is no affair of mine let them look to that they will answer for that in another place to be sure i wish they would set us a better example about going to church and those things but still hoardings not the sin of the age they dont lock up their money  away it goes and every bodys the better for it they do spend too much to be sure in feastings and fandangoes and if i was a parson i would go to work with em in another kind of a way but as i am only a poor tradesman why it is but bringing more grist to my mill it all comes among the people  their coaches and their furniture and their buildings and their planting employ a power of tradespeople and laborers  now in this village what should we do without the castle though my lady is too rantipolish and flies about all summer to hot water and cold water and fresh water and salt water when she ought to stay at home with sir john yet when she does come down she brings such a deal of gentry that i have more horses than i can shoe and my wife more linen than she can wash then all our grown children are servants in the family and rare wages they have got our little boys get something every day by weeding their gardens and the girls learn to sew and knit at sir johns expense who sends them all to school on a sunday   tom aye but there is not sir johns in every village   jack the mores the pity but there is other help twas but last year you broke your leg and was nine weeks in the bristol infirmary where you was taken as much care of as a lord and your family was maintained all the while by the parish no poorrates in france tom and here there is a matter of two million and a halt paid for them if it was but a little better managed   tom two million and a half   jack aye indeed not translated into tenpences as your french millions are but twenty good shillings to the pound but when this levelling comes about there will be no infirmaries no hospitals no charityschools no sundayschools where so many hundred thousand poor souls learn to read the word of god for nothing for who is to pay for them equality cannot afford it and those that may be willing will not be able   tom but we shall be one as good as another for all that   jack aye and bad will be the best but we must work as we do now and with this difference that no one will be able to pay us tom i have got the use of my limbs of my liberty of the laws and of my bible the two first i take to be my natural rights the two last my civil and religious these i take it are the true rights of man and all the rest is nothing but nonsense and madness and wickedness my cottage is my castle i sit down in it at night in peace and thankfulness and no man makes me afraid instead of indulging discontent because another is richer than i in this world for envy is at the bottom of your equality works i read my bible go to church and think of a treasure in heaven   tom aye but the french have got it in this world   jack it is all a lie tom sir johns butler says his master gets letters which say it is all a lie it is all murder and nakedness and hunger many of the poor soldiers fight without victuals and march without clothes these are your democrats tom   tom what then do think all the men on our sidewicked   jack no  not so neither  they have made fools of the most of you as i believe i judge no man tom i hate no man even republicans and levellers i hope will always enjoy the protection of our laws though i hope they will never be our lawmakers there is many true dissenters and there is hollow churchmen and a good man is a good man whether his church has got a steeple to it or not the new fashioned way of proving ones religion is to hate somebody now though some folks pretend that a mans hating a papist or a presbyterian proves him to be a good churchman it dont prove him to be a good christian tom as much as i hate republican works i would scorn to live in a country where there is not liberty of conscience and where every man might not worship god his own way now that they had not in france the bible was shut up in an unknown heathenish tongue while here thou and i can make as free use of ours as a bishop can no more be sent to prison unjustly than a judge and are as much taken care of by the laws as the parliament man who makes them and this levelling makes people so dismal these poor french fellows used to be the merriest dogs in the world but since equality came in i dont believe a frenchman has ever laughed   tom what then do thou take french liberty to be   jack to murder more men in one night than ever there poor king did in his whole life   tom and what do thou take a democrat to be   jack one who likes to be governed by a thousand tyrants and yet cannot bear a king   tom what is equality   jack for every man to pull down every one that is above him till they are all as low as the lowest   tom what is the new rights of man   jack battle murder and sudden death   tom what is it to be an enlightened people   jack to put out the light of the gospel confound right and wrong and grope about in pitch darkness   tom what is philosophy that tim standish talks so much about   jack to believe that there is neither god nor devil nor heaven nor hell  to dig up a wicked old fellows voltaire rotton bones whose books sir john says have been the ruin of thousands and to set his figure up in a church and worship him   tom and what mean the other hard words that tim talks about  organization and function and civism and incivism and equalization and inviolability and imperscriptible   jack nonsense gibberish downright hocuspocus i know it is not english sir john says it is not latin and his valet de sham says it is not french neither   tom and yet tim says he shall never be happy till all these fine things are brought over to england   jack what into this christian country tom why do know they have no sabbath their mob parliament meets of a sunday to do their wicked work as naturally as we do go to church they have renounced gods word and gods day and they dont even date in the year of our lord why do turn pale man and the rogues are always making such a noise tom in the midst of their parliament house that their speaker rings a bell like our pennypostman because he cannot keep them in order   tom and do thou think our rights of man will lead to all this wickedness   jack as sure as eggs are eggs   tom i begin to think we are better off as we are   jack i am sure on it this is only a scheme to make us go back in every thing it is making ourselves poor when we are getting rich   tom i begin to think i am not so very unhappy as i had got to fancy   jack tom i dont care for drink myself but thou do and i will argue with thee in thy own way when there is all equality there will be no superfluity when there is no wages therell be no drink and levelling will rob thee of thy ale more than the malttax does   tom but standish says if we had a good government thered be no want of any thing   jack he is like many others who take the kings money and betray him though i am no scholar i know that a good government is a good thing but dont go to make me believe that any government can make a bad man good or a discontented man happy  what art musing upon man   tom let me sum up the evidence as they say at sizes  hem to cut every mans throat who does not think as i do or hang him up at a lamppost  pretend liberty of conscience and then banish the parsons only for being conscientious  cry out liberty of the press and hang up the first man who writes his mind  lose our poor laws  lose ones wife perhaps upon every little tiff  march without clothes and fight without victuals  no trade  no bible  no sabbath nor day of rest  no safety no comfort no peace in this world  and no world to come  jack i never knew thee tell a lie in my life   jack nor would i now not even against the french   tom and thou art very sure we are not ruined   jack i will tell thee how we are ruined we have a king so loving that he woudd not hurt the people if he could and so kept in that he could not hurt the people if he would we have as much liberty as can make us happy and more trade and riches than allows us to be good we have the best laws in the world if they were more strictly enforced and the best religion in the world if it was but better followed while old england is safe i will glory in her and pray for her and when she is in danger i will fight for her and die for her   tom and so will i too jack that is what i will  sings o the roast beef of old england  jack thou art an honest fellow tom   tom this is rose and crown night and tim standish is now at his mischief but well go and put an end to that fellows work   jack come along   tom no first i will stay to burn my book and then i will go and make a bonfire and    jack hold tom there is but one thing worse than a bitter enemy and that is an imprudent friend if thou would show thy love to thy king and country let us have no drinking no riot no bonfires but put in practice this text which our parson preached on last sunday study to be quiet work with your own hands and mind your own business   tom and so i will jack  come on   the end
