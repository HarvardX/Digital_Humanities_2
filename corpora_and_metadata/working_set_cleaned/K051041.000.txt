an essay on ordinary fevers  and the methods to be used to prevent their becoming so grievous and mortal as they are often found to be  in three parts  by john curry m d  rationalem quidem puto medecinam esse debere instrui vero ab evidentibus causis obscuris omnibus non a cogitatione artificis sed ab art ipsa rejectis  cells london printed for j robinson at the golden lion in ludgate street and sold by the other booksellers and publishers of london and westminster mdccxliii  the introduction it has been observed that fevers have always been more frequent and done more general mischief than any other disorders whatsoever that they have often produced grievous and fatal effects even when they have arisen from accidents seemingly not dangerous and that far from being confined to the infirm and valetudinary they are most apt to seize upon and destroy bodies that are young vigorous and sound  these observations have long since induced me to endeavor to point out some means easy and intelligible to the generality of people to prevent at least in some measure so great an evil and i have fixed upon those as the most probable and authentic which are mentioned in the following essay for in making choice of them i have not been influenced by any hypothetical reasoning how plausible soever but i have proceeded solely upon the sure footing of such observations of physicians as have been confirmed by long and accurate experience and handed down to us through many succeeding ages  i have likewise subjoined a short and plain account of the production of the symptoms of fevers as evidently deduced from experience and observation which account perhaps i shall hereafter attempt to illustrate and enlarge but i should be much better pleased to find some abler person excited by

rigors that commonly introduce fevers page  0             an assay on ordinary fevers etc part i of the causes by which ordinary fevers are often made grievous and mortal i what medecin p     celsus has insinuated concerning chronic diseases is in some respects applicable to those that are called acute viz that they are seldom mortal in their own nature and that if a phisitians advice is followed from their beginning hardly any dye of them unless through his fault  ii for the first attacks of fevers even of such as are most dangerous are generally so light that people are apt to persuade themselves that they can easily get rid of them without the pain of confinement or a strict regimen and therefore many are seen walking abroad for some days with the sickness upon them every hour increasing and when they are at length forced to lie down under the burden which they find themselves unable to shake off they often think they act a prudent part in delivering themselves up to the management of persons who through a fatal and too common mistake are deemed able and honest enough to cure every slight feverish disorder  iii and in this sense it is strictly true that many ordinary fevers have been made grievous and mortal which if rightly handled in the beginning would not have been attended with any considerable prejudice  iv there is likewise some reason to suspect that the commonlyreceived opinion of the nature of these diseases has a tendency to retard and sometimes absolutely to hinder their cure the opinion i mean is that a fever is excited by a foulness or distemperature in the blood which is for that reason called the febrile matter that this disorder itself is a kind of instrument which nature makes use of to clear the blood of that foulness that as vid etmull de feb p     bagliv prax p     in the depuration of wine and other fermentative liquors a certain number of days is necessary for carrying on and completing this salutary work and therefore that we ought not to think of removing this febrile matter in the beginning of the sickness while it is yet crude nor until such time as by some particular signs it shall be found so attenuated and concocted as to be fit for what is called a critical expulsion out of the body  v this opinion i say seems to be attended with no small danger on account among other things of the delay and inaction which it necessarily implys on the part of the physician and i know not any vid bagl prax and epist ad andry archb pitcairn diss de opera quam pressed corpa acida vel alcal etc evacuation whatsoever bleeding itself not excepted which according to it can with safety be advised in the beginning of fevers or even until the signs of coction appear in them for as before this time no separation is made of the pretended morbid humors from the sound bleeding and every other evacuation that is then put in practice must indiscriminately take away both and perhaps more of the treasure of life than of the cause of the disease and when the signs of cognoscitur coctio i0 quiet morbi ejusque decremento etc boerh inst coction have once appeared every arteficial evacuation is generally speaking useless if not hurtful for when nature has of herself done so much toward a cure in this or any other disorder as to have brought about those appearances by which the coction of the humors is said to be known she seldom or never stands in need of the assistance of art to enable her to complete it  vi but the truth is that this opinion had its rise in the very infancy of physic when physicians were rather observers than assistants of nature which latter however they afterward became in an eminent degree by means chiefly of such observation and hence it was that few or no medecines were then prescribed by them in these or any other disorders  vii if what we are told concerning putrid fevers and the morbific matter in them be true viz that they consist as method    galen affirms in a change of the whole body into corruption or as modern physicians more cautiously express it that they are caused by an alkalescence or degree of putrefaction in the mass of blood the case of those who are sick of them must be very deplorable for to omit other reasons such a state of the blood can be amended by no other medecines but a sufficient quantity of acids intimately mixed and blended with it but this cannot be done by acids given in the usual way for it is known by vid boil apud pitcair diss de opera quam pressed etc arbuth on aliments experience that all acid vegetables are very much altered in the stomach and guts and that they are even made alkalescent before they are received into the blood and it is highly probable that no mineral acids can be admitted through the mouths of the lacteal vessels  viii and such shocking ideas of any distemper when entertained by the sick are apt to make it though light in its own nature both grievous and mortal for barth in act haffn vol   obs    great anxiety of mind has often produced dangerous and malignant fevers in bodies that were otherwise sound and bag p     hodg de pest p     writers of good credit assure us that in the beginning of the plague itself numbers have been seized with that disease and dyed of it who contracted it rather through fear of so great an evil than by any contagion  ix from the critical evacuations in fevers having very often a strong fetid smell and other signs of corruption in them it has been generally concluded that they must necessarily have been derived from an infected source and that the same morbid state of the whole mass of humors must therefore have given rise to these distempers but it may be as well infered that an harsh illscented perspiration to which many people enjoying good health are subject can be thought to show that the blood of such people is in a state of putrefaction or that their bodies are infected with putrid fevers gouraigne de feb p     if a vein be opened in these diseases while the most faetid sweat is ouzing through the pores of the skin there shall not be found the least disagreeable smell or taste in the blood that is drawn and therefore all that can be concluded from the abovementioned evacuations is that as the matter of them is always obstructed or otherwise altered in the emunctorys themselves vid de gorter de secret hum a sanguine which may happen many different ways they must necessarily have something preternatural in them without implying at the same time any original impurity or corruption in the mass of blood from whence they were derived  x the humors that are critically cast forth in the decline of fevers says the juditious b sydenham on this occasion are no doubt vicious although the blood was before pure but this is not more to be wondered at than that some part of our food is made corrupt and faetid after having undergone a considerable change in the body and been separated from the rest  xi upon the whole the notion of a febrile matter has not always been so universally entertained by physicians de febrib p  0 as some would have us believe for we learn from medecin p     celsus that aesclepiades who had many followers seemed to show no regard to it in the cure of fevers and many eminent physicians says de praesag vit and mor p     prosper alpinus have maintained that good and profitable evacuations have happened in these diseases before the signs of coction appeared in them as for putrid fevers trallian expressly de feb p         vid forest de feb p    fernel p     assures us that it was the opinion of several among the ancients that they do not arise from the corruption of any other humors but those that are contained in the stomach and guts and that the vital juices cannot be the subject of putrefaction in these cases and de feb p  0 sydenham among the moderns does not scruple to affirm that fevers happen more frequently without the concurrence of any vicious particles in the blood than otherwise  xii i must observe here that it was a point agreed upon by all the vid part the  d of this essay ancient physicians that diary fevers are not excited by any peccant matter inherent in the blood or humors and that they were accordingly cured by them in a very short time and by the simplest methods but although these fevers were formerly accounted harmless and in their own nature indeed they are so yet we now often see them made griveous and mortal by ignorance and neglect for it is my design to show hereafter that the fevers which nowadays do so much mischief among us for the most part arise from the same causes and are of the same nature with the diary in their beginning  xiii and it may be no improper introduction to this design to take notice beforehand of that dangerous custom so prevalent of late though contrary to the sentiments of the best physicians of bleeding purging and vomiting in the beginning of all fevers without distinction for although these remedys when administered with judgment are of the greatest service to the sick yet nothing is more certain than that an improper application of any of them may make nature nihil mirum si frequenter observamus aegros post ordinatam plebotomiam interire statim  idemque succedere post imprudenter praescriptum catharticum bagliv p    sink under a disease which if left to herself she might have easily overcome  xiv thoner obs p    willis bleeding has been known to have kindled fevers in bodies which before they had undergone that operation had not the least disposition to them and the writings both of ancient and modern physicians are full of the strictest cautions against opening a vein in some fevers which impudent pretenders frequently undertake to cure by profuse bloodletting apud prosp mart in hyp p     vid ramaz dissert  da de constut an      hyppocrates was so far from thinking bleeding necessary in all fevers that he expressly forbids it in some other disorders on account of their having fevers joined with them  xv when in the beginning of these diseases the body is known to abound in blood when its veins are turgid and its surface red and inflamed and when the brain or any other viscus is threatened or attacked by this fullness and no spontaneous hemorage ensues then indeed large and sometimes repeated bleeding is not only safe but necessary but when on the contrary these distempers happen to persons already weakend by excessive labor too frequent venery or great evacuations or when from being intermitting they become acute and continual in such cases i say bleeding has been often found pernicious and always will be so  xvi hyp aphor    sect   the giving of purgative medicines in the beginning of fevers has been generally forbidden by physicians since the days of hyppocrates down to our own times yet nothing is more common than to transgress this established rule on the most frivolous pretenses and they who do so never confider that as such medicines are always apt to increase the already too frequent vid bagl epist ad andry and alios oscillations of the solids they bid much fairer to augment than diminish these disorders and their symptoms there is no question but that sharp indigested humors in the guts often produce fevers which must cease as soon as these causes have been removed but it is equally certain that this does not happen as often as it is pretended and that when it does happen such fevers do not require or even admit of cathartics for their cure the following extraordinary case and the observations naturally arising therefrom may serve to put this matter in a clearer light  xvii in the year      a man of about fifty was brought to the charitable infirmary on the insquay dublin with a tumor in his groin which in due time and by proper applications came to suppuration he had complained for some time before he was taken in there of an uneasiness and shooting pain in the part affected but of no other sickness however when this tumor was opened some bones of a chickensneck were extracted from it by which and the patients own confession it appeared that he had some weeks before hastily swallowed down these bones unchewed and that they had gradually vid anton beniven obs cap  0 joan lang epist  0 lib   alex benedict hist human corp cap    lib   forced themselves a passage through the intestine and the parts about it into his groin this man eat and slept well when i saw him and he had done so from the very beginning of his complaint as he himself avered and while in the infirmary he was free from every feverish symptom except what the suppuration of his tumor naturally occasioned of this i was assured by mr francis duany one of the surgeons of that infirmary who had often visited him while he was there and by whom i saw some of these bones taken out entire with great dexterity mr duany likewise informed me that mr kelly in his turn of visiting had also extracted from this person some bones of the same kind  xviii now if an irritation of the intestines which was so great that it at length destroyed part of their substance did not produce any considerable fever which as i have said is indeed an extraordinary case may it not easily happen that the so much feebler stimulus of indigested humors on these parts may be often hindered by the mucus which defends them from having any such effect and as in case a fever had ensued from that great irritation an attempt to carry off these bones by a stimulating purge would in all probability have increased the evil vid bagliv boerhaave hoffman and alios passim it being the only safe method in such cases as when fragments of glass needles or corrosive poisons have been swallowed to plye the patient with a sufficient quantity of such liquids only as are fit to soften relax and lubricate his contracted intestines so whenever sharp cruditys in the stomach or guts have occasioned a fever and it is therefore necessary to empty these parts we should have recourse to no other remedys for that purpose but such as are lenient and diluting and as free as possible from any irritating quality thus p     tralian in the cure of such fevers does not once mention emetic or purgative medicines but advises the digesting and washing away of these cruditys with plentiful draughts of warm water only and a more excellent remedy adds he i know not for those who being of an hot temperament fall into diary fevers from such a cause  xix in like manner when the rigors that commonly introduce fevers are caused as they often are by bilious humors lying in the stomach and a vomit is therefore wanting to discharge them medecin p     celsus directs nothing else for that end but warm water seasoned with a little salt and as the caution of the ancients in these particulars was wise and worthy of imitation so is the rashness of some modern practitioners as much to be dreaded and avoided for there is much oftener than is vulgarly imagined an frederic hoff dissert de inflam ventric inflammation of the stomach in these disorders and so very latent this inflammation sometimes is that it is with difficulty discovered even by the most thinking and experienced profecto veteranus hic habet quod timeat medicus rega de consens part p     and vomiting medicines to an inflamed stomach are certainly pernicious it has been besides wintringh comment noso p     observed that vomits when given in such fevers as in a particular manner attack the head have often produced fatal symptoms in the course of the sickness on account of that fullness and concussion of the vessels of the brain which they always occasion  xx but if bleeding purging and vomiting in the beginning of all fevers without distinction have often done mischief there is not less to be feared from the too dilatory practice of those who as we have already observed have nothing else in view in the cure of these distempers but the gradual correction or distant expulsion of some preconceived foulness of the blood or humors for while such are waiting for the imaginary coction of a febrile matter they are frequently suffering the real cause of the disease to take such deep root in some of the noble parts that it cannot perhaps be afterward removed from thence by any efforts of nature or art  part ii of the sentiments of ancient and modern physicians concerning ordinary fevers and the methods to be used to prevent their becoming grievous and mortal i by ordinary fevers i understand such as happen to the body when otherwise sound and in health from outward or sensible causes as from the taking of cold excesses in eating or drinking immoderate exercise of body or mind the suppression of some usual discharge and the like the sentiments of ancient and modern physicians concerning the nature of these fevers and their events are briefly as follow  ii vid gal de feb ephem and alios omnes all fevers proceeding merely from outward or sensible causes are in their own nature simply diary so called from their commonly ending or declining on the first day although they are sometimes prolonged to the second or third  iii id ibid etc diary fevers are not excited by any peccant matter preexisting in the blood yet they for the most part dolaeus p   0 precede other fevers and id ibid differ from them chiefly by the mildness of their symptoms and causes insomuch that the fernel p         same causes which when light produce only diary fevers will when more violent occasion such as are often dangerous and fatal  iv vid galen and alios passim diary fevers are harmless in their own nature and never become griveous or mortal until by ignorance mismanagement or neglect they have been first changed into such as are known by the name of putrid hectic malignant or the like  v vid fernel p     lom obs p   etc when a diary fever is made by improper treatment ignorance or neglect to exceed the term of three days it degenerates into a fever of a worse kind as likewise when it seems to decline without sweat or some dewy moisture on the skin  vi a diary fever then chiefly turns into that which is called putrid when the proper occasion of opening the pores of the skin has been neglected  vii that diary fevers are capable of being changed into such as are very malignant appears among many other instances from the sweatingsickness that prevailed in england in      for although this sickness was called and in itself was no other but the british diary fever yet by mead discourse on pestil contag mismanagement in stopping the sweats it became very griveous and did great mischief de sud angl lib   cap    sennertus informs us that scarce one patient out of an hundred was recovered from it  viii as the diary fever often gal   ad glauc c   lom obs p   etc does mischief before it is known and that chiefly because it is not known it may not be amiss to transcribe an history of it from forestus wherein he gives us the rise progress and cure of it in his own person  ix de feb diar fol   going to see a patient says he that lay at some distance from me in a very cold and windy season the pores of my skin were closed by the sharpness of the weather and i fell ill of a diary fever it seized me about eleven oclock in the morning not with a shuddering but with a coldness that seemed to have pierced my skin and muscles but after i had placed myself by a good fire i begun to be a little heated without thirst and my pulse became quicker but was equal about four in the afternoon a moisture came through my skin and i grew better as i had taken no nourishment through the whole day i then refreshed myself with a little ale in which a small quantity of sugar and butter was boiled and about six i went into a warm bed where covering myself up i begun to sweat nevertheless about two hours after having felt such a pain in my stomach as had like to have made me faint i took some pearlsugar by which means i came again to myself and my pain and anxiety vanished then i fell into a sweet sleep in which i past the whole night and a copious vaporose sweat exhaled from the lower parts of my body in the morning when i found myself entirely free from the fever i ordered the sweat to be wiped off having first used long and gentle friction to open the pores of my skin  x it has been already observed that diary fevers differ from others only in degree and as the proceeding from outward or sensible causes is so distinguishing a mark of them that de feb ephesians forest fol   fernelius and others tell us even putrid fevers when occasioned by such causes are necessarily preceded by them it follows that vid fernel p     lom obs p   whenever we find ourselves all at once seized with any of the lighter symptoms of a fever as with a small rigor or coldness to which an unusual heat headache pain in the stomach or other sickness attended with a quick pulse succeeds and are at the same time sensible that these symptoms have arisen from some outward or evident cause we may safely conclude that fever to be simply diary to which however a proper remedy should be immediately applied because when these disorders light as they are in their own nature have been neglected but a few days and the symptoms abovementioned have been all along felt gradually increasing it is to be feared that they are no longer diary but that they have degenerated into other fevers of much greater danger and duration  xi the method of cure used by vid dodon prax p   and alios passim galen and the ancient physicians in general in diary fevers was besides a spare and regular diet no other but that of relaxing the surface of the body and opening the perspiratory or surdorific pores and although this was done chiefly by external applications such as baths of warm water friction and unction yet inward means were sometimes found proper for the same end according to the nature and exigence of the particular cause thus cassius the most ingenious physician of our age says praef medic p    celsus cured a person of a fever which was got by drinking too much wine and attended with great thirst by giving him large draughts of cold water and thereby putting him into a sweat and making him sleep  xii the same author medecin p     informs us that among the ancients before the days of herophilus and erasistratus and very soon after those of hyppocrates there was one petron who when he undertook to cure any one of a fever covered him up with a large quantity of clothes in order to excite a great heat and thirst in him and afterward when his fever begun to be a little abated he gave him cold water to drink by which means if he made him sweat he thought he had extricated him from all danger  xiii nor are the objections commonly raised against the promoting of sweat in the beginning of fevers of any force here for vid de gort med comp p     and alios passim such sudorifics only are in this case forbidden by physicians as are apt to stimulate the fibers too much and thereby increase the causes of these distempers whereas those things which procure that evacuation by relaxing the solids and by thining and diluting the humors are allowed to do great service in the beginning and every other period of these diseases  xiv and it is no doubt from frequent and successful experience grounded on this maxim that people are generally so fond of sweating in the beginning of all fevers and indeed this method when not abused by hot and inflaming medecines as it too often is may be supported by the authority of several eminent physicians de morb acut infant p    doctor harris observes that in the first infults of fevers when the sensible or insensible perspiration is much obstructed sweats whether natural or procured by art are very beneficial doctor sup to anim aecon bryan robinson has mentioned some fevers in which a constant gentle sweat in the beginning is of much use and he says that it often cures them in a little time  xv i have frequently seen says de feb p     doctor frederic hoffman poor laboring people who had been seized with fevers by being exposed to the injurys of the weather safely and speedily cured by means of a sweat which was excited with warm draughts of the decoction of scabiouse and blessed thistle in equal quantitys of wine and water and river obs com p     another author assures us that in fevers from the same cause he has found nothing more successful than after having first opened a vein to relax the surface of the body by a sudorific decoction and my success in this particular adds he has brought over several physicians to approve of my method who before never thought of giving sudorifics in such cases  xvi i must add that even pestilential fevers have been cured by promoting sweat from their beginning as de pest p     and alibi diemoerbrock de pest p   bar and others testify from their own experience and sydenham affirms that after he had begun to follow that method closely in the pestilential fever of      at london he did not lose one patient out of all those he attended in that terrible distemper  xvii but the danger of using vid sydenh de feb p    strong sudorifics in the beginning of fevers cannot be too often nor too strictly cautioned against of this danger obs p     doctor harris has given us a notable instance in a very distinguished personage he tells us that mary queen of england had once acquainted him in conversation that she was accustomed by the advice of the famous doctor lower then sometime dead to take about bedtime time a pretty large dose of the treacle of andromachus in order to promote sweat as often as she found herself inclined to a fever and although this conversation happened two years before the appearance of the smallpox of which she dyed and doctor harris had given her all the necessary precautions against the use of that medecin yet so great was her confidence in the advice of her former physician that afterward on the very night in which she fell ill of that disease she had recourse to her dose of treacle which not having its usual effect of making her sweat althought it was repeated next morning in a double quantity put her humors into so great a ferment that when the smallpox appeared it was attended with a spitting of blood purple spots and other such desperate symptoms that she dyed of it in a very few days  xviii from this passage however it is manifest that doctor lower thought sweating at the beginning of fevers the best method to prevent their increase and that the royal patient had before experienced the good effects of that method  xix the famous apheris           boerhaave after having warned us against the use of hot stimulating things to remove that coldness and rigor which are felt at the beginning of fevers acquaints us that if instead of these we have immediate recourse to draughts of warm water with which a little nitre wine and honey are mixed and to bathing fomenting and washing with the same that rigor and coldness will happily cease and all the worst symptoms of these distempers be speedily prevented  xx doctor suppl to anim aeconom bryan robinson promotes sweat in the beginning of some fevers by means that are not attended with any danger to grown persons laboring under this disease he gives a dram of the testaceous powders in three or four ounces of cold water every third or fourth hour and to children five or six years old he gives half the quantity of powders in half the quantity of water adding this precaution that persons thus treated ought to be bled and vomited before they begin the use of the powders and he proposes this method not only in the beginning of colds and slight fevers but also in high inflammatory fevers in young bodies  xxi the sudorifics says doctor de morb infant p       harris which are the use in the beginning of fevers ought to be mild and temperate not dry spirituous things taken from the apothecaryes shop but liquid and simple such the kitchen affords things which by their quantity will yield copious matter to the sweats and call them forth not by any innate heat but by external and acquired warmth  xxii it was no doubt by causing an easy and general relaxation of the surface of the body that baths of warm water anciently acquired the universal character of being a certain cure in diary fevers for perspiration from bathing in warm water has been observed by medecin stat brittan p       keil to arise to the quantity of a pound and an half in the space of an hour and there is this further advantage in perspiration thus caused above that which is promoted by exercise and motion that the large evacuation in the former case does not lessen the usual perspiration in the subsequent hours as it always does in the latter de feb p     trallian advises those who labor under a causus or burning fever to have themselves bathed all over in warm water and de medec egypt p     prosper alpinus not only gives the same advice in fevers that are called putrid but he likewise informs us that the best physicians among the ancients made use of this remedy in almost all kinds of fevers  xxiii i shall conclude this head with a passage from celsus relating chiefly to diet wherein are directions to prevent the increase of fevers from their beginning given with such exactness and promised certainty that they very well deserve to be transcribed at large  if any signs of approaching illness appear says that de medecin p     excellent writer the best of all remedys are quiet and abstinence if the person indisposed must drink let him drink water and generally speaking it will be sufficient for him to keep to that drink for one day sometimes if the symptoms still remain it will be necessary to continue it for two next to abstinence a very spare diet is proper with which water must be drunk one day and wine the next and so on until all cause of fear is removed by these means an heavy and iminent disease is often prevented and many are deceived who think to put of a beginning sickness by exercise or bathing or purging or vomiting or sweating or the use of wine on the first day of its appearance not that these things have not sometimes a good effect but because they are oftener attended with a bad one while abstinence alone cures without any danger for it may be lessened or increased according to the degree of the sickness insomuch that if the symptoms be light it will suffice to abstain from wine only the disuse of which in this case will be of more service to the sick than lessening the quantity of his food can be and although his complaints should be somewhat greater it will be enough to forbid him the use of flesh in his diet and to confine him to the drinking of water sometimes indeed it will be necessary to allow him less even of bread than usual and to tie him down to a moist herbdiet and should even the signs of a violent distemper treaten him it will be sufficient to abstain entirely from food the use of wine and all motion of the body nor is it at all to be doubted that scarce any one has fallen into an heavy fit of sickness who has seriously and in time taken those methods to prevent it  xxiv i must observe by the way that when celsus acquaints us that many are deceived who think to put off a beginning sickness by bathing or sweating etc he ought to be presumed to mean those pople who place their entire confidence in such methods without having at the same time any regard to abstinence and quiet  part iii of the production of the symptoms of ordinary fevers as evidently deduced from experience and observation although vid de gort de feb it be extremely difficult to give an exact definition of the nature of fevers on account of the great variety of their causes and symptoms yet we are sure to find in all bodies affected with them a sickness that is generally brought oh by a coldness and shuddering to which a burning heat succeeds and lastly a sweat breaks forth by which an end is put to all the symptoms  and it is plain from vid fred hoffn de feb the dryness and contraction of the external parts of the body in the beginning of these distempers from the smallness of the pulse the coldness of the hands and feet and the subsiding of the vessels in them from the breathing difficult and the feeling of blood as it were boil about the praecordia from all these things i say happening in the beginning of fevers it is plain id ibid that the vital fluids are then first driven from the surface of the body into the internal large vessels and toward the heart and that these fluids are afterward by the increased contraction of the heart and arterys swiftly and forceably pushed outward into the narrower vessels until such time as by the removal of the spasms the usual secretions return and the fever ceases  this retrograde motion of the vital fluids from the constringed surface of the body into its center has been long since discovered and accurately described by hypp foes lib de flat fol     hyppocrates himself for treating of the beginning of fevers he tells us that the blood then creeps over the whole body and runs together into its warmest parts  but when continues he the blood has forsaken the extremitys the bowels and the flesh tremble for some parts of the body are replenished with a great quantity of blood and others are left bloodless and those parts which the blood has forsaken cannot rest through cold but are shaken and those parts which are filled with a great quantity of blood tremble on account of that fullness and inflammations are excited in them  a remarkable instance of the great power of the constriction of the surface in repelling whatever is therein contained into the larger cavitys of the body we find in prax p     baglivi who informs us that when he had opened a very strong man who had dyed of a fever that begun with violent rigors succeeded by convulsions almost all the fat which had layn toward his skin was by the great contractions of the external fibers driven inwards to the center and that in such quantity and so dissolved that his lax and flaccid intestines were found swimming in it  from hence it follows that the first apparent symptom of a fever is a constriction coldness rigor or trembling in the surface of the body which by driving the blood in great quantity from thence into the inner and larger vessels and thereby preternaturaly distending them is the retrogrado enim in febrium initio and morante sanguine in

all the other griveances that commonly attend this disease boerh aph     thus the greater the coldness or rigor is at the beginning of fevers the more dangerous always are these distempers and the coldness which ushers in the plague is generally greatest thus likewise whatever occasions a considerable and lasting constriction of the surface of the body as fred hoff de aqu min vid gal meth med lib   cap   bathing in waters that are too hot or astringent is apt to produce fevers of all sorts and on the other hand whatever brings about an early removal of this rigor or constriction and thereby promotes an easy and universal moisture of the skin will as we have already shown at large in the second part of this essay speedily prevent all the worst symptoms of those disorders  the truth of this reasoning is further confirmed by the prognostic signs that are observed both in bodies recovering from these distempers and in those that are dying of them for as to the first experience and observation have always shown us that no fevers are completely cured until the skin from being dry and contracted becomes all over vid etmull de feb p     and alios soft relaxed and moist and as to the second it is well known that the continuance and increase of the contraction of the skin in the decline of these disorders which vid hypp praen coac celf med p    cold extremitys the temples collapsed the nose sharpened the eyes sunk and the drying up of issues and ulcers plainly indicate are but too often the certain forerunners of death  and the reason of these prognostics is very evident and naturally flows from the idea we have given of fevers for as the sick then only recover from them when by the removal of the spasms in the superficial parts of the body a free passage is again opened to the humors that way from the overloaded viscera as in a complete and salutary crisis so by a too long continuance or great increase of these spasms and by the morbid fullness and distension of the parts within consequent thereto the heart and brain must at length be entirely disabled from performing those functions on which the lives of all animals do absolutely depend for this reason it is that the sick are in lom obs p   great danger in continual fevers when after a rigor or shuddering they do not grow warm hence likewise those who dye of intermitting fevers commonly expire in the cold fit and in all dead bodies the right ventricle of the heart is found very much distended with blood  from what has been said it follows that crudity in fevers so much talked of and so little understood is in truth nothing else but an vid heq de purg med p  0  irregular and devious motion of the vital fluids from the constringed surface of the body into the viscera causing such a fullness and distension in them as are apt to produce the usual symptoms of these distempers and that their crisis therefore consists not in the expulsion of any morbisic matter out of the body but only in the removal of that constriction of the surface and in an opportunity thereby given to nature to restore to the vital juices their due and regular motion through all their usual channels wherefore the evacuations commonly happening in this period of fevers ought to be looked upon merely as the effects of that general relaxation of the solids which then always ensues and to be helpful to the sick in no other manner but by taking off that extraordinary fullness in the bowels from whence all their complaints arose  and although when these diseases are left to themselves and art does not interfere with them these evacuations for the most part happen on certain days which are therefore distinguished by the name of critical yet we often find the matter otherwise when proper remedys have been administered from the beginning in order to put a stop to them for which reason vid etmul fol     helmont de feb cap xi modern physicians pay not altogether so scrupulous a regard to those days as the ancients have done who were more employed in observing the progress and changes of distempers than in applying medecines for their cure thus we have already shown from the concurring testimonys of the best physicians that an end may be put to ordinary fevers on the first or second day of their appearance though neither of these days was ever accounted critical  in this manner may be explained both the symptoms and events of ordinary fevers as arising solely from a preternatural change in the solid parts of the body and without having recourse to hypothetical conjectures of their being caused by any acrimonious impuritys in the blood itself for it is highly probable that no such impuritys can be admitted through the extremely small and delicate orifices of the lacteal vessels and that as well on account of the great irritability of these orifices which the contact of every thing that is acrimonious must immediately close as likewise because these vessels are formed only for the reception of such a liquor as may contribute to the nourishment and preservation of the animal or at least is not destructive of it thus we says de purg mdec hequet that a sower chyle is always refused by them and cast out of the body in loose stools or if any such impuritys wrapped up perhaps in smooch chyle should be suffered to pass through these vessels into the blood nature has provided various outlets to discharge them by and more superfluitys of any kind than can be readily discharged by these outlets it is not reasonable to think she will receive  in the progress of fevers indeed when by means of the spasms in the surface obstructions have been already formed in the bowels and the usual secretions have been stopped the blood may become too thick or otherwise impure as slowmoving or stagnating waters may be foul and corrupted id ibid but as this happens only secundarily and by accident it ought to be considered in these distempers meetly as a symptom but never as a cause thus it has been observed that fevers frequently happen to bodies vid syd de feb whose humors are pure though these humors may be afterward tainted in the course of the sickness and it has been always remarked that vid lom obs p   and alio putrid fevers themselves are most incident to persons of a found laudable and wellconditioned blood  that the tenacity of the blood in these diseases is in truth nothing more than the effect of those rigors at the beginning of them which slacken and obstruct its motion in the superficial parts of the body appears i think from hence that if blood be drawn during those rigors it shall be found so thick and tenacious as to pass with difficulty through the orifice that is made in the vein but it will be much thiner and come out with greater freedom if it be drawn either sometime before those rigors have been felt or when they are abated  and in general the appearances of blood drawn in these and other distempers are so various and uncertain that a prudent physician will hardly lay any stress upon them in choosing his method of cure prax p     baglivi has observed that almost all those have been recovered from acute diseases whose blood when drawn was covered with a white and chylous crust which however is vulgarly looked upon as a mark of bad and even corrupted blood and therapeut p     frederic hoffman informs us that he has often seen blood taken from scorbutical and hectical people that was elegantly red and fluid while that which had been drawn from sound and healthy persons was thick black and glutinous and i have observed id ibid continues he blood to flow from arterys opened in a virulent cancer which was fluid of a fine red color and in all appearance without fault de sang miss ballonius affirms that impure blood has been taken from many whose inward parts appeared after death to have been sound and that pure blood has been drawn from others whose lungs and bowels have been found to be rotten  all attempts therefore to cure fevers by directly attenuating the blood or by correcting or expelling any morbific matter supposed to be in it must be vain and fruitless inasmuch as they are levelled not at the causes but merely at the effects of these disorders and indeed that the rectifying of the solid parts of the body ought to be the phisitians chief care in these and other diseases seems reasonable from this consideration that the vid fred hoffm diss de intest duoden operation of such medecines as have been found successful against the most dangerous and obstinate distempers is in all probability confined to these parts and that they produce their most salutary effects in the id diss de just ventric helmont fol  00 stomach and guts by affecting principally their nervous coats and other parts of the body by consent only we have already observed that acid medecines which are allowed to be of great use in fevers are entirely changed in the first ways or at least soon after they have been received into the blood  it now remains to show by what means that rigor and constriction of the surface from which we have proved all the other symptoms of fevers arise are themselves produced and these means i take to be no other but those very things which are commonly called the remote causes of these disorders viz cold taken excesses in eating and drinking the suppression of some usual discharge trouble of mind and other accidents of the like nature when great and sudden  for first as to gold taken a rigor and constriction of the surface and a fever thence ensuing are such common and obvious effects of it that all proof on this head is unnecessary  thus the vid gal    meth etc ancient physicians generally attributed the rise even of putrid fevers to no other cause but the obstruction of the pores of the skin  secondly excesses in eating and drinking are apt to leave crudities in the stomach which by remaining there for a certain time grow acrid and vellicate its nervous coat and from thence a rigor or constriction may be propagated by consent to the surface of the body of this consent of the stomach with the skin we have a plain proof in those who are apt to shudder after having taken things that are acrid or sower and celsus fernelius and etmuller plainly insinuate that the cause of those horrors which commonly introduce fevers often lies in the stomach only  thirdly in the suppression of every usual discharge especially when great and sudden there is a morbid fullness in the vessels from whence the discharge used to be made and this fullness must necessarily occasion a spasm or constriction in other parts but in none to such a degree as in those at the surface and extremities by reason of their great and general consent with all the rest of the body thus coac praen fol     hyppocrates has observed that a dangerous rigor ensues upon the untimely suppression of the purgations of women in childbed or after a miscarriage and hence on the other hand baths of warm water vid prosp alp de med egypt p      by relaxing the skin inviting the humors thither and opening the perspiratory pores are apt to remove obstructions in the inner vessels and by that means often renew those discharges from them which had been suppressed  lastly that trouble of mind occasions fevers by affecting the surface in the same manner appears from the method of cure successfully used by the ancient physicians in the beginning of fevers so caused which was no other but friction unction and the warm bath  thus have we assigned for the production of those rigors that generally usher in fevers causes which are plain and sufficient and may be easily removed together with their ill effects by a timely application of vid part the second of this essay proper remedies and we have excluded from that denomination such things only as whatever may be thought of them have been proved to be merely effects of these distempers hardly if at all to be come at by the medecines usual in these cases and which therefore serve for no other purpose but to terrify the sick and mislead the physician  finis
