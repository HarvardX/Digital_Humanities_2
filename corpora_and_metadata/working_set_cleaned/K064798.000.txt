a letter to mr david hume on the tragedy of douglas its analysis and the charge against mr garrick by an english critic    sic ais ast ego contra so thou fayest but i am of a contrary opinion london printed for j scott in paternoster row mdcclvii  a letter to mr david hume sir having for a long time conceived the highest esteem for the variety of your literary merit a recommendation from you was almost a sanction to preengage my implicit approbation how high were my expectations raised by your dedicatory commendation of the tragedy of douglas but alas how fallen from seeing its representation nor has a perusal since won me over as an admirer of it  had the tragedy of douglas been ushered into the world as the promise of a dramatic genius as such it ought to have been received with applause but its having been forced upon us authoritatively in competition with all antiquity and the moderns two obvious effects were produced in the minds of men to wit curiosity was excited in some jealousy provoked in others i am sorry to inform you sir that in consequence your national judgment has been greatly run upon here and your critical stocks reduced almost to bankruptcy  for my part when i first read your panegyrical paragraph i for some time hesitated as to the sincerity of it and could not help reflecting on the passage in the art of sinking in poetry written by your truly ingenious countryman dr arbuthnot  take all the best qualities you can find in the most celebrated heroes if they will not be reduced to a consistency lay them all in a heap upon him but be sure they are qualities which your patron would be thought to have and to prevent any mistake which the world may be subject to select from the alphabet those capital letters that compose his name and set them at the head of a dedication but on a second reading of it i changed opinion and have moreover been assured that what is written you meant to which in amaze i used the famous reply of  est il possible is it possible  the four great and revered names maffei voltaire olway shakespeare which you have employed as supporters of douglas put me in mind of the statue of lewis xiv in paris where the four nations germany spain holland and england are chained round him as vanquished and lavishly accompanied with all the tokens of subjection however this may please the national vanity of the french all foreigners with reason laugh at the folly of the design and unpardonable foppery of the execution  i respect you too much sir to make any unmannered or indelicate application such as all fools admire but men of sense approve and shall impeach you by an evidence whom i dare say will not be objected to yourself  and from the standard of taste  strong sense united to delicate sentiment improved by practice perfected by comparison and cleared of all prejudice can alone entitle critics to this valuable character and the joint verdict of such whenever they are to be found is the true standard of taste and beauty  just expressions of passion and nature are sure after a little time to gain public vogue which they maintain for ever  according to this just and admirable doctrine what is likely to be the fate of the tragedy of douglas neglect and oblivion however illumined for the present by the flambeau you forgive the expression too partially or in the mildest terms too sanguinely hold before it  not satisfied to have preluded to the assured triumph of this tragedy in your dedication an unprovoked and congenial enforcer of the extravagance of its merit has been artfully diffused through the public under the title of the tragedy of douglas analyzed a seeming attack which the disappointed reader finds to be the second part of the same tune you had begun in your dedication and which is there quoted in order to be illustrated true in every article therefore to join issue the sooner we shall follow the method therein observed  from page seventh to twelfth is a tedious historical account of the fable quite too long for the proposed limits of this letter to be quoted and therefore i refer to it  the next heads proceeded to are the characters manners and diction having nothing to object against what the analyser says relative to the two former the following citations will sufficiently show that our disapprobation arises not from caprice but very justifiable motives  lady randolph for in your shades i deem some spirit dwells who from the chiding stream or groaning oak still hears and answers to matildas moan  wherefore chiding groaning hears answers this may be founded on some tradition or popular error of scotland but to english understandings if not altogether nonsensical is at least chimerical  thou do not think so woeful as i am  woeful indeed  but whether go thou now is a question in the low familiar  the misplaced and horse doeuvre compliment to the union  a river here there an ideal line etc is tedious and insipid the line it closes with flat  the youthful warrior is a clod of clay clod and clay are not only mean words but also cacophonous to the ear  anna to dry these piteous tears i would throw my life away  for but a confident there is a qualityease in this offer to oblige a friend but she soon relapses into a diction more apposite to her condition iwillspeaksonomore and presents us at the same time with a nasty image  but silent mix my tears with hers lady randolph can thy feeble pity roll back the flood of never ebbing time  is this strictly correct ebb and flood being opposites roll is inadequate here  and with him in spite of all my tears did malcolm go that tears should have been shed rather to detain her but three weeks married husband douglas than an unsubstitutive brother will be assented to by all young married ladies who are so unfashionable as to love their husbands  faultring i took an oath equivocal that i never would wed one of douglas name this is a pretty jesuitical device she having been married to one already  anna never did i hear a tale so sad as this  nor any body else  lady randolph the good priest who joined our hands my brothers ancient tutor with his loved malcolm in the battle fell they two alone were privy to the marriage  the poet is hard run here in order to distress his heroine why kill the priest in battle perhaps this action happened in the days of the church militant  across the carron lay the destined road this name of a river in scotland from its likeness in sound to our english word carrion is grating to the ears of a london audience why destined road  anna the hand that spins the uneven thread of life may smooth the length that is yet to come of yours  this may appear a pretty figure to those acquainted with the art of spinning though it does not to me the last line is monosyllabically harsh a fault our author is often guilty of  to anna replies lady randolph not in this world    i should be glad to know in what other  never were vice and virtue poised so ill as in glenalvons unrelenting mind on the contrary i think never better if he played his varied parts with that subtlety and protean art she ascribes to him  lord randolph blush not flower of modesty  is an odd expression from one man to another and would be better addressed to one of the gentle sex  lady randolph i will be sworn thou will not  this is inelegant and not suited to the rank of the speaker  lord randolph go with me norval and thine eyes shall see the chosen warriors of thy native land who languish for the fight and beat the air with brandished swords  i dislike this picture of scotch warriors beating the air the renowned don quixote indeed encountered windmills  glenalvon and waves the flag of her displeasure over me  this would not be improper from a seaofficer  persistive wisdom is the fate of man i do not understand this line and confess my ignorance of what persistive means  we found him lurking in the hollow glynn glynn is a word used in scotland and ireland but not in the meridional parts of england  norval red came the river down and loud and often the angry spirit of the water shrieked  the meaning of red here and the angry spirit of the water shrieking are unknown to us south britons  by the moons light i saw whirled round and round a basket soon i drew it to the bank and nestled curious there an infant lay quite the contrary and all drenched in water is most likely unless the basket had been purposely caulked from a foreknowledge of the event  sir malcolm of our barons was the flower our author seems fond of the word flower to mark male eminence wherefore pursuant to the baptismal vows you have made for him as his sponsor not at all alluding to the song let him be called the flower of edinburghs tragic writers for on this side of the tweed nothing more will or ought to be allowed him  the panegyrical analyser placefoot n a pamphlet in favors of this play entitled douglas analyzed was lately published at london where a great number of passages are quoted as the most exalted sentiment as well as poetical fancy that has appeared in our day  who has quoted many indifferent has in my sense omitted several of the most beautiful passages which as they occur i shall insert in this letter for instance  lady randolph what does my anna think of the young eaglet of a valiant nest how soon he gazed on bright and burning arms spurned the low dunghill where his fate had thrown him and towerd up to the region of his fire  anna mysterious nature with the unseen cord of powerful instinct drew you to your own  a cord is a visible substance besides this is too gross and material an image of the power of instinct  glenalvon the field must man to man and foot to foot be ought  this rather excites an idea of two armies wrestling than fighting with offensive weapons  here follow other unpardonable omissions by the analyser  lord randolph an army knit like ours would pierce it through brothers that shrink not from each others side and fond companions fill our warlike files for his dear offspring and the wife he loves the husband and the fearless father arm in vulgar breasts heroic ardour burns and the poor peasant mates his darling lord the cross of christ  christian cross would sound less harsh to the ear what follows is a fine picture of decayed beauty and some judicious sentiments  lady randolph arise my son in me thou do behold the poor remains of beauty once admired the autumn of my days is come already for sorrow made my summer haste away yet in my prime i equaled not thy father his eyes were like the eagles yet sometimes liker the doves and as he pleased he won all hearts with softness or with spirit awed thou do not know what perils and injustice await the poor mans valor o my son the noblest blood in all the lands abashed having no lacquey but pale poverty there burst the smothered flame how do bad women find unchanging aspects to conceal their guilt when i by reason and by instinct urged full hardly can dissemble with these men in natures pious cause  the following remark deserves the attention of all men ambitious of the matrimonial state  lord randolph let no man after me a woman wed whose heart he knows he has not though she brings a mine of gold a kingdom for her dowry  glenalvon she too that seemed pure as the winter stream when ice embossed whitens its course  this is strained quaint and affected and what follows sheer bombast  he is in a proper mood to chide the thunder if it at him roared glenalvon is answered with a sensible and manly ingenuity by douglas  sir i have been accustomed all my days to hear and speak the plain and simple truth and though i have been told that there are men who borrow friendships tongue to speak their scorn yet in such language i am little skilled therefore i thank glenalvon for his counsel though it sounded harshly glenalvon what will become of you  is an unheroic interrogation  thy truth you are all a lie this brutality does not meet with an instantaneous and proper retort from one of young douglass supposed feeling which by the following sentiments is farther manifested  douglas to the liege lord of my dear native land i owe a subjects homage but even him and his high arbitration i would reject within my bosom reigns another lord honor sole judge and umpire of itself if my free speech offend you noble randolph revoke your favor and let norval go hence as he came alone but not dishonored imposes silence with a stilly sound  what means stilly here is it tantamount to stilling i know the word is in shakespeare but do not understand it in the place he uses it  norval and ever and anon they vowed revenge  ever and anon are no doubt supposed defensible because in a shepherds mouth and in imitation of homers practice are in p  0 faithfully repeated by douglas to his mother  douglas may heaven inspire some fierce gigantic dane to give a bold defiance to our host before he speaks it out i will accept  how accept it before he speaks it out does not this at least border on a blunder  sad fear and melancholy still divide the empire of my breast with hope and joy this sir is an abridgment of your dissertation on the passions  lady randolph too well i see which way the current of thy temper sets  drives would perhaps be more explicit  the sentiments of dying douglas are not amiss nor is the mothers affliction ill drawn nay somewhat affecting but why she should plunge from a precipice headforemost into the sea i cannot see any reason nor for her or her sons deaths he might have killed glenalvon though previously wounded by him in the back but not mortally and lord randolph in expiation of his groundless jealousy and rash attempt resign to victorious douglas his rightful inheritance  the prologue a learned allusion to the old song of chevychase is of the true poetical profound  in ancient times when britains trade was arms why not pride instead of trade but the scotch have always sneered at the english as a trading nation  and the loved music of her youth alarms the sense of this line not intelligible to us alludes rather to the musical alarms of highlan bagpipes  it would be too much to take in the whole prologue here to read it is enough where it emerges from confusion and obscurity it gently subsides in kindred lines to this they knocked alternate at each others gate   it concludes with an humble petition in behalf of scotland  the epilogue is a priggish affectation and i hope will never be relished by a genuine british audience the farfetched comparison of the nile is stolen i object to the epithet of celestial joined to melancholy in the last line heaven by all information i have ever had of it is the kingdom of joy it is therefore a dissenting opinion to make it the abode of melancholy  why has the panegyrist taken notice but of three performers and natives of ireland shameful partiality this appears a flagrant combination of the scotch and irish against the true sons of old english roastbeef as if forsooth the former are only qualified to write tragedy and the latter to perform but to thy teeth partial analyst i will do my countryfolks the justice they deserve  he who figured in the character of glenalvon manifested a projectile spiritedness of person and strictly adherent to horaces rule semper sibi constans without any variation throughout now this is what may be called supporting a character  the actor of lord randolph was selfcollected having the curb of his passions in hand he exhibited a commanding calmness of deportment and a level stomachfetched dignity of voice  the liquid toned actress of anna irradiated sorrow with her smiles how sweetly did she speak  thy vassals grief great natures order break and change the noontide to the midnight hour i should not have been surprised if the superior beings descended from heaven to her pretty manner of uttering this invitation  ye ministers of gracious heaven who love the human race angels and seraphs who delight in goodness forsake your skies and to her couch descend there from her fancy chase those dismal forms that haunt her waking her sad spirit charm with images celestial such as please the blessed above upon their golden beds i owed this to my country so now my mind is at ease golden beds savours of epicurism  the groundwork of the play is an absolute absurdity for either the lady randolph must have been very artful who had a chopping boy    years before to pass on her husband for a maid or he lord randolph must have been very unacquainted with the affairs of women i fear the latter case and from ineffectual nights sprung the daily cause of her tears and certainly a very material one penelope it is true mourned twenty years for ulysses but then she did not admit an apathic lover to tantalize her in bed  the shepherd the jewels and recognition of this doleful piece are wornout devices of the stage and expletive pegs of the human invention  the protracted monotony of lady randolphs grief is irksome one character often exhibited in the same piece must be agitated by variety of passions otherwise we grow tired of the sameness  after the discovery of douglas he is not thrown into any interesting situation nor is there any dramatic anxiety throughout arising from the intricacy of the plot for from the beginning to the end it is an uninterrupted downhill greensword course entirely against the revolutionary spirit of the scenic laws which perhaps nay by your miscalled dissertation or rather dissertatiuncle on tragedy it appears you are no acquainted with we had however a righ to expect at least unexceptionable correctness of style in a work by you so immoderately praised not to say profanely  i now take leave of douglas this aurora borealis of tragedy that had so long corruscated ove us from the north to execute the last part o my task to wit to defend mr garrick by disculpating him from a heavy charge disseminated every where from the drawing room in st james to the nightcellars which is that he had the impudence to refuse the tragedy of douglas the best play ever acted not only on the english stage but on any other ancient or modern  the author not only absolves but apologis for mr garrick by his motto  non ego sum vates sed prisci conscius avi i am not a poet but well read in old ballads mr garrick acquiesced to the former part o his confession and told him that but poor matrials for the stage could be derived from the later this is the upshot of his crime has h then deserved all the foulmouthed abuse that has been lavished on him i think not who am not partial to him  the pulpit and clergy of scotland are irreverently treated in the analysis which ends with a bullying line that might waggishly be retorted to wit the blood of douglas will defend itself   that is people will keep aloof from it because nemo impune lacessit no body rubs to it with impunity  the drift of the whole being now seen through with a dislike to your partiality but esteem and veneration for your genius and erudition  i am sir your etc  finis
