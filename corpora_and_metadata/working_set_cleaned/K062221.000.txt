of unexhausted love nor joys alone thy dangers too i will share with thee the menace of the waves i will dare in vain  for smiles his brow deep frowns involve the sacred ties of gratitude dissolve see faith distracted rends her comely hair his fading vows while tainted zephyrs bear oh thou before whose seraphguarded throne the christians bow and other gods disown if wrapped in darkness thou denyst thy ray and shroudst from nubia thy celestial day indulge this fervent prayer to thee addressed indulge though uttered from a sable breast may gathering storms eclipse the cheerful skies and madning furies from thy hell arise with glaring torches meet his impious brow and drag him howling to the gulf below ah no  may heavens bright messengers descend obey his call his every wish attend still over his form their hovering wings display if he be blessed these pangs admit allay me still her mark let angry fortune deem so thou may walk beneath her cloudless beam yet often to my wrapped ear did thou repeat that i sufficed to frame thy bliss complete for loves pure flame i took thy transient fires we fondly credit what the heart desires i hoped alas to breathe thy native air and vie in splendour with the british fair ascend the speedy car enchasd with gold with robes of silk this pearldeckd form infold bid on this jetty hand the diamond glow and chosen rubies sparkle from my brow deluded sex the dupes of man decreed we splendid victims at his altar bleed the grateful accents of thy candyd tongue where artful flattery too persuasive hung like flowers adorned the path to my disgrace and bade destruction wear a smiling face yet formed by nature in her choicest mould while on thy cheek her blushing charms unfold who could oppose to thee stern virtues shield what tender virgin would not wish to yield but pleasure on the wings of time was born and i exposed a prey to grinning scorn of lowborn traders  mark the hand of fate is yarico reduced to grace the state whose impious parents an adventurous band imbrued with guiltless blood my native land even snatched my father from his regal seat and stretched him breathless at their hostile feet illfated prince the christians sought thy shore unsheathed the sword and mercy was no more but thou fair stranger came with gentler mind to shun the perils of the wrecking wind amidst thy foes thy safety still i pland and reached for galling chains the myrtle band nor then unconscious of the secret fire each heart voluptuous throbd with soft desire ah pleasing youth kind object of my care companion friend and every name that is dear say from thy mind can thou so soon remove the records pencild by the hand of love how as we wantoned on the flowery ground the looserobd pleasures danced unblamd around till to the sight the growing burden proyd how thou oercamst  and how alas i loved too fatal proof since thou with avarice fraught did basely urge ah shun the wounding thought that tender circumstance  reveal it not lest torn with rage i curse my fated lot lest startled reason abdicate her reign and madness revel in this heated brain that tender circumstance  inhuman part  i will not weep though serpents gnaw this heart frail frail resolve while gushing from mine eye the pearly drops these boastful words belie alas can sorrow in this bosom sleep where strikes ingratitude her talons deep when he i still adore to nature dead for roses plants with thorns the nuptial bed bids from the widowed couch kind peace remove and cold indiffrence blast the bower of love what time his guardian power i most required against my fame and happiness conspired and do i live to breathe the barbarous tale his faithful yarico exposed to sale yes basely urged regardless of my prayers even while i bathed his venal hand with tears what most for pity called  i can no more  my future child  to swell his impious store all all mankind for this will rise thy foe but i alas alone endure the woe alone endure the festring hand of care the bleeding soul and swoonings of despair was it for this i left my native plain and dared the tempest brooding on the main for this unlocked seduced by christian art the chaste affections of my virgin heart within this bosom fand the constant flame and fondly languishd for a mothers name lo every hope is poisoned in its bloom and horrors watch around this guilty womb with blood illustrious circling through these veins which never was checkered with plebeian stains through ancestrys long line ennobled springs from famecrownd warriors and exalted kings must i the shafts of infamy sustain to slavrys purposes my infant train to catch the glances of his haughty lord attend obedient at the festive board from hands unscepterd take the scornful blow uproot the thoughts of glory as they grow let this pervade at length thy heart of steel yet yet return nor blush oh man to feel ah guide thy steps from yon expecting fleet thine injured yarico relenting meet bid her recline woestricken on thy breast and hush her raging sorrows into rest ah let the youth that sent the cruel dart extract the point envenomed from her heart the peace he banished from this mind recall and bid the tears he prompted cease to fall then while the stream of life is given to flow and sable hue overspread this youthful brow or curl untaught by art this woolly hair so long so long to me shall thou be dear say lovely youth flow all my words in vain like seeds that strew the rude ungrateful plain say shall i never regain thy wonted grace never stretch these arms to catch the wished embrace enough  with newawakd resentment fraught assist me heaven to tear him from my thought no longer vainly suppliant will i bow and give to love what i to hatred owe forgetful of the race from whence i came with woe acquainted but unknown to shame hence vile dejection with thy plaintive prayer thy bended knee and still descending tear rejoin rejoin the palecomplexiond train  the conflicts past  and i am myself again thou parent sun if ever with pious lay i ushered in thy worldreviving ray or as thy fainter beams illumd the west with grateful voice i hymnd thee to thy rest beheld with wondering eye thy radiant seat or sought thy sacred dome with unclad feet if near to thy bright altars as i drew my votive lamb thy holy flamen slew forgive that i irrevrent of thy name dared for thy foe indulge the unhallowed flame even on a christian lavished my esteem and scorned the sable children of thy beam this poniard by my daring hand impressed shall drin the ruddy drops that warm my breast nor i alone by this immortal deed from slavrys laws my infant shall be freed and thou whose ear is deaf to pitys call behold at length thy destined victim fall behold thy oncelovd nubian stained with gore unwept extended on the crimson floor these temples clouded with the shades of death these lips unconscious of the lingering breath these eyes upraisd ere closed by fates decree to catch expiring one faint glimpse of thee ah then thy yarico forbear to dread my faultring voice no longer will upbraid demand due vengeance of the powers above or more offensive still implore thy love finis
