the progress of envy a poem in imitation of spenser  occasioned by lauders attack on the character of milton  inscribed to the right honorable the earl of bath  odium bonorum sede me infausta extrahit diros scelesta mente versantem dolos grotii adamus exsul london printed for j newbery at the bible and sun in st pauls churchyard mdccli  price one shilling  to the right honorable the earl of bath patron of milton and his vindicators  the following poem is inscribed by his lordships most obedient humble servant  the author  the preface to be studious of bringing merit in obscurity to light is so strong an instance of benevolence that it has in all ages been constantly attended with the highest commendations while the destroyer of a mans reputation in whatsoever it consisted has been accounted a more odious criminal than even the assassin of his body on this remark is founded one of the most beautiful passages in shakespeare  who steals my purse steals trash twas mine it is his and has been slave to thousands but he that filches from me my good name steals from me that which not enriches him but makes me poor indeed othello this is so true an observation that few i believe will doubt that milton was less offended at the low price his inestimable poem was rated at on its first publication than he would have been at the late mean attempts to subvert a fame so well established  to view the character of this son of darkness in its most genuine form let us contrast it with another no less eminent for its splendour which is the properest i could choose for my present purpose as it is particularly so in relation to that divine author we have lately seen so well vindicated from the groundless aspersions of almost his only enemy  in the course of the spectators mr addison who was perhaps the most candid critic that ever wrote without deviating from impartiality took a particular pleasure in producing latent unregarded worth that he might show those cavillers who were daily complaining of a deartb of good poetry what noble things of this kind they neglected  agreeably to this end is his criticism on the old english ballad of chevychace but his most glorious works of this kind are his observations on the paradise lost there is not a stronger instance of prejudice and the force of party than the reception this poem met with in the authors lifetime whose unhappy attachment to wrong principles rendered all his attempts at fame while living fruitless his admirable poem lay in obscurity till mr addison removed those envious clouds which had been suffered to obstruct its splendour with what pleasure does be discover its excellencies and instruct an ordinary reader to judge of its beauties with what regret does he speak of the sew blemishes of that divine piece which says he is like writing a treatise upon the spots of the sun  these remarks are so universally read and approved that i believe every body but lauder and his friends if he has any will concur with me in the following observation had mr addison never wrote a line but his critique upon milton that would alone have been sufficient to have established his reputation as a fine writer and a good man  if the reader would view the exact reverse of the above character let him turn his eyes on lauder a being so utterly void of candor and benevolence that he has thought it worth his while to commit the grossest forgeries to disturb if possible the ashes of our poet and has been more industrious to depreciate the paradise lost than the writers in the beginning of this century were to heap encomiums upon it the inhumanity and amazing impudence of these proceedings have puzzled all to devise a likely reason for so strange a piece of malice the faint excuses alleged for this behavior in lauders recantation by no means palliate his crime notwithstanding the florid dress he has clothed them in though i am far from being admitted into his secret counsels i believe i may venture to mention one which out of his usual regard to truth he has purposely omitted it is very possible the same thing which has often made poets tempted lauder to unmake one viz poverty and the hopes of a subscription  these potent arguments once induced him to commend with some warmth the very same poem he has lately been at so much pains to brand as a work of no genius but as honesty would no longer procure him a dinner his conscience did not prevent him from turning the tables  rem faciam rem si possim recte si non quocunque modo rem but we will urge this no farther remembering that it is not right to speak ill of the dead  prefaces are commonly intended for discourses to the reader on the book he is entering upon but the consideration of a being quite divested of modesty and humanity naturally led me into the foregoing reflections arising from the subject of these sheets  i shall not trouble the reader with an account of the time i was employed in writing it or insipidly petition the favor of the critics but commit it to the world with all its imperfections on its head  an attempt to overthrow the bold assertions of lauder by poetry till he had been foiled at his own weapons would hardly have succeeded but when so invincible a champion as mr douglas had taken the field and returned victorious the muses who were particularly interested in the contest should adorn him with the insignia of a triumph  this hint has already given rise to the pandaemonium and the following stanzas in imitation of spenser the design of our several pieces are so very different that it is almost impossible they should clash in point of merit if we both meet with success according to our various models we need not be disheartened at any accidental rivalship or absurd comparison an injudicious reader may draw between us  mr dryden in some part of his works has an observation hinting at poetical genealogy we have amongst us says he our lines and descents in as regular a manner as the noblest families in deducing the best english writers from their poetic original he observes that milton is the first descendant from spenser this remark of so great a judge as mr dryden induced me to choose spenser for my model and to place him by the side of apollo in my poem imagining there was a peculiar propriety in shielding the son under the protection of the father  as i did not suppose that imitations were bound to transcribe the faults as well as excellencies of their original i made no scruple of making a slight alteration in spensers stanza which is universally condemned for the redundancy of its correspondent rhimes the difficulty i should have found in the execution had perhaps some share in this voluntary omission allowing this to be certain my judicious reader will be so far from thinking it a blemish that i am persuaded he will readily compound for the loss of some of my bells provided i can entertain him more rationally i have in general rather wished to fall into spensers way of thinking than his manner of clothing his sentiments because i think his imagery infinitely superior to his style i have however ben so far from neglecting his language that except those places where i found the old words express less than the modern i always gave them the preference whether i have transfused any of the divine spirit of spenser into the following stanzas and whether his style is successfully imitated the reader must judge for himself  the mention i made of the slight variation from spensers stanza was merely to prevent the nibblers of the age from imputing it to ignorance these wouldbe critics take great pains to pervert the movements of the human mind which certainly has more pleasure in bestowing commendations than dispraise i beg leave to show the truth of this assertion by an instance drawn from myself as an author whatever satisfaction it may have afforded me to stigmatize the malice of lauders proceedings nothing in the whole course of this work pleased me so much as celebrating mr douglas if the following trifle should meet with the approbation of the public i hope that gentleman will think it an acceptable present to himself  the progress of envy i ah me unhappy state of mortal wight since envys sure attendant upon fame ne does she rest from rancorous despite until she works him mickle woe and shame unhappy he whom envy thus does spoil ne does she check her ever restless hate until she does his reputation foil ah luckless imp is he whose worth elate forces him pay this heavy tax for being great ii there stood an ancient mount yclept parnass the fair domain of sacred poesy which with fresh odours everblooming was besprinkled with the dew of castaly which now in soothing murmurs whispering glides watring with genial waves the fragrant soil now rolls adown the mountains steepy sides teaching the vales full beauteously to smile dame natures handiwork not formed by laboring toil iii the muses fair these peaceful shades among with skilful fingers sweep the trembling strings the air in silence listens to the song and time forgets to ply his lazy wings palevisagd care with foul unhallowed feet attempts the summit of the hill to gain ne can the hag arrive the blissful seat her unavailing strength is spent in vain content sits on the top and mocks her empty pain iv often phoebus self left his divine abode and here enshrouded in a shady bower regardless of his state laid by the god and owned sweet musics more alluring power on either side was placed a peerless wight whose merit long had filled the trump of fame this fancys darling child was spenser hight who pipd full pleasing on the banks of tame that no less famed than he and milton was his name v in these cool bowers they live supinely calm now harmless talk now emulously sing while virtue pouring round her sacred balm makes happiness eternal as the spring alternately they sung now spenser gan of jousts and tournaments and champions strong now milton sung of disobedient man and eden lost the bards around them throng drawn by the wondrous magic of their princes song vi not far from these dan chaucer ancient wight a lofty seat on mount parnassus held who long had been the muses chief delight his reverend locks were silvered over with eld grave was his visage and his habit plain and while he sung fair nature he displayed in verse albeit uncouth and simple strain ne mote he well be seen so thick the shade which elms and aged oaks had all around him made vii next shakespeare sat irregularly great and in his hand a magic rod did hold which visionary beings did create and turned the foulest dross to purest gold whatever spirits rove in earth or air or bad or good obey his dread command to his behests these willingly repair those awed by terrors of his magic wand the which not all their powers united might withstand viii beside the bard there stood a beauteous maid whose glittering appearance dimmed the eyes her thinwrought vesture various tints displayed fancy her name ysprong of race divine her mantle wimpled a word used by spenser for hng down the line enclosed within commas is one of fairfaxs in his translation of tasso wimpled low her silken hair which loose adown her wellturnd shoulders strayed she made a net to catch the wanton air whose lovesick breezes all around her played and seemed in whispers soft to court the heavenly maid ix and ever and anon she waved in air a scepter fraught with allcreative power she waved it round eftsoons there did appear spirits and witches forms unknown before again she lifts her wonderworking wand eftsoons upon the flowery plain was seen the gay inhabitants of fairie land and blithe attendants upon mab their queen in mystic circles danced along the enchanted green x on the other side stood nature goddess fair a matron seemed she and of manners staid beauteous her form majestic was her air in loose attire of purest white arrayed a potent rod she bore whose power was such as from her darlings works may well be shown that often with its soulenchanting touch she raised or joy or caused the deepfelt groan and each mans passions made subservient to her own xi but lo thick fogs from out the earth arise and murky mists the buxom air invade which with contagion dire infect the skies and all around their baleful influence shed the infected sky which whilom was so fair with thick cimmerian darkness is overspread the sun which whilom shone without compare muffles in pitchy veil his radiant head and sore the time soregrieving seeks his watery bed xii envy the daughter of fell acheron the flood of deadly hate and gloomy night had left precipitate her stygian throne and through the frighted heavens winged her flight with careful eye each realm she did explore ne mote she ought of happiness observe for happiness alas was now no more since every one from virtues paths did swerve and trample on religion base designs to serve xiii at length on blessed parnassus seated high their temples circled with a laurel crown spenser and milton met her scowling eye and turned her horrid grin unto a frown full fast unto her sister did she post there to unload the venom of her breast to tell how all her happiness was crossed since others were of happiness possessed did never gloomy hell send forth like ugly pest xiv within the covert of a gloomy wood when funeral cypress starproof branches spread oergrown with tangling briers a cavern stood fit place for melancholy dreary head gloominess drearyhead here a deformed monster joyd to won which on fell rancour ever was ybent all from the rising to the setting sun her heart pursued spite with black intent ne could her iron mind at human woes relent xv in flowing sable stole she was yclad which with her countenance did well accord forth from her mouth like one through grief gone mad a frothy sea of nauseous foam was poured a ghastly grin and eyes asquint display the rancour which her hellish thoughts contain and how when man is blessed she pines away burning to turn his happiness to pain malice the monsters name a foe to god and man xvi along the floor black loathsome toads do crawl their gullets swelled with poisons mortal bane which ever and anon they spit at all whom hapless fortune leads too near her den around her waste in place of silken zone a lifedevouring viper reared his head who no distinction made twixt friend and foen but death on eyry side fierce brandished fly reckless mortals fly in vain is hardyhead courage hardyhead xvii impatient envy through the aetherial waste with inward venom fraught and deadly spite unto this cavern steered her panting haste enshrouded in a darksome veil of night her inmost heart burnt with impetuous ire and fell destruction sparkled in her look her ferret eyes flashed with revengeful fire a while contending passions uttrance choke at length the fiend in furious tone her silence broke xviii sister arise see how our power decays no more our empire thou and i can boast since mortal man now gains immortal praise since man is blessed and thou and i are lost see in what state parnassus hill appears see phoebus self two happy bards atween see how the god their song attentive hears this spenser hight that milton well i ween who can behold unmoved sike hearttormenting scene xix sister arise ne let our courage droop perforce we will compel these mortals own that mortal force unto our force shall stoop envy and malice then shall reign alone thou best has known to file thy tongue with lies and to deceive mankind with specious bait like truth accoutred spreadest forgeries the fountain of contention and of hate arise unite with me and be as whilom great xx the fiend obeyed and with impatient voice  tremble ye bards within that blissful seat malice and envy shall oerthrow your joys nor phoebus self shall out designs defeat shall we who under friendships feigned veil prompted the bold archangel to rebel shall we who under show of sacred zeal plunged half the powers of heaven in lowest hell  such vile disgrace of us no mortal man shall tell xxi and now more hideous rendered to the sight by reason of her raging cruelty she burnt to go equipt in dreadful plight and find fit engine for her forgery her eyes inflamed did cast their rays askance while hellish imps prepare the monsters car in which she might cut through the wide expanse and find out nations that extended far when all was pitchy dark ne twinkled one bright star xxii black was her chariot drawn by dragons dire and each fell serpent had a double tongue which ever and anon spit flaming fire the regions of the tainted air among a lofty seat the sistermonsters bore in deadly machinations close combined dull folly drove with terrible uproar and cruel discord followed fast behind god help the man against whom such caitiff foesare joined xxiii aloft in air the rattling chariot flies while thunder harshly grates upon its wheels black pointed spires of smoke around them rise the air depressed unusual burden feels detested sight in terrible array they spur their fiery dragons on amain ne mote their anger suffer cold delay until the wished for region they obtain and land their dingy car on caledonian plain xxiv here elder son of malice long had dwelt a wretch of all the joys of life forlorn his fame on double falsities was built ah worthless son of worthless parent born under the show of semblance fair he veiled the black intentions of his hellish breast and by these guileful means he more prevailed than had he open enmity professed the wolf more safely wounds when in sheeps clothing dressed xxv him then themselves atween they joyful place sure signs of woe when such are pleased alas then measure back the air with swifter pace until they reach the foot of mount parnass hither in evil hour the monsters came and with their new companion did alight who long had lost all sense of virtuous shame beholding worth with poisonous despite on his success depends their impious delight xxvi long burnt he sore the summit to obtain and spread his venom over the blissful seat long burnt he sore but still he burnt in vain mote none come then who come with impious feet at length at unawares he out does spit that spite which else had to himself been bane the venom on the breast of milton lit and spread benumbing death through every vein the bard of life bereft fell senseless on the plain xxvii as at the banquet of thyestes old the sun is said to have shut his radiant eye so did he now through grief his beams withold and darkness to be felt overwhelmed the sky forth issued from their dismal dirk abodes the birds attendant upon hideous night shriekowls and ravens whose fell croaking bodes approaching death to miserable wight did never mind of man behold sike dreadful sight xxviii apollo wails his darling done to die by foul attempt of envys fatal bane the muses sprinkle him with dew of castaly and crown his death with many a living strain hoary parnassus beats his aged breast aged yet never before did sorrow know the flowers drooping their despair attest the aggrieved rivers querulously flow all nature sudden groaned with sympathetick woe xxix but lo the sky a gayer livery wears the melting clouds begin to fade apace and now the cloak of darkness disappears may darkness ever thus to light give place erst grieved apollo jocund looks resumes the nine renew their whilom cheerful song no grief parnassus aged breast consumes forth from the teeming earth new flowers sprung the plenteous rivers flowed full peacefully along xxx the stricken bard fresh vital heat renews whose blood erst stagnate rushes through his veins life through each pore her spirit does infuse and fame by malice inexpulsive reigns and see a female form all heavenly bright upheld by one of mortal progeny a female form yclad in snowy white ne half so fair at distance seems as nigh douglas and truth appear envy and lauder die finis
