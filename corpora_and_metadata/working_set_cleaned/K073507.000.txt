land of freedom that there is no such thing as using it until the terror of every cowardly peace officer obliges them to cry for it and then we can employ it with some degree of plausibility  grapnel i have contrived it so that none but sneaking fools shall on that occasion appear in opposition to the watcherites by which means the mobility may be induced to proceed to such enormities that the blockheads who are to deal with them will to protect themselves call loudly for military aid and thereby furnish us with an excellent pretext to govern by that power  this my lord is a crisis which

good god how much does your g  e surprise me just at the most important juncture of all our hopes and fears to see a nobleman of your abilities careless of so great concerns  is indeed amazing   grap my lord it does not signify  with me business must yield to pleasure  in this hour i sacrifice more to your lordship alone  than i would  to save a nation from perdition  think only my darling flavia is in impatient waiting  the postchaise has been ready these two hours  and  let us drive as fast as we can  we shall lose at least the first course of sport  so  my good lord excuse me  i am yours  offering to go   botch but  my lord  one moment    grap upon my honor i cannot  a moment is an age  you have nothing to sear  every thing is prepared  wimple is yours  and the secretaries only wait

an artless c  n down to the cunning of the more active petticoat  yet those of the nobility who have understanding to be of any service in arbitrary projects are either so timid and fearful of popular clamor or so prone to dissipation and pleasure  that i am drove to the disagreeable necessity of availing myself of others who have too much to be done by one man  whose chief study is  to make the world believe  he does nothing  ha some fresh reproach  i hear almagnia   enter almagnia alm my lord it is past all bearing  was ever a person in my exalted station suffered to be so daringly and openly insulted by a rabble of  rascally slaves   botch alas madam they are not slaves  that is what i want to bring em to  may i but accomplish that  your vengeance should be amply gratified  but what is the matter  tell me thou dear empress of my heart  does any thing new distress you   alm see here another vile scrawl found pasted near the p  e g  e this morning  what are all the guards blind where are their eyes what have they their arms and their pay for i conjure you my lord to enquire into this matter find out who were upon guard  i shall insist that they be punished  i never desire to see any but the  d regiment mount upon the    botch madam  that is what cannot be  such distinctions would provoke our best friends the a  y to the same disaffection which governs the multitude  and then indeed the event might be fatal to both you and me   alm well  well my lord  if a  must submit to such rudeness  better be the m  of a shoe black  than the m  of a  the one may sue for redress  i it seems cannot  she cries and indignantly throws a paper to him  he takes it up and reads  the  is a fool  his  a whore  botch is a rogue  we need say no more    botch such insolence is indeed distracting    alm yes my lord  such insolence is distracting  and to suffer it  not much to the honor of a man for whom i have so dearly purchased so much power  by heavens it is want of spirit    botch madam  you wrong me  what man dare do  i dare  but the constitution of this d  d country so little understood by either you or me is so pregnant with obstacles to arbitrary g  t  that while one watcher stands in our way the difficulties are almost insuperable   alm very fine indeed  after having spent the very best of my youth to aggrandize and to make you happy  i must at length be told that the ac  d c  n of this country condemns me to bear hourly insults unnoticed and confinement from every sort of pleasure but  those of my bed chamber  of what importance then my lord has been the persecution and imprisonment of the so much dreaded watcher  had it not been better to have purchased him also at any price   botch madam you know as little of watcher as you do of the e  c  n  he is incorruptible  for what good purpose do you think it was that i bestowed so much pains to soften and reclaim the most obdurate enemy we had  the so popular chatwell  why madam  all that was with a view to trapan watcher  chatwell had his price  i found it out  i left him and his contentious ally lord taunter to divide the nations spoils between em  and  all to silence this d  d watcher whom i thought was so inviolably attached to their interests that he would lead just as they pleased  but he is an unfathomable fellow  the people are his k   and he is theirs  there is no separating their interests  nor do i see a possibility of purchasing watchers services  but at  a price  which no m  r will ever part with  that is  to yield up all the power and wealth of c  t supporters and c  t p  rs to be divided amongst the multitude that they forsooth may enjoy the conveniences of life with no less satisfaction than the best of us  perdition seize such liberty   alm then my lord  i find there is no hope left  i wish i was any where out of this vile country   botch a moments patience madam  i have yet some cards to play  for chatwell and taunter when they had you know the whole k  m at their disposal differed between themselves as i rightly judged about the dividing of it  i threw them the bait on purpose  they tugd and tugd at each end of it until chatwell finding what every body had seen before that the avidity of taunter was insatiable then invited others less gormandizers to partake of the feast  and by one clever jirk he pulled the bait entirely out of taunters maw  he next gilded a a pill for prattle  prattle swallowed it  and the edge of his patriotic zeal was blunted  watcher perceiving that the capital pillars of his grand structure were thus shaken and that taunter only was left unsatisfied bethought him next to rear an edifice on a broader bottom to be founded in greater solidity and to require fewer ornaments  he applies himself to the public  endeavors as the most interested to open their eyes and to speak truth he has labored so successfully that the question now is  whether all must yield to watcher and liberty  or by force and despotism endeavor to chastise both   alm and do you make a question of that  have you not watcher already tied up are not the j  s of our side and have you not all the m  y force of the n  n at your command   botch true madam watcher is confined but this confinement is rather form than reality  and if he was of that seditious spirit that we attribute to him he has friends enough at his nod to shake the pillars not of his p  n only but the p  e too  and it is from some violent attempt of that sort that my best hopes are at present founded  but i fear he has too much penetration for us all  for although he sustains the spirit of the multitude he artfully restrains their impetuosity  as for the j  s  i hope they lean to our side but the sagacity of mansupple is so guarded that he will do nothing rashly  the best services he will do for us must have at least the countenance of l   the m  y are no doubt at our devotion but even with respect to them i am under some difficulties  there is lord shelter rides resty  he is yet too young in m  l practices  nay i am afraid the projects we must now carry through are somewhat repugnant to his notions of politics  i am afraid he is either too honest or too timorous  he feels too warmly for the people  and although he never was in the cabal with watcher yet he rather seems to disapprove of rigid measures  in one word i am deceived in him  i do not like him  and yet when force is necessary i would wish to have his sanction    enter a servant serve my lord  an officer   ex almagnia enter an officer officer my lord  all is in an uproar  nothing to be heard from one end of the city to the other  but  watcher and liberty  no liberty no life  down with botch and all botchers  the p  n is surrounded by thousands and the fields are filled with millions    botch so much the better  but pray how does watcher behave   officer why my lord he seldom appears and when he does come to the window the acclamations are so loud that he cannot be heard himself  one of his d  d adherents told me that in the midst of their uproar a servant of watchers mingled with the mob they bore the servant on their shoulders  swore that maugre all power on earth they would have him out and that if he would not come to the window to satisfy them that he was well and wellused  they would instantly knock down every thing before them and make their way to his apartment  the servant told them he would speak to them and had twice attempted it but that their clamor was so noisy he could not be heard  my lord it will surprise you but it is true the word of command for silence was given out and in a trice all was as still as a bagnio at midday  the servant returned watcher came to his window and harrangued the people upon the impropriety of their assembling in such numbers neglecting their business and their families to do him more harm than good  told them his confinement was by appointment of law that the same law would soon relieve him and that he would not for a kingdom enjoy one hour of freedom that was contrary to law  he prayed them to dismiss  and promised that should any illegal steps be pursued to punish him or injure them he would then be glad of and call for their assistance but at present he had no complaints    botch curse his discretion   offi but all would not do my lord  he had no sooner finished and pulled down his window than the shouting grew louder  his enemies were all d  d  and swearing that there could be neither law nor reason to punish so great a man the outrage grew more violent  they insulted the senturies  and j  requires more force otherwise he says he will abandon his post    botch so far well  fly instantly and find lord barnacle    offi see my lord he is here   enter lord barnacle botch my good lord  youre welcome    bar my lord  the uproar increases  lord wimple begs your lordships opinion  lord shelter opposes sending any troops or if any should be sent he is for marching all the three regiments that the people seeing no chance of opposition may disperse quietly    botch why my lord  that would be to represent g  as too fearful and the mob as too important  my opinion is that a small detachment should first be sent  if they are resisted let others be ready to reinforce them and let the t  d r  t be kept under arms as a reserve that when the fury of the ruffians is thus gradually roused to a proper pitch they may have a good pretense to fall upon them and heartily revenge their countrys affronts    bar yours my lord is the judgment of a soloman  i go about it

shameful and terrible doings  see what all this patriotism of watchers brings upon us   blunt friend honesty thou art certainly mad  all this patriotism of watchers  what in the name of justice  do you blame watcher   hon no i do not blame watcher as the actual transgressor but as the original cause for had he kept himself quiet and given no countenance to the mob perhaps his past offenses might have been forgotten the g  t might have overlookt him then there would have been no canvassing no caballing nor no riots    blunt friend honesty  you are not yet well acquainted with the true spirit and character of jack watcher  some others of your more pusilanimous liberty boasters would as you say have kissed the rod long before now  but jack is not that man  he has once fairly engaged to be libertys and the peoples champion  and to expose to the just censure of the public those m  l s  s who would sacrifice both to the lust of their own temporary emolument  he has resolution and he has honesty  and should arbitrary measures so far prevail against him as to bring him even under sentence of death  whilst the people will adhere to him and until he obtains for them the end of his noble pursuit he would go to that death sooner than owe his life to m  l favor   hon well well but to what end does he seduce the people to neglect their business and to make all this rout and noise so much to the prejudice of themselves and neglect of their families i still say that he is indirectly the cause of this days slaughter   blunt watcher does by no means either seduce or inflame them  they are sensible that it is on account of his firm attachment to them and to the just influence he has got amongst them that the resentment of a  n so keenly persecutes him they justly think if they were to leave him to lie neglected in a prison where he is confined for their sakes it would be the height of ingratitude  this leads numbers of them successively to show their personal gratitude by which they imagine they keep up his spirits  this is poison to his persecutors  they make a parade of g  s c  s etc  such parades always gather abundance of idlers and the indifferent and the interested mingling together look like a concourse of people and are howsoever quiet branded with the name of mob  the scheme of g  t is to deter every body from so much as looking at him  in hopes by procrastinating his trial as they do from day to day that the people will at length be tired out and so desert him  but to blame him with any fatal consequences is just as reasonable as it would be to blame me  if i sent out a ship to purchase wealth to the nation and if by the mismanagement of the master or pilot the ship should be lost  the loss of that ships crew may i say be as justly imputed to me as the murders of this day can be imputed to honest jack watcher   hon well blunt but what security have the people or you in your minds supposing that watcher was to get the better of his enemies what security have you i say that he would more than others before him exert unchangeably all his masterly faculties for the public weal   blunt every earthly security that can be promised upon incorruptibility  a clear head  and an honest heart   hon pray what mighty proofs has he given of being incorruptible   blunt proofs in such a case cannot be positive because corruption seldom admits of evidence  but never was any case supported by so strong presumptive proof  during his service in p  t his vigilance and activity could not escape the notice of the m  s  we all know that many with not the half of his talents were bought off at a very high price and his continuing so long unplaced and unpensioned is a convincing testimony to me that he was not to be purchased  in the next place when through him such a wound was given to the native liberty of e  can you suppose that any son of corruption would have in defense of it undergone ignominious trials and suffered imprisonment when doubtless he could have avoided both by letting the stab which liberty had sustained pass unnoticed would not the m  y think you have paid him a very high price rather than have submitted to the disgrace he brought upon them and their emissaries and yet did he not as advocate for the public peril his freedom and fortune rather than yield one inch of theirs   hon why blunt these are strong presumptions i confess but how will you justify that clearness of head and goodness of heart you ascribe to him when you consider the censure of p  t  and the v  s of a j  standing against him for sedition and impiety   blunt as for the seditious part of it honesty has too much good sense not to grant me that the speeches put into the mouths of the best of k  s by wicked m  rs have before watchers time been as freely handled and not a word said about it  as to the accusation of impiety  i am sorry he is liable to the imputation  but i will no more admit that he was guilty of a publication in that case than if you was to show me a witty poem however wild it might be of which i should wish for a copy and you should consent to let me take one on condition that i would furnish you with two or three  the perusal of free thoughts on religious subjects is only dangerous to the morals of mankind when they fall into the hands of weak heads incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong  when they come into the hands of men of sense they will be able to discover and expose their errors and thereby do rather service than harm to the truth  and as it is impossible to conceive that ever the piece in question was designed for the public eye as i cannot help thinking that a most absurd verdict which pronounced it to be a publication and by that means subjected the undesigning copier to the punishment due to a criminal publisher   hon upon my word blunt  thou make no bad advocate for thy friend jack watcher   blunt my friend do you call him  faith he is too keen a fellow to be a friend to blunt  any farther than as being the friend of the public he is every mans friend and as such he shall always have blunts best wishes nay neighbor i will fairly tell you that i am determined to stand by him at the peril of all i am worth   hon give me thy fist blunt  for by my soul honesty will go hand in hand with thee  i will tell thee blunt  it is now no trifling question  i dont at present look upon it as a simple contention between watcher and the m  y  i consider it as war openly declared between liberty and arbitrary power  at no juncture have the people so unanimously and avowedly distinguished themselves in the cause of freedom and patriotism  and if it should be in the power of prerogative and despotism to render their endeavors upon this occasion ineffectual then may every one of us be next employed to rivet his neighbors chains  along then friend blunt let us go to the dukes head and quaff one sober bottle  to liberty  to

could not force myself to divert him with  he grew also cool  mutual indifference ensued  when my dear undoer came to town  i longed to repeat the act of my ruin  in fine without the least anger we

watcher himself  in the beginning of his endeavors here  popular appearances were necessary for him to supply the defections of those affected patriots who had formerly flattered him with their eternal protection  he found after he had risked all and spent all in pursuit of the very schemes they had concerted with him that they had fallen off and become so lukewarm that unless he should be able to inspirit the public with a just sense of his and their own oppressions he must fall a sacrifice to real merit  he therefore did not at first discourage their cabals but as no man is more anxious than he to preserve order and harmony in the community and knowing very well the dangerous effects of popular fury he has labored with as much zeal to moderate their resentments as he nobly intends to employ for the redress of their grievances   hon but pray tell me blunt have his lately so great and powerful friends actually abandoned him   blunt not entirely abandoned him  that is what for their own sakes at least for the sake of that popularity on which they would still fain plume themselves they dare hardly do  they continue i believe to contribute toward his expense  but for his noble and spirited measures they leave him to struggle through them the best way he can  they will not consent i imagine that he be too rigorously handled but they will as little concur with him in bringing to justice those tools of a  n who have disgraced and plundered the nation to aggrandize themselves and to crush the efforts of true patriotism   hon by my soul  blunt  i always feared it would be so  and yet who could have thought it  who for example to have heard the patriotic declamations of an orator chatwell while a c  r  could have believed he would ever submit to that degenerated inactivity in which they now rock him to sleep   blunt chatwells degeneracy does by no means surprise me i have ever looked upon him to be the vainest of all men  his best hopes were from the beginning founded in the peoples applause that he courted that he obtained and he has made a good account of it  the amazing success which crowned his a  n made him the idol of the people who would not see how greedily he adorned himself with ornaments of which he often spoiled the real purchaser no man in these days dared to contradict him and he therefore assumed every glory to himself   hon why blunt  all that is but too true  nor did i begrudge him at that time any honor he graspt at  i regarded him as the savior of a sinking state and thought the more honor he acquired the more he should have it in his power to distribute justice    blunt yes justice  what justice pray did he attain for the honest q  i forgot his name  but who from pure public spiritedness  threw himself out of a thriving trading company  pland the attempt upon s  l  spent every shilling he had industriously gained that he might convince the m  y of his sincerity  assisted or at least directed in the operations which conquered it  came home big with the hopes of grateful acknowledgments from so patriotic an a  n  these hopes not founded on imagination only but in written holograph assurances under the hand of the great patriot himself  and did not chatwell nevertheless not only assume to himself the whole merit of that scheme but would fain have retracted his promises  and because the honest q  unschoold in the science of politics would not belie himself and suffer the whole honor of the project to be ascribed solely to chatwell  did not chatwell in place of rewarding neglect and insult him  and as i am well assured had it not been for the generosity and truly patriotick application of lord shelter the s  y who solicited and obtained a pension for the original contriver of that conquest  then in very deep distress  the resentment of chatwell would have left the cheated q  to have lamented in indigence the folly of a merchant having forsook trade to spend a fortune in the public service   hon i have indeed heard as much  and farther  that although to demonstration there never was a better concerted plan  yet  that unless it had been countenanced and enforced by lord h  all the q  s fervency never could have moved the spirit of a  n to have carried it into execution    bl i believe that is true  for h  was certainly the first who adopted it and as far as he had influence promoted it  h  is no bad man  and i wish the execution of the d  d g  w  had fallen to any other m  rs share than his   hon well  but pray tell me what did the q  get by it at last   bl why  he got a pension  i dont know how much  but imtold  little more than sufficient to pay up the very debt he was obliged to contract during the time he was soliciting it   hon well blunt  and if chatwell now that he is again in a  n does not exert himself to repair at least a fortune so sequestered to the public use  may    bl ay  may the next fool that spends a shilling in such a service be hanged  as well as  beggared   hon but tell me blunt  might not the fate of the q  have served as a beacon to your friend jack watcher   blunt friend honesty  the case is extremely different  the q  for the service of his country had but one single object in view  upon the fate of that he was willing to peril his life and all he was worth  but it was still in the character of a merchant  if his project failed he was undone  if it succeeded he hoped to avail himself by some preference in the commercial way  watchers enthusiasm is of quite another fort  he penetrates into the bowels of a  n he sees by what poison it has been infected  he is anxious to purge it  and will rather die than leave it unrestored to its primitive constitution  he has abilities and perseverance  and while he breathes he will flatter himself with being upheld by honest men  that at length if not in the c  at least in the s  he may be the terror of evil doers  amen  so be it  if patriots dauntless  for their country bleed reward though late  will certainly succeed exeunt scene changes and discovers lord botch and lord mansupple extremely serious botch and what does your lordship think may be the consequence   mans my lord i am sorry to tell it you but it is truly my private opinion that the master j  e the o  rs who gave orders to fire and the rascals who left their stations deserve all to be hanged    botch it must not be  or by g  d i am undone  if these poor fellows who only acted under superior order are given up  the whole army will be as much incensed as the people are now  my dear lord  think how you may but screen us for this once and i will promise you that there never shall be any thing again countenanced on my part without your lordships advice   mans why my lord you never put a more difficult task upon me if we had consented to take bail for watcher  we might with some color of justice have bailed the s  and then the worst would have been a forfeiture of the bail  but how in equity can we accept the bail of wilful murderers  after having rejected it in the case of ludicrous publications will be something so repugnant to common sense that every porter has judgment to reason upon the impropriety  in a word my lord they must be tried  and if condemned  you may obtain a pardon for them   botch that will never do  we most not impose such a hardship upon the  he begins to think for himself  and his humane soul is so resolutely inaccessible to the most powerful intercessions in the case of murder that the greatest favorites at c  t would hazard their reputation by the application   mans my lord i have every disposition in the world for your service but you know how much the eyes of mankind are upon me and therefore i will by no means condescend to take upon me the burden of an affair which would make my name stink in their opinion pray have you talked to the a  y g  l upon this subject   botch my lord i have not  but i am certain he will not hesitate a moment to do any thing he may do consistently with his office   mans then the greatest difficulty is over  murder is one of the pl  of the c   let a welltimed petition be presented  prepare the a  g

pray let me first know what fact they were caught in   cons why my lord in no less than the rebellious fact of roaring out watcher and liberty    mans and pray good master constable what bad consequence attended the crying out watcher and liberty   cons bad consequence  is not watcher and liberty consequence sufficient is not watcher and liberty a heinous sin   mans no master constable there is no more sin in the words watcher and liberty than there is common sense in the word constable  it is according as they are employed that they are useful or troublesome to the community  and i am afraid that you are as much mistaken in having brought these people before me as they are mistaken in neglecting their business to cry out watcher and liberty  to jenny and pray madam how comes a gentlewoman of your appearance to be amongst the rest   jenny for saying my lord what i imagine your lordship thinks  that this wiseacre of a constable was  a fool  i was accidentally passing by saw these people in no other act of rioting than laughing and singing something about watcher and liberty and this sagacious gentleman having laid hold of them  i did tell him that if he carried them before any judge he would be laughed at for a fool  so madam says the constable  you are a watcherite too  along along you shall go with the rest  thus my lord i have the honor to be presented to your lordship   mans pray sir why is this gentlewoman brought here   cons why my lord  i think she is hanged by her own confession  does she not own that she called a civil magistrate a fool in the due execution of his office   mans my good friend  it is not possible in every case to suppress the truth  i am afraid  when a constable acts foolishly  one may call him a fool  without incurring the censure of the law  let me advise you for your own sake to carry for the future such offenders before some of the acting j  s  dont trouble me with them  and in the mean time you had best step in some where with these honest people and take a reconciling pot lest it should be put into their heads to ask some questions about unlawful detention  so go about your business  the people go out hallowing

capable of charming    jen your lordships very good  and though your observations rather favorable  it is not i imagine altogether unjust for where will you find a gentleman of livelier parts than my oppressed friend jack watcher and surely our sex never had reason to doubt of his benevolence for em   mans so madam  i find at length you are a well wisher to mr watcher    jen yes my lord  i avow it  and if your lordship  i mean  if every body would speak their sentiments as honestly as i do mine watcher would have avoided a great deal of distress and your lordship a great deal of trouble   mans come come madam no politics  politics methinks comes as awkwardly from the lips of a fine woman as love would come from the lips of an old judge   jen and so my lord  you would have me lay aside my
