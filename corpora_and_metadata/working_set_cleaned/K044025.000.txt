remarks on mr popes rape of the lock  in several letters to a friend  with a preface occasioned by the late treatise on the profund and the dunciad  by mr dennis  london printed for j roberts at the oxford arms in warwick lane      price  s  to the honorable george duckett esquire sir as soon as i had resolved to address the following treatise to one of the gentlemen who was abused together with myself in the late infamous libel more than one motive induced me to make choice of you for as no one was so flagrantly injured as yourself the infamous aspersion was so open and so manifest that there remained not the least doubt who was the person meant by it an insinuation equally base and groundless which could have entered into the head of no one who had either sense honor or nature in him into the head of no one but one whose mind was equally out of nature and equally crooked and deformed with his body this base insinuation was not only contrary to truth and justice but even contrary to common fame for you are known to have that respect esteem and affection for the most beautiful part of the creation which god and nature designed we should have but you have qualities to recommend you to them which have not been given to all as truth faith honor justice and a conversation at the same time entertaining and instructing these are qualities which have recommended you to a very fine lady to whom you have been married many years and by whom you have had eight children who are now living and these are qualities which as they have gained you the affections of the fair sex have equally recommended you to the esteem and respect of ours and more particularly of  sir your most humble and most obedient servant john dennis  preface it was toward the latter end of the reign of queen anne that i wrote remarks upon the first hundred lines of the late translation of homer upon the windsor forest upon the rape of the lock and upon the infamous temple of fame provoked and urged to it by the folly the pride and the petulancy of that little gentleman a pe qualities which at that time made me foresee and foretell that there was no person whatever whom he apprehended to be above him whether by station power or merit but he would come impudently one day to fly in his face if timely care were not taken to chastise and correct his soaring insolence  it was in the beginning of the reign of the late king that i ordered three of the forementioned treatises to be published viz remarks on the translation of homer on windsor forest and on the temple of fame which was done with a design to hold a faithful glass to this little gentleman and to cure him of his vain and his wretched conceitedness by giving him a view of his ignorance his folly and his natural impotence the undoubled causes of so many errors and so many imperfections  but at the same time that i ordered three of them to be published i took care to keep back the ensuing treatise purposely in terrorem which had so good an effect that he endeavored for a time to counterfeit humility and a sincere repentance and about that time i received a letter from him which i have still by me in which he acknowledged his offenses past and expressed an hypocritical sorrow for them  but no sooner did he believe that time had caused these things to be forgot than he relapsed into ten times the folly and the madness that ever he had shown before he not only attacked several persons of far greater merit than himself but like a mad indian that runs a muck struck at every thing that came in his way without distinction of friend or foe acquaintance or stranger merit or unworthiness wisdom or folly vice or virtue like a blind beetle that in its blundering flight bruises itself against every object it meets and does not fail to knock itself down by the impotent blows which it gives to others  he has not only struck at very different persons without any manner of distinction but has thrown his rhetorical flowers of fool dunce blockhead scoundrel promiscuously at them all as if he wisely thought that he was the only foulmouthed fellow in england or had so much of the fool blockhead dunce scoundrel within him that they have the same effect on his mind that jaundice would have upon his eyes and make every thing without him be to him in appearance what in reality is within him  nothing is more easy than to give foul language which a fool is more capable of giving to a wise man than a wise man to a fool because nothing incapacitates a man so much for it as good sense good nature good breeding and common discretion and nothing qualifies a man more for it than his being a clown a fool a barbarian and a brute the calling a man fool dunce blockhead scoundrel if it does not find him so it does by no means make him so but if it does not find him so it gives him who calls him so an unquestionable title to those terms himself as this is the language of the rabble of mankind the more any one brings himself to use it the more he sets himself upon an infamous level with the scum and offscouring of things  before i take my leave of this subject i cannot help reminding this little gentlemen en passant that though his adversaries were as many fools blockheads dunces as he is pleased in hononr to them to call them yet is he most unjust and most ungrateful to reflect upon any persons for their want of capacity since it is to people who want understanding that he owes most of his little fortune and all his little reputation for i will venture to affirm that mr a pe has no admirers among those who have capacity to discern to distinguish and judge and i will venture to foretell that time will make this affirmation good  not but that i am obliged in justice to own that there are several persons of very great merit who subscribed to his translation of homer but then they were persons most of them who were induced to expect a very different performance to what they found and some were importuned and teased into that subscription some were drawn in by their complaisance to their friends and others sacrificed their judgment to their interest  the calling a man of the best understanding fool dunce blockhead is the easiest thing in the world as we observed above to him who is really all this himself but for such a one to prove what he says is absolutely impossible therefore in the remarks abovementioned upon the translation of homer upon windsorforest upon the temple of fame i have given none of these appellations to the little facetious gentleman at whom those pieces were levelled but then i have proved in them by convincing reason and by undeniable fact that he has a greater right to the possession and property of them than any other person in great britain whatever i have shown that he was equally a stranger to the character the language and the meaning of homer that nothing qualified him to enter the lists against sir john denham but impudence and stupidity and that the temple of fame will as long as it is remembered be to a pe the temple of infamy  i propose to do the same thing in the subsequent remarks i shall call him neither fool nor dunce nor blockhead but i shall prove that he is all these in a most egregious manner it is justly observed by the duke of rochfoucault that a man may be a very great fool notwithstanding his wit but that he never can be so if he has judgment for imagination is common to man with beasts but he enjoys reason and judgment in common with god and angels the impartial reader who knows the rape of the lock and who will read the following remarks will be able to determine whether a pe has shown one dram of judgment either in the choice of this trifling subject or of his more senseless machinery or in the manners and behavior of his fine lady who is so very rampant and so very a termagant that a lady in the hundreds of drury would be severely chastisd if she had the impudence in some company to imitate her in some of her actions the impartial reader is to determine whether the sentiments are not often exceeding poor and mean and sometimes ridiculous and whether the diction is not often impure and ungrammatical  but if the author has not shown one dram of judgment in the piece that has been so much applauded by readers more light than the subject what shall we say of the insipid profund what shall we say of the fulsome dunciad were they not writ in perfect spite to good sense to decency to justice to gratitude to friendship to modesty and can such a creature as this be deserving of the noble name of a poet the name and the function which he has so much blasphemed nay can he deserve even the name of a versifyer whose ear is as injudicious and undistinguishing as the rest of his head the commendation which tasso so justly and so judiciously gives to lucretius is nobilissimo versificatore a most noble versifyer for lucretius knew all the variety the force and the power of numbers so that his harmony in some parts of him has never been surpassed not even by virgil himself but a pe has none of these distinguishing talents nor variety nor force nor power of numbers but an eternal monotony his pegasus is nothing but a battered kentish jade that neither ambles nor paces nor trots nor runs but is always upon the canterbury and as he never mends never slackens his pace but when he stumbles or falls so that having neither judgment nor numbers he is neither poet nor versifyer but only an eternal rhimer a little conceited incorrigible creature that like the frog in the fable swells and is angry because he is not allowed to be as great as the ox  but if judgment reason and numbers are wanting to his rhimes if we take a view of his prosaick rhapsodies it is there a thousand times worse not only judgment and reason are wanting there but veracity integrity honor and faith are wanting a pe sets up for a knight of the post a frank affidavitman of parnassus falsifies matter of fact at pleasure and invents the basest calumnies to expose men of sense to fools in the height of his professions of friendship for mr addison he could not bear the success of cato but prevails upon b l to engage me to write and publish remarks upon that tragedy which after i had done a pe the better to conceal himself from mr addison and his friends writes and publishes a scandalous pamphlet equally foolish and villainous in which he pretends that i was in the hands of a quack who cures mad men so weak is the capacity of this little gentleman that he did not know that he had done an odious thing an action detested even by those whom he fondly designed to oblige by it for mr addison was so far from approving of it that he engaged sir richard steel to write to me and to assure me that he knew nothing of that pamphlet till he saw it in print that he was very sorry to see it and that whenever he should think fit to answer my remarks on his tragedy he would do it in a manner to which i should have no just exception thus mr addison acted like a man of honor and like one who foresaw what he himself had to expect from a wretch who was capable of so much baseness what he foresaw and expected happened a pe libelled him in manuscript while he lived and in print after he died  it is a sure sign that we live in a poor undiscerning degenerate world when one who has writ and acted as this little gentleman has done has been able to delude it so long but as he got such favors by ungenerous arts he has worked himself out of it by his weakness and his baseness by which he has made by a modest computation a hundred thousand enemies and raised indignation and disdain in the breast of every generous and sensible reader he has not only attacked such numbers of people at one time as no one before him ever did in any nation or any age but has grossly abused several very ingenious men and some of them for no other reason but because they had shown an understanding and discernment and a sagacity greatly superior to his own among whom i am obliged in justice to name mr theobald who by delivering shakespeare from the injuries of time and of lazy or ignorant and stupid editors has obliged all who are concerned for the reputation of so great a genius or for the honor of great britain  it was for no other reason that he has libelled mr theobald mr phillips and several others than that they have surpassed him he has been so far from making that distinction which he ought to have done that his malice has been levelled most at those who have most merit which is a certain proof that this little envious creature knows nothing of the nature of satire which can never exist where the censures are not just in that case the versifyer instead of a satirist is a lampooner an infamous libeller none of the ancient satirists neither horace nor persius nor juvenal ever attacked merit and boileau declares that merit is always precious to him and that he has a greater esteem for patru in the midst of indigence than for one who has amassed the greatest treasure by base and unjustifiable means he did not only say this but showed by a very generous action that it was his real sentiment patru had a very noble library consisting of a great number of volumes and all of them very well chosen he was reduced by his circumstances to part with this library in order to satisfy his creditors boileau hearing of this came and paid down the full price for it and never removed a volume but gave patru the enjoyment of the whole during the remainder of his life  but the little gentleman who wrote the dunciad and the profund does not only with infinite baseness reproach authors with poverty who have deserved a thousand times better both of their country and the commonwealth of learning to both which he is an open and a mortal enemy but he has the impudence to infer their want of merit from their want of fortune at this rate spencer the renowned lord bacon butler and otway were dunces and a pe and ned howard and two or three rich and noble lords are poets and great wits at this rate horace too was a dunce because he was not only poor before augustus and his first minister cast a favorable eye upon him but his poverty made him a poet such is the account that he gives of himself in the second epistle of book ii  quem dimisere philippi decisis humilem pennis inopemque paterni et laris and fundi paupertas impulit audax ut versus facerem if horace was poor virgil was not rich before the same magnanimous prince and his wise and discerning minister took him into their protection yet he was so far from contemning poverty that he rather had a contempt for riches witness what he makes evander say to aeneas in the  th aeneid when he introduces him into the homely palace where hercules had lain before  ut ventum ad seeds haec inquit limina victor alcides subiit haec illum regia cepit aude hospes contemnere opes and te quoque dignum finge deo rebusque veni non asper egenis and in his praise of a countrylife at the latter end of the second georgic he seems to make poverty the foundation of the roman greatness  agricola incurvo terram dimovit aratro hinc anni labor hinc patriam parvosque nepotes sustinet hinc armenta boum meritosque juvencos now what follows a little after this  hanc olim veteres vitam coluere sabini hanc remus and frater sic fortis etruria crevit scilicet and rerum facta est pulcherrima roma which his friend horace seems to have done before him in the ode to augustus lib i  regulum and scauros animaeque magnae prodigum paulum superante poena dicam and insigni referem camoena fabriciumque hunc and incomptis curium capillis utilem bello tulit and camillum saeva paupertas and avitus apto cum cure fundus this i will venture to say that there never was a great poet in the world but he had a contempt for riches of which opinion likewise is horace   vatis avarus non temere est animus versus amat hoc studet unum and there never was a little poetaster but he loved them valued himself upon the possession of them and did base things to acquire and to augment them  nothing can show any one more weak or more base than to prefer fortune to merit or vainly and vilely to endeavor to extol fortune and to decry merit god has given extraordinary merit to few but he has subjected all to the vicissitudes of human affairs as well as to diseases and death the greatest and most powerful of monarchs are not exempted from the power of fortune that is from the unchangeable and irresistible decrees of providence nay the greater and more powerful any one is the more deplorable misfortunes is he subjected to and therefore the calamities of the great generally supply the fittest subjects for so noble a poem as tragedy  considering the vicissitude of human affairs men of the greatest fortune and power ought not to value themselves upon either but for this little gentleman to strut and be conceited upon his having a hundred a year to pretend to look down upon those whom he never had capacity to look up to to call their good sense and their reasoning railing because neither of them are his talent to say he will answer what they urge against him when he is as much in debt as they are at the same time that he owes his little substance to a vile translation of a poor but excellent poet who if he was not in debt it was because no body would trust him to do all this entertains the public with the most ridiculous farce in the world notwithstanding this as long as he writes so scandalously as he has lately done in so degenerate an age he will not be without readers for all fools are fond of scandal because all fools are levellers but for the same reasons that he has their approbation he is contemned by men of sound understanding  and now i appeal to every impartial sensible reader who shall have read this and the following remarks and who has formerly read those upon homer windsorforest and the temple of fame if i have not proved both by convincing reason and by undeniable fact that a pe has himself a just and indefeasible right to all those noble appellations and titles which he so foolishly and so wrongfully to himself and company squanders away upon others  remarks on the rape of the lock in several letters to a friend letter i sir may        i shall now according to my promise send you some observations upon the rape of the lock which is one of the last imitations of the little mimicking bard and one of the most impertinent to so high a degree impertinent that i am afraid of being accused of writing a satire upon nothing as my lord rochester wrote a panegyric  the faults of this ridiculous poem begin at the title page i will not insist upon the fantastical composition of the word heroicomical but i desire leave to dwell a little upon the thing what can this author mean by creating in his readers an expectation of pleasantry when there is not so much as one jest in his book of all blockheads he is the most emphatically dull who to an insipid tedious tale prefixes this impertinent prelude now gentlemen expect a very good jest now my masters prepare to laugh instead of heroicomical it should have been heroi tragical since it seems there was a necessity for a fantastical word for there is a great deal of tragedy in this poem but not one jot of comedy but at the same time there is nothing so tragical in it as what the author designs for comedy for whenever he aims at a jest it is such sad deplorable stuff that he never fails to move compassion by it  but now sir to pass from the title page to the dedication he need not have been at the trouble of acquainting his fair patroness that he published what he calls his poem before he had thought of what he calls his machinery for the book would have told her that without the epistle for what he calls his machinery has no manner of influence upon what he calls his poem not in the least promoting or preventing or retarding the action of it as we shall show more plainly when we come to treat of the machines he has taken his machines he tells us from the rosycrucians and it is with them he tells his fair patroness that he must bring her acquainted and how bring her acquainted why he must tell her what the count de gabalis says of them who has given it seems the best account that he knows of them if he had not too much pride the natural necessary consequence of his capacity to be instructed for my lord roscomon is certainly in the right when he tells us that  pride of all others the most dangerous fault proceeds from want of sense or want of thought i would direct him to a better account of them which is to be found in a writer of our own who is infinitely a better judge both of persons and things than the fantastic count de gabalis and that is the most ingenious and most judicious author of hudibras who has given this short account of the rosycrucians in his comment upon two lines which are to be found in the character of ralpho the facetious squire of hudibras canto i part   and which two i have chosen for the motto to these letters  in rosycrucian lore as learned as he that vere adeptus earned the short comment upon which is this  the fraternity of the rosycrucians is very like the sect of the ancient gnostici who called themselves so from the excellent learning they pretended to although they were really the most ridiculous sots of all mankind and then upon the words vere adeptus says he  vere adeptus is one who has commenced in their phanatick extravagance thus if we will believe butler who as we said before is an admirable judge both of books and of mankind this judicious author of the rape has taken what he calls his machinery from the phanatick extravagance of the most ridiculous of all modern sots as their predecessors the gnostici were the most contemptible ones of all the ancient a sect that is as becoming of this merry little gentleman as it was of the facetious squire of hudibras and now tell me in good earnest sir is not the fair lady infinitely obliged to him for her new acquaintance an acquaintance very unbecoming her though very becoming of him  thus sir have i done with the title page and the epistle i shall proceed to morrow upon the body of the book in the mean time i will assure you for your comfort that you shall never have a letter of above a sheet of paper at a time upon this impertinent subject i am sir  your most humble and faithful servant john dennis  letter ii sir may        i hope mine of the first of this month came to your hands which contained some reflections upon the dedication and titlepage of the rape of the lock which latter creates an expectation of pleasantry in us when there is not so much as one jest in the book  quanto rectius hic qui nil molitur inepte how much more judiciously does boileau appear in the title page of his lutrin in a sottish emulation of which this and several late fantastic poems appear both to you and me to have been writ boileau calls his lutrin an heroic poem and he is so far from raising an expectation of laughter either in the title or in the beginning of the poem that he tells monsieur de lamoignon to whom he addresses it that it is a grave subject and must be read with a grave countenance  guard toy de rire en ce grave sujet lutrin chant i butler modestly calls his poem by the name of his hero hudibras and without endeavoring to prepossess his reader leaves the poem itself to work its natural effect upon him  but now sir since i have said that the rape of the lock seems to be writ in imitation of the lutrin i mean so far in imitation that the author had a mind to get reputation by writing a great many verses upon an inconsiderable subject as boileau appears to have done before him i believe it will not be disagreeable to you if i show the difference between the lutrin and this fantastic poem  the rape of the lock is a very empty trifle without any solidity or sensible meaning whereas the lutrin is only a trifle in appearance but under that appearance carries a very grave and very important instruction for if that poem were only what it appears to be boileau would run counter to the famed rule which he has prescribed to others  auteurs pretez l oreille a mes instructions voulez vous fair aimer vos riches fictions qu en scavantes lecons votre muse fertile par tout joigne au plaisant le solid and l utile un lecteur sage fuit un vain amusement et veut mettre a profit son divertissement and which horace has given before him  centuriae seniorum agitant expertia frugis celsi praetereunt austera poemata ramnes omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci lectorem delectando pariterque monendo and the rule which my lord roscomon has given for translations is certainly more strong for originals  take then a subject proper to expound but moral great and worth a poets voice for men of sense despise a trivial choice and such applause it must expect to meet as would some painter busied in a street to copy bulls and bears and every sign that calls the staring sots to nasty wine now since it is impossible that so judicious an author as boileau should run counter to his own and to the instructions of his master horace the lutrin at the bottom cannot be an empty trifle it is indeed a noble and important satirical poem upon the luxury the pride the divisions and animosities of the popish clergy it is true indeed the admirable address of the poet has made it in appearance a trifle for otherwise it would not have been suffered in a bigoted popish country but yet boileau in some places seems to have given broad hints at what was his real meaning as in the following passage  la deesse en entrant qui voit la nappe mise admire un si bell order and reconnoit leglise lutrin chant i and this other passage is still more bold  pour soutenir tes droits que le ciel autorise abime tout plutot c est l esprit de leglise lutrin chant i as the rape of the lock is an empty trifle it can have no fable nor any moral whereas the lutrin has both fable and moral it is true indeed the allegory under which that moral is concealed is not so perspicuous as boileau would have made it if it had not been for the apprehension of provoking the clergy but on the other side it is not so obscure but that a penetrating reader may see through it the moral is that when christians and especially the clergy run into great heats about religious trifles their animosity proceeds from the want of that religion which is the pretense of their quarrel the fable is this two persons being deserted by true piety are embroiled about a religious trifle to the perplexity and confusion of them and theirs upon the return of piety they agree to set aside the trifle about which they differed and are reconciled to the quiet and satisfaction both of themselves and their partisans  if you will be pleased to compare the beginning of the sixth canto with the rest of the poem you will easily see that this account which i have given of the lutrin is not without foundation but you know very well sir that there is not the least shadow of a moral or fable in the rape  as nothing could be more ridiculous than the writing a full an exact and a regular criticism upon so empty a business as this trifling poem i will say but a word or two concerning the incidents and so have done with what relates immediately to the design the intention of the author in writing this poem as we find in the title page is to raise the mirth of the reader and we find by the effects which hudibras and the lutrin produce in us that butler and boileau wrote with the same intention now you know very well sir that in a poem which is built upon an action mirth is chiefly to be raised by the incidents for laughter in comedy is chiefly to be excited like terror and compassion in tragedy by surprise when things spring from one another against our expectation now whereas there are several ridiculous incidents in the lutrin as the owl in the pulpit frighting the nocturnal champions the prelates giving his benediction to his adversary by way of revenge and insult the battle in the booksellers shop etc and whereas there are a thousand such in hudibras there is not so much as one nor the shadow of one in the rape of the lock unless the authors friends will object here that his perpetual gravity after the promise of his title makes the whole poem one continued jest  i am yours etc  letter iii sir may        i come now to the characters and the machines the characters in the lutrin are well marked they are the true resemblances of men of active men who pursue earnestly what they are about but there is no such thing as a character in the rape of the lock belinda who appears most in it is a chimera and not a character she is represented by the author perfectly beautiful and wellbred modest and virtuous let us now see how he sustains these qualities in her and then we shall discover what taste he has of nature and of decorum  first then he represents her perfectly beautiful  sol through white curtains did his beams display and opened those eyes which brighter shone than they and thus in the next page the sylphs accost her  fairest of mortals thou distinguished care of thousand bright inhabitants of air and yet in the latter end of this very canto he makes her owe the greater part of her beauty to her toilette  unnumberd treasures open at once and here the various offerings of the world appear from each she nicely culls with curious toil and decks the goddess with the glittering spoil this casket indias glowing gems unlocks and all arabia breathes from yonder box now awful beauty puts on all its arms the fair each moment rises in her charms repairs her smiles awakens every grace and calls forth all the wonders of her face sees by degrees a purer blush arise and keener lightnings quicken in her eyes nay the very favorite lock which is made the subject for so many verses is not shown so desirable for its native beauty as for the constant artifice employed about it witness what thalestris says to belinda just after she had lost it  was it for this you took such constant care the bodkin comb and essence to prepare for this your locks in paper durance bound for this with torturing irons wreathed around for this with fillets strained your tender head and bravely bore the double loads of lead such artifice must deface the luster of locks which were naturally lovely and the toilette must of necessity detract from perfect beauty the toilette indeed may add to some who are called beauties or to some who would be thought such a decayed superannuated beauty may receive advantage from her toilette may rise in her charms and by the help of spanish red a purer blush may arise but her counterfeit charms can please none who have a taste of nature according to that of tibullus  heu sero revocatur amor seroque juventa cum vetus infecit cana senecta caput tum studium formae est coma tum mutatur ut annos dissimulet viridis cortice tincta nucis but for her who has youth and beauty  illa placet quamvis inculto venerit ore nec nitidum tarda compserit art caput such a one wants neither flounce nor furbelow nor torturing irons nor paper durance when god and nature design a face to please the fairone on whom they bestow it can never add to workmanship divine she may spoil it indeed by industry but can never improve it they who made it alone know the certain ways of going to the heart of man and alone can give it those resistless inimitable graces which industry does but spoil and which artifice does but hide  horace was as fond of his mistresss hair as any modern lover can be witness what he says to maecenas in the twelfth ode of the second book  number tu quae tenuit dives achaemenes aut pinguis phrygiae mygdonias opes permutare velis crine licymniae plenas aut arabum domos and yet as he and the rest of the ancient poets had an admirable taste of nature they had quite another taste of beauty than what this author discovers and believed that the brightest ornament either of the hair or face was simplicity and a becoming negligence  cui flavam religas comam simplex munditiis says horace to pyrrha ode v lib    and in the eleventh ode of lib    quis devium scortum eliciet domo lyden eburna dic age cum lyra maturet incomptam lacenae more comam religata nodum terence who every where so exactly imitates nature takes a quite different course from this author to show a touching beauty the passage is in the first act of his phormio  virgo pulchra and quo magis diceres nil ad erat adjumenti ad pulchritudinem capillus passus nudus pes ipsa horrida lacrymae vestitus turpis ut ni vis boni in ipsa inesset forma haec formam extinguerent here was no care neither of hair nor face nor shape and yet how much more charming does this terentian virgin appear even in rags and misery than belinda does at her toilette i mean to those who have a taste of nature for she who even in this miserable plight moved all beholders with pleasure and antipho with love what might she not justly be supposed to do adorned with a cleanly negligence and simplicity i say adorned with them for it may truly be said of every accomplished beauty what tasso says of one of his  di natura d amor del cielo amici le negligenze sue sono artifici and our ladies who spend so much time at their toilettes would do well to consider that after all the pains which they take in adorning themselves they who are most charmed with their persons endeavor to retrieve their natural beauty in imagination at least by divesting them of their borrowed ornaments and clothing them in the simplicity of the rural habit when in their sonnets they transform them to shepherdesses  but the author has not only shown belinda an accomplished beauty he represents her likewise a fine modest wellbred lady  favors to none to all she smiles extends canto ii and a little below  with graceful ease and sweetness void of pride and yet in the very next canto she appears an arrant ramp and a tomrigg  the nymph exulting fills with shouts the sky the walls the woods and long canals reply must not this be the legitimate offspring of stentor to make such a noise as that the nymph was within doors and she must set up her throat at a hellish rate to make the woods where by the by there are none and the canals reply to it let us turn to the fifth canto and we shall see her there as loud with anger as she is now with joy  restore the lock she cries and all around restore the lock the vaulted roofs rebound not fierce othello in so loud a strain roared for the handkerchief that caused his pain well but his friends will object here that this is an hyperbole and an hyperbole is designed to carry us beyond the truth only that it may make us enter more justly into it and that when virgil says of camilla  illa vel intactae segetis per summa volaret gramina nec teneres cursu laesisset aristas vel mare per medium fluctu suspensa tu menti ferret iter celeres nec tingeret aequore plantas  he means only that camilla was exceeding swift of foot why be it so but then by the same rule must not the author of the rape mean that belinda shouted and roared very loud and that in short she made a diabolick din now is shouting and roaring proper for a wellbred lady are they not below the modesty and the decency even of those sonorous nymphs of the flood who haunt the banks of the vocal thames between the bridge and the tower  let us look once more upon the last canto p    is she not a terrible termagant there and the exact resemblance of magnanos lady in hudibras  see fierce belinda on the baron flies with more than usual lightning in her eyes  now meet thy fate the incensed virago cried and drew a deadly bodkin from her side but belinda is not only shown beautiful and wellbred she is represented virtuous too  favors to none to all she smiles extends and yet in the latter end of the fourth canto she talks like an errant suburbian  oh had thou cruel been content to seize hairs less in sight or any hairs but these thus sir has this author given his fine lady beauty and good breeding modesty and virtue in words but has in reality and in fact made her an artificial dawbing jilt a tomrig a virago and a lady of the lake  there is no other character in this poem worth taking notice of i should now come to the machines in which you might expect to be entertained with something more curious and more ridiculous but i have already detained you too long and must defer it till the next opportunity  i am sir yours etc  letter iv sir may        according to the promise made in my last i am now to treat of the machines in the doing which i shall lie under a great disadvantage for before i come to those of the rape it is necessary to say something of machines in general of the reason of introducing them of the method used by the ancient poets in employing them and of the practice of the greatest and best of the moderns it is necessary to say something to all these in order to show the absurdity of our authors machines and his utter ignorance of the art he pretends to but to treat of all these in as ample a manner as the subject deserves would require a volume and on the other side it would be extravagant to spend a great deal of time to so insignificant an end but when i consider that i write to a gentleman who is perfectly well versed in these matters and who consequently will comprehend a great deal by a little i find to my comfort that it will be easy to avoid both those inconveniences of saying a great deal and of saying nothing  the reasons that first obliged those poets which are called heroic to introduce machines into their poems were  first to make their fable and their action more instructive for says bossu lorsque les poets sont devenus philosophes moraux ils n ont pas cesse detre theologiens au contraire la morale quils traitent les oblige indispensablement de meler la divinite dans leurs ouvrages parceque la conoissance la crainte and l amor de dieu en un mot la piete and la religion sont les premiers and les plus solides fondements des autres vertus and de tout la morale  by introducing machines into their fables the epic poets showed two things   that the great revolutions in human affairs are influenced by a particular providence   that the deity himself promotes the success of an action formed by virtue and conducted by prudence but  secondly the heroic poets introduced machines into their fables in order to make those fables more delightful for the employing machines made the actions of those poems wonderful now every thing that is wonderful is of course delightful let us see what one of the greatest masters among the moderns says to this  qu aenee and ses vaisseaux par les ventes ecartez soient aux bords affricains dun orage emportez ce n est qu une avanture ordinaire and commune qu un coup peu surprenant des traits de la fortune mais que junon constante en son aversion poursvive sur les flots les restes d ilion qu eole on sa faveur les chassant d italy ouvre aux vents mutinez les prisons d eolie que neptune en couroux selevant sur la mer dun mot calm les flots met la paix dans l air deliure les vaisseaux des syrtes les arrache c est la ce qui surprend frappe saisit attache sans tous ces ornamens le verse tomb en langueur la poesy est morte ou rampe sans vigueur le poet nest plus quun orateur timide qu un froid historien dun fable insipide this says the most judicious m despreaux in his art of poetry and the four last lines remind me here of what i have at large discoursed upon other occasions viz that as the epic poets by their machines made the actions of their fables more wonderful and more delightful as well as more instructive they likewise made the poetical expression more wonderful and more delightful since it is from them that they chiefly derive that greatness of expression which renders their works so divine  i shall now come to the practice of the ancient poets and the method which they made use of in introducing their machines in order to render their poems more instructive and more delightful    they took their machines from the religion of their country upon which account these machines made the stronger impression and made their fables and the actions of them probable as well as wonderful for nothing was more natural than for those ancient heathens to believe that the powers which they adored were wont to intermeddle in human affairs and to promote the success of those designs which they favored and nothing could be more natural for them than to believe that that design must prosper which was espoused by jupiter but this was not all for the machines by making the actions of their poems probable made them wonderful to men of sense who never can admire any thing in humanity which reason will not let them believe but   the ancient poets made their machines allegorical as well as their human persons   they opposed them to one another   they showed a just subordination among them and a just proportion between their functions while one was employed about the greatest and the sublimest things another was not busied about the most trifling and most contemptible   they always made their machines influence the actions of their poems and some of those machines endeavored to advance the action of their respective poem and others of them endeavored to retard it   they made them infinitely more powerful than the human persons but secondly the practice of the greatest modern heroic poets is conformable to that of the ancient    they take their machines from the religion of their country witness milton cowley tasso   they make them allegorical   they oppose them to one another   they show a just subordination among them and a just proportion between their functions the author of the rape has run counter to this practice both of the ancients and moderns he has not taken his machines from the religion of his country not from any religion nor from morality his machines contradict the doctrines of the christian religion contradict all sound morality there is no allegorical nor sensible meaning in them and for these reasons they give no instruction make no impression at all upon the mind of a sensible reader instead of making the action wonderful and delightful they render it extravagant absurd and incredible they do not in the least influence that action they neither prevent the danger of belinda nor promote it nor retard it unless perhaps it may be said for one moment which is ridiculous and if here it be objected that the author designed only to entertain and amuse to that i answer that for that very reason he ought to have taken the utmost care to make his poem probable according to the important precept of horace  ficta voluptatis causa sint proxima veris and that we may be satisfied that this rule is founded in reason and nature we find by constant experience that any thing that shocks probability is most insufferable in comedy  there is no opposition of the machines to one another in this rape of the lock umbriel the gnome is not introduced till the action is over and till ariel and the spirits under him have quitted belinda  there is no just subordination among these machines nor any just proportion between their functions ariel summons them together and talks to them as if he were their emperor  ye sylphs and sylphids to your chief give ear fays fairies genii elves and demons hear ye know the spheres and various tasks assigned by laws eternal to the aerial kind some in the fields of purest ether play and bask and whiten in the blaze of day some guide the course of wandering orbs on high or roll the planets through the boundless sky  or brew fierce tempests on the watery main or over the glebe distill the kindly rain others on earth over human race preside watch all their ways and all their actions guide of these the chief the care of nations own and guard with arms divine the british throne now sir give me leave to ask you one question did you ever hear before that the planets were rolled by the aerial kind we have heard indeed of angels and intelligences who have performed these functions but they are vast glorious beings of celestial kind and machines of another system pray which of the aerial kind have these sublime employments for nothing can be more ridiculous or more contemptible than the employments of those whom he harangues  to save the powder from too rude a gale nor let the imprisoned essences exhale there is a difference almost infinite between these vile functions and the former sublime ones and therefore they can never belong to beings of the same species which of the aerial kinds are the movers of orbs on high or the guardians of empires below when he who calls himself their chief is only the keeper of a vile iseland cur and has not so much as the intendance of the ladys favorite lock which is the subject of the poem but that is entrusted to an inferior spirit contrary to all manner of judgment and decorum  the machines that appear in this poem are infinitely less considerable than the human persons which is without precedent nothing can be so contemptible as the persons or so foolish as the understandings of these hobgoblins ariels speech for the first thirty lines is one continued impertinence for if what he says is true he tells them nothing but what they knew as well as himself before and when he comes at length to the point he is full as impertinent as he was in his ramble before for after he has talked to them of black omens and dire disasters that threaten his heroine these bugbears dwindle to the breaking a piece of china the staining a petticoat the losing a necklace a fan or a bottle of sal volatile but we shall consider this passage further when we come to examine the sentiments and then we shall see that sawny takes the change here and it is he a little lump of flesh that talks instead of a little spirit  that which makes this speech more ridiculous is the place where it is spoken and that is upon the sails and cordage of belindas barge which is certainly taken from the two kings of brentford descending in clouds and singing in the style of our modern spirits    king o stay for you need not as yet go astray the tide like a friend has brought ships in our way and on their high ropes we will play but now sir for the persons of these sylphs and sylphids you see what ideas the threats of ariel give us of them when he threatens them that for their neglect they shall  be stopped in viols or transfixed with pins or plunged in lakes of bitter washes lie or wedged whole ages in a bodkins eye discord is described by homer with her feet upon the earth and head in the skies upon which longinus cries out that this is not so much the measure of discord as of homers capacity and elevation of genius even so these diminutive beings of the intellectual world may be said to be the measure of mr popes capacity and elevation of genius they are indeed beings so diminutive that they bear the same proportion to the rest of the intellectual that eels in vinegar do to the rest of the material world the latter are only to be seen through microscopes and the former only through the false optics of a rosycrucian understanding  i shall mention but one or two more of the numerous defects which are to be found in the machines of this poem the one is the spirits which he intends for benign ones are malignant and those which he designs for malignant are beneficent to mankind the gnomes he intends for malignant and the sylphs for beneficent spirits now the sylphs in this poem promote that female vanity which the gnomes mortify and vanity is not only a great defect in human nature but the mother of a thousand errors and a thousand crimes and the cause of most of the misfortunes which are incident to humanity  the last defect that i shall take notice of is that the machines in this poem are not taken from one system but are double nay treble or quadruple in the first canto we hear of nothing but sylphs and gnomes and salamanders which are rosycrucian visions in the second we meet with fairies genii and demons beings which are unknown to those fanatic sophisters in the fourth spleen and the phantoms about are derived from the powers of nature and are of a separate system and fate and jove which we find in the fifth canto belong to the heathen religion  but now sir in treating of these matters i have before i perceived it transgressed the bounds which i prescribed to my self which i desire that you would excuse  i am sir yours etc  letter v sir i have now shown that there is no such thing as a fable or characters in the poem of the rape and that what he calls his machinery is most extravagantly chosen i now come to the sentiments which are more absurd than the rest and of such an odd composition that they are at one and the same time both trivial and extravagant  the absurdity of the sentiments begins with the book and the author stumbles at the threshold  what dire offense from amorous causes springs what mighty quarrels rise from trivial things i sing  this verse to c muse is due where in three lines there are no less than two errors in the sentiments for in the first place though the author has neither fable nor general action yet he proposes to sing something general rather than that particular action which is the subject of his poem and he begins as if he designed to make the reader expect a treatise of lovequarrels which proceeding is just contrary to the practice of homer and virgil and to the dictates of right reason homer and virgil had accomplished fables and their actions at the bottom were universal and allegorical yet they each of them proposed to sing these actions as they had particularized them by the imposition of names homer begins thus  muse sing the baleful fury of achilles and virgil thus  arma virumque cano trojae qui primus ab oris italiam fato profugus lavinaque venit littora  in the third line he does not invoke the muse to sing but proposes to do it himself and though he names the muse immediately afterward he does it forsooth to acquaint her that it is not she but belinda that is to inspire him   this verse to c muse is due this even belinda may vouchsafe to view slight is the subject but not so the praise if she inspire and he approve my lays so that he has desired no assistance from the muse and none she has afforded him  the muse indeed could not possibly assist him in this case the muse is a machine like fate and jove belonging originally to the ethnic system and transferred sometimes to the christian religion only allegorically and the muse cannot be supposed to bring him acquainted with rosycrucian spirits which would destroy her own divinity either as heathen or christian since they are beings utterly unknown either to the ethnic system or to the christian religion so that it is belinda and not the muse that is to inspire him he introduces her into the acquaintance of the sylphs and sylphids in his epistle and she is to bring him acquainted with them in the body of the book and now sir is not this very ingeniously and very judiciously contrived he has desired no assistance from the muse and as i said before none he has had from her the whole poem seems to have been infused by a coquette and not inspired by a muse  i have already acquainted you sir that i would not in the examen of this poem confine my self to an exact and regular method for neither is the subject worth the while nor ought a letter to a friend to be writ with any restraint i shall therefore take the sentiments of this poem as they come in my way without pretending to rank them under their respective classes excepting perhaps the puns which are numerous and by which the author frequently shocks not only the dictates of good sense and the rules of true pleasantry but those of grammar and common english but those we shall omit till we have done with the rest  there is in this first canto page   a very unlucky imitation of a passage in the sixth book of virgil  quae gratia currum armorumque fuit vivis quae cura nitentes pascere equos eadem sequitur tellure repostos which the author of the rape has thus imitated  think not when womans transient breath is fled that all her vanities at once are dead succeeding vanities she still regards and though she plays no more oerlooks the cards her joy in gilded chariots when alive and love of ombre after death survive now there is this remarkable difference between these two passages that what virgil says of the souls in the elysian fields that they were pleased with the same diversions after death of which they were fond in their lifetimes does by no means contradict any doctrine of that religion which the romans derived from the grecians but the passage in the rape shocks the fundamental doctrines of the christian religion and is therefore a most absurd imitation  i have already shown in speaking of the characters how injudicious all that passage is in the  th and  th pages which relates to the toilette and as i do not pretend to show all his errors but only some few which are very gross ones i shall now pass to the second canto in which canto page    there is a remark that cannot but be the effect of very wise and very deep observation  with hairy springes we the birds betray slight lines of hair surprise the finny prey fair tresses mans impertal race ensnare and beauty draws us with a single hair that is to say birds are caught by the heels and fish by the jaws with horsehair and men are hampered by the souls with womans hair tell me truly sir is not this the effect of very wise and very deep observation i have been so taken with these four verses that i could not forbear making the four following in imitation of them  with jingling bells nightfowlers birds betray with these nightanglers catch the finny prey small poets hamper fools by jingling rhimes and nonsense draws them by its senseless chimes in this second canto page    we have another imitation of virgil and one ten times more unhappy than the former in the first canto the passage of virgil is in the second book of the aeneis  dolus an virtus quis in host requirit that is to say if a captain obtains a victory few enquire whether he owed it to stratagem or open force  the imitation is included in the following lines  the adventurous baron the bright lock admired he saw he wished and to the prize aspired resolved to win he meditates the way by force to ravish or by fraud betray for when success a lovers toil attends few ask if fraud or force attained his ends now the mischief of it is that if a lover obtains his ends by force the whole country makes a very severe enquiry into it by their representative a petty jury and if he happens to be convicted of it in that case poor culprit passes his time but scurvily  in the letter which i lately sent you concerning the characters i mentioned several of the sentiments which are to be found in ariels speech but i know not how i omitted that which follows  to fifty chosen sylphs of special note we trust the important charge the petticoat often have we known that sevenfold fence to fail though stiff with hoops and armed with ribs of whale where sir it is easy to observe that as it is belindas petticoat of which he commits the important charge to the sylphs it is the petticoat of the same belinda according to all english meaning and all true grammatical construction that he has known so often to fail in spite of the hoops of whalebone and now i leave you to judge if there was not reason for telling mrs arabella in the epistle that madam belinda was not like her  there seems indeed to be a terrible shock made upon the same petticoat in the beginning of the fifth canto page     all side in parties and begin the attack fans clap silks rattle and tough whalebones crack by tough whalebones he cannot mean those of the fans for they are limber enough besides fans were mentioned in the beginning of this last verse the tough whalebones then at he latter end of it are those of the petticoat and could not possibly be heard to crack unless a violent attack had been made upon it  at the bottom of page    canto iii there is a very notable thought  coffee which makes the politician wise and see through all things with his halfshut eyes sent up in vapors to the barons brain new stratagems the radiant lock to gain now what was this new stratagem or these new stratagems why the baron comes behind belinda as she was drinking her coffee and snap off goes the lock now if this was the new stratagem what in the name of impertinence could be the old one  but the profoundest and wisest reflections of all are at the end of this third canto  what time would spare from steel receives its date and monuments like men submit to fate steel did the labor of the gods destroy and strike to dust the imperial towers of troy steel could the works of mortal pride confound and hew triumphal arches to the ground what wonder then fair nymph thy hair should feel the conquering force of unresisting steel why who the devil besides this bard ever made a wonder of it what before troy town and triumphal arches were built was the cutting off a lock of hair a miraculous thing but we may very properly apply what he says of steel and the cutting off a lock of hair to fire and the burning of a faggot  what time would spare from fire receives its date and lofty piles like men submit to fate fire did the work of demi gods consume and laid in dust the imperial towers of rome fire could the works of mortal pride confound and level this proud city with the ground to fire a victim sacred pauls could fall and eke the regal turrets of whitehall what wonder one poor faggot should expire by the resistless force of conquering fire but sir i have once more unawares transgressed the bounds prescribed to my self and am  yours etc  letter vi sir the complaint which you make of my long silence and the interruption of this weighty affair seems to be a return to that compliment which i designed to make you by discontinuing my observations upon these arrant bawbles it was in complaisance to you that i began to make them and it was out of respect to your judgment that i left them off they began to run into length and i thought i might as reasonably entertain you with voluminous remarks upon mites in cheese or upon eels in vinegar as with tedious observations on mr popes poems  but since it is your desire that i should make an end of what i have begun i am resolved to comply with it as far as my indisposition and my affairs and the satiety which i have contracted in saying so much already will permit me for the difficulty here does not lie in making remarks but in reading the faults are so gross and so numerous that there is no more pleasure in finding them than there is in hunting in a harewarren  i am now come to the sentiments which are to be found in the fourth and fifth cantos of this notable poem i shall only take notice of a very few by which you and your friends may judge of the whole  the first thing i shall take notice of is the impertinent journey of umbriel the gnome who  down to the central earth his proper scene repairs to search the gloomy cave of spleen page   now to what purpose does this fantastic being take this journey why to give belinda the spleen in order to which spleen equips him with a bottle and a bag as a country dame does her ploughjobber to equip him for his days work  a wondrous bag with both her hands she binds like that where once ulysses held the winds there she collects the force of female lungs sighs sobs and passions and the war of tongues a viol next she fills with fainting fears soft sorrows melting griefs and flowing tears now what could be more impertinent than this journey of umbriel or more vain and useless than this gift of spleen whether we look upon the bag or the bottle  umbriel descends to the central earth to give belinda the spleen now it is plain that before his descent he leaves her mad and upon his return finds her in a fit of the mother  that before his journey he leaves her mad is i think pretty plain from page     then flashed the livid lightning from her eyes and screams of horror rend the affrighted skies not louder shrieks by dames to heaven are cast  that upon his return he finds her in a fit of the mother is manifest from p     sunk in thalestris arms the nymph he found her eyes dejected and her hair unbound how absurd was it then for this ignis fatuus to take a journey down to the central earth for no other purpose than to give her the spleen whom he left and found in the height of it and why does this impertinent devil who sees this give himself the trouble which he takes in the following lines  full over their heads the swelling bag he rent and all the furies issued at the vent belinda burns with more than mortal ire ibid now pray what were the furies enclosed in this bag why we were told what they were a little higher viz the force of female lungs and bedlam passions and the war of tongues now could belinda have more of those than she had before the gnome took his journey  then flashed the livid lightning from her eyes and screams of horror rend the affrighted skies and as for the bottle that seems like trinca los rather to comfort her than to ferment her more for let us but consider the condition in which umbriel found her upon his return  sunk in thalestris arms the nymph he found her eyes dejected and her hair unbound that is to say she was stark mad  now let us compare this condition with that in which she appears after she has a dram of the bottle  but umbriel hateful gnome forbears not so he breaks the viol whence the sorrows flow now pray what is the consequence why belinda of a sudden comes to herself holds up her head and is calm enough to make reflections  the next thing i shall take notice of is the equipage of spleen and this authors giving her two handmaids the one of which ought rather to be her mother than her maid and the other can have nothing at all to do with her  two handmaids wait the throne alike in place but differing far in figure and in face here stood ill nature like an ancient maid  here the author with a great deal of judgment makes a universal subordinate to a particular ill nature may with some color be said to be the mother of spleen but she can never be called her maid without shocking common sense the nature of a man must be coeval to the man and must far precede any thing that the world calls spleen in him but let us take a view of her other handmaid page     there affectation with a sickly mien shows in her cheeks the roses of eighteen now affectation can never have any thing to do with spleen spleen is the mother of passion which is nature affectation is the child of tranquillity and for the most part is nothing but counterfeit passion now he who has violent passions of his own is hardly at leisure to counterfeit those which are foreign to him and therefore it has been often seen that when too much felicity has made a fop affected spleen and adversity have brought him back to nature  i will not take notice of the various errors in the description of what he calls the palace of spleen i shall content myself with the mention of one of them which may not improperly be called the impossible transformation  unnumberd throngs on every side are seen of bodies changed to various forms by spleen here living teapots stand one arm held out one bent the handle this and that the spout a pipkin there like homers tripod walks here sighs a jar and there a goosepie talks men prove with child as powerful fancy works and maids turned bottles call aloud for corks now sir i appeal to you and your friends if ever there was such execrable stuff such lamentable such deplorable pleasantry what says horace  scribendi recte sapere est and principium and sons good sense is the sole foundation of good writing and according to him boileau  quelque sujet qu on traite ou plaisant ou sublime que toujours le bon sens saccorde avec le rhyme good sense is the only foundation both of pleasantry and sublimity but that which is out of truth is certainly out of nature and good sense now was ever any thing more out of truth than the foregoing description instead of giving spleen a power to bring melancholy delusions upon mortals and to cheat them with false appearances this author gives her the power really to transform bodies and makes umbriel the gnome who as a spirit is supposed to see things as they are actually and really to behold that extravagant transformation but so much for the sentiments of the fourth canto  as the fifth is very short and very insipid and as your humble servant is very much tired i shall make but two observations upon it  in the beginning of it there is a rampant scuffle which i suppose our author took from the rankness of a buttockball so little is it becoming of persons of condition  all side in parties and begin the attack fans clap silks rustle and tough whalebones crack heroes and heroines shouts confusedly rise and bass and treble voices strike the skies no common weapons in their hands are found like gods they fight nor dread a mortal wound the latter part is something odd in the mouth of the translator of homer who ought to know that both mars and venus had been wounded by diomedes but if no common weapons are found in the hands of these combatants pray what weapons are they which make the silks to rustle and the whalebones to crack but let us consider what follows  so when bold homer makes the gods engage and heavenly breasts with human passions rage  against pallas mars latona hermes arms and all olympus rings with loud alarms joves thunder roars heaven trembles all around blue neptune storms the bellowing deeps resound earth shakes her nodding towers the ground gives way and the pale ghosts start at the flash of day now sir who says that this passage is not very justly applied to a catterwauling but the latter part of it is not taken from homer but from his most impertinent imitator monsieur de la motte and neither the one nor the other trifler seem to have known any thing in this passage of the solemnity and the dreadful majesty of homer  in the beginning of the next page the following lines are full of miserable pleasantry  while through the press enraged thalestris flies and scatters death around from both her eyes a beau and witling perished in the throng one died in metaphor and one in song o cruel nymph a living death i bear cried dapperwit and sunk beneath his chair a mournful glance sir fopling upwards cast those eyes are made so killing  was his last so that here we have a real combat and a metaphorical dying now is not that sir very ludicrous what did he fight or make love as professors read or as popes fulminate ex cathedra i cannot imagine how he could do that unless he had got belinda or thalestris upon his lap  thus sir have i gone through several of the sentiments upon the rape which are either trifling or false but there are a great many lines which have no sentiment at all in them that is no reasonable meaning such are the puns which are every where spread throughout it puns bear the same proportion to thought that bubbles hold to bodies and may justly be compared to those gaudy bladders which children make with soap which though they please their weak capacities with a momentary glittering yet are but just beheld and vanish into air of this nature is that pun in the   th canto p     see fierce belinda on the baron flies with more than usual lightning in her eyes nor fears the chief the unequal fight to try who sought no more than on his foe to die that is to say he wished for nothing more than to fight with her because he desired nothing more than to lie with her now what sensible meaning can this have unless he takes her for a russian who is to grow passionately fond of him by the extraordinary gallantry of a lusty bastinado such likewise is that quibble in the following page  boast not my fall he cried insulting foe thou by some others shall be laid as low now we heard nothing before of the barons lying low all that we heard is that by a dextrous toss of this modest virgin his nostrils were filled with snuff so that he seems here to say the same thing to her that nykin says to cocky in the old bachelor i have it in my head but you will have it in another place what follows seems to be very extraordinary  nor think to die dejects my lofty mind all that i dread is leaving you behind rather than so ah let me still survive and burn in cupids flames but burn alive now sir who ever heard of a dead man that burnt in cupids flames  of the same nature are those numerous banters in rhyme which are to be found throughout this poem which are so uniform and so much of a piece that one would swear the author were giving a receipt for dry joking for by placing something important in the beginning of a period and making something very trifling follow it he seems to take pains to bring something into a conjunction copulative with nothing in order to beget nothing of this there are diverse instances in ariels speech in the   d canto  this day black omens threat the brightest fair that ever deserved the watchfullst spirits care some dire disaster or by force or slight but what or where the fates have wrapped in night whether the nymph shall break dianas law or some frail china jar receive a flaw or stain her honor or her new brocade forget her prayers or miss a masquerade or lose her heart or necklace at a ball or whether heaven has doomed that shock must fall which by the way i suppose is designed as a bitter bob for the predestinarians raillery apart we pretend not to deny that the very minutest events are foredoomd by eternal prescience but that heaven should give notice of the death of a vile dog by what he calls black omens is a great deal too strong heaven could do no more for caesar himself the very top of the human creation and the foremost man of the universe  but now sir give me leave to ask you one question is ariel in jest or in earnest in haranguing the spirits at this rate is he in earnest why then even robin goodfellow himself is not a more senseless insignificant hobgoblin is he in jest why then all this is a very grand impertinence since it does not so much as aim at any thing for how can the spirits be any ways influenced by these dry jokes of their leader  of the same stamp and the same contrivance are these lines in the beginning of the   d canto  here britains statesmen often the fall foredoom of foreign tyrants and of nymphs at home here thou great anna whom three realms obey do sometimes council take and sometimes tea  one speaks the glory of the british queen and one describes a charming indian screen as i said above sir is not here a receipt for dry joking and can any thing be more easy than to be a wit at this rate  but so much for the sentiments in this rape of the lock i should now come to the expression but i have already transgressed the bounds i prescribed to myself and it is time to take pity of myself and you i am sir  yours etc  letter vii sir though i am heartily tired with what i have already sent you and am really ashamed of having passed a week in thinking on such an empty jingling trifle as the rape of the lock a wretched rhapsody writ for the amusement of boys and men like boys and though i am both very much indisposed at present and very busy yet since i have received your commands to send you some remarks upon the expressions in that bawble in order to complete the conversion of mrs s i will in obedience to those commands do myself a little more violence and will do it in as short a time and as small a compass as i can for i will confine myself to the first twelve lines that by the numerous faults which will be seen in them any one to whom you may happen to show this letter may be able to judge of the rest  this rhapsody begins with absurdity  what dire offense from amorous causes springs what mighty contests rise from trivial things i sing  this verse to c muse is due this even belinda may vouchsafe to view slight is the subject but not so the praise if she inspire and he approve my lays the two first of these lines and the beginning of the third are out of all grammatical construction for here the verb active sing has no accusative case depending on it as the nominative case is without a verb in the beginning of the prologue to cato which prologue was writ by the same little whimsical gentleman  the word muse is a mere expletive and can have nothing to do here since it is belinda only that is to inspire him  there are no less than six faults in the six lines which he calls his invocation  say what strange motive goddess could compel a wellbred lord to assault a gentle belle o say what stranger cause yet unexplord could make a gentle belle reject a lord and dwells such rage in softest bosoms then and dwells such daring souls in little men now all this if it were not for the rhyme would appear even to fools as well as to men of sense the poorest and most contemptible stuff that ever laid the gentle reader asleep i would fain know what the word goddess in the first line  the muse or belinda goddess by the usual signification of the word relates to muse but according to grammar and construction it relates to belinda because she was mentioned last and she is the inspiring person the word compel in the first line likewise is a botch for the sake of the rhyme the word that should naturally have been used was either induce or provoke the word compel supposes the baron to be a beast and not a free agent now sir what a pretty sense these two first lines make  say what strange motive goddess could compel a wellbred lord to assault a gentle belle that is what could force a wellbred man to be damnably rude and to show himself an errant clown and a brute as for the terms gentle belle they are too affected too weak and too low and by no means come up to what is said to belinda in the very next page by ariel the sylph  fairest of mortals thou distinguished care of thousand bright inhabitants of air for belle and beau as we have made them as it were english substantives do not signify so much as beautiful though as they are french adjectives they have that signification no man when he calls another beau means that that other is handsome but only that he takes a great deal of poppish care about his dress and gives himself a great many fantastic airs in order to please superficial people and render himself ridiculous to men of sense belle has much the same signification and according to the present use and acceptance of the word no more signifies a beautiful woman than coquette does but only one that takes a great deal of fruitless pains to make herself more agreeable than god and nature have made her but let us go on to the next couplet  oh say what stranger cause yet unexplord could make a gentle belle reject a lord the cause was because she did not like him a strange cause indeed and which required a great deal of sagacity to find it out but to what purpose is the word reject belinda granted him every thing that he asked of her he desired to wait upon her to hamptoncourt and she granted it he desired her to make one at ombre and she complied with that request likewise if she granted no more it was because he asked no more for if we may believe herself by what she says at the beginning of the fourth canto she would have refused him nothing unless it was her favorite lock  oh had thou cruel been content to seize hairs less in sight or any hairs but these for she who seems inclined to sacrifice her modesty to her vanity would in all likelihood have sacrificed it to her pleasure in short the baron is so far from making love in this rhapsody that he plainly shows by the rude affront which he puts upon belinda that he expected no particular favor from her and indeed this party of pleasure at hampton court seems to me to look more like catterwauling than the behavior of persons who went thither with any amorous design but let us proceed to the next couplet  and dwells such rage in softest bosoms then yes most certainly does it and if this little gentleman had not had a head more soft than belindas bosom he could never have been capable of asking so simple a question the softer sex are much more subject to violent passions than men virgil showed a softness in dido which this little gentleman is utterly incapable of comprehending a softness which obliged a sovereign queen whose understanding was equal to her supreme power or to her greatness of mind to grant the last favor to the trojan hero and yet that softness was immediately succeeded by a rage to whose force and whose noble enthusiasm this little creature who is as diminutive an author as he is an animal is as utterly incapable of raising himself as an earthly vapor is of ascending to heaven but though nothing is more plain than that rage may dwell in softest bosoms yet had it no more to do here than reject and indeed had the less to do here because of reject for cannot a lady deny a gentleman who makes a civil request to her but she must sall immediately into as raving a fit as she could have done if he had extorted the favor from her reject shows contempt rather than rage it shows that she did not esteem the baron enough to be at all angry with him but let us come to the second line of the couplet  and dwells such daring souls in little men yes certainly daring souls dwell often in little men and for that very reason because they are little men did he never hear of what statius says of little tydeus   totosque infusa per artus major in exiguo regnabat corpore virtus i myself know a little monster who i dare venture to prophesy will one day show as daring a soul as a mad indian who runs a muck but what occasion is there for daring souls here the baron shows a good deal of brutality and a good deal of perfidy but no daring he showed a great deal of courage indeed in coming treacherously behind a lady and cutting off her favorite lock  but all this piece is like windsor forest or the temple of fame below criticism and therefore i take my leave of you it would be unreasonable to expect that you should read remarks with pleasure which i write with pain remarks which may be made by the most ordinary reader without any penetration or any sagacity besides i have given a sufficient sample to enable mrs s to judge of the rest for as a lion is known by his claws an ass is known by his ears  i am etc  finis
