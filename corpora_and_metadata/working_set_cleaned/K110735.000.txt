george augustus prince of wales etc and knight of the most noble order of the garter  scul   to his royal highness georgeaugust prince of wales etc knight and companion of the most noble order of the garter pardon me mighty prince that in the crowd of your joyful and devoted britons one of an obscure fame presumes to lay his humble offering at your feet  it is the history of the most noble order of the garter which from its first institution has been constantly worn by persons of the highest birth and most illustrious merit  if the style and manner in which it is treated were proportionable to the dignity of the subject there would need no apology for this dedication for to whom next to the great sovereign of the garter whose true heir you are in all manner of virtue and honor could this treatise have recourse for protection but to your royal highness who are the premier knight of this most noble order and the standing grace and ornament of it  but far above all particular views are the unspeakable blessings derived to these kingdoms by the succession of your illustrious royal house every briton seems new born and to have borrowed fresh influence from its glorious presence  the godlike virtues of your royal father are not to be excelled and should we venture to express an equality it can only be the appearance of your royal highness imitating so great a pattern  as he is wise and good beyond praise so has he a title to the hearts of his people beyond question which stands confirmed by the highest instances of divine providence as well as the incontestible authorities of temporal laws on these foundations what glorious prospects may we not build of future happiness  it were easy to dwell on this subject were it not wasting moments of much more concern to your royal highness than what i am able to express  may your royal highness long live to adorn this most noble order and to support the crown by a bountiful and flourishing issue that there may never want one of your royal line to sit on the throne of great britain  is the ardent prayer of illustrious sir your royal highnesss most faithful most obedient and humbly devoted servant thomas walker  the preface those who are acquainted with mr ashmoles history of the most noble order of the garter will easily satisfy themselves that no pains or industry was wanting to perfect and complete so voluminous a work he had the encouragement of a very gracious prince and the use of public records more particularly the several books of the order with the assistance of several mss wrote by the officers of arms who bore part in the ceremonies or went on embassies to stranger kings princes etc and by their constant observations were familiarly versed in all its laws and customs  these were very great helps to him and it must be confessed his own elaborate study had not less owing to it there is nothing that has relation to this most noble order which he has not touched on and indeed it is a work so very copious that he does himself acknowledge he has inserted some things of little importance which he desires may be considered to be done to gratify some few who have a more immediate concern therein  the reader will in this treatise find little else omitted a very painful and exact abridgment has been made many corrections of the authors which he saw before his death and left among his other books in his library at oxford are here carefully altered some additions are made a list continued of the several knightscompanions as well as officers of the order for above forty years and the coats of arms of abundance of the knightscompanions visibly corrected from good authorities and every distinct chapter treated of at large so that this work has not been completed but at great labor as well as expense which could not have been supported but for the encouragement some of the knightscompanions of the most noble order were pleased to give it as well in their subscriptions as in the good opinion they seemed to express of the design  the history of the most noble order of the garter it was undoubtedly a good sentiment in the first collector of this learned work to introduce as well as a discourse of knighthood in general a treatise of all the several orders that have prevailed in other parts of the world for these in their rise and institutions having a relative sense to the particular subject he was to illustrate seemed to afford him a very good opportunity of doing it by building on so convenient a foundation  i shall therefore though much more confined to brevity follow the same method making it serve as a proper introduction there being many things in the voluminous original which i conceive may with less inconveniency be dispensed with  it was a constant maxim in all wellregulated governments to give a just encouragement to merit and this by proportioning rewards to the service done for merit must be supposed to consist in the performance of some virtuous or heroic action directed for the public good and as virtue is either military or civil so the distribution of rewards is different either by bestowing degrees and titles of honor or by donations of wealth so that in either construction virtue may have its proper and suitable reward  but the proper reward of military virtue is honor to which distinct head this work is confined honor which aristotle calls the greatest of exterior goods and being an object of a nobler ambition than the accumulation of wealth is principally the aim of that virtue we understand by valor which springs from more generous spirits and has been the constant foundation of raising men to the highest eminence of glory and superior dignity  but that fame might not lose it self in an unbounded notion it was at length thought fit to reduce honor into form and order by investing the person meriting with some particular title or appellation of excellence the original of all nobility of which knighthood as it has been accounted the most suitable reward to the greatest virtue so it has been esteemed the chief and primary honor among many nations  the romans held honor and virtue in that esteem that they deifyd and dedicated temples to them they made them so contiguous in their situation that there was no other passage to that of honor but through the temple of virtue mystically admonishing that honor was not to be attained by any other way  in several of the roman coins we see honor and virtue represented together in one reverse and in one medal the face of honor so shadows that of virtue that but a little of it appears honor being the more illustrious of the two and where we behold any person outwardly adorned with it we are to judge him inwardly endued with virtue inasmuch as honor is his due and justly bestowed upon him     in tracing the original of knighthood we are not so vain to say with the french that s michael was the premier chevalier yet thus much we may assert that tis near as ancient as valor and heroic virtue notwithstanding the ceremonies and circumstances of  have varied according to several ages and nations and therefore with much probability we may derive the original of military honor from the trojans and greeks among whom as knights of great renown were hector troilus aenes antenor agamemnon menelaus pelus tydeus etc and thus homer uses the word  in the same sense as eques was afterward among the latins    among whom thus nestor spoke that honored knight     upon a more substantial basis we shall descend to the romans among whom in the very infancy of their military glory a society of knights was instituted immediately after their union with the sabines romulus enrolled centuriae tres equitum three centuries of knights out of the chiefest families whom he appointed to be his lifeguard and called them cleres from their activity and dispatch in martial affairs  tarquinius priscus made an addition to these centuries the like did servius tullius who ordained that those who should succeed in that body should be elected ex censu viz from a considerable and certain valuation of their estates who had the greatest cens and were of the most noble families says dyonys halicarn and soon after the equestrian class began to be formed and constituted one of the three orders of the commonwealth which were thus ranked according to livy senatus ordo equestris and plebs which in the roman literal notes is set down after this manner con sen e ord p q r and forasmuch as this degree is placed between the patricians or senators and the plebeians it answers exactly the state of our knights between the nobility and commonalty and from this order to the height of nobility which resided in the senators was the way prepared junius brutus being the first who was raised to a senator from the equestrian order  it was a constitution as old as tibriuss reign that none should be admitted unless freeborn or a gentleman for three generations and indeed for a long time none were elected knights but the best sort of gentlemen and persons of extraction as was the illustrious macenas  aavis regibus ortns eques mart  who aspired no higher not out of any incapacity of attaining greater honors but that he desired them not says paterculus yet at length through corruption of times plebeians and freedmen being too frequently received into this degree too near a parallel among the knights of this age occasioned their power to grow less and less till it shrunk to nothing so that the places and offices of judges which they before had executed became conferrable upon the publicans and when cicero was consul anno ab urbe conditi   0 the equestrian order stood in need of reestablishment whereupon they were then incorporated into that commonwealth in the third degree all acts passing in the name of the senate the people of rome and the equestrian order  they often enjoyed abroad the government of several provinces whereof egypt had this peculiar to itself that none of the senators were admitted but only those of the equestrian order whose decrees augustus commanded to be had in like regard as if the magistrates of rome or kings consuls or praetors had pronounced them  as a mark of eminence they had the titles of splendidi and illustres bestowed upon them and sometimes have been called most sacred knights  and besides other privileges they had seats with the senators in the circus maximus and by the roscian law sat next them in the theaters they had likewise a college called collegium equitum and temples were dedicated to the goddess fortune under the title of equestri fortunae  having shown the dignity and honors of the equestrian order among the romans we shall now touch upon the degrees of knighthood which have been personal and may be comprehended under the modern title of equites aurati or milites simplices as distinguished from the several orders of chivalry instituted in christendom in the circumstance of whose creation we confess nothing in the roman ordo equestris has place though that might be the ground and original of the dignity and one common end in both namely the pursuit of military exploits and service in the wars     of the degrees of knighthood we shall first of the monozons i e knights begirt with the military girdle a custom devolved to the germans and gauls from ancient times and from them to afterages  sir henry spelman notes that the late emperors conferred the dignity af knighthood with the military girdle instead of all other arms because that part more eminent amongst them girdeth supporteth and adorneth the rest whence seldom calls this girding the most essential part of the ceremony nor do we find among the various ceremonies of knighthood any that have continued so constant in practice as the endowing with girdle and sword ornaments proper to the dignity and marks of honor and virtue with which the statues and portraitures of knights on their gravestones have been adorned  for as at this day knights are styled equites aurati from the golden spurs heretofore put on at their creation so were they more anciently singulo miletari donati in respect when any one was knighted he was not only smitten with the sword but invested with sword and belt yet retained at the creating our knights of the bath as the old formulary thus has it then shall the king of great favor take the sword and gid the quire therewith  secondly the baccalaurei or knights batchelors are to be considered who are indifferently styled chevaliers milites equites aurati and knights this degree is truly accounted the first of all military dignity and the foundation of all honors in our nation and is derived from if not the same with that immediately preceding for as the ceremony of a gentle touch on the shoulder with the flat side of the sword has been since used instead of girting with the sword and belt especially in times of war or in haste as an initiation into the military order so on the contrary it is not unusual nowadays for the prince at least gladi if not cingulo donare for he oftentimes bestows the sword upon the person he knighe  miraeus gives them the epithet aurati from the privilege of wearing gold upon their swords and spurs omitting tiraquels fanciful distinction between miles and eques auratus who allows the former to signify a knight noble before and the other to denoe one whom we call a knight and no gentleman or applicable to the neapoan gentlemen usually called cavaliri who are all styled equites though they never have attained the knightly dignity  the third sort were knights banerets who so well deserved in the wars that they were afterward permitted to use vexillum quadratum a square banner whence they were called equites vexillarii or chevaliers a buniere from the dutch banerheere lord or master of the banner  camden conceives this title first devised by k edward   in recompense of martial prowess a recital of which dignity is mentioned in a patenr  0 e   to john coupland for his service in taking david king of scots prisoner but it was much more ancient with us as well as in france and they had particular robes and other ornaments given them from the crown ad apparatum suum pro militia tanquam pro baneretto a rege suscipienda etc viz ad unum tunicam etc after which is set down the particular robes and other ornaments appointed for his creation  to show this dignity yet more ancient there is the evidence of a writ in k edw  ds time for furnishing thomas bardolf with the robes of a baneret it is an honor esteemed the last among the greatest viz nobilitum majorum or the first of the second rank and is placed in the middle between the barons and the other knights in which respect the baneret may be called vexillarius minor as if he were the lesser bannerbearer to the end he might be so differenced from the greater namely the baron to whom the right of bearing a square banner does belong  but there are some remarkable differences between these knights and knightsbatchelors as in the occasions and circumstances of their creations the baneret being not created unless at a time when the kings standard is erected and that he bears his own banner in the field whilst the knightbatchelor follows that which is another  this farther difference is observed between them that the knightbaneret had so many gentlemen his servants at command as that he could raise a banner and make up a company of soldiers to be maintained at his table and with his own pay but the knightbatchelor had not sufficient for this and therefore marched under the banner of another and the wages of the baneret were double  nxt to these we are to mention knights of the bath which is a degree that has the investiture and title of knight with an additional denomination derived from part of the ceremony of his creation it is the general received opinion that our k hen   first instituted these knights which is justified by sir john froisard who says he created    of them at his coronation choosing them from such as were either his favorites or had pretensions to it from their personal merits or services  but if the ceremonies and circumstances of their creation be well considered it may be inferred that he rather restored the ancient way of making knights than instituted them and consequently that the knights of the bath are really no other than knightsbatchelors that is such as are created with those ceremonies wherewith knightsbatchelors were formerly created by ecclesiastics but some of them having been laid aside were then brought again into use and made peculiar to this degree and since continued to them upon some solemn and great occasion  at the first view they look like a distinct order of knighthood but cannot be so accounted because they have no statutes assigned them nor are in case of vacancy supplied the essentials of distinct orders nor do they wear their robes beyond the time of that occasion upon which they were created as chiefly the coronation of a king or queen the creation of a prince of wales duke of york and the like whereas also their number is uncertain and always at the pleasure of the king  favine calls them knights of the crown because to distinguish them from esquires they wore upon their left shoulder an escutcheon of black silk embroidered with three crowns of gold but therein he mistakes for they never used only a silk lace and the jewel they wore was made of gold containing three crowns with this motto tria juncta in una hanging down under the left arm at a carnation ribbon worn cross the body  this leads us to the degree of baronets who seem allied to knighthood by having granted them the addition of sir to be set before their names but this gives them not the dignity of knighthood nor can they properly be flyled knights until they be actually knighted  it is a degree erected anno   jac   and the grant made by letters patents under the great seal of england it is hereditary to them and the heirs male of their bodies lawfully begotten for ever and by a subsequent decree of the said king precedence is granted to them before all banerets except such as should be made by the king under his standard displayed in an army royal in open war and the king personally present and next to and immediately after the younger sons of viscount and barons  the ground for erecting this degree was partly martial for though themselves were not enjoined personal service in the wars yet each baronet was to maintain thirty foot soldiers for three years in ireland after the rate of eight pence per day for the defense of that kingdom and chiefly to secure the plantation of ulster  they were at least to be descended from a grandfather on the fathers side that bore arms and had a revenue of  000 l per ann or lands of old rents of equal value with  000 l per ann of improved lands or at least two parts of three of such estate in possession the other third in reversion expectant upon one life held only in jointure  the year after king james i added some new privileges and ornaments viz to knight those already made that were no knights and the heirs hereafter of every baronet should at the age of one and twenty years receive knighthood likewise that all baronets might bear in canton or in an inescutcheon the arms of ulster and farther to have place in the armies of the king in the gross near about the royal standard  since the institution of baronets in england there have been made diverse in ireland after the like form and the knights of nova scotia in the west indies were ordained in imitation of baronets in england by the said king james a d      for the planting that country by scotch colonies and the degree made likewise hereditary  these latter wear an orange tawny ribbon as their badge to distinguish them from other knights and it appears there was an intention      to move his then majesty that all baronets and knights bachelors might wear ribbons of several colors some badge or jewel in such sort as did the knights of the bath to distinguish the one from the other but that matter dropped     we shall now observe the etymology of eques miles chevalier ritter and sir the grecians had a title of honor equivalent to the signification of eques in the latin from equs an horse because one part of the ceremony whereby this honor became conferred was the giving of an horse or because having an horse at the public charge they received the stipend of an horseman to serve in the wars horses being symbols of war bello armantur equi it is to be noted that the degree of knighthood in the dialects of other nations has the same derivation for in the french a knight is called chevalier in the german ridder or ritter q d rider so the gheslagen ridder is interpreted the dubbed knight in the italian it is cavagliero in the old british morchog concerning which hear one of jeffery chaucers scholars  eques ab equo is said of very right and chevalier is said of chevalrie in which a rider called is a knight arragoners done also specify caballiero through all that party is dame of worship and so took his ginning of spurs of gold and chiefly riding and though the word miles signified at first any legally enrolled for the war which inrolment was twofold honoraria and vulgaris yet upon the decay of the roman empire upon the irruption of the innumerable forces of the alani goths vandals etc which consisted in horse their foot was rendered useless miles was no longer said of him that served on foot in the wars but began to be properly spoken of the horseman whence it came into vogue that among the titles of nobility he who had that of miles bestowed on him was understood to be horseman or eques that is of the equestrian dignity  seldom observes miles to be equivocal and that in the old feodal laws of the empire it signified a gentleman as the word gentleman is signified in nobilis and with us it has been frequently used to denote both gentlemen and knights for milites denotes gentlemen or great freeholders and not dubbed knights viz such who hold by knights service from a lord of a manor and such who are chosen from the several counties to serve in the high courts of parliament  miles even in the saxon times denoted sometimes a dignity but about the year  0   becoming a title of honor it is since most generally appropriated to persons who have received knighthood correspondent to eques and chevalier though indeed less proper in regard knighthood is the dignity of horsemanship and the tenure of lands by knights fees here in england anciently called regale servitium is in truth horse service and the tenants such as served the king on horseback in wars are gentlemen at least if not of noble extraction  minshew says the equites which heretofore followed and accompanied the emperor are in the german tongue called knechtes that is servitors or ministers but camden says knecht in saxon cniht was in far more ancient times accepted as an honorary title and among the old germans signified a person armed with spear and lance the ensigns of their knighthood as in aftertimes such were among other nations adorned with a girdle and belt since called equites aurati and sometimes simply milites  the addition sir to the names of all knights banerets knights of the bath and bachelor knights pronounced at the time when they are created with this compellation arise sir john or sir thomas etc is accounted parcel of their style which the banerets enjoy by virtue of a clause in their patent it is a contraction of the old french sire taken for seigneur or lord from the greek  but how it came to be first given we cannot find nevertheless our english writers have bestowed it upon the major part of the nobility after they had been received into the order of knighthood and in the life of st thomas becker written about the time of king edw   we meet with the title prefixed to the names of the four knights who slew the said st thomas     the ensigns of the equestrian order among the romans by which they were made was a public horse or a gold ring yet still to those who had equestrian cense the horse was the ancienter badge of the two but when through the multitude of these knights no public horses were assigned but to such who were ready to enter upon military service and to fight in the legions such were called legionary knights to distinguish them from the rest who had only received the honor of a goldring for they were not all employed in wars  the censor after the institution of that offiee ab urbe condita   0 and afterward the emperor were the persons who bestowed this equus militaris or publicus as it was called from the annual allowance to keep him which they gave unto those of known virtue and approved life compelling him to serve in the wars though against his will but in the more ancient method of election constraint was not used and upon negligence in the care of these horses or any blemish reproach or infamy or loss of patrimony in the knights the horses were not only taken away but the knights wholly disfranchisd rosinus laying down the manner and order used in ejecting such knights adds a recital being made of all the knights that were enrolled those whose names he omitted were thereby understood to be deprived of that dignity  when they had served in the wars the time appointed by law it was the custom to lead their horses by the bridle into the forum before the duumvirs censors and giving an account under whom and what generals or captains they had served they were thereupon dismissed from farther service in the wars an example whereof plutarch relates to have been given by pompey himself  but whereas among the roman inscriptions we find equo publico honoratus donatus ornatus and exornatus such is not to be construed to be of equestrian dignity but only to have received the praemia militaria with which the emperors used to recompense some particular exploit by the honor of such a gift according to salmasius equus publicus by a wondrous nevertheless an accustomed speech among the romans is the knight qui equo publico meret and qui equo publico donatus the other deserving person  as to the ring in genesis we read of pharoahs taking off his ring and putting it upon josephs hand when they came in fashion with the romans the senators at first wore iron ones which were accounted the ensign of military virtue received upon a public account howbeit in process of time when gold rings were drawn into use none but senators and knights had them the difference among the rings of the three orders in the state were as licetus observes gold rings set with precious stones were given to the senators only plain rings without stones to the knights and iron rings to the plebeians or freebornmen insomuch that equestri dignitate donare and annulo honorare is a promiscuous phrase in tacitus to give the dignity of knighthood and at the battle of cannae by the two measures or bushels of gold rings sent to carthage the number of the roman knights there slain was computed     at length freedmen being created knights the jus annulorum the right of wearing gold rings became promiscuous  among the germans the shield and lance were accounted the grand badges of military honor or knighthood this the lombards the franks and our countrymen all descending out of germany used and was to us in the opinion of sir hen spelman the foundation of the knightly order much like the ancient germans was the custom of making knights among the irish and favine notes the shield and lance were the proper arms appertaining to a french knight which esquires armigers carried always after their masters shields and scutes as they are vulgarly called i e equestrian targets inclining to an oval not shields or bucklers of foot soldiers  another ensign and ornament of knightly honor is the cingulum militare or balteus which varro says is tuscan signifying a military girdle which were garnished with great buckles studs and rings of pure gold to show their dignity and power in military commands and with such a belt set with pearls and precious stones young athelstan was girded when he received knighthood from his grandfather king alfred our knights were no less anciently known by these belts than by their gilt swords spurs etc howbeit the use now only appears in knights of the bath  to this belt was also added a sword not of ordinary use and therefore termed the sword of a knight which was hallowed with great ceremony  another eminent badge is the golden spurs wherewith at the time of their creation knights spurs were wont to be adorned and to these a little after the conquest were added far more and greater oruaments they were usually put on after the person had been presented to the prince who gave the honor to signify that the newmade knight should not only declare his valor by his sword but also by the management of his horse which he should encourage and excite with his spurs to the carrying on his valiant designs these spurs have been of that esteem that knight batchelors are latinized equites aurati among the germans ritter dess gulden sporns and with us heretofore knights of the spurs and several families by the name of knight bear for their arms the spurs on a canton  it is farther certifyd among the rights of a knight baneret that upon the account of his knighthood he may wear gilt spurs as well as a gilt sword and that the spurs are essential may be collected from the degradation of a knight where his gilt spurs are first cut off with an hatchet the case of sir andra harcla in the last place is the collar an ensign of knightly dignity among the germans gauls britons danes and goths among whom it was customary to wear them as denoting such as were remarkable for their valor but in latr times it was the peculiar fashion of knights among us to wear golden collars composed of s s or other various devices so that those monuments are known to be erected for knights on whose portraitures such ornaments are found     the qualifications for knighthood are principally three   merit the bare mentioning whereof shall suffice here   birth viz that the parties who enter thereinto ought first to make appear they be gentlemen of three paternal descents bearing coat armor and much the same was the law of the empire under frederick   a d      some think it also insufficient unless descended so by the mothers side at least she must be a freed woman and   estate which also serves to support the dignity  thus wealth was so much regarded among the chaldonians that those who were rich bore the name of knights it was estate that entitled a man to this honor among the romans for the censor might compel any citizen equal to the equestrian cense whom he thought fit to take that order and this consisted of  00000 sesterces i e  0   l of our money  and as in old rome so here in england not long after the conquest they who held a knights fee viz   0 acres of land might claim it says camden but it appears from seldom that no certain number or extent of acres made a knights fee and temp hen   and edw   and   edw   the census militis was measured by  0 l by the year or more and by the royal prerogative some who held    then  0 at other times  0 then  0 and sometimes  0 l lands were required to accept this honor by writs directed to the sheriffs of the counties and were excused only by reason of old age irrecoverable weakness loss of limbs or being in holy orders and upon all other causes if exempted they paid a fine estimated according to the nature of the excuse or length of time given  but in the promiscuous course of knighthood where the men of wealth and estate whether otherwise worthy or not became dignified yet the gate of honor was not then shut against those who wanting riches deserved well of their country for when princes conferred such dignities upon men of narrow fortunes they usually bestowed with them annual pensions or lands agreeable to the judgment of the author of the division du monde who says that the honor of knighthood is not to be given any person who has not a considerable estate unless sufficient means to support the honor of the order be also given with it  these pensions are frequently mentioned in our rolls sometimes during pleasure and sometimes during the life of the knight or till better provision should be made for their supports examples whereof are sir john at lee sir nele loring sir john walsh knights the like rewards our kings gave to such whose merit raised them to the degree of a banret expressed in their patents ad manutenendum statum baneretti pro sustentatione sua ut ipse statum baneretti melius manutenere possit pro statu suo manutenendo or words to the like effect examples where of are sir reginald cobham sir thomas de rokeley sir john lysle and sir roger de swynerton banerets  it may be next considered who can make knights wherein it is apparent that they who never were and others who never could be knights have conferred this dignity yet it is to be understood that necessity and custom has in this case the force of a law for anciently bishops and priests made knights so also do the popes and some commonwealths likewise our queens for the sovereign or the heir apparent though they be no knights may nevertheless do it by reason they possess the kingdom and are therefore the head and chief of chevalry and consequent all the power thereof is contained in their command to conclude this point knighthood was always received from the hands of another person either by ceremony or diploma except only the kings of spain who time out of mind made themselves knights and this by virtue of an old law written in the arragonian tongue as ambrosias morales repotts and to show that no man upon earth has any power over him he shall gird himself with the sword made after the orm of a cross and that day can no other man be knighted     of the ceremonies and formalities used at the conferring of knighthood the most ancient was performed by putting the belt ioose over the shoulder or girding it close about the waste the bend in armoury represents the one and the fess the other the first christian kings at giving this belt kissed the new knight on the left cheek saying in the honor of the father and the son and of the holy ghost i make you a knight it was called osculum pacis the kiss of favor or brotherhood and is presumed to be the accollade or ceremony of embracing which charles the great used when he knighted his son lewis the dbonair it was in the time of the same emperor the way of knighting by the colaphum or blow on the ear used in sign of sustaining future hardships which is thought to have been derived from the manner of manumission of a slave among the romans a custom long after retained in germany and france thus william earl of holland who was to be knighted before he could be emperor at his being elected king of the romans received knighthood by the box of he ear etc from john king of bohemia a d       in the time of the saxons here in england knights received their institutions at the hands of great prelates or abbots which according to their opinion rendered them more auspicious in the accomplishing of which solemnity they added many religious ceremonis as watching fasting bathing and consecrating the sword an instance of which we have in heward lord of brune in in lincolnshire who received this honor from brand abbot of st edmundsbury but not long after the conquest this custom was restrained by a synod a westminstr a d   0    h   which among other things ordained ne abbates i e all spiritnal persons saciunt militas however the religious ceremonies for the most part continued especially vigils and bathings as appears by that grand solemnity at the creation of     knights son of earls barons and knights upon whitsontide anno    edw   cited by seldom and camden and these formalities the saxons and normans not only here in england but the french spaniards and other nations observed concluding from it that decency of habit was as well expected from them as integrity of life and purity of manners and the like religious ceremony was heretofore observed in spain at the creation of knights whether cavelleros de espuela d orada or amados our knights batchelors in this form the person to be knighted was bathed in the evening and presently laid in bed then clothed in rich robes and led to the church to perform his vigils that being over and mass heard his spurs were put on and his sword girt about him then drawn out and put into his right hand whereupon the oath was forthwith administered to him which taken he that bestowed the dignity gave him una pesconade a blow or stroke on the neck saying god assist you in the performance of your promise  the oath or vow the knights professed was in general to relieve and protect widows the fatherless oppressed and miserable and to defend the church of god which to keep and perform was esteemed as meritorious as to do all that a monk friar or canon regular should  there is also mention by mr seldom of consecrating the sword offering it at the altar and receiving it again from thence as an implicit kind of taking an oath but as in peace and great leisure these tedious ceremonies were used yet it was otherwise in times of war or on a day of battle where hurry and throng of affairs would not permit and therefore as well before the joining of battle as after victory obtained it was usual for the prince or general in the field on sight of the army to give those whom he thought fit to advance to that honor they humbly kneeling before him a stroke with a naked sword flatwise upon their shoulders or else to touch their heads or shoulders lightly without any other ceremony except pronouncing sis eques in nomine dei to which he adds rise sir  knight or in the french sus or sois chevalier au nom de dieu which we commonly call dubbing the old english word used for creating consecrating a knight from doopen to dip by bathing  another manner of creating knights abroad was by royal codicils or letters patents these the spaniards call privilegios de cavelleria whereupon such knights are entitled equites codicellares and these were sent to such as dwelt in remote countries and sometimes but rarely extended so as to make the degree hereditary there is one example that by the bare signification of letter without any ceremonies or patents under seal philip iv of spain jan         conferred upon all the captains that behaved themselves valiantly in defense of mastricht then lately besieged by the hollanders to those that were gentlemen the title of knights and to others that of gentlemen  having thus briefly showed the various forms of creation of knights batchelors i shall remark what seldn has observed of knights bannerets in later times wherein he that was advanced to that honor in the field was inducted between two senior knights with trumpets before them and the heralds carrying a long banner of his arms called a penon in which manner being brouht to the king or lieutenant who bidding him good success the tip of the banner is cut off that of an oblng it might become a square like the banner of a baron this done he returns to his tent conducted as before as for the many and various formularies at the creation of a knight of the ath see sir edward ys among his nots upon utton and sir william dugdales warwicksh the knights of the bat at the coronation of king charles ii watched and bathed they took an oath they were girded with a sword and belt and lastly dubbed by the king with the sword of state   0 in the dignity honor and renown of knihthood is included somewhat of magnificence more excellent than nobility it self which mounting the royal throne becomes the assertor of civil nobility and its as judge at the tribunal therefore knight is noted by camden as a name of dignity but baron is not so for if heretofore a baron had not received knighthoo he was written plainly by his christian name and that of his family without any addition but that of dominus a term attributed to a knight and in ancient charters the titles and names of knights may be seen set before barons it bestows gentility not onl upon the meanly born but upon hs descendant  ncreaseth the honor of those welldescended hereunto agrees the common law if a villain be made a knight he is thereby immediately enfranchised and consequently accounted a gentleman agreeable to the roman law where the donation of a goldring ennobled a slave moecens died a companion of that order even kings and princes look upon it as an accession to their honor their other titles showing dominion and power this their valor and courage geysa king of hungary leopold marquis of austria ottacher duke of stiria and frederick duke of austria and stiria godfry duke of brabant with henry his son peter king of arragon the emperor henry iii our william rufus king edward iii henry vi henry vii edward vi lewis xi francis i kings of france and others received this dignity at the time they enjoyed their other titles and though it is said the sons of the french king are knights as soon as they receive baptism yet are they not judged worthy the kingdom unless first solemnly created and we elsewhere find that the royal heirs of arragon were suspended from that crown until they had received the honor of knighthood and after the norman conquest our young princes were sent over to the neighboring kings to receive this honor thus our king henry ii was sent to david king of scots and knighted by him in carlisle and edward i at the age of fifteen years to alphonsus xi king of castile for the same dignity in like manner did foreign princes repair hither to receiv the honor from our kings as malcolme king of scotland and alexander son of william king of scotland knighted by our king john anno      so was alexander iii by our king henry iii at york anno      and magnus king of the sle of man by the same king all which sufficiently demonstrate the great renown of knighthood and the honor and esteem which was ever had for that order  cap ii of the religious orders of knighthood in christendom   the grounds and causes of founding societies or knightly orders were several and different though all terminated in one end among which principally were these first a sincere love to honor and therein chiefly to excite and promote virtue by suitable rewards such was the design of king arthur when he formed himself and other martial men into a fellowship which he styled knights of the round table secondly to repress the incursions and robberies of the saracens and barbarians to vindicate the oppressed redeem the enslaved and to entertain and relieve pilgrims and strangers which were part of the duties the knights hospitallers and templars etc stood engaged in a third reason was to fight in defense of the christian faith against pagans and infidels to enlarge the christian territories and promote the service of the catholic church and indeed their zeal very much advanced christianity lastly when sovereign princes perceived themselves embroiled in wars or dangerous factions the erecting such an order or society was that they might by such a tie restore peace quiet all jealousies unite affections and secure a lasting friendship and powerful assistance both for their own and their countrys safety and to this end were badges of several orders devised as pledges of remembrance to quicken and establish their friendship    these orders are of two kinds   religious or ecclesiastical and   military or secular    the institutions of the latter sort were after a while thought too weak to continue if not sustained by religion and piety and too defective without adjoining ecclesiastical persons thereunto therefore the founders considering divine assistance should concur with military industry began to dedicate these orders to the honor and worship of god or to our savior or to the blessed virgin or some other of the saints to gain the protection and favor of heaven more easily as they thought obtainable by the prayers and offices of the clergy whereupon some in their institution joined sacred orders to their military and made provision for sacred persons to pray for their prosperity at home while they were engaged abroad hence king ed iii at the first institution of the garter appointed thirteen secular canons and thirteen vicars to attend the celebration of divine offices upon the same account certain foundations of divine service were erected at bugy for the order of the annunciads at dijon for the order of the golden fleece and at mont st michael in normandy for the order of st michael    i shall now deliver a brief account of the religious orders of knighthood proceeding according to their antiquity    the knights of the holy sepulcher in jerusalem are accounted the most ancient dr hylin reports this order to be instituted a d  0   at such time as the temple of jerusalem was regained from the saracens by philip king of france yet favin will have it to be by baldwin the first king of jerusalem for while the saracens possessed the city there were certain canons regular of st augustine to whom they permitted the custody of the holy sepulcher these canons baldwin made men of arms and knights of the holy sepulcher and ordained that they should nevertheless retain their white habits and on the breast bear his own arms which were argent a cross potent or between four crosses of the same commonly called the jerusalem cross their great master was the patriarch of jerusalem they were to guard the sepulcher fight against the saracens and infidels protect pilgrims redeem christian captives hear mass every day recite the hours of the cross and to bear the five red crosses in memory of our saviors wounds their rule was confirmed by pope innocent iii upon the loss of the holy land these knights retired to perugia in italy but retaining their white habit changed their arms to a double red cross a d      they were incorporated to the knights hospitallers of jerusalem then in rhodes but a d      alexandr vi made himself and the popes his successors great masters thereof and empowered the guardian of the holy sepulcher his vicar general to bestow the same upon pilgrims to the holy land philip ii king of spain endeavored to restore this order in some of his dominions about the year      himself being elected great master and another attempt was made by the duke of nevers      but these designs took no effect    knights hospitallers of st john baptist in jerusalem before the taking of jerusalem from the saracens certain christian merchants of naples obtained leave from the caliph of egypt to erect a small and convenient house for the entertainment of themselves and countrymen which they built before the church of the holy sepulcher together with a small oratory to them repaired certain canons of the order of st augustine who built another oratory but the confluence of pilgrims growing great they erected a large hospital in the place where our savior celebrated his last supper for the better accommodating devout travelers who for want of a place to lodge in were often robbed and murdered so that at length from their charity and hospitality as also for that they took st john baptist for their patron they obtained that title it was instituted a d  0   or according to others  0   by gerard a native of thoulouse who came to jerusalem in the time of codsry of bouillon and built this hospital which became the first seat of this order dedicated to st john of cyprus bp of alexandria commonly called jonnes eleemosynarius and king baldwin i conferred on them large privileges permitting them arms and instituted them to be knights a d   0  their duty was to fight against the infidels and they acknowledged obedience to the patriarch of jerusalem but growing rich they obtained from rome to be absolved from that obedience pope gelasius ii or calixtus ii a d    0 confirmed their rule of living and adrian iv received them under the protection of the papal see being likewise endowed with ample privileges and exempted from payment of tithes by succeeding popes chiefly by pius iv  they took the black habit of hermits of st augustine and lived under his rule by grant of honorius ii anno      vowing obedience poverty and chastity and on the breast of their habit wore at first a plain cross of white cloth which was after changed to one with eight points but in time of war they used a red cassock bearing the white cross upon it unto gerard succeeded raimund who digested and enlarged their laws and institutions in the composition whereof his style was raimundus dei gratia servus pauperum jesu christi and custos hospitalis jerusolymitani but afterward he and his successors had the title of great master of the order given him to denote his power and authority at this day he has the title of prince of malta and goza among his privileges he seals in lead as does the pope and doge of venice he acknowledges the pope for his head and the king of spain for his patron he had under him in several kingdoms prios some of whom had also the addition of great with us in england he was styled prior hospitalis st johannis jrusalem in anglia and by that title was he summoned to the parliament as a baron of this kingdom and at length for place and precedence was ranked the first baron and the greatness of these knights grew to such height that temp h   they had in christendom   000 manors  when saladine took jrusalem these knights retreated to ares or ptolmais and that being taken they seized upon the island of rhodes a d   0  whence they began to be called knights of rhodes but a d      being driven thence by solomon they betook themselves to the island of malta which with tripoli and goza were granted to them in fee by the emperor charles v a d    0 under the tender of one falcon yearly to the viceroy of sicily and to acknowledge the king of spain and sicily for their protectors in this isle they continue a bulwark to those parts and from this their settlement are called knights of malta    knights templars about the year                or    0 this order took beginning baldwin ii then reigning in jerusalem when nine gentlemen of whom two of noble extraction hugh de paganes and godfrey de st omer came in devotion to the holy land they were called brothers of the militia of the temple ordinarily knights templars from the habitation assigned them out of a part of the kings own palace adjoining to the temple of solomon in jerusalem their first undertaking was to guard the most dangerous ways about that city against the violence and robberies of the saracens which made them acceptable to all and for which they had remission of their sins but for the first nine years they were yet so poor that they lived upon the alms of others wore clothes bestowed in charity upon them and rode two on one horse in memory of which primitive poverty their seal had the impress which is represented in math paris a d      they had rules assigned them drawn up by st bernard abbot of clairvaux by the appointment of pope honorius ii and stephen patriarch of jerusalem they made their vows of obedience poverty and chastity and to live under the rules of canons regular of st augustine their habit was white to which in the time of eugenius iii they added the red cross and of the same form that the hospitallers wore avin says a patriarchal cross and sowed it on the left shoulder of the malles these with the holy sepulcher hospitallers and teutonicks principally supported a long time the kingdom of jerusalem but when riches increased and their revenues augmented they grew proud sell from the obedience of the patriarch to join with the pope and at last   0  all the knights of this order in france were in one and the same hour seized and imprisoned by philip le el king of france with consent of pope clement v being charged with most infamous and damnable crimes and in england anno   ed   they were also apprehended afterward rendered convicts and all their possssions seized into the king s hands howbeit the b shop of york commiserating their deporable condition within his diocese charitably disposed of them in monasteries under his jurisdiction two years after many of these knights were burned in rance and jaqus de la male the last great master suffred the same fate having seen a d      his order by papal au hority condemned and perpetually dissolved after which their lands were annexd to the hospitallers for their service against the turks  tus they fell no lss famous for martial atchievments in the east than their weal h in the west for they enjoyed   000 lordships in europe and a spanish author tells us their revenue was two millions yearly and hd in possession  0000 commanderies which occasioned diverse to think they were flsly accused and by suborned witnesses merely upon the ambition and covetous design of phil p king of rance    knighs of the ordr of st lazarus tese were at the first a fraternity of religious monks after which they became ecclsistick knights in imitation of the knights of the holy sepulcher pope ps v      sles it ant quissimum charitatis and mti risti ordinm yet it must be understood as an order of monks founded by st pas about the time of uan the apostate a d     upon a charitable account viz to take care of leprous persons a malady frequent in the east by which they became separated even from the conversation of men at length through the incursion of the barbarians and injury of time it lay extinguished but was revived when the latin princes joined in a holy league to recover the hy land and a famous hospital was erected at jerusam under the title of st larus for the reception of lepers for in that time he monks of this order added martial discipline to their skill in physic and for their services against the infidls begat a great esteem from baldwin ii king of jerusalem and some of his successors in process of time this order decayed being suppressed by innocent viii who united it to the hospitallers at rhodes a d    0 nevertheless pius iv restored it a d      confirming the old and granting new privileges making his kinsman don janot de chastillon great master pius v a d      enlarged their privileges permitting them to take one wife only to wit a virgin not a widow lastly pope gregory xiii a d      bestowed the great mastership of this order upon emanuel philibert duke of savoy and his successors and prescribed them the cistercian rule and accordingly he had the investiture and collation of the commanderies in spain and italy    knights of the teutonick order or prussia in the time of the holy war a wealthy gentleman of germany who dwelt at jerusalem commiserating the condition of his countrymen coming thither in devotion made his house their receptacle afterward he erected a chapel to the blessed virgin whence they had also the title of marian knights to him associated other germns and in short time increasing they professed the military employments of the templars and followed the acts of piety and charity of the hospitallers a d    0 or      they elected henry walpott their first master and the following year were confirmed by celestine iii under the title of knights tutonicks or dutch knights of the hospital of st mary the virgin vowing poverty obedience and charity and following the rule of st augustine their statutes were composed from those of the hospitallers and templars and one article was that none but germans should be of this order their habit was a white mantle on the breast a plain black cross but some make it a black cross voided with a cross potent at acon they erected another hospital but after that city was taken by saladine they removed under hermannus their master into germany on whom the emperor frederick ii a d      and pope honorius iii bestowed prussia where having conquered that nation and reduced it from paganism they built the city of maryburgh and there a d    0 fixed the chief residence of their great master this country they enjoyed till      that albertus brandenburgh the last great master made solemn renunciation of that order and became feudatory to sigismond i king of poland who created this albert first duke of prussia however some of the knights disrellishing this action elected another great master viz albert wolfang and leaving prussia settled in germany where they now reside the younger sons of the german princes being for the most part received into this order giving it the greatest reputation    knights of mountjoy these are so called from a castle where this order was instituted built upon the point of a mountain not far from jerusalem whence the pilgrims first viewed the holy city and where these knights lay in garrison their habit was white and the badge thereof an octogonal cross rd they vowed poverty chastity and obedience and followed the rule of st basil which pope alexander iii a d    0 changed to that of augustine upon the loss of the holy land they retired to spain and fought against the moors and according to the places they resided in had other names in caalonia and valentia equites de mongoia i e mount joy but in castile knights of monfrac a castle there when alphonso ix king of casle gave them lands they had won from the moors the donation says to you don rodrigo gonsales master of monfrac of the order of mount joy upon the decay of this order a d      this castle was given to don gonsalionez master of the order of calatrava by ferdinand the saint and these knights were incorporated with them    knights of st john of acon or acres under the patronage of this saint was this order erected they exercised all duties of charity toward pilgrims and assumed arms in imitation of the hospitellers they followed the rule of st augustine and according to favina had a black habit upon which they wore a white cross patee after acon was taken they removed into spain and flourished in the reign of alphonsus the astrologer king of castile about which time pope alexander iv approved the order under the conjoined title of st thomas and st john of acon this king gave them by his will all the furniture of his house and much money but afterward they dwindled and at last were united to the hospitallers the ensign was a red cross in the middle whereof stood the figures of st john and st thomas    knights of st thomas distinct from the former yet wearing the same habit as the knights of st john of acon making the same processions and following the same rule their badge was a saltire gules or as others are of opinion the same with that of st john of acon wanting the figures in the middle but favin reports this order was instituted by king richard i after the surprizal of acon and that these knights were of the english nation who wore a white habit and a red cros charged in the middle with an esllon and that st thomas bek was their patron howbeit after the christians were driven out of the holy land the knights of this order were joined to the hspillers    knights of st blaze these were also called knights d sa maria they were officers and servants to the kings of armenia their habit was sky color with a cross gold on their breasts others say a rd cross and in the middle the picture of st blaze their patron this order was at the height when the armenian kings of the house of luzignan kept their court in acon   0 knights of the martyrs in palestine these took their denomination from an hospital in palestine dedicated to st cosmus and st damianus martyrs where acts of charity were exercised toward sick strangers their profession obliged them to other works of mercy viz to redeem captives and bury their dead they followed the rule of st basil which was confirmed to them by pope john xxii there badge was a red cross in the middle whereof within a circle was the aforesaid two saints when they retired into europe they changed into a red cross and st augustins rule     knights of st catherine at mount sinai this order was instituted a d  0   under the patronage of st catherine whose body was there deposited in the church of the monastery erected and dedicated to her name their first institution was to guard the said sepulcher to secure travelers defend the grecian pilgrims and to relieve them with hospitality their habit was white and they lived under the rule of st basil the great vowing conjugal chastity and obedience to the abbot of this monastery who was their superior but when the turks obtained these countries these knights were ill treated and driven away and the order almost abolished nevertheless some shadow remains for such as travel to visit the holy sepulcher at jerusalem do now and then pass to this monastery at mount sinai where in imitation of the padre guardian of jerusalem the principal monk in this covent makes them knights of st catherine over her tomb with the like questions and formulary as used at the holy sepulcher these knights now wear upon the left side of their white habit the cross of jerusalem and instrument of st catherines martyrdom but according to others the middle of the wheel is pierced with a sword     knights of st anthony in aethiopia after the death of st anthony the hermit who died about the year     many of his disciples remaining near aethiopia followed his example and manner of life and their successors lived in great aufterity and solitariness in the desert therefore called anchorites till the year   0 when it is said john emperor of aethiopia erected them into a religious order of knighthood under the title and protection of st anthony patron of his empire and bestowed upon them great privileges and being thus instituted they received st basils rule and cohabited in monasteries their habit is black with a blue cross tau their chief seat is in the isle of meroe but in other parts of aethiopia they have great numbers of convents and no less than  000000 of annual revenue the eldest sons of nobles and gentlemen cannot be admitted but the second sons may and if a man except a physician have three sons he is bound to assign one of them to be of this order their vow is to observe conjugal chastity to die in defense of the christian faith to guard the empire to obey their laws and their superiors and to go to war when and wheresoever commanded moreover they take an oath not to fight in wars between christians nor receive holy orders or marry without license they are of two sorts one employed in the wars the other who being old are exempted from military services and retire themselves under the title and profession of monks to the abbeys where they first took their habit before which they must serve three years against the arabian pirates about the red sea three years against the turks and three against the moors upon the borders of borneo when they come to be admitted into their abbey they are introduced in their military habit of which being disrobed the religious one is put on viz a black gown reaching down to the ground lined with blue having a blue cross fixed to the breast and over that a black cowle they are afterward led to the church and there make their profession philip vii son to the founder enlarged their lands and privileges and added a border of gold to the badge of the blue cross as observed at this day  in italy france and spain there are a sort of monks that have the title of knights of st anthony which observe the rule of st augustine and they wear a plain cross like that in aethiopia but the principals of these wear a double st anthonys cross of blue satin the one above the other their chief seat is at vienne in dauphine of which place the general of the order bears the title of abbot the monastery being erected into an abbey      in honor of st anthony whose body was translated thither from constantinople and all other places built in honor of his name were made subject to him a d      moroeus calls them the hospitallers of st anthony and says they begun in france a d      from gaston a nobleman of vienna but baronius and others say gaston and gerin instituted it earlier making the letter thau their ensign or badge     the constantinian angelick knights of st george in greece but now in italy marquez a spanish writer makes this one of the first military orders in christendom and derives a formal institution rules and laws from constantine the great which appears little better than fabulous therefore we shall omit his account  the great masters have their chief seat and convent at brianno near venice and is hereditary in the family of angelus flavius comnenus among the rest of their prerogatives the masters are commensales pontificum i e may sit at the table with the pope who defends them as benefactors to the church and founders of the lateran cathedral at rome as subjects to no prince they have power of coining money they give titles of counts and princes to their own fraternity and take upon them the restoring to honors of legitimating bastands making doctors poets laureats and public notaries this order is under the protection of the virgin mary and patronage of st george and they profess obedience and conjugal chastity they wear a white habit on the left side whereof is sowed a red or crimson velvet cross flory in the middle is the labarum s imbroidered with the letter a upon one arm of the cross and s on the other the sides are wrought with gold and silk but the labarum is all gold amongst these knights are three degrees the first called collered or grand crosses wearing a collar formed of labarums whereat hangs the cross and st george the second are the knights and these wear the cross above described the third are servants and they bear the cross only without the labarum the many grand priorates or commanderies belonging to this order show the power they were formerly endowed with     knights of st james in galicia or sanctiago this is the principal order in spain and had it title of don raniro king of leon who about the year     at clavigio by the assistance of st james said to appear upon a white horse bearing a banner with a red cross and gained a mighty victory over a great army of the moors some place the institution about the year    0 others      whereas it was only then confirmed and their rule of living prescribed by pope alexander iii there being a fraternity of knights in spain a d  0 0 under a master and governor with revenues  and although this order at first were disposed to vrtuous courses and valiantly to encounter the moors enmies to the cross of christ yet in time they became scandalously perverted but were afterward reduced to a better life and approved on by the said pope alexander who received them into the protection of the papal see and gave them the rule of st augustine the form of holding chapters of electing their masters of trves and thirteen commendadores of houses and of the visitors and in short very large privilges together with the monastery of st lorjo situate in galicia near sanctiago and the prior and canons thereof were incorporated into this order  their ensign is a red cross which the knights wear upon their breast terminating like the blade of a sword the hilt crosletted and fashioned after the ancient manner whereupon it was called la order de sanctiago de la espada  their habit is a white mantle close before on the breast whereon is placed the said cross made of silk or cloth and they are obliged to wear it upon their garments coats or cloaks though they use crosses of gold likewise  when the moors were driven out of spain and the principal branch of this order expired upon a contest for the place of great master the crown of castile stepped in between and by consent of the knights obtained it under the title of administrator which was granted to king ferdinand and his son charles v annexed it with all its rights etc to his successors in the kingdoms of castile and leon since which the kings of spain now enjoy the administration of this order and carry that title and style in the inscription upon the great seal thereof which holds the royal arms of spain upon a cross that fills all the shield with a sword at each of the four corners     knights of st savior in arragon these were instituted a d      by don alphonso called emperor of spain king of navarre arragon etc chosen out of the spanish and french nobility that assisted in his wars he formed them into a society the better to enable him to drive the moors out of saragossa and the whole territory of arragon their rule of living was the cisteran and somewhat conformable to the knights templars when the moors were driven out of spain their rich commanderies were at length united to the crown  their habit was a white mantle on the breast whereof was a red cross anchre but some say it was the figure of our savior     knights davis in portugal don alphonso henriquez first king of portugal took from the moors a d      the city of evora and to strengthen it sent thither several gallant commanders who assumed the title of knights of st mary of evora putting themselves under the protection of our blessed lady not long after they were called davis from a castle upon the portuguese frontiers conquered from the moors whither they transplanted themselves it was confirmed by pope innocent iii a d   0  under the rule of st benedict and therefore in some papal rules called of st benedict davis the knights profess conjugal chastity and obedience anno      they submitted themselves to the rule statutes and visitation of the order of calatrava but in the time of john of portugal natural son to pedro king of portugal seventh great master davis they cast off their acknowledgments to calatrava and never after submitted to them and afterward when the crown of portugal fell into the hands of philip ii king of spain this order was governed according to the statutes of portugal  their badge is a green cross flory such as the knights of alcantara used to wear they must be gentlemen by extraction both of the fathers and mothers side     knights of st michaels wing in portugal about the year      others say      don alphonso who founded the order davis founded this also after his obtaining a notable victory over the moors and albara king of sevil in which battle st michael the archangel is said to appear on the right side of alphonso and fight against them  their investitute etc was the same with davis it is now grown out of use but the mastership remains with the king of portugal     knights of st gereon this order was established by frederick barbarossa the emperor others say by frederick ii and consisted only of the german nation they followed the rule of st augustine and wore a white habit whereon was sowed a black patriarchal cross set on a little green hill     knights of st julian de pereyro or of alcantara they had the first appellation from st julian de pereyro a town in leon where they had a monastery built for them by ferdinand ii king of leon and galiia who in his diploma of privileges granted thereunto      styled himself protector of this society of knights in the approbationbull of pope alexander iii their chief is called prior but in that of pope lucius iii he is styled master of pereyro they used a secular habit modest and grave and the ecclesiastics a clerical habit with a shred of cloth and a scapulary to distinguish them from other seculars and ecclesiastics they observed the rule of st benedict moderated as it was convenient for the exercise of arms against the moors for which end it was instituted their ancient badge was a pear tree vert in allusion to the name  the occasion of altering the first appellation was upon change of their habitation pope adrian vi annexed this mastership together with those of st james and calatrava to the royal crown of castile for ever   0 knights of trugillo or truxillo in spain this order is so called from the city of trugillo in remadra but when or by whom founded or their adge is unknown some suppose these knights the same with that of alcantara it is evident they were in being a d      when it is pretended the master of acantara took trugillo from the moors and placed there a brotherhood of knights but it seems these knights of truxillo were a distinct order several years before and it is not unlikely that they might be incorporated into that of st julian de pereyro and by this means the order of alcantara acquired the towns of trugillo sancta cruz etc which alfonso ix king of castile had given them they were to be of noble descent and make proof of their gentility they were obliged to be near the kings person and to attend him in all martial expeditions maintaining always two horses and servants in readiness     knights of calatrava this order was instituted in castile by sanchio iii and so called from calarava a frontier castle of castile and toledo which the moors took a d     compounded of the arabic cala a castle and the spanish travas manacles with which the moors fettered the christians  00 years after which upon the recovery of the town from the moors it was given to the knights templars but they unble to stop the mighty conquests of the moors the said sncho by proclamation promised the inheritance to any who would undertake the defense of it being the key of the kingdom of toledo at length raymond of barcelona formerly a knight then a cistercian abbot by the persuasion of velasquez accepted the proffer and had the donation a d      and fortifying it by the help of his associates this order arose called at first militia de calatrava upon the account of the frtility of the place  0000 men and their families were drawn from the neighboring countries to settle there so that the moors never after attempted it they remained under their own masters till pope adrian vi annexed it to the crowns of castile and lon     order of the holy ghost at rome marquez calls them brothers of the hospital of the holy ghost who though not invested with swords and spurs are nevertheless reckoned among the military orders because bound to certify their gentility before admittance their chief seat is the sumptuous hospital of the holy ghost founded at saxia near the river tyber at rome by pope innocent iii a d      or   0  but the ancient foundation was the hospital of the holy ghost at montpelier in france though this other became the principal

conjugal chastity hospitality and obedience and none are admitted till they make proof of their gentility by blood their ensign is a red sword formed like that of st james of galicia the habit white and the only difference between them lies in a little twist of gold which these of portugal draw about their sword at alcasar de sul was their principal convent which they afterward removed to dalmela

these sprang also from the ruin of the knights templars whose confiscated estates king denis surnamed penoca desired of pope john xxii might not be disposed out of his kingdom in regard of the great evils the neighboring moors in algarves did his kingdom and forasmuch as the town of castro marin was a frontier and commodious to resist the enemy he moved for license to institute an order of knights therein and offered his holiness the rents and jurisdiction thereof which accordingly was granted by the pope and dedicated it to the honor of god and the exaltation of the catholic faith

for the subversion and confusion of enemies of the faith a mss in the arundelian library reckons up twenty causes for the necessity of its institution which are too long to be inserted and although it

instituted      by charles gonzaga duke of mantua and nevers in conjunction with adolph count of altham his brother and john baptist petrignan sfortia to give it the greater luster they divided the world among them charles took the north and west parts adolph the eastern and the other had the south where they were personally to found convents and invest knights duke charles began his institution of this order under the rule of st francis in olmutz the metropolis of moravia the year aforesaid and dedicated it to the blessed virgin and st michael but what progress the others made in their pious resolutions history is silent it has been likewise styled conceptionis ordo and militis virginis annunciatae anno      several illustrious princes of diverse countries entered themselves into that order at vienna it was approved by pope paul v and confirmed by pope paul viii      the design of its institution was to establish peace and concord among christian princes and their subjects to release captives and deliver the oppressed out of the hands of the infidels  on some unhappy difference among the illustrious founders in a short time it moulderd away and became ineffectual that the mahometans for whose destruction it was designed heard only the report of it  cap iii   having particularized the religious orders i shall proceed to those accounted absolutely military among them    knights of the round table may for antiquity challenge the first place the founder was arthur king of britain crowned in the year of our lord     at the age of    years of whose incredible courage and gallantry though some have stretched too far yet william of malmsbury is of opinion he was worthy to have been celebrated by true and faithful historians and not false and spurious tales he it was that long propd up his declining country and inspired martial courage into his subjects the saxons in twelve pitched battles having overcome and conquered diverse countries he lived in so great repute and renown that worthy knights came from all parts to his court as a seminary of military discipline to demonstrate their valor in point of arms this gave him occasion to select out of these and his own subjects some say twenty four of the most valiant which he united in a fellowship and to avoid all controversy upon precedence caused a round table to be made whence the order had its appellation he admitted not only britains but strangers and their qualifications were to be persons of nobility dignity and renowned for virtue and valor the place where they were instituted was windsor and those others of note where he and his knights assembled were at caerleon in monmouthshir winchester and camelot in com somerset and their time of convening was whitsuntide in winchester castle was  large round table called and affirmed to be king arthurs or at least set up in the room of one more ancient which was destroyed in the rebellious times of forty one with other relics there the articles of their profession number    are set down by sir william segar we find no authentic proof what badge they bore notwithstanding the report that king arthur had a shield named pridwin wherein the virgin mary was depicted his sword and lance had also their names one being called caliburne the other irone or rone it is not remembered that this order survived the founder but rather that it expired with him most of these knights perishing with him at the battle of kamblan now camelsford in cornwall where though he killed his enemy mordred yet he died a d      it may be noted that the like round table grew in estimation shortly after the norman conquest being permitted at haslelades tilts and tournaments temp steph and r i and roger mortimer earl of march kept the celebration of the round table consisting of one hundred knights and as many ladies with tilting at kenelworthcastle in com worcest   ed i and king edward iii designing to restore it held a just a windsor in the   th year of his reign and in the   th ordained it annually to be kept there at whitsontide but it was thought fit upon diverse accounts to forbid these assemblies and in particular    h iii at shrewsbury when the king went to meet llewellin prince of wales and in    h iii and at many other times    knights of the oak in navarre were instituted by garcia ximenes of the blood of the goths who had formerly retired from the world to a solitary life but relinquished it to command an army raised by the navarrois to deliver themselves from the oppression of the moors as he was marching to encounter them a d     there appeared to him from the top of an oak the sign of the cross adored by an infinite number of angels on giving battle to the infidels he gained a remarkable victory and the people elected him their king and he in thankfulness to god erected this order investing his nobles therewith and obliged them to defend the christian faith and acknowledge obedience to his successors kings of navarre time has eclipsed this order    the order of the gennet was founded by charles martel in memory of the famous battle near tours a d     where he overthrew    000 saracens and moors with their general abdiramo and to reward those who had wellbehavd themselves in this action the great number of rich gennet furr ermine has since gained the better value as also the creatures themselves taken alive among the spoils was the occasion of assuming the name but others impute it to gennets a kind of neatshapd horses whereof not unlikely a great part of the founders cavalry consisted the knights were sixteen in number and were accounted the first order of this nature among the french which continued till the institution of the star when it was laid aside though some french authors question if ever the order was in being    the order of the crownflower erected by charles the great son of king pepin a d  0  to reward the frizons who had behaved themselves valiantly in his armies and to encourage others to emulate their virtue it was so called from its ensign viz an imperial crown emroiderd with gold the knights were invested with the military belt and a box on the ear    the order of the dog and cock that there was such an order in france is related by several writers but they give no certain account of its institution    the order of st andrew or the thistle in scotland is reported by john lesley bishop of ross to take beginning from a bright cross in heaven in fashion of that whereon st andrew suffered martyrdom which appeared to hungus king of the picts and to the sts whom achaius king of scotland sent to his assistance the night preceding the battle with athelstan king of england over whom prevailing they went in solemn procession to the kirk of st andrew to thank god and his apostle for their victory promising that they and their posterity would ever bear the figure of that cross in their ensigns and banners favin in his theater of honor relates it to be instituted upon the famous league offensive and defensive made between achaius and charlmain king of france to preserve the memory of which alliance achaius added the tressure of flowers de lys to the lion and took for device the thistle and rue which he composed into a collar of his order and for his motto pour ma defense yet does menenius make these the symbols of two different orders one of the thistle whence the knights were so styled and the motto nemo me impune lacessit the other called sertum rutae or the garland of rue nevertheless to both these collars hung one and the same jewel viz the figure of st andrew bearing his cross before him but there are some faith the same author that refer the institution of the thistle the badge of the scotch kingdom from the times of achaius to the reign of charles vii king of france when the amity was renewed between both kingdoms lastly others place its foundation   00 their principal ensign is a gold collar composed of thistles interlinkd with anulets of gold and pendant thereto st andrew with his cross and this epigraph nemo me impune lacssit their solemn meeting was annually on st andrws day in the church of the town dedicated to his name during the festivity the knights were richly habited and wore their parliament robes having fixed on their left shoulders an azure rounde charged with a saltire argent or st andrews cross enfild in center with a crown composed of flower de luces or for the ordinary and common ensign the knights used a green ribbon whereat hung a thistle of gold crowned with an imperial crown within a circle of gold containing the last named epigraph and now of late they have sewed to their left breast an irradiation like that of the knights of the garter over a saltire silver the irradiation charged with a blew roundle of st andrews cross their number consisted of thirteen in allusion to our blessed savior and the twelve apostles    knights of our lady of the star owe their original to robert the devout of france a d  0   to manifest his strict devotion to the blessed virgin they were in number thirty inclusive of the chief their seat was in the noble and ancient house of st owen called de chichey near st denis in france this order was of no long continuance for being much fullyd and disgraced during the civil and foreign wars by the imitation of persons that had neither birth nor merit to recommend them king charles vii took occasion to efface it a d      by delivering up in a chapter the ensign that he wore to the chevalier du guet captain of the nightwatch in paris the lords and princes throwing it off after it had received that mark of infamy though some allege it declined upon the erection of the order of st michael as the star supplanted that of the ennet    the order of the lilly in navarre or of st mary of the lilly was founded a d  0   by garcius vi king of navarre in honor of the blessed virgin mary after his recovery from a languishing sickness others relate that prevailing against the moors he made a feast in honor of the blessed virgin at which he instituted this order electing his brothers and sons among the first knights it was esteemed the most illustrious of all spain and consistd of thirty eight knights extracted out of the ancientest blood of navarre iscay and old castile the kings of navarre were their chief they promised at their institution to expose their lives and fortunes in defense of the christian faith the conservation of the crown and expulsion of the moors    the order of the sword in cyprus was erected      by guy of lusignan king of jerusalem and cyprus after he had purchased that isle of our king richard i in commemoration of so fortunate a plantation of   000 persons whom he brought thither some question the truth of this however all assent its founder was one of the lusignan family the collar was composed of round cordons of white silk woven into loveknots interlacd with the letters s and r beneath this collar hung an oval of gold whereon was perfigurd a sword the blade enameled silver the hilt gold and about the oval this motto securitas regni micheli says pro fide servanda and gothofredus pro integritate tuenda their festivity was ascensionday whereon the founder gave it in the church of st sophia the cathedral of nicosia in cyprus to his brother amaury and to three hundred barons established in that his new kingdom there were eight kings of cyprus of the lusignan line great masters but when this isle fell into the hands of the turks this institution ceased   0 the bear in switzerland was instituted a d      by the emperor frederick ii in favor of the abbot of st gall in swaben who had assisted him in gaining the empire these knights wore a collar of gold at the end whereof hung a bear gold mounted on an hillock enameled with black in honor of st ursus of the theban legion who was martyred before the temple of the sun at solurre in switzrland it was also called the order of st gall from the name of the patron a scotch gentleman and the apostle of swaben of the place where it received its appellation the abbot whereof for the time being had power to confer this honor which was done by girding with the military belt the sword being first consecrated and putting on the collar it continued till the switzers became a commonwealth and then the castles of the nobles being dismantled it was laid aside     the broomflower in france took its original from lewis of france to honor the coronation of his queen margaret a d      their habits were cassocks of white damask and violet chaperons the collar composed of broomflowers proper interlacd with flowers de lys hanging thereat a cross florence gold to which was added this inscription exaltat humiles the founder accounting the broom the symbol of humility their number was at the sovereigns pleasure and this order continued till the death of king charles v some say charles vi instituted it and others deny the being of any such order     the ship and double crescent in france such an order was of old in honor of the great achievements of that nation though by whom founded is unknown favin affirms st lewis erected this after he had instituted the broom flower to animate the nobility to accompany him in his expedition to africa      their badge was alluding to the name of the order the figure of a ship pendant in an oval of gold and expired with st lewis after the first class of knights but its honor was kept up by charles brother of st lewis and flourished in sicily with his sucessors until the kings of arragon obtained that kingdom     knights of st james in holland this order was erected by florentius earl of holland and zeland and lord of friseland and he a d    0 bestowed the ensigns of it in his palace at the hague upon twelve of his chief nobility among which was lancenot lord hamilton ambassador from the king of scots they were invested with a collar of gold or military belt of

poland to honor the marriage of his son casimire the great with anne daughter of gedimer duke of lithuania      the ensign was a white eagle crownd     the order of knights de la banda in castile was set up by alphonsus ii king of leon in castile in the city of victoria a d      or palencia    0 or burgos      according to others not long before his coronation the better to secure himself against his enemies soon after the solemnity was celebrated at burgos in the monastery of st mary royal where the candidates conducted by the king to the altar and depositing their arms spent the night in watching and prayer the morrow after mass they were invested with a red military belt or ribbon of four fingers broad which came across the body over the right shoulder and so under the left arm and was the ensign from whence they took their denomination this order was chiefly to honor the nobility and at first none were admitted but the younger sons of noblemen excluding elder brothers or persons welldescended or esquires who had served in court or camp ten years at least it was anciently of great esteem and kings have vouchsafed to take its ensign but at length it was disused     the order de la calza instituted at venice a d   00 from the example of the knights de la banda in honor of the inauguration of duke michele steno it consisted of a society of particular noblemen and gentlemen who voluntarily met together and elected a chief among themselves they took an oath to observe their articles part whereof was the honor of the city where noble and splendid regales were made and with such like magnificent divertisements did they entertain king henry iii of france and other noble personages it received the greater luster by the addition of several italian princes and the most conspicuous families were received into it their habit on solemn days was a crimson senators vest appearing very splendid their ensign a sun in a shield painted in their banners it arrived to such profuseness that in    0 it was wholly laid aside     the order of st mark in venice is here reckoned because the knights are dignified with a title and particular ensign of honor at their creation the ceremony is after the manner of knights batchelors by dubbing with a sword and their title a bare mark of honor having no laws or statutes or particular obligations enjoined it had the denomination from st mark the evangelist whose body was translated to venice     and became the titular angel and guardian of that city his picture being displayed in their banners the exact time of its institution is not certainly determined the badge that adorns these knights is a gold chain put over their shoulders at their creation whereat depends a medal on one side whereof is the symbol of st mark viz a winged lion holding in his right paw a drawn sword and in his left an open book with this motto pax tibi marce evangelista meus on the reverse the duke surviving is beautified with a particular impress sometimes represented on his knee receiving a standard from the hands of st mark this medal is worn on a cross enameled blew the duke confers this honor either privately in his chamber or publicly in a full college the senate have the power of creating this order and they who receive it by their sanction the dignity is greater than from the hands of the duke himself absent persons are invested by letters patents and to aggrandize their honor and title style themselves knights of st mark   0 the order of the seraphims or seraphick knights otherwise sirnamd of jesus was begun by magnus iv king of sweden      in memory of the siege laid to the metropolitan city of upsala the collar was composed of seraphims and patriarchal crosses     the order of the sword and military belt in sweden by whom or when founded we have no memoirs the collar made up of swords with belts twining round them the symbol of love and justice the swords somewhat inclining toward the point and so joined two and two point to point placed round in a circle     the order of the knot in naples when lewis king of hungary warred against joan queen of naples not so much to dispossess her of the kingdom as to revenge his brother andrews death whom this joan his wife had strangled      on the   th of may the queen and lewis prince of tarantuni being crowned king and queen of that realm on the same day in commemoration of so pacifick an union and to tear up all their enmities the prince instituted this order into which entered at that time threescore and ten lords their habit was white and their ensign a knot the emblem of love and friendship intermixed with gold this order expired in a short time     knights of the annunciade in savoy ame vi earl of savoy instituted this order under the title of the collar      in honor of the fifteen divine mysteries of the rosary favin on a mistaken ground calls it the order of the snares of love in regard its founder had received of his lady a bracelet made of the tresses of her hair plaited in loveknots and that the four letters afterward interlacd by the founder should signify frappes entres rompes tous it is conspicuous enough at the first erection it was called of the collar and so remained till charles iii or le bon duke of savoy bestowed on it the title of the annunciation from the picture of the annunciation which he annexed to the collar      the founder appointed the number of his knights to be fifteen among whom sir richard musard an englishman is recorded      and      their number was increased to twenty that being solely lodged in the breast of their sovereign riene castle in buger was their principal seat they had a chartreuse to entertain fifteen priests to celebrate fifteen masses to the

fert and one knot commonly called the savoy knot at the end of each fert which with three other knots entwined one within another made up the circumference pendant at the collar without any figure these old characters were supposed to be the initials of fortitudo ejus rhodum tenuit alluding to amadeus le grand who so valiantly defended rhodes against the turks    0 but that this was long before the devise of the house of savoy is manifest from the coins of lewis de savoy baron de vaud who died   0  the monument of thomas de savoy who died      whereon was lying at the feet of his portaiture a dog with a collar about his neck inscribed fert as an integral word and from a brass coin of the said earls on the reverse whereof are two knots of the model before spoke of and the word fert in the midst there is the ectype of a silver coin of peter de savoy who erected in england the noble pile of that name in the strand temp h iii wherein is represented the devise fert in gohick characters the true interpretation of which word cannot be explained this ancient collar is still in vogue and daily worn but now called the little collar fashioned of gold or silver gilt about an inch broad and of

daughter to the count daulphine in auvergne the first solemnities of this order were performed at nostre dame de maulins in bourbonnois where he founded a college of twelve canons in honor of the blessed virgin the intent was to corroborate his interest for the aid of the duke of orleans against the faction of the house of burgundy and by joining of flowers de lys and thistles the symbols of hope and courage emblematically to express the nobleness of his spirit against all the power of fortune he ordained the number of knights to be twenty six comprehending himself and his successors

windsor castle     the order of the dove was begun by john i king of castile in segovia    0 or as others      to encourage his nobles to prosecute the noble acts of his grandfather king henry iii but the founder dying the same year before it had taken root it became of small continuance     the order of the argonauts of st nicholas was instituted by charles iii king of naples      to preserve amity among the nobles to compo enmities and suppress seditions if any of these knights upon a variance refused a reconciliation the ensigns were to be forfeied others say the design was to advance navigation to which their ensign alludes being a ship floating upon the waters in the midst of a storm having this motto non credo tempori in the convent of that sumptuous church which st nicholas bishop of smyrna erected was the grand feast held on the anniversary of that saint this king appointed a white habit for the knights and prescribed them laudable constitutions but for want of a settled revenue their splendour expired with their founder     knights of st anthony in hainault albert of bavaria earl of hainault holland and zeland designing an expedition against the turks and

was erected by lewis of france duke of orleans      to honor the solemnization of the baptism of his eldest son charles by his wife daughter to the duke of milain he chose the porcupine for his devise with this epigraph cominus and eminus not only out of the aspiring hopes conceived of this child but also to intimate something of revenge against john duke of burgundy his mortal enemy the porcupine being an emblem both offensive and defensive others make charles aforesaid the founder of this order    0 in imitation or emulation of the golden fleece instituted by philip duke of burgundy their number including the founder was twenty five their habit surcoats of violet velvet and over them mantles of watchet velvet lined with carnation satin the collar was formed of gold chains at the end whereof hung a porcupine of gold upon an enamelled hillock of grass and flowers which creature was also embroidered on the knights belts     the order of the lily or lilies in arragon or de la jarra

title of the lookingglass of the blessed virgin in castile instituted in memory of a victory king ferdinand obtained in that kingdom against the moors    0 whence he transplanted them with him into arragon      when he received the crown where it flourished under the sons of that king and then the line was extinct   0 the order of the dragon overthrown in hungary was instituted a d      by the emperor sigismond the glorious      for the defense of the christian religion and to crush or oppugn all heretics and schismatics and for the satisfaction he received in conferring peace to the churches of hungary and bohemia by the aid of the council of constance it was in high esteem shortly after in germany but the order and founder had very near the same period the knights wore daily as their ensign a green cross flory on solemn days a scarlet cloak and on the mantlet of green silk a double chain of gold others say a green ribbon at the end of which hung a dragon dead with broken wings in posture of being overcome the symbol of heresy enamelled with variety of colors     the equites tusini in bohemia or else both in bohemia and austria this order had its name from toca a cap or coif the archdukes of austria were its founders which they enacted to engage their subjects in defense of the christian faith against turks and heretics conferring upon the knights toward their support whatsoever they acquired in the wars which was a respite to themselves after almost two hundred years charges and military expense indeed the encouragement proved so good a bait that they cleared their provinces almost of all turks and schismatics that infested them their badge was a plain green cross and their habit red     ordo disciplinarum was instituted by the bohemian kings or rather the austrian to be a curb upon the turks and heretics at least to prescribe the confines of the kingdom the collar of the order had a white eagle these knights flourished in germany in the reigns of sigismond and albert emperors     orde de la scama in castile was instituted by john ii king of that realm about the year    0 to excite his nobility to fight against the moors which produced so good effect that in a short time the moors were shamefully overthrown that king granted them privileges gave them their statutes and rules but upon his death the splendour hereof was greatly eclipsed their ensign was a cross composed of the scales of fishes they were obliged to defend castile against the moors to dye in defense of the faith and when the king went to war they marched before him their ensign was a cross composed of the scales of fishes the spanish scama bearing the same signification as the latin squama     the order of the golden fleece had its original from philip ii duke of burgundy sirnamd the good the  0th of jan      at his marriage with elizabeth daughter of portugal in the city of brugs in flanders to perpetuate the memory of his great revenues raised by wools with the low countries some say in commemoration of gideon who with three hundred men vanquished a numerous army of the midianites or of jacobs leece viz the partycolored and streaked fleece after the example of jason and his argonauts whose expedition to colchos he intended to make his pattern by a voyage into syria against the turks he founded it to the glory of the almighty creator and redeemer in reverence of the virgin mary and st andrew the apostle who was patron thereof and whose festival was celebrated on that day but afterward translated to the  st of may by reason of the shortness of the days and the fatigue aged knights would find to convene in an intemperate season the knights at first were twenty four beside the duke chief and supreme who reserved the nomination of six more at the next chapter but charles v increased them      to fifty duke charles and maximilian sons to the founder annexed many privileges to them which were confirmed      for their habit three different mantles were ordained them at the grand solemnity the first day of scarlet cloth richly embroidered about the lower end with flints struck into sparks of fire and fleeces with chaperons of the same and the same day after dinner to proceed to vespers in mantles of black and of the color of chaperons the day following they were to hear mass habited as themselves thought fit but duke charles aforesaid prescribed them mantles of white damask for that days ceremony and changed their cloth mantles into velvet the great collar is composed of double fusils placed back to back two and two together in form of the letter b representing it both ways to signify bourgoigne and these fusils are interwoven with flintstones in reference to the arms of the ancient kings of bourgoigne seeming to strike fire and sparkles of fire between them the device of the founder at the end whereof hung the resemblance of a golden fleece enamelled proper to the flint paradine ascribes the motto ante rit quam flamma micet and to the fleece pretium non vile laboris the jewel is commonly worn in a double chainet or mles of gold linked together at convenient distance between which runs a small red ribbon or otherwise it is worn in a red ribbon alone the emperors of germany descended from philip archduke of austria duke of burgundy and count of flanders were the sovereigns of it till charles v gave the guardianship of it to the kings of spain which he performed on the   th of october      conferring it on his son king philip at bruxelles when he took the collar from his neck and with his own hands put it over his sons shoulders in the presence of diverse of the knights with this form accipe fili mi quem e collo meo detraho tibi praecipuum aurei velleris torquem quem philippus

this order remains at this day in that crown     the order of st george at genoa was given by frederick iii emperor of germany in honor of st george the titular saint and patron of genoa the ensign is a plain cross gules and worn by the knights at a chain of gold about their neck the dukes of genoa are chiefs thereof and in regard their dignity lasts but two years the order is much impaired through the inconstancy and alteration of the times     the order of the croissant or half moon in france was erected in the city of anjou      or according to the saint marthes a d      by rene of the house of anjou king of jerusalem and sicily etc duke of anjou etc the intent thereof was the honor of god support of the church and exaltation of knighthood over which he declared himself and his successors dukes of anjou and kings of sicily chiefs he also chose st maurice knight and martyr for patron and held the first ceremonies in the church of angiers dedicated to his name the symbol which the knights wore on the right side of their mantle was a golden crescent whereon in red enamel was this word loz signifying loz en croissant whereby they were spurred forwards to search after the increase of valor and reputation at this crescent was fastened as many small pieces of gold fashioned like columns and enameled with red as the knights had been engaged in battles and sieges for none could be

epigraph in french amaire the device of his said grandfather by which he made known his courage and rather than fail in the least punctilio of his word he would undergo any misfortune this order ended when the dukedom of bretagne became annexed to the crown of france by the marriage of anne duchess of bretagn to charles viii and lewis xii both french kings     the order of the ermin in naples owes its institution to ferdinand i king of naples at the expiration of the war which he was engaged in with john of lorain duke of calabria      being induced thereto by the treason and confederacy of his brotherinlaw marinus marcianus duke of sessa who designed to murder him and transfer the kingdom to the duke of calabria but the plot being defeated instead of bringing him to justice he not only pardoned him but instituted this chevalry admitting therein all the noblemen of title and figure in the kingdom and generously appointed him one of the first knights the collar was of gold intermixed with mud or dirt to which depended an ermin and this motto malo mori quam foedari alluding to the clean nature of the animal     the order of st michael in naples had its original from the same king ferdinand in honor of st michael the archangel patron of apulia the habit of the knights was a long white mantle embroidered with ermins and the collar of gold composed of the letter o to which hung in an oval the epigraph decorum by the habit it seems to be the preceding order if that was dedicated to st michael   0 the order of st michael in france lewis xi king of that realm considering how

the king and his successors were chief but it afterward proceeded to three hundred the collar is composed of ecallop shells of gold joined one with another and doublebanded fastened on small chains of gold at the end of which is annexed an oval of the same and therein on an hillock is the figur of st michael comaring and ampling down the dragon the motto immens mor oceani the habit was a mantle of white da mask hanging down to the ground furred with ermin having its cope embroidered with gold and the border of the robe interwoven with escallops of gold the chaperon or hood with its long tippet was made of crimson velvet but afterward king henry ii ordered this mantle to be cloth of silver embroidered with three crescents of silver interwoven with trophies quivers and turkish bows semied and cantoned with tongues and flames of fire the chaperons of crimson velvet should have the same embroidery their grand festival was to be celebrated on michaelmasday at the church of mount michael in normandy but afterward transferred to bois de vincennes near paris there is an herald of arms to attend this order called monsieur st michael upon the instituting the order of the hoy ghost not only

and noblmen its chief ensign was the figure of an elephant on whose side within a rundle was a crown of thorns with three nails all bloody in memory of the passion the knights were obliged to acts of pity almsdeeds and certain ceremonies especially upon those days on which they wore the ensigns king john valued it so highly that he wore them on every solemn festival he advanced it to that pitch of grandeur that our king henry viii and james v king of scotland accepted it  hertholm a learned dane in a particular treatise of this elephantine order says the badge was merely military anciently given as a memorial and incitement to the danish princes who took upon them the defense of christianity against the moors and africans  heretofore the knights wore a collar of gold composed of castellated elephants and crosses something like the crosses ancrees menenius calls them spurs at which hung the picture of the virgin mary to the middle holding christ in her arms and surrounded with a glory of sunbeams but that long since laid aside they now wear only a blue ribbon at which hangs an elephant enameled white adorned with five large diamonds set in the middle these elephants in the reign of king christian iv had in the same place within a circle the letter c and in the center of it the figure   denoting christianus quartus  this honor is usually conferred on the days of the

france it was to consist of one hundred knights besides the sovereign or great master which office is inseparable from the crown of france a long mantle of black velvet turned up on the left side and opened on the right was also appointed for the habit being at first embroidered round with gold and silver consisting of flowers de lys and knots of gold between three sundry ciphers of silver and above the flowers de lys and knots were thickly powdered flames of fire this great mantle was garnished with a mantle of cloth of silver covered with embroidery made after the same fashion excepting only that instead of ciphers there were wrought doves of silver and both these robes double lined with a satin of orangetawney the great collar worn over the mantle was at first composed of flowers de lys cantoned or cornered with flames of fire interwoven with three ciphers and diverse monograms of silver one was the letter h and a greek lambda both double for the kings name and the queens lovisa de lorain the other two were reserved in the kings own mind but these ciphers were taken off the color and the embroidery of the robes by king henry iv and for a mark of his victories trophies of arms were interlacd instead thereof with the letter h crowned the initial of his name whereout arose flames and sparks of fire and for the like reason the h has been changed into l both by lewis xiii and xiv at this collar hung a cross richly enameled in the midst whereon was figured a dove in a flying posture as descending down from heaven with full spread wings and that an epigraph might not be

eagle knights    there was another order called of the lions and tigers these knights being commonly the most valiant in the wars always bore with them their badges and armories    other knights there were as the gray knights not so much respected as the rest they had their hair cut round about the ears they made war upon their enemies with ensigns like other knights and were only armed to the girdle while the most honorable were capapeed all knights might carry gold and silver be arrayed in rich cotton have the use of painted and gilt vessels and wear shoes but the common people only the earthen sort neither might they carry shoes nor attire themselves but in a gross stuff every order had their lodging assigned them in the palace distinguished by their proper ensigns the first was the lodging of the prince the second of eagles the third of lions and tigers and the fourth of gray knights  the province of cinaloa near new mexico created their knights by giving a bow and setting them to encounter a lion or some other wild beast  the inguas or lords of peru dedicated their children to honor by adorning them with guarras or ensigns they pierced their ears whipped them with slings smeared their faces with blood in order they should be true knights to the ingua those of royal extraction before they received the order of knighthood abstained seven days from all manner of nutrment except a little raw grain and water and after being heartned and brisked up again performed some military exercises also racing wrestling leaping shooting slinging throwing the dart and lance etc and enduring to be beaten on the hands and legs with wands these being as it were the tests whether they could endure the hardships of war or no for if they did not sustain them manfully they were denied knighthood the ceremonies being performed by boaring an hole in the ears putting on gallant shoes and wearing of the breeches which before they were restricted adorning their heads with flowers and having the privilege of an herb that none but themselves could make use of and lastly giving an axe into their hands menenius calls these knights oreiones from the spanish orejas flop or lolleared in the latin auriculares from the leaf which they bore hanging in their ears or because they only negotiated affairs with the emperor and had his ear at all times  in japan there is an order of knights called mengoras part of whom are called bonzees living in fraternities as our religionists in europe some of these have the charge of their idols and the service relating to their temples others follow the wars they profess chastity with such severity that no woman is allowed to enter their cities they govern the kingdoms they conquer and are so very opulent that some of them possess  0000 ducats per annum and have a public armory well stored to make use of upon any exigence which is maintained by a daily contribution women have been excluded their share in this way of honor though their courage and valor have equalized the amazons of old the example is of the noble women of tortosa in spain or the femme cavaliers of the torchi micheli barely calls them chavalleros or rather chavalleras seeing the latins have had the words equitissae and militissae to express viragos and hroines  don raymond last earl of barcelona having in the year      reduced the city of tortosa from the moors on the thirty first following they laid a fresh siege to it in hopes to recover it the inhabitants were at length reduced to great streights they desired relief of the earl but he not being in a condition to answer their request they had thoughts of a surrender which the women to prevent put on the apparel of the men and by a resolute salley forced the moors to raise the siege the gallantry of the action the earl acknowledged by granting them several privileges and to perpetuate the memory instituted this order somewhat like a military one and none were to be admitted only those brave women and the honor to derive to their descendants and assigned them for a badge a thing like a fryers capouche sharp at the top after the form of a torch of a crimson color to be worn upon their headcloaths that at all public meetings the women should have precedence of the men and should be exempted from all taxes and that all the apparels and jewels left by their dead husbands should be theirs  a more general ornament of honor peculiar to the fair sex is the cordon which some will have to be an order or equivalent thereunto the institution is attributed to anne britaigne wife to charles viii of france who instead of the military belt or collar bestowed a cordon or lace on several ladies admonishing them to live chastely and devoutly always mindful of the cords and bonds of our savior and to engage them to a greater esteem of it she surrounded her escutcheon of arms with the like cordon from which example the arms of unmarried ladies and gentlewomen are usually adorned with them  cap iv of the castle chapel and college of windsor etc having dispatched the several orders of knighthood and traced them from their proper fountains we come now to treat of the most noble order of the garter an order that not only grants merit and honorable and valiant exploits at home but what imperial heads and persons famed for the antiquity of their race or gallantry of actions have always esteemed a further advancement to their glory therein to be enrolled for the better explanation it will be necessary to begin with the description of the castle chapel and college of windsor the place claims no greater antiquity than of the saxons named by them windleshore and as cambden conjectures had the denomination from the winding of a shore thereabouts as did wandsworth in surry heretofore written windlesworth the first authentic notice is from the donation which king edward the confessor made thereof to the monks of westminster as the charter expresses it for the hope of eternal reward the remission of all his sins the sins of his father mother and all his ancestors to the praise of almighty etc he grants wyndleshore with all its appurtenances as an endowment and perpetual inheritance to the use of the monks there and at westminster that served god those monks enjoyed it not long for king william the conqueror in the first year of his reign being greatly namourd with the peasant situation and commodiousness of the place stnae so near the thames and the wood fit for game ivited eadwin the then abbor and the mnks to accept in exchange fr it wokendune in essex a mansion called ferings with all its members and hamlers together with fourteen sokemen and their lands and oe frholer and three houses in colchester all in essex n e which it has remained in the crown  the king being thus possessed forthwih built a castle upon the hill which in doomsdy book contained half an hide of land and is there noted to be parcel of the manor of clivore clure this castle king henry i rebuilt and beautified with great magnificence and in the tenth year of his reign held his whitsontide there with great state and splendour shortly after in a charter of peace between king stephen and duke henry king henry ii afterward this castle was called mola de windesor the fortress of windesor within this castle was king edward iii born commonly called edward of windsor and was baptized in the old chapel and so great was his affection to that place that he constituted it the seat of the most noble order of the garter and to embellish it the more he founded the college of the chapel of st george and much enlarged and beautified the castle  for this work he appointed several surveyors whom he assigned to press hewers of stone carpenters and such other artificers as were thought useful and necessary as also to provide stone timber and all other materials for them william de wyckham who attained to be bishop of winchester was one of these supervisors and had that place conferred on him by letters patent october  0 ed iii and a grant of the same fee was likewise allowed to robert de bernham viz one shilling a day while he was at windsor two shillings when he went elsewhere about that affair and three shillings per week to his clerk afterward he was chief custos and surveyor of this castle of the manors of old and new windsor and of other castles manors etc belonging to the king to provide workmen and lok after the repairs and in those manors to hold leets and other courts pleas of trespass and misdemeanors  about the   th of ed iii it is presumed the most considerable enlargement of the castle was made seeing there was then great store of the ablest diggers and masons impressed by virtue of writs directed to the everal sheriffs with command under  00 l penalty to send them to windsor the sunday after the feast of st george to work at the kings charge from whence they were not to depart without wyckhams license security having been first taken by the sheriffs and returned into chancery london found forty essex in conjunction with herford forty wilts leicester with worcester cambridge with huntington forty kent gloucester somerset with devon and northampton one with another found also forty apiece and because diverse of these workmen for gain and advantage clandestinely left windsor to the hindrance of the work all persons were forbid to employ or retain them under forfeiture of all they had and likewise to arrest those that withdrew themselves from the work and commit them to newgate a    ed iii many of them being swept away by the pestilence the like writs were directed to other sheriffs under a hundred pound penalty to send able men whereupon the counties of york sent sixty derby twenty four salop sixty hereford fifty nottingham twenty four lancaster twenty four and devon sixty a    ed iii the noble edifice was ready for glazing and of twenty four of that occupation impressed for the kings service twelve were to be employed at windsor in this year and the next a great proficiency was made and vast quantities of stone were amassed dug out of the quarries of wellesfor newel and carby and other places from the   th to the   d the building of the castle was diligently pursued we find no addition to this august pile till his   th year and after that time nothing more during his reign so that it is supposed this famous piece for magnificence and strngth was then chiefly finished viz the great hall of st george the lodgings on the east and south side of the upper ward the keep or tower in the middle ward the chapel of st george the houses for the custos and the canons in the lower ward with the whole circumference of the walls their several towers and gates as in the present posture they remain  in succeeding times king hen vii added that stately fabric adjoining to the kings lodgings in the upper ward king hen viii reedified the great gate at the entrance into the lower ward king edw vi began and queen mary perfected the conveying the water from blackmorepark in wingfield parish into a fountain of curious workmanship erected in the mide ward which supplied all the castle queen elizabeth made a terrace work on the north side of the castle from whence there is a pleasant prospect down upon eatonbridge the thames and the adjacent country king charles i a d      built the gate at the east end of the terrace which leads into the park and lastly king charles ii greatly beautified and repaired the fabric and furnished it with a curious armory and in fine every thing is so fitly disposed and ordered that they are worthy of the notice of every nice and curious traveller  camden elegantly describes its situation in prose in this manner from an hill says he that rises with a gentle ascent it enjoys a most delightful prospect round about foreright in the front it ovrlooketh a vale lying out far and wide garnishd with corn fields flourishing with meadows decked with groves on either side and watered with the most mild and calm river thames behind it arise hills every where neither rough nor over high attired as it were with woods and even dedicated as one would say by nature to hunting game  and thus denhams muse pourtrays it  windesor the next where mars with venus dwells beauty with strength above the ualley swells into my eye and does it self present with such an easy and unforced ascent that no stupendous precipice denies access no horror turns away our eyes but such a rise as does at once invite a pleasure and a everence from our sight thy mighty masters emblem in whole face sat eekness heightened with majestic grace such seems thy gentle height made only proud to be the basis of that pompous load than which a noblet weight no mountain bears but atlas only that supports the spheres this castle is under the government of a constable so called in the reign of king john and has bore that denomination ever since the office is of great antiquity honor and power but of small revenue for it is partly military and civil as military he commands the castle and any garrison placed therein and is obliged to defend it against all enemies whatsoever all the prisoners brought hither are committed to his charge and is answerable for all that is in the castle to the king under whom he is commander as a civil officer he is judge of a court of record held there by prescription for determining by way of common law all pleas between party and party arising within the precincts of the forest of windsor and liberties thereof which compriseth many towns and all legal processes issue out in his name he is allowed a deputy learned in the law who is called the steward of the court of record and is keeper of the constables seal of office this officer supplies the constables place as a judge of the court of common pleas from whose judgment the appeal is by writ of error returnable in the kings bench or common pleas at westminster the constable is likewise forester and warden of the forest of windsor which is an   0 miles in compass he has under him one or more lieutenants at his pleasure and may imprison any trespasser in vert and venison convict having a prison in the castle for that purpose named the coalhole he has the freedom of using the sports of the forest which is granted to no person without his or the kings license and signs all warrants to kill deer except what the king signs and is to fell timber and wood  he that was chastelain the french word for constable in william the conquerors reign was walter fitz other from whom the family of the barons of windsor are descended and the earls of plymouth bearing the surname of windsor temp car ii prince rupert was constable  we come next to the chapel of st george which is situate in the lower ward or court of this castle and so named by king ed iii shortly after he had founded the college mentioned in the next section he having pulled down the old chapel erected there by king henry i and dedicated to king edward the confessor to raise a more stately structure in its stead to bring which marter to perfection in the   th year of his reign john de spoulee had the office of master of the stonehewers and had power to provide masons and other artificers to whose care they were entrusted in anno    ed i john de dorchester subconstable of the castle was appointed to keep a control upon all the provisions bought for the works of the chapel as well as on the payments and all other affairs relating thereunto to this fabric he erected several houses adjoining for the custos and canons to reside in and afterward king hen iv gave them the void place in the castle called the woodhall nigh the great hall for building of houses and apartments for the vicars clerks and choristers and the other ministers assigned for the service of the chapel but king edw iv observing the walls and foundation of the chapel sapped and consumed and esteeming the fabric not stately or spcious enough designed another more noble and excellent in its room in order to it richard beauchamp bishop of salisbury was constituted master and surveyor of the work who had power from the king to remove all impediments demolished diverse of the officiry houses and other irregular piles and decayed walls and dug up their foundations particularly those ancient buildings on the east side of the chapel which extended unto the walls on the north side of the castle where the towers viz cureys tower and le amenerys tower and brneys tower were situated as also on the south side of the chapel unto the belfry there exclusively the materials whereof he might bestow upon any buildings in the castle as he thought convenient how well the bishop discharged this office appears from the preamble of his patent whereby that king conferred o him the chancellorship of the carter in which is set forth that out of mere love toward the order he had given himself the leisure daily to attend the advancement and progress of this goodly fabric  from this erection of k ed iv arose the elegant and beauteous structure now standing enlarged in length at least an hundred fathom though it did not arrive to its perfection until the reign of king henry viii together with the dean and canons houses on the north side of the chapel and those of the petty canons raised at the west end in form of a fetterlock one of king edward the ivths badges and so vulgarly called temp henry vii sir reginald bray knight of the garter became a liberal benefactor finishing the body of the chapel and rearing the middle chapel on the south thereof which still retains his name and where his body lies interred as is manifest by his arms badges etc cut in stone and by his last will anno    hen vii john hylmer and william virtue free masons undertook the vaulting the roof of the choir a curious piece of architecture for  00 l and finished it by christmas   0  anno   henry viii the rood loft and lanthorn were erected with the contributions raised by the knights companions near to the east end of this chapel was a little fabric of freestone raised by cardinal wolsey called the tomb house in the middle whereof he designed to erect a monument for king henry viii and had almost finished it before he died but this was demolished      by command of the long parliament and all the copper figures exceedingly enriched by art carried thence this place king charles i intended to enlarge for the interment of his own royal body and those of his successors but those villainous times drawn on they with much ado afforded him but a mean obscure place near the first high place in the choir of this chapl in the same vault where the bodies of king henry viii and his last queen yet remain  in this chapel besides many of the knights companions repose the body of king hen vi removed from chersey abbey in surrey deposited under the uppermost arch at the south side of the altar without any monument or inscription and likewise that of king edw iv under a large stone of tuch raised within the opposite arch at the north side of the altar but without inscription having on the outside of his grave a range of steel gilt to enclose it from the north isles cut excellent well in churchwork  over this arch hung this kings coat of mail covered over with crimson velvet and thereon the arms of england and france quartered and richly embroidered with pearl and gold interwoven with diverse rubies which trophy had remained over his monument ever since his interment till plundered by captain fogg      who at the same time sacrilegiously robbed the chapel of all its altarplate  within this chapel were several chantries endowed with lands and other revenues for chaplains and priests to sing masses for the souls of their founders kindred  william of wickham bishop of winchester in   hen iv gave two hundred marks to the dean and chapter to buy twenty marks per annum to maintain one chaplain     ed iv the feoffees of richard duke of glocster gave the manors of bentfieldbury in essex knapton in norfolk and chetlesworth in suffolk for a daily mass     ed iv sir thomas st ledger founded a chantry of two priests who were to officiate in the middle chapel on the north side of the church and the said king by his will ordained two priests to serve at his tomb with an exhibition of twenty marks yearly apiece    hen vii there was another chantry priest assigned for thomas pasche and william hermer etc who was to perform his office at the altar on the north side the new church     hen vii margaret countess of richmond founded a chantry for four chaplains to celebrate mass in the east part of the new work of the chapel     hen vii william lord hastings founded a chantry for one priest on the north side of the choir about the middle whereof this lord lies     hen vii charles somerset lord herbert afterward earl of worcester left a secular priest for a daily mass etc to be said in the south chapel dedicated to the virgin mary where he lies interd both these lords have built appartments adjoining for their chantry priests now to be seen and distinguished by their arms garterd and cut in stone over their several doors  to these we shall add the foundation of the new commons erected over against the north door of the body of st georges chapel by james denton one of the canons anno    hen viii for the lodging and dieting such of the chantry priests choristers and stipendiary priests who had before no certain place where to hold commons in which he furnished with all proper utensils the charge amounting to     l   s   d in lieu of which the choristers were to say certain prayers when they entered the chapel commemorate his death and pray for his and the souls of all the faithful departed  in this chapel of st george there were heretofore several anniversaries or obits held and celebrated which we pass over and as it was usual for some of the military profession to spend the remains of their lives in pious speculations for their king and country and the salvation of their own souls permission was allowed to the welldisposd knights of the garter who retired from the noise and bustle of the world to make their abode there yet so as to maintain themselves out of their own revenues king henry viii ordained that the sovereign should assign them convenient appartments within the castle and the like favor he granted to other knights though not of the order but the lodgings to be such as the sovereign and knights companions should decree however we do not find the knights companions made use of the benefit but only for their better accommodation at the grand feast of the order etc a motion was made    car i that they might have lodgings assigned them in the great court which they offered to repair at their own charge since all the officers had conveniences in the castle but the knights companions none which the king did not dissent to provided it be without exclusion of the great officers of state    within the chapel of the castle erected by king henry i was founded a college for eight canons to be maintained by an annual pension out of the exchequer king edw ii founded here a chantry for four chaplains and two clerks as likewise a chapel in the park of windsor under the same regulation for four more chaplains whom king edw iii removed and joined to those before settled in the chapel of the castle and built habitations for their better accommodation on the south side thereof  the foundation we treated of here was confirmed by letters patent dated at westminster aug      edw iii three quarters of a year before he erected the order of the garter when he laid the foundation of the ancient chapel afresh in honor of god the virgin mary st george and st edward the confessor and ordained that to king henrys eight canons there should be annexed one custos fifteen more canons and twenty four almsknights together with other ministers all under the power of the custos and these to be supported out of the revenues wherewith this chapel should be endowed upon which pope clement vi      by his bull directed to the archbishop of canterbury and bishop of winchester approved in part the kings intention  the next year the statutes and ordinances of the college commenced by virtue of the popes authority the kings command and consent of the bishop of salisbury in whose diocese the chapel is situate by which statutes winchester one of the popes delegates instituted a college within the precincts of the chapel of st george consisting of one custos twelve secular canons thirteen priests or vicars four clerks six choristers and twenty six almsknights besides other officers  dean   the first custos was john de la chamber constituted nov       edw iii to whom succeeded william mugg on the   th of june following which mugg is the first if the institution of the college bears date by papal and not kingly authority after him were others that were called by the same title till the last year of king henry iv when thomas kingston was presented by the name of dean and his successor john arundel observing diverse endowments granted to the college alternately by the name of custos dean and custos or lastly of dean only and doubting this variation of titles in time might bring inconveniences upon the foundation petitioned the parliament   hen vi whereupon the king by letters patent under the great seal granted that the said john should be custos sive decanus for life and his successors cusiodes sive decani wardens or deans of the free chapel of st george within the castle of windsor and that the custos or dean and canons thereof and their successors by that appellation should have and hold to them and their successors for ever all lands tenements etc liberties etc devolved upon the college at any time before so that here was a kind of new incorporation by the title of custos or deans and canons only at least this was a great step to complete the privilege they after enjoyed when through the interest of richard beauchamp bishop of salisbury then also dean of windsor and chancellor of the order king edw iv by letters patent dated dec   in the   th year of his reign modeled them by the name of dean and canons of the free chapel of st george within the castle of windsor one body corporate in thing and name with a perpetual succession and capable in law to purchase receive and take lands etc in fee and perpetuity to have a common seal and might plead and be impleaded by that name and for better security the letters patent of incorporation were within three years after passed into an act of parliament now in force  the authority of the custos or dean consists in being president over the rest of the college to govern direct and order them their goods and estates he has all manner of ecclesiastical jurisdiction over them with a reservation of power of appeal to the chancellor of england who is visitor of that college  when any persons lead lives inordinate he with the chapter in cases where no particular penalty is appointed may reprehend or correct at discretion and in matters of discord shall within eight days reconcile the contending parties or do justice after thrice admonition may expel from the college all sowers of discord backbiters and whisperers that are below the degree of a canon and that there be no defect of government when the dean has occasion to be absent above eight days he shall appoint one of the canon residents for his deputy in whose absence he has the title of lieutenant and on all occasions to exercise his office for the statutes allow him sixty days in a year for nonresidence which space the royal visitation      enlarged to one hundred and ten days and the lord chancellor hyde granted him liberty of six weeks absence but in the vacancy of the custos the chapter has all his power conferred on them which chapter ought within two days after the vacancy made known elect one of the resident canons under the title of president to govern the college until they be provided of another custos  canons the canons by the letters patent of the first erection were appointed to be twenty four including the custos but upon the institution of the college by the bishop of winton there was ordained as aforenoted one custos twelve secular canons and thirteen priests or vicars in all twenty six completely the number of the knights of the garter and for a fuller distinction between these canons secular and the priests the first twelve are in a bull of pope innocent viii named majores canonici the others minores or pettycanons to these twelve seculars were assigned so many prebendships in the chapel of st george as also stalls in the choir and place in the chapter together with that held by the custos whence they are frequently styled prebends and have a sacerdotal power for if they are not in full orders before they are instald they must within a year after they have enjoyed their prebendship be ordained a priest or quit the benefice  by the bull of pope clment vi the right of presenting the canons priests clerks alms knights and other ministers were reserved to the founder and his successors yet we find the first canons were presented to the custos by the founders of the order of the garter viz the twenty five first knights companions every one presenting singularly yet this was but with the sovereigns permission pro hac vice and that none of them should be entitled to it hereafter but the sovereign alone and because it might the more effectually be observed the custos was obliged upon every canons death to signify the same to the sovereign that he might pitch on one to succeed which being nominated he is approved instituted and instald by the custos or dean to whom he swears canonical obedience and observance of the statutes  the principal duty of these canons and of all the other ministers of the college is continually to attend upon the service of god in the chapel of st george and the statutes run upon each days omission of a canon resident to be mulcted his quotidian distribution    d and though we find no license of nonresidence granted them by their founder yet there is mention of canons resident and nonresident for whom great defalcations are appointed to be made to prevent such neglects because the residentiary canons bear not only the burden of that duty belonging to the chapel but the expense of hospitality and other works of charity occasioned from their residing at windsor  richard beauchamp bishop of salisbury obtained power from sextus iv to make new statutes and dispensed with the old ones and in      he gave to the dean and every canon fourteen days of nonresidence in every term to wit fifty six days in the year by the visitation      they obtained a dispensation for eighty days and the lord chancellor hatton yet gave them a further permission to two hundred and two days which the lord chancellor hyde confirmed so that there remains one hundred and sixty three days in the year in which the canons ought to be resident with hospitality to be consonant to their statutes  the canons are particularly obliged to pray for the sovereign and for the happy estate of the order if any knight companion or other person should bestow ten pounds per annum in order to be partaker of the prayers appointed for the benefactors of the college his name was to be inscribed amongst them and he also prayed for which article though king hen v confirmed yet with this restriction it should not be admitted without the consent of the sovereign or the knightscompanions of the order   edw vi some one of them were enjoined to commemorate the benefactors in a discourse upon the tuesday next after the third sunday in lent and on the first tusedays in june september and december and not only to set forth the munificence of the founder and of king hen viii but of all others so as to excite their auditors to an emulation in the increase of religion and setting forth of gods glory  the civil obligations of these canons are to attend the sovereign or his deputy and the knights companions at their grand feast and at the feasts of the installation or when the sovereign or knights companions shall come to the chapel of st george upon a religious account on those solemn days over their ecclessastical habit they wear a murrey mantle at this day a taffaty robe in fashion like the three inferior officers of the order with the arms of st george arched within a rundle on the right shoulder  petty canons those now called petty canons in the patent of foundation went undistinguished with the canones majores only in the bull of pope clement vi to the archbishop of canterbury and bishop of winton for instituting the college they are called presbyteri and by the said bishop in the very words of his statutes presbyteri se vicarii by which last name they are styled at the first erection of the garter their number was originally thirteen only king henry the viiiths english statutes mention eight petty canons besies thirteen vicars but the latin takes notice only of thirteen priests some called canonici minores others vicarii ann   edw vi twelve priests were apointed and named petty canons that is four to be added to the eight mentioned in the statute of king henry viii yet in queen elizabeths ordinances for the continual charge the petty canons thereby provided for are thirteen agreeable to the ancient number of vicars but at this day they are reduced to seven and one of them subchanter  the vicars at their admission are bound to be priests at least deacons and at the next ordination they must commence priests their statutes oblige them to continual residence and if absent from matins or from the grand mass they are amerced   d and for every canonical hour the mass of the virgin mary or for the defunct a penny all which forfeitures were to be deducted out of their sallary and divided among those vicars that duly attend these duties but the statutes   edw vi state the forfeit of absence from matins to be one halfpenny and the like from procession communion or evensong to be paid to the poors box and not only they but all other ministers of the chapel if they leave the college above twenty days without reasons sufficiently approved of by the residentiary canons or any of the society that lead a vicious or scandalous life after the fact manifestly proved before the custos are to be expelled but an absence less than twenty days without leave granted is punishable at discretion  each vicar enjoyed at first an annual pension of   l paid after this manner viz every calendar month   s for their diet and at the expiration of every quarter day the surplus was consigned for other necessaries they stood in need of king ed iv increased their pensions to twenty marks apiece to which queen elizabeth they being then called petty canons advanced    s and   d per annum to each out of the lands confirmed on the college by king ed vi and now their yearly sallaries are increased to thirty pounds out of these petty canons is elected a subchanter and commonly the same person is the deans vicar who has the cure of souls marries and buries etc  clerks for the service of the choir at the foundation were allotted four clerks one whereof was to be instituted a deacon and another a subdeacon before their admission and these two were designed upon vacancy to the vicars places but for the other two institution into lesser orders in which they were to continue were sufficient each of the two first sort had eight marks per ann and the other two but six king ed iv increased their number to thirteen and allowed them  0 l per ann they are mentioned to be thirteen in hen viiis statutes   ed vi they were increased to fifteen but here appointed to be laymen wearing surplices in the choir each having the same allowance   ed vi a model was proposed to augment the number of these fifteen clerks to twenty but in the reign of queen elizabeth they were again reduced to thirteen as at this present they remain one of them as organist has a double clerks place and consequently reckoned for two and an augmentation to each of   l    s   d three farthings yearly which being at first opposed by the dean and prebends they at length   eliz consented to allow them  0 s per ann apiece not out of the new lands but out of other payments which the dean and chapter should otherwise receive and      they increased their annual pensions to    l apiece they are obliged to be present in the choir at divine service as well as the petty canons and under the same forfeitures nor may they or the petty canons go out of town above three at once left the choir should be left unprovided  choiristers for the service of the choir were appointed six choiristers and they to be of the clerical order at their admission to each of which was allowed five marks per ann and as the dacon and subdeacon were placed in the college only in addition to the vicars and designed to succeed them in their vacancies so also were there six secular children endued with clear tunable voices to succeed the choiristers when they perceived a roughness or alteration in their voices king ed iv increased the number of choiristers to thirteen and allowed them annually six marks apiece and which was again confirmed by king h viiis statutes yet the injunction of   ed vi reduced them to ten but queen elizabeth established the former number and gave in augmentation among them all of   l    s   d they are now reduced to eight and their present exhibition is    s per month     the alms knights we shall treat of in a threefold estate   under the foundation   when disjointed thence by act of parliament and   as established anew by queen elizabeth    then king edward iii out of the great regard he had to military honor and those who had bravely behaved themselves in his wars yet after chanced to fall in decay made a provision for their relief and comfortable subsistence in old age by providing for them in this his foundation and making a coalition in one joint body with the custos and canons these he called milites pauperes and we poor or almsknights the stated number at first were twenty four equal to the custos and canons at the first erection but shortly after upon his instituting the order of the garter two more were added as there was to the first canons to make the complete number of the knightscompanions of that order which were twenty six as we find stated at the ordination of the college by the bishop of winchester the popes delegate  the intention of the founder was for those that were real objects of charity as he describes them viz poor knights infirm in body indigent and decayed or as the statutes of the garter qualifies them such as through adverse turns of fortune were reduced to that extremity that they had not wherewithal to sustain themselves to live so genteelly as was suitable for a military condition which for greater caution was reiterated in the statutes of king hen v king hen viii and in the orders of queen elizabeth for it was expressed in case any estate of  0 l per annum devolved on them such knights were to be discharged the college and they were to proceed to a new election  at the first each knightcompanion of the order presented his almsknight but ever after their election was to be at the disposal of the sovereign their habit was a red mantle with the escutcheon of st george without any garter to surround it their exhibition after their first election was    d apiece every day they were at service in the chapel or resident in the college besides  0 s per annum for other contingencies it being the stated allowance appointed to each of the canons residents  about the beginning of king hen vis reign their quotidian distributions and annual  0 s had been unpaid upon the account of some dissentions risen between them and the dean and canons but upon complaint of john bishop of york lord chancellor of england and visitor of the college  0 hen vi they were redressed and their arrears of both discharged without any deduction and likewise obtained this clause that if the treasurer of the college became negligent in future payments he should lose his own quotidians from the time of his voluntary omission and the same to be divided among the almsknights their duty was to pray for the sovereign and the knights companions to be every day present at high mass the masses of the virgin mary at vespers and compline and in default to be mulcted their    d toties quoties which was to be converted to the use of the other almsknights then residing in the castle of windsor notwithstanding which decree the dean did afterward break in upon them and disposed of these forfeitures at his pleasure till   rich ii adam bishop of st davids then chancellor of england and visitor of the college redressed it and another complaint of like nature being made of the deans disposing of donations and other liberalities of the knights companions in wrong of the almsknights this chancellor decreed an equal distribution between the almsknights and canons till the king and council should otherwise determine  these and other differences between the dean and canons and alms knights grew up to that height that they became irreconcilable insomuch as in the act of parliament    edw iv for incorporating of the custos and canons by the name of dean and canons the almsknights were not only omitted but this clause inserted that the dean and canons and their successors should for ever more be utterly quit and discharged from all manner of exhibition or charge of or for any of the said knights and this under the cover that the king has greatly augmented the number of the ministers of the chapel that the revenue was insufficient to maintain both them and the almsknights but in the dean and canons answer to the knights petition to repeal this act the cause is alleged for that some of these knights used their utmost endeavors before this act to incorporate themselves and to be exempt from the obedience and rule of the dean and canons  after this act which struck off their quotidian portions and fees assigned by king edwards foundation how the alms knights subsisted we find not but so soon as king hen vii came to the crown they petitioned the king and parliament for repeal of the act    edw iv and alleged it was obtained without their knowledge or being called thereunto which plea availed not at all but on the contrary the dean and canons some years after got an exemplification thereof under the great seal dated feb      hen vii  and it is very evident from king hen viiis letter to the college that what they did in this nature after this act commenced was merely upon courtesy for he returns them thanks for a pension of twenty marks conferred upon peter narbone whom he had recommended to an almsknights place and promises to burden them no more with requests of this sort but that he would settle lands for their maintenance so great was their caution narbone was by covenants indented between him and the dean and canons to relinquish his pension upon that kings settling lands on the college for the provision of such knights in the interval between the disunion of the college and almsknights to their establishment by queen elizabeth their habit and badge continued the same and was so confirmed by hen viiis statutes it may be collected by his last will there was an intention to draw the  about the escutcheon of st george which projection came to nothing and expired in this interval it is observed that several persons of considerable rank and distinction became almsknights some of which were rendered great objects of charity among which number was sir robert champlayne a valiant knight an honor to our nation for his renowned and martial servces abroad he was of king henry vis party in the civil wars against king edw iv immediately after whose coming to the crown he left england and traveled into hungary with an equipage of three servants and four horses where in the assistance of mathou corvinius king of hungary against the turks he behaved himself very gallantly but prosperous fortune not always attending him with success he received many wounds and at length was taken prisoner lost all and forced to pay   00 ducats for his ransom for the attestation of which he had the great seals of the king of hungary the archbishop of crete legate de latere in hungary the emperor of germany the king of sicily the count palatine of the rhin and the duke of burgundy and lastly a declaration thereof under the privy seal of king edw iv and being reduced to so low an ebb of fortun he was through hen viis favor admitted an almsknight  but some obtained admittance probably out of devotion rather than poverty as thomas hulme clarenux king of arms temp edw iv lodowick carly the kings physician and john mewtes secretary of the french tonue both temp hen vii and bartholomew westhy made second baron of the exchequer   hen viii  it is evident king hen viii designed a restablishment of half the ancient number of almsknights viz thirteen for which purpose he appointed by his will  00 l per annum in manors lands and spiritual promotions settled upon the dean and canons and their successors for ever upon the provisos that they should find two priests to say mass at his tomb to commemorate yearly four obits for him and at every obit distribute    l in alms likewise to pay    d a week to those thirteen almsknights who were to have once a year a long gown of white cloth and a mantle of red besides five marks annually to such one among them as should be constituted their governor and so much for a sermon every sunday throughout the year in performance of which will king edw vi in the first year of his reign did confer several lands upon the college but  00 l per annum of these rents were by the dean and canons paid back to be employed on erecting of houses for the almsknights intended to be settled by king hen viii this work began not till the  d and  th of philip and mary and was finished the  th and  th of their reign the charge amounting to      l   s   d these houses are situate on the south side of the lower ward of the castle and contain thirteen rooms besides an hall a kitchen

the  th and  th of philip and mary the houses being then near finished a debate arose about placing some almsknights therein if possible by mchaelmas following whereupon the marquess of winton lordtreasurer had orders to assign lands for their maintenance and toward the completing of this the queen had nominated nine of the thirteen designed but falling sick in august a stop was put to the affair till queen elizabeth coming to the crown confirmed her sisters grants to the nine nominated knights and made up the number full thirteen ordained by king henry viii under which establishment they still remain for afterward viz aug  0 in the first year of her reign minding the continuance of king edwards foundation the intent of her progenitors and advancement of the order of the garter

and in what manner the  00 l given by her father should be employed for the maintenance of these knights and their successors she lastly declred that the dean and canons should for ever cause these rules and orders to be observed  impr that there be thirteen poor knights all gentlemen one whereof to be governor that have spent their time in the wars or other service of the realm having little or

will dated jan        bequeathed   00 l to charitable uses to be disposed as sir francis who had married his sister should think it within four years after his death whereupon sir francis determining to erct certain houses in windsorcastle for the dwelling of five almsknights designed the said   00 l toward that use and what was deficient made up at his own cost charging his brother executor sir richard crane by his will dated aug         to see the pile which he had began finished sir francis also bequeathed  00 l per annum to be settled in lands by his eecu ors for the perpetual maintenance of five almsknights after the rate of  0 l per annm to every one of them but his executor growing slack in the performance the work being rather exposed to ruin than forwarded by him upon complaints made to the sovereign and knightscompanions in chapter orders were islud out to quicken him and a peremptory letter dated mar        to go on with the work faithfully which commands he evading and bad times coming on the building was totally negiected sir richrd crane afterward dying by his will dated sept  0      he appointed that his manor of carbrooke in norfolk should stand bound for ever for payment of the said  00 l per annum whereupon by inquisition taken at widsor mar        by virtue of a commission upon the statute anno    eliz for charitable uses the manors of woodrising and wesfield etc in norfolk were found liable to satisfy for building and finishing the said five houses and payment of the  00 l yearly and further that the arrears thereof from sir frans cranes death came at that time to   00 l some contest ensued in chancery nevertheless the  00 l per annum was juy         decreed to be paid out of all the lands which were sir richards and the building of the houses out of his personal estate at two years expiration arose that fair pile of building between the chancellors and garters towers against the west wall in the lower ward of the castle which was

payable halfyearly at michaelmas and lady day or within thirty days after for the maintenance of five alms knights together with  0 l yearly for repairs payable also then which annual sum of   0 l anno    ca ii in a chapter held at whitehall jan    the king decreed the chancellor of the order for the time being should receive and dispose thereof thus  00 l per annum among the five new almsknights quarterly at the four usual feasts of the year and to employ the residue upon repair of the new buildings erected for their lodgings which powers were inserted in the patent for his office bearing date the  0th of the same month and it was moreover decreed that these five knights should be subject to the same rules and government of the thirteen of queen elizabeths foundation and made equal partakers of the same privileges and wear the like habits  king charles i taking into consideration the donation of sir francis crane which made the almsknights eighteen though they were not yet settled intended to make up twenty six as they were at the institution of the order to complete which design a chapter was held at whitehall apr         for the knightscompanions to consider the best way how the same might be effected and report their opinions but nothing was done thereupon and this affair waits a more propitious opportunity    the other ministers of the college and chapel of st

that sing in the choir and such as are employed about divine service before the reformation he appointed who should begin the antiphones celebrate masses and read the lessons epistles and gospels to

statutes of the college make mention that in procession and other solemnities they were to go before the dean and canons bearing their rods for which service they were to have annually a robe and   d per diem and besides these there are two sextons two bellringers a clockkeeper and a porter who attends the shutting and opening of the gates    for the endowment of the college we shall only treat upon those lands given to the maintenance of this foundation by the founder himself or by his uccessors or by sovereigns of the order of the garter uch as have been knightscompanions  king edw iii by his letters patent of the foundation    edw iii aforesaid gave them the custos canons almsknights and ministers the advowsons of the churches of wyardesbury rasbury in lincoln southtanton in exeter and uttoxater in coventry and litchfield diocese in frank almoigne free from all secular exactions which license to appropriate the same to the college notwithstanding the statute of mortmain he appointed as much out of his treasure for their support as amounted to an immovable estate of  000 l per annum and lest there might be any defect in the knights title to uttoxater and southtanton henry earl of lancaster    edw iii and thomas beauchamp earl of warwick that year had special licenses granted them in right of patronage to the said two advowsons and they to receive the same another such license   th of january    edw iii was given to william de bohun earl of northampton for assigning to the custos and chaplains the advowson of dodyngton in com oxon which he held of the king in

of the farm of the town of northampton to be paid by the bailiff of the town at easter and michaelmas by equal allotments and it was at the founders instance therefore worthy to be inserted that the town of yarmouth    edw iii under their common seal granted them a last of red herrings yearly well dried and cleansd to take the corporation into their prayers though some say it was a penance enjoined them for murdering a magistrate  in the    edw iii the founder granted them and their successors the manor of eure near weybrigg in com bucks the manor of craswell in bray in com berks and a

intended    edw iii the king granted the custos and college by letters patent a pension of  00 l per annum out of the exchequer and upon the vacating the same    edw iii he gave them yearly lands of  0  l    s    d out of the possessions of religious aliens which fell into his hands by occasion of the french wars but lest these possessions should be again restored upon a treaty of peace they were to receive the annual sum of  0  l    s    d out of the exchequer till they were provided of lands of the like value upon several restrictions he granted them    l   s   d yearly to be received out of     l which the prior of takkele paid him for the farm of that priory it being then in the kings hand by reason of the war with france and by reason the revenues did not amount to  000 l per annum as he designed at the foundation in the   th year of his reign he granted them so much money yearly out of the exchequer as would make up the deficiency till lands or rents of that value should be settled on them lastly    edw iii the founder bestowed on them a piece of ground in new windsor whereon had stood an house of john of london in lieu of the great garden south of the castle formerly given them by him and also a garden opposite thereunto on the other side of the way besides these largesses of the founders there were others made by pious and devout persons said to be incorporated

dean and chapter were confirmed to them by act of parliament   jac i  the ancient rate of these new lands in the kings books was     l   s and   d per annum but according to the improved rents as they were then turned over to the college     l      d out of which   0 l   s   d was yearly allowed them in requital of their lands passed to king hen viii and  00 l per annum for accomplishment of his will but the remaining sum viz    l  0 s   d was reserved in lieu of tenths to be paid into the court of augmentation nevertheless this last reserved sum was not assented unto by the dean and canons to be so paid because the charges issuing out of the lands were larger than were expressed in the rental and we find that shortly after the rents of st germains northam ilsington etc part of the new lands were received and accounted for according to the old rate in the kings books to wit     l    s   d per annum in recompense for the lands conveyed to king hen viii and out of which they paid a yearly surplusage of   l   s   d this sum together with the rents of the rest of the new lands being upon the said improvement accounted to be     l    s    d made in all  00 l per annum and this was laid out by the dean and canons for some time toward erecting the almsknights apartments  thus stood the lands accounted for till the settlement made by queen elizabeth who in the first year of her reign appointed the dean and canons to convert the rents of these new lands to such uses and intents as she had set down in a book signed with her sign manual and annexed to an indenture made between her and the dean and canons by which indenture they were obliged to apply the rents and profits of these lands as was prescribed in the book and to observe the ordinances therein and upon default to abide such orders as the crown or any knightcompanion deputed by the sovereign shall set forth  l s d in this book the total of the revenue reckoned at the ancient value     0  0  the annual charge

reparation of the premises and for the relief of the dean and canons in maintenance and defense of the said lands  and to the end the queen might know how the revenue was disposed of she gave charge that her lieutenant and the knightscompanions should annually at the feast of the order held at windsor state the account and see how the income was expended and that her lieutenant should yearly be put in mind of it by one of the officers of the order this ordinance was renewed    jac i and the chancellor of the order was appointed to be the remembrancer and in obedience thereunto the account of these new lands which begins at lady day as that of the old lands does at mihaelmas was afterward exhibited in chapter and in particular that account   car i which was submitted to the sovereign and knightscompanions consideration who referred the inspection thereof to the knightscommissaries who were to consult over the affairs of the order     the privileges of the chapel and college are ecclesiastical and temporal as to the first pope clemnt vi exempted the chapel college canons priests clerks almsknights and officers from all ordinary jurisdiction of archbishops bishops archdeacons and all judges and officers and received them within the protection of the papalsee and granted a farther privilege that the custos should have ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the canons priests etc as also the cure of their soul notwithstanding any papal constitution provincial or synodical yet allowing that the custos should receive that cure from the diocesan of the place in consideration of this exemption the custos was to pay annually on st georges day a mark in silver to the popes chamber two years preceding the chapel was called the kings free chapel which title it still enjoys for it owes sbjection to none but the sovereign of england the supreme of the church as heretofore it stood divided between the king and see of rome the privilege of exemption included in the confirmation of liberties made by the founder in his charter dated anno regni sui    and all other emoluments granted by him are confirmed by act of parliament   hen vi as the college has its sole dependence on the crown it is visitable only by the lordchancellor whose visitations and power are reserved to him by the statutes of the college and himself called in the kings commission for visitation   rich ii governor of the said chapel as well in spirituals as temporals and under the king immediate custos and so jealous were the dean and canons left the power of the said exemption should be infringed that when sixtus iv had granted the bishop of salisbury and themselves to make new and interpret the ancient statutes they soon obtained  revocation of that authority left the said bishop in whose diocese the college is situate being so unpowered might by degrees bring them under his jurisdicton in prejudice to their exemption and a d      to prevent uch design the archbishop of canterbury etc were commissioned to see the bull revoked and salisbury enjoined not to intermeddle further in the college affairs moreover other bishops and the chancellor of england were to rnew alter or new make such statutes as might accrue to the advantage of the college  if the archbishop of cantrbury be present in the chapel he sits below the dean nor can he consecrate there without his license and this is very remarkable that at the ratifying the peace between king charles i and lwis xiii a d      in the chapel at wsor dr wren then dean of the college gave the oath to the french ambassador and not the archbishop of canterbury though he was then present  the dean and chapter are to weigh well and debate at their yearly chapters all things fit to be dispatched in reference to the college affairs and whatsoever determination they come to not repugnant to their statutes all persons are firmly obliged to observe  the deans have no institution from any bishop but his institution investiture and installation into the custosship canonship and prebendship is conferred from such of the canons resident to whom the king who collates does recommend him other marks of exemption appear in the constant proving of wills before him or in his absence before his lieutenant in using the power of excommunication within their jurisdiction the precincts of the college granting a dispensation for eating flesh in lent a farther mark of their privilege appears that the ordination for the chantry priests were confirmed by the dean and chapter and not the bishop of the diocese as were the statutes of the new commons the dean is exemp from paying all synodals or procurations nor can any of the kings chaplains preach in the chapel of st george unless he be a canon there or have license from the king or from the dean and canons they send no delegates to the synod and when the point was debated    0 it was carried in the negative as being against their liberties and might entitle them to the paymnt of subsidies nor are they entitled to any share in the government of the church more than the colleges in the universities where there are many nominal deans in short when by the act of uniformiy    car ii every clergyman was bound to subscribe before the arch bishop or his ordinary the canons subscribed before the dean and though some of them subscribed before the bishop yet was it with a salvo saving the rihts and privileges of this free chapel  their temporal immunities and privileges are these as rntd them by chartr   mar    edw iii and confirmed by several of his successors  the cstos and canons were fre from pvin aid upon making the kings eldest son a knight and marrying his eldest daughter and exempt of all aids to the kings contributions and tallages  whenever the clergy should give a tenth or other imposition out of their spiritualties or the commons give a tenth fifteenth or other out of their temporalties subsidy or the king tax his own demean or the pope

emoluments whatsoever within their own fees from all their tenants which might appertain to the crown as if the tenants did hold of the crown or others in capite  cap v we come now to treat of the most noble and illustrious order of the garter which if we consider either its antiquity or the nobleness of the personages that have been enrolled it excels and outvies all other institutions of honor in the whole world it owes its original as is confessed on all hands to edward iii king of england and france yet as to the occasion there are several opinions which we shall rectify the vulgar and more general is that the garter of joan countess of salisbury dropping casually off as she danced in a solemn ball king edward stooping took it up from the ground whereupon some of his nobles smiling as at an amorous action and he observing their sportive humor turned it off with a reply in french honi soit qui mal y pense but withal added in disdain of their laughter that shortly they should see that garter advanced to so high an honor and renown as to account themselves happy to wear it  but upon examination of this tradition let others judge what credit it bears to establish its belief for sir john froissart the only writer of the age that treats of this institution assigns no such original nor for  00 years after is there any thing to the purpose in our other historians till polydore virgil took occasion to say something of it but had it been fact some french historian or other would not have neglected to register it at a convenient time with a scoff and ridicule since that nation was so ready to deride king henry vs design of invading them with a return of tennis balls  in the original statutes of this order there is not the least conjecture to countenance the conceit of such a feminine institution no not so much as laying an obligation on the knightscompanions to defend the quarrels of ladies as some orders then in being enjoined nor does the author of that tract entitled institutio clarissimi ordinis militaris a praenobili subligaculo nuncupati prefaced to the black book of the garter let fall the manifest passage to ground it on  as to what polydore says he is not so confident to ascertain the person whose garter it was but cautiously declining that says it was either the queens or the kings mistresss and if it were the latter yet does he omit her name and title both which on what authority we find not are supplied by modern historians who call her joan countess of salisbury the same elsewhere celebrated by the name of the fair maid of kent whom edward the black prince afterward married whereas no historian ever gave the least inuendo that king edward iii ever courted her as a mistress seldom points at her when he calls the lady from whom the garter slipped countess of kent and salisbury but about the time when this order was founded she in truth was dignified with neither honor for although she was daughter to tho of woodstock earl of kent and had been sometime the reputed wife of william mountague second earl of salisbury yet then she could not properly be accounted countess of salisbury she was actually wife to sir thomas holland one of the first founders of the order nor was she yet though afterward countess of knt because her brother john earl of kent at the institution of this order survived and died not till    edw iii  that there was a countess of salisbury with whom king edward iii became greatly enamored froissart reports after this manner that this king having relieved a castle of that earls in the north wherein his countess had been besieged by the scots the earl himself being at that time prisoner in france upon sight of her extraordinary beauty he fell in love with her but she so virtuously demeaned her self during his abode there that he declined further solicitation however some time after the king out of desire to see her proclaimed solemn justs in london whither this countess and other ladies being invited came up this castle it seems was wark upon tweed in northumberland which king edward had formerly bestowed on her husband for his good service past when he first espoused her being then but a knight  although it should be admitted that this countess of salisbury was the kings mistress yet must it be remarked that she was wife to william mountague knight created earl of salisbury anno    edw iii mother to william the beforementioned second earl that her christian name was catherine not alice as froissart not joan as others call her daughter to william lord granston and that she expired    edw iii but that the whole may appear what indeed it is a mere fable we shall insert the judgment of dr heylin who took great pains in this particular this says he i take to be a vain and idle romance derogatory both to the founder and the order first published by pol virgil a stranger to the affairs of england and by him taken upon no better ground than fama vulgi the tradition of the common people too trifling a foundation to so great a building  of the same contexture with the former is another tradition in andrew du chesne that the queen departing from the king to her own apartments and he following soon after chanced to espy a blue garter lying on the ground supposed to have slipped from her leg whilst some of his attendants carelessly passed by it as disdaining to stoop at such a trifle but he knowing the owner commanded it to be given him at the receipt of which he said you make but small account of this garter but within few months i will cause the bst of you all to reverence it alike some suppose that the motto was the queens answer when the king asked her what men would conjecture of her upon her losing her garter in such a manner  both relations are far distant from fact nevertheless it has thus fared with other orders of sovereign foundation and an amorous instead of an honorable account has been falsely rendered of their institution as for instance the order of the annunciade and that of the golden fleece  there is a third opinion grounded on a relation made of king rich i who whilst his forces were employed against cyprus and acon and extremely tired and harrassd with the siege he by the assistance and mediation of st george as imagined was inspired with fresh courage and bethought himself of a new device which was to tie about the legs of a number of knights a leathern thong garter for such had he then at hand whereby they being emulated to future glory with assurance of reward if they proved victorious they might be excited to behave themselves intrepidly and well much after the examples of the old romans among whom were distributed various crowns for several causes to adorn the soldiers but if king richard i did make use of this device in the holy land as a signal or mark of distinction of a party upon some warlike exploit yet that he took occasion to create a distinct order of knighthood thereupon there is not sufficient warrant to believe for it is only put down in the preface of the black book but not in any part of the annals of the order nor can it plead higher antiquity than the reign of king hen viii when written all the advantage that can be made of it is to heighten the reputation of that saint among the english by which means the garter came to be dedicated to him and not that it contributed to its institution    the true motive was therefore neither the ladies garter or king richards leathern thong that it owes it original to but king edward being a person of consummate virtue gave himself up to military affairs and being engaged in war for recovering his right to france made use of the best martialists of the age did thereupon first design induced by its ancient fame the restoration of king arthurs round table to invite hither the gallant spirits from abroad and endear them to himself and adjudging no place more requisite than windsor upon newyearsday a d      he issued out letters of protection for the safe going and return of foreign knights to try their valor at the solemn justs to be held there on monday after the feast of st hilary following which happened jan    and these letters of safe conduct continued in force until the octaves of the purification of our blessed virgin ensuing being the   th year of his reign at the time appointed he provided a great supper to begin the solemnity and then ordained this festival to be annually at whitsontide and immediately after these first exercises were over for a future and better accommodation he impressed workmen and carriages for erecting a particular building in the castle and therein placed a table of two hundred foot diameter where the knights should have their entertainment of diet at his expense of  00 l per week to which building he gave the name of the round table and as at these great conventions the days were spent in all kinds of noble feats of arms justs and tournaments so were a great part of the nights consumed in public balls and dancing with the ladies that attended the queen thither and perhaps it was hence conjectured that at some of these balls the queens garter or the garter of catherine countess of salisbury might slip off and the kings taking it up occasion smiles in the bystanders and afterward when the king had modeled his intended order a garter offering it self for its chief ensign might add to the conjecture but that it was the principal cause is a groundless imagination and though king edward advanced the honor of the garter as to denominate the order yet was it not to enhance reputation to or perpetuate an effeminate occasion but to adorn martial prowess with honors rewards and splendour to increase virtue and valor in the hearts of his nobility that so true worth after long and hazardous exploits should not enviously be deprived of that glory which it has intrinsically deserved and that active and hardy youths might not want a spur in their progression in the paths of virtue which is to be esteemed glorious and eternal  it is further observable that the french king philip de valoys in emulation of this seminary at windsor set up a round table at his court and invited knights and valiant men of arms out of italy and almaine thither left they should repair to our king edward iii which meeting with success proved a countermine to his main design who perceiving that his hospitality toward strange knights upon account of reviving king arthurs round table was too general nor did sufficiently ingratiate them to his person but being unconstrained and at liberty did after their departure take what side they pleased in the ensuing wars he at length resolved upon a projection more particuar and select and such as might oblige those whom he thought fit to make his associates in a lasting bond of friendship and honor and having issued forth his own garter for the signal of a battle that was crowned with success which is conceived to be the battle of cressy fought about three years after his erecting the round table upon so remarkable a victory he thence took occasion to institute this order and gave the garter preeminence among the ensigns of it whence that select number whom he incorporated into a fraternity are styled equites aureae periscelidis and vulgarly knights of the garter by this symbol he designed to bind the knights and fellows of it mutually unto one another and all of them jointly to himself as sovereign of the order nor was his expectation frustrated for it did not serve only as a vehement spur and incentive to honor and martial virtue but also as a golden bond of unity and internal society and for his consideration cambden aptly calls it a badge of nity and concord  by the symbols of this garter the knights are reminded with all religiousness sincerity friendliness faithfulness and dexterity not to leave the pursuit of whatsoever they take in hand nor to enterprise any thing contrary to the statutes of the order neither to frustrate the rights of peace and friendship nor vilify the law of arms or proceed in any thing farther than faith and compact or the bond of friendship will admit moreover in the binding of the leg with this enobled ensign there was given this caveat and exhortation that the knights should not pusillanimously by running away from battle betray the valor and renown which is ingrafted in constancy and magnanimity nay so exactly did the founder contrive the whole habit into the signification of the garter that he ordained his and the knightscompanions robes and ornaments to be all alike both for materials and fashion intimating thereby that they ought to conserve brotherly affection among themselves the great collar of the order was made of equal weight and like number of knots and links in token of the like bond of faith peace and amity inviolably to be observed and retained amongst them in fine all things were so designed that every one might plainly perceive how much these things tended to the maintenance of amity and concord  in further reference to the establishing this order the aforesaid king calling together the earls barons and principal knights of his kingdom freely says froissart and obligingly declared his mind to them concerning this affair to which all of them being well inclined entertained the motion with equal joy and applause deeming it would prove a very great advancement to piety nobility and virtue and likewise an excellent expedient for the uniting not only his subjects one with another but all foreigners conjunctively with them in the bonds of amity and peace and it is very improbable the prudent founder should summon his nobles to consult about the grandeur of an order that had taken its rise from so slight an occasion as the dropping of a garter from a ladys leg now to draw the tie of friendship more close the king caused those who were or should be of the order to be called fellows associates colleagues brethren and knightscompanions and the order it self a society fellowship college of knights and knightcompanionship and their habits to be all alike to represent how they ought to be united in all chances and various turn of fortune copartners both in peace and war assistant to one another in all serious and dangerous exploits and through the whole course of their lives to show fidelity and friendliness one toward another there are other reasons assigned much to the same effect that the order was instituted to fortify the confidence of the king the kingdom and martial virtue that is to say to strengthen the faith of the subjects toward them and for their greater security and because the garter carries with it a bond or tie of fellowship and is a symbol of amity between princes being companions of the same order  in the last place if we look upon the statutes of its institution we shall find the injunctions wholly military and so are the words of admonition pronounced at the putting on the ensigns of the order and the ground of the institution in the preamble to king henry viiis exemplar is said to be for the honor of god and exaltation of the catholic faith joined both with piety and charity in establishing a college of religious men to pray for the prosperity of the sovereign of the order and the knightscompanions and to perform other holy duties as also ordaining a maintenance for a company of almsknights who have not otherwise wherewith to support themselves but not one word relating to the engagement on behalf of the feminine sex  and whereas king edw iii had laid claim by his title to the kingdom of france and in right thereof assumed its arms he from the color of them it is said caused the garter to be made blue and the circumscription gold and it may without straining be inferred from the motto honi soit qui mal y pense that he retorted shame and defiance upon him that should dare to think amiss of so just an enterprise as he had undertaken for recovering of his lawful right to that crown and that the magnanimity and bravery of those knights whom he had elected into this order was such as would empower and enable them to maintain the quarrel against all who thought ill of it consonant to this is the conjecture of harpsfield that this apophthegm was designed to put the knightscompanions in mind not to admit any thing in their actions or among their thoughts derogatory to themselves and their honor  that age did exceedingly abound with impresses mottos and devices and particularly king edw iii was so excessively given up to them that his apparel plate bed housholdfurniture shields and even the harness of his horses and the like were not without them many of which now to descant upon would be a fruitless attempt seeing the occasion of the invention and the circumstances are lost that should illustrate them and others by reason of their brevity seemed insignificant in regard something was designedly omitted and left to be understood which cannot now be rightly supplied so as to arrive at the mind of the inventor of this number may be this motto it is as it is which was embroidered upon a doublet of that king though there are others which seem more easy to be decypherd as that daring motto wrought upon his surcoat and shield provided to be used at a turnament  hay hay the with swan by gods soul i am the man   the time when the order was instituted historians differ widely about seldom cowper and others from froissart who wrote temp rich ii would have it in the   th of king edw iii but since froissart errs in making the number of knightscompanions no fewer than forty which is a grand mistake why might not he trip in point of time and confound the year of its erection with that wherein the founder renewed the order of the round table windsor being the place for both for should we admit that during some part of the solemnity held in this kings   th year when the accident of the ladys garter slipping off happened what other inference can be made but that he had only an intention to put in execution somewhat afterward not that an order was actually rected at that time besides the jollity of the season the greatness of the concourse and the splendidness of the festivity it was too busy a time to suffer much consultation tending thereunto or at least to mould and model a design so complete and substantial as it appears to have been even at first if we join fabian he is plain that though the king designed the institution at the end of the festival which he places between candlemas and lent in the   th and not   th year of that king yet was it not then says he but afterward established by him nevertheless mr seldom elsewhere observes it had its original in the   th year of the said king and our industrious stow with whom lily speed and segar agree tells us that the first feast of the order was celebrated a d    0 which exactly agrees to the   th of edward iii but polydore virgil places it after the   th of edward iii we must therefore have recourse to some other proofs for elucidating this point since this chronological era of the true time of its institution has wonderfully slipped the pens of all writers  admitting then that the erecting this order was first thought of by king edward at some of those grand assemblies of the round table held after the french king had set up the like yet was it not mature or brought to any perfection till after his glorious victories and triumphs over the french and scots in the battles of cressy and nevils cross in the last of which the scotch king david was taken prisoner and until king edward had calais surrendered to him as will appear very conspicuous  among the rolls of the great wardrobe is one containing the account of all the kings liveries from michaelmas anno    to the   st of jan    edw iii in the same are diverse things mentioned to be adorned with garters which were provided against the first grand feast of st g orge and among the rest the royal robes viz his mantle surcoat and hood likewise a bed of blue taffaty was bedecked with garters containing the motto honi soit qui mal y pense there were made for the sovereign three harnesses whereof two were of white velvet wrought over with garters de blu and daspi per totum compedmein cum woodhouses and the third de velveto ynde cont lappkin quisseux and caligas wrought over likewise with garters had the roll been divided into years or had distinguishing marks of time upon it we might have been guided with more certainty as to the true year of the institution however we may thence conclude it was not founded in the   th of edw iii because that the sovereigns robes were not made until the   d year of his reign at soonest perhaps not till the beginning of the   d but to put the matter beyond dispute the founders statutes fix the time of institution to his   d year so do the statutes of king henry v and the preface to the black book leland mills and dr heylin to conclude when he had fixed upon the day and place for elebrating the first grand feast of this order he sent his heralds into germany france scotland burgundy hainault flanders and brabant to invite all knights and esquires with assurance of safe conduct and liberty for fifteen days both before and after the grand solemnity to show their military prowess and other public exercises there to be performed proper to the place and occasion agreeable to which invitation sundry knights and gallant men came over to signalize their valor and what made the solemnity more glorious king edwards queen was there present attended with three hundred of the fairest ladies in all imaginable splendour and gaity    the patrons of the order were several under whose protection according to the custom of the age king edw iii put himself and all the knightscompanions that the affairs of the order might be defended preserved and governed  the first and chiefest which he elected was the holy trinity which in a more especial manner was invocated to the aid and assistance of this order  secondly king dward iii entitled peculiarly the blessed virgin mary accounted then the general mediatrix and protectress of all men unto whom kin edward iv was so strictly devoted that he thought some additional ceremonies requisite to her farther honor and thereupon ordaind that on her five solemnities the knights companions should annually as accustomed on the feast of st george wear the habit of the order as long as divine service was celebrating unless they had sufficient cause of excuse bearing on the right shoulders of their robes a golden figure of the virgin mary and that they should go in the same manner and habit upon all sundays throughout the year and lastly that on the same days for ever they should say five pater nosters with as many ave marias  thirdly st george of cappadocia a most choice champion of christ and famous martyr was also elected one of the patrons to this order by king edward iii not so much as he was a professor of the christian faith or for that he was an armed soldier or knight of christ but so much the more because in those wars which were waged by the christians against the infidels he by several appearances manifested his presence as a most certain encourager and assistant to the christians the relations whereof may be seen in dr heylins history who has laboriously and judiciously maintained the history of this saint against those that will not allow him a place in heaven or a being in the church in like manner the learned seldom has avouchd him to be the special patron protector defender and advocate of this realm of england and has made it plainly appear in what veneration he has been honored abroad especially among the eastern nations to whose corroborating testimonies we shall add that this title of patron to our nation as given to st george by the founder of this order in a patent granted to the dean and canons of the chapel of st stephen at westminser and st george at windsor which discharges them from payment of tithes as also by king henry viii in the preambe of his sttutes and though in general he is styd the principal patron of the affairs of christendom and a tutelar guardian of military men yet among all christians the english did excel and in this nation the founder of this order in making choice of such an approved  captain and patron in particular respct o whom the knights had the title of  st georges knights and the order it self came to  called the ordo divi sancti georgii the order of st george  it is remarkable that du chesn a noted french historian acknowledges it was by the special invocation of st george that king edward iii gained the battle of cressy which afterward bringing to his remembrance he founded says he a chapel within the castle of windsor but if we may ascend a step higher and give credit to harding it is recorded king arthur paid st george particular honors for he advanced his picture in one of his banners which was about two hundred years after his martyrdom and very early for a country so remote from cappadocia to have him in reverence and esteem  lastly the founder added a fourth patron whose name himself bore viz st edward the confessor his predecessor king of engand and we find he was wont to be invocated by this founder as well as st george in any great difficulties and streights walsingham gives an instance at the skirmish of calais a d      when king edward in great anger and grief drew out his sword and most passionately cried out ha st edward ha st george which his soldiers hearng ran presently to him and rushing violently upon the enemy put many of them to the sword these four patrons we find recorded together in the preamble of the foundation of windsor college by king edward iii though in the preamble to his statutes of the order and to king henry vs statutes st edward the confessor is omitted nevertheless he is enumerated with the rest in the preamble to king hnry viiis    as to the honor and reputation of this noble order either in comparison with others or in reference to it self it challenges the precedence of antiquity before the eldest rank of honor of that kind any where established  secondy the statutes of the foundation were so exquisitely and judiciously devised and compacted upon such solid foundations of honor and nobleness that they afterward became a precedent to other orders and gave the plan to those two of the golden flece and of monsieur st michael as is manifest by comparing their statutes  thirdly it is no small honor that accrues to this order that the number of these knightscompanions were never increased but as they were twenty six with the sovereign so they now thus continue ut pretium faciat raritas for the infringing this article has split several other military orders into contempt and ruin as nothing more tarnishing or throwing a fully on the worth of glory and honor than when rendered so vulgar and indifferently disposed without distinction and merit as is exemplified in the order of the star and the now declining order of st michael  fourthly it has received more additional luster by being honored with the companionship of diverse emperors kings and sovereign princes who esteemd it the summit of their glory and the highest trophy of additional honor to be enrolled in the number insomuch that some of them with impatience courted the election for we find recorded in the register a d      eight emperors of germany three kings of spain five french kings two kings of scotland five kings of denmark five kings of portugal two kings of sweden one king of poland one king of arragon two kings of naples besides diverse dukes and other free princes as one duke of guelderland one duke of holland two dukes of burgundy two dukes of brunswick one duke of milan two dukes of urbin one duke of ferrara one duke of savoy two dukes of holstein one duke of saxony and one duke of wertemberg seven count palatines of the rhin four princes of orange and one marquis of brandenburg  fifthly it entitles those knights and noblemen whose virtue has raised them to this pitch of greatness to be companions and associates with emperors and kings a prerogative of an high nature and a sufficient recompense for the greatest merit we shall close up all with the high elogy bestowed on it by the learned seldom that it exceeds in majesty honor and fame all chivalrous orders of the world  cap vi the statutes and annals of the order order and regularity is not only the beauty and symmetry of government and societies but also greatly contributes to their establishment and perpetuity statutes and rules are as well the bounds to determine as bonds to unite fellowship and societies together and if either fall into difuse or be unadvisedly broken they open a field to dissolution and ruin  such like considerations moved and excited the victorious king edward iii after he had determined the erection of this most renowned order of the garter to devise and institute several laudable statutes and ordinances to be duly observed and kept within the said order which being collected into one body are called the statutes of institution  the original of these was ordained to be kept within the treasury of the college of windsor but has long since wholly perished yet a transcript of them is recorded in the reign of king henry v in an old book called registrum ordinis chartaceum two more ancient exemplars of this body of statutes are also in being the one in the library of the lord hatton and the other in the black book of the order and comparing them together i shall here give from the latin the heads they consist of    the king of england his heirs and successors are to be sovereigns or superiors of this order    none are to be admitted unless he be a gentleman of blood and that he be a knight and without reproach    the knightscompanions were to be twenty six ach to have at windsor a mantle and garter for the better splendour of the order to wear the said habit whenever they go to the chapel of st george or chapter house to hold a chapter or do any thing relating to their order in like manner they are to wear the habit upon the vigils of st george in their procession from the kings lodgings to the chapel or chapter house and returning back and during supper continue so habited till it be over and likewise on the morrow of st georges day at chapel dinnertime suppertime and afterward all the said day until the sovereign or his deputy shall deposite the ensigns of the order and decree their departure    there were to be thirteen canons secular who at the time of their institution or within a year were to be priests and as many vicars already priests or to be made so at the next ordination answerable to the number of the knightscompanions these religious persons to be presented by the several founders each one and upon the death or vacancy of such presented the sovereign of the order ever afterward to have the nomination of them who were bound to pray for the good estate of the sovereign and his kingdom and particularly for this order    the canons were to wear a purple mantle with the arms of st george in a roundle upon their right shoulder    there were to be twenty six poor veterane knights ach to have a competent subsistence their election to be after the manner of the canons aforesaid    these knights were to have a red mantle with the arms of st george but without any circle of the garter about it    if the sovereign could not be present at the solemn festival of st george his deputy was to supply his place at the charge of the sovereign but such deputy was not to make any new ordinances though he has license to correct or amend the old ones    every year upon the vigils of st george the knightscompanions within the realm or elsewhere if conveniently are to assemble at windsor castle and be present there at the celebration of divine service in the habit of the order where placed regularly in their stalls or seats directly over their heads their helmets and swords etc are to be hung up and remain as long as such knights live in honor of them and to signify the defense of the church to which they are obliged as a military order but in case the feast of st george happens to fall within the quindene or fifteen days after the feast of easter then it was to be prorogued to the sunday next following accounting fifteen days from easter day that every knightcompanion might have reasonable time to come nor be forced to ride upon any of the three easter holy days   0 that they meet in st georges chapel yearly on the eve of st george at the hour of three in the afternoon and if they come not at the time assigned without a just excuse which the sovereign or his deputy allows their penalty is to be according to the ordinance of the chapter which is that they shall not enter into the chapter door for that time but say without and shall have no voice in any thing that is done in the said chapter and if they come not before the beginning of vespers they shall not enter into their stalls but shall tarry below before the said stalls in the choiristers places during vespers the like penalty is ordained for not coming to the mass or morningservice betime and at vespers on st georges day and whosoever shall absent himself wholly from this solemnity without sufficient excuse and leave from the sovereign or deputy he is not to enter within his stall the next feast after but shall stay below and before his stall as it is said at vespers and in the morrows procession must walk before the three processional crosses now the choristers and at mass service shall sit below until the offering and he to offer last after which he is to come before the sovereign or his deputys stall and ask pardon which reinstates him in his stall absenting the next second time upon the feast without leave he has no stall allowed him until he has given and offered a jewel upon st georges altar to the value of twenty marks which is to be double every year until a reconciliation     wheresoever they be they must wear their blue robes from the beginning of the first vespers on the eve of st georges day to the second vespers on the morrow inclusive etc     if any knightcompanion appears publicly without his dignifying garter upon challenging the same is to pay half a mark to the custos and college     at the times of offering each associated with the other who holds the opposite stall are to march in procession together to make their offerings but alone when his consort is absent and so that in all processions the sovereign goes last     in the morrow after the solemnity of st georges feast is over before their separating a mass de requie or office de defunctis was to be used at which the knightscompanions were all entirely to be present without necessary impediment shown to the sovereign or deputy for liberty to depart     they were to leave their robes at windsor always to be ready for them there upon any sudden occasions that might evene     journying near windsor in honor of the place unless lawful cause obstructs they must take it in their way and assuming the habit of the order the canons wore devoutly to meet and conduct them into the chapel where if it happens to be time of divine service they are to hear the same if not they are to be detained no longer than while the canons shall say the psalm de profundis for the defunct and during their own offering but if any had riden through the town without visiting the chapel and offering there for every neglect he must go one mile on foot from the said chapel to show his obedience and offer an halfpenny in honor of st george     upon first notice of the death of any of the order the sovereign shall ordain a thousand masses every foreign prince shall cause eight hundred a prince of wales seven hundred a duk six hundred an earl three hundred every baron two hundred and every knight batchellor one hundred masses to be celebrated for the good of the soul departed which neglected for a quarter of a year after notice of such death the masses are to be doubled upon half a years neglect again doubled and so from time to time in like form till the end of the year and then the years to be doubled     upon sure notice of the death of a knightcompanion the sovereign or his deputy is to converse by letters the remainder not strangers that are within the kingdom to meet him within six weeks in some convenient place and elect another which assembled at least six with the sovereign or deputy every of them present is to name nine of the worthiest and sufficientest knights without reproof that he knows whether native subjects or foreigners sobeit they hold no contrary party or be against the sovereign viz three earls or of sublimer title three barons and three knights batchellors which names the bishop of windsor for the time being was to write or in his absence the dean or register and in their absence the oldest residencer in the college and after show them to the sovereign who is to choose out of them him that has the most voices and whom he esteems the most beneficial to the crown and kingdom every knight failing to appear at an election without an approved cause was to pay to the custos and college the penalty of a mark and at his next coming to the chapter shall kneel upon the ground in the midst of the chapter before the sovereign or deputy until reconciliation     soon after election the knightcompanion elect is to have a garter in token of his election and that he is a fellow of the order and as soon as decreed to take possession of his stall but not before is to have a mantle which if he dies before he received he was not to be accounted as one of the order because he wanted possession nevertheless he was to have one half of the masses abovesaid because he had the garter delivered to him and nothing beside if he was not installed within a year after his receiving the garter and especially if within the realm and without reasonable excuse to be allowed of by the sovereign or deputy his election became void and they might proceed to a new one moreover neither the sword nor helmet was to be put upon his stall within the castle before his coming to the end that if the knight elect came not his achievements might not be unhandsomly taken down and abused but honorably removed into the choir for the public use and profit of the said college   0 every foreigner elected was to have certification of such his election from the sovereign at the sovereigns charge who was to send him the garter and the mantle and a copy of the statutes of the order under the common seal of the said order within four months after the election the better for him to advise on which being accepted of whatsoever condition he be he was obliged within eight months after to send a sufficient proxy according to his state and dignity a knight irreprehensible to be installed in his room and who was to bring with him a silk mantle of the blue color of the order also a sword and helmet to remain at windsor which mantle was be put upon the right shoulder of the proxy by the sovereign or deputy at the time of installment when he is introduced to take the stall in the name of his lord and master neither was he to deposite the same till the end of divine service after which he was not to wear it nor be admitted in the chapter house or have any suffrage by virtue of any powers vested in him but this favor foreigners elected by proxy were to have that could not personally come themselves they were to be partakers of the whole masses and orisons of the order whereas if they died before the installation they were to have but a moity of them     upon the death of any earl or of superior dignity baron or knight batchellor his successor whether earl or of superior dignity baron or knight was to have a vacant stall of his predcssor without any changing of places except the prince of wales alone who was to have always the next stall and opposite to the sovereign so that it may happen for a knight to have an earls place or an earl a knights place and this because the first founders might be nown     every knightcompanion at his first entrance was to give a certain alms according to their eminence and degree for the perpetual maintenance of the canons and poor knights viz the sovereign forty marks a foreign king twenty pounds a prince of wales twenty marks a duke ten pounds an earl ten marks a baron a hundred shillings and a knight batchellor five marks that by these pious dontions they might justly entitle themselves to the name and privileges of the order wherefore before these payments were rightly performed their sword and helmet atchievements were not to be hung up and for foreigners the sovereign was obliged to pay himself     upon the death of any of the founders his arms in a plate of metal was to be fixed upon the back of his stall and their successors were to have the like but to be placed underneath their predecessors and not to be so great as those of the first founders     at admission every knightcompanion must promise and swear personally or by proxy faithfully to observe the statutes of the order and none are to be installed by proxy but foreigners only which cannot conveniently come in person     if the sovereign be out of england at the installation of any knightcompanion or could not attend himself to do what appertains to him in that point he might empower and authorize any of the fellows to officiate for him     that there be a common seal or signet keeper whom the sovereign was to assign     every knightcompanion was to have a copy of the statutes under the seal of the order the original sealed likewise with the said seal to remain for evermore within the treasury of the college and upon the death of any knightcompanion his executors were to send back such copy to be delivered to the custos or warden     no knightcompanion was to go out of the realm and dominion of england without the knowldge and license of the sovereign who of grace and favor is bound to grant it upon a military expedition or other notable act appertaining to the honor of knighthood in preference and advancement of this order of st george     they were not to arm themselves against each other but in the wars of their sovereign lord in his right and just quarrel and if it happened that any of the order should be retained in the cause and quarrel of any lord and the adverse party desired another knightcompanion on his side that latter knight isby no means to agree but to excuse himself in all things because his fellow was armed on the other side and was retained before him and every knight was bound to except and agree at his being retained that he may have his discharge from the wars upon any of the orders being engaged in arms before him for the contrary party and if the second retained knows not of it upon notice that any of his fellows were retained before him and armed on the contrary side the second retained knight was to excuse himself to his master and relinquish the quarrel   0 all licenses given to the knightcompanions to travel in quest of honor by military exploits also all certificates mandatous letters certificates and other writings whatsoever relating to the order were to be issued out by the sovereign under the seal of the order to remain in the keeping of one of the order during the sovereigns pleasure and if the keeper of the seal absent himself upon reasonable cause he was to leave the seal with another of the fellowship that the sovereign should appoint to the intent that the seal at no time be out of the presence of the sovereign he being within his dominion and in like manner concerning the seal in the absence of the sovereign or the deputy     if any knightcompanion for devotion sake should desire to dwell at windsor he was to maintain himself at his own and not at the college charge     any other knight not of the order upon the account of devotion that would reside there was to be provided for at the appointment of the sovereign and the fellowship also any knight or other person giving  0 l yearly rents or lands or more to the college to participat of their prayers and suffrages he was to be registered in the calendar of benefactors and continually be prayed for by the canons and poor knights     upon the death of any canon the custos or warden is to certify the same by letters to the sovereign if beyond sea to know whom he pleases to present to the canonship     there was to be a register appointed by the sovereign and fellowship the most intelligent person of the college who was to be present at the chapters to record their elections and the electors their punishments and causes of them with their reconciliations all acts whatsoever administered in their council from chapter to chapter yearly for the faithful execution of which office he was to be sworn at his admission therein and whatsoever had been registered was in the beginning of the following chapter on the vigils of st george to be publicly recited before the sovereign and the whole fellowship that what was amiss and incorrect might be mended and reduced to due form    besides these statutes there are two other bodies or exemplars established since the one by king henry v the other by king hen viii king henry v finding the glory of the order declining removed the grand festival and other solemnities and commanded a strict observation of all the founders statutes and brought many more to like perfection which he subjoined to such of them where they might be proprly and are as follow  to article   that the knights should mark their obeisance in the choir first to the altar and next to the sovereign or in his absence to his stall   that the deputy should lect if the sovereign when abroad had not six knights with him   that the feast of st george should not be kept upon st marks day nor the days of st philip and jacob nor of the holy cross neither upon any days which should happen in the festivals of th ascension or pentecost or other solem feasts ordained by the church to the interrupting their divine service    that when a knight should rid out he might wear a blue silk ribbon instead of his garter    that the order and manner o offering up the achievements should b as is there prescribed viz before the offer their money their swords should b first offered by two companions which the sovereign or his deputy should appoint and afterward their helmets with their crests by two others of the order  0 that knights absent in the sovereigns service might be installed by deputy    that the sovereign should take a signet of the order abroad with him to be fixed to all the acts he does in foreign parts relating to this order in distinction to those done at home    that no charge should be admitted upon the college by the custos or canons without the sovereigns consent likewise   the statutes with these additions as the statutes of institution this king caused to be translated into french and transcribed into a roll which was ordered to be presented to every knightcompanion under the common seal of the order in after times it was transcribed into books and by a decree anno  hen vii an original book of these statutes and institution fair written was to be reposed in the college of st gorg and the scribe or register to have transcripts of them in readiness to present the elected knights withal  the last and largest body was first began and received the finishing sroke by king hen viii chiefly in regard some of the former statutes wanted explication and others contraction and for the completing of which purpose on st georges day anno   regni sui he summoned all the knightscompanions to convene next year at the time of the solemnity about the abrogation of what tended to darken the honor of this order if any such were and for the advancement of what might promote the grandeur and luster of it but these resolves came to no perfection till may    anno    regni sui when he entered upon this reformation with all magnificent ceremony imaginable for being accompanied with nineteen knightscompanions of the order proceeding in cavalcade to the chapter house and taking into consideration their former statutes of knightscompanions with all due reverence implored the sovereign to reform and explain them as he should think convenient which he brought to a successful period by the advice and consent of the society assembled that done all present entreated the sovereign kneeling that where any of them had been peccant against the order he would please to remit and issue out a general pardon which he granted and ratified in chapter next day this was a task of three years complete before it rose to perfection viz april    anno    hen viii for then the sovereign out of right singular love welltempered zeal and entire affection to this most noble order to the estate of chivalry and the continuance and increase thereof as also at the humble request and instant importunity of the then knightscompanions and by their advice counsel and consent did interpret and elucidate all the obscurities doubts and ambiguities of the former statutes and ordinances diverse affairs contained in fifty of them being explained and amended he made likewise necessary additions the original whereof being signed and sealed were commanded to be carefully laid up in the treasury of windsor college to remain as a standard to succeeding times yet they have not been seen there these many years past  the articles and clauses added to the former stautes in this last body are these  to article   that the interpretation of the statutes etc belongs to the sovereign   the three points of reproach declared and what is meant by a gentleman of blood   of the prerogative of the feast   how the feast is to be observed by absent knights   attendance on the sovereign if he be not at the feast   that the sovereigns deputy may correct things in chapter    the offering up of achievements and a taper armed with an escutcheon    canons to sit in the lower stalls when any knights are present    that six knights make a chapter  0 the manner of installation set down    clause for a foreign knights deputy to be conducted from the chapter house to the stall and for making an election void if the knight send not his proxy within seven months    for advancing and translating of stalls    plates not to be larger than the first founders except strangers    the time three months prefixed for the executor of a deceased knightcompanion to send back the copy of the orders delivered to him at his admission which might be also sent to one of the principal officers of the order    concerning the collar of the order   this body of statutes was compiled in latin and is recorded in the black book of the order it was translated into french and english by sir thomas wriothesly knight then garter king of arms the english version annexed here to this treatise is what has since been delivered instead of the former statutes to all succeeding knightscompanions according to the injunction but of late times appointed to be sent to foreign princes and other elect knights abroad sealed with the great seal of the order affixed to a label of blue silk and gold    there have been several endeavors since the reign of king henry viii for reforming the statutes as first king edward vi who as sovereign by the orders themselves had an undoubted prerogative set him to alter and reform many things which seemed inconsistent with the religion he established to which purpose at a chapter at greenwich held april    in the third year of his reign the lord st john the earl of arundel and sir william paget were to peruse and make them agreeable to the kings other proceedings by the assistance and advice of the protector the duke of somerset and other companions this was followed by a subsequent order passed in the chater at greenwich the year after that the statutes should be reformed and corrected as they thought expedient and for the better accomplishment of their design at the next feast april      edw vi another order commenced impowering the duke of somerset the marquess of northampton the earls of warwick arundel bedford and wits to peruse and amend the statures and other books of the order which were brought to some tolerable degree of perfection for thereupon a new body was collected in general very much altering the laws of the order and published march    anno   edw vi but this king within four months after expiring queen mary his sister and successor the very first thing she transacted was to abrogate and make them void wherefore we need not mention them as never in use and unrevived for the execution of which purpose she convened a chapter at st jamess the   th of september following and it was then decreed that the said laws and ordinances as inconvenient impertinent and tending to novelty should be disannulled and no account to be made of them for the future and for the quicker execution sir william petre that day admitted chancellor had orders to see them speedily expunged out of the book of statutes and forthwith defaced lest any memory of them should remain to posterity and only those of her father hen viii and his royal predecessors should be retained  in this affair king philip her husband appeared no less zealous for on the  th of august   and   philip and mary which was the  d day after he had been invested with the habit himself being present at a chapter at windsor it was ordained that all acts and decrees in the great book  ie the black book aforesaid which were repugnant and disagreeable either with the ancient and received statutes of the order or else with the laws of the realm should clearly be abolished and erased by the marquis of winchester the earls of arundl pembroke and the lord paget  no sooner was queen elizabeth fixed on the throne but soon after viz on st georges day in the second year of her reign a view of the statutes was committed by commission to four of the knightscompanions viz the marquis of northampton the earls of arundel and pembroke and the lord howard of effingham who were thereby empowered to peruse and consider those statutes with the utmost care and regard if any of them were repugnant to the religion laws and statutes of the realm and if any such were recorded to represent them faithfully to the sovereign that she in conjunction with the knightscompanions might establish such decrees concerning them as she should think sit but that any thing was done in pursuance hereunto does not appear for the transcripts of her fathers body of the statutes throughout the time of her reign were presented to the knghtscompanions at their instailations and the practice of her time was pursuant to the direction therein except in some few things now and then added or altered at future chapters when there arose fresh matters for such expedients  king james i her successor revolved something toward a new regulation and in order to put it in execution the   th of may in the  th year of his reign decreed that commissionary letters should be granted to the earls of nottingham worcester pembroke and northampton to empower them to examine the registers and other monuments which pertained to that order and where any passage should be found obsolete or obscure to make it conspicuous and clear where contrariety appeared fitly to reconcile it yet with no design of innovating any thing but an intention of renewing all as near as might be to the first standard and most ancient institution of the order saving always power to himself as sovereign of the order to add or diminish any matter according to the occasion as it should seem agreeable to his prudence for the honor of this most noble order what progress they made in this commission the memoirs of that time are silent in but some few years after this affair was revived and another was issued forth to the earls of nottingham worcster southampton arundel and montgomery and the viscount lisle all knightscompanions dated april    in the   th year of his reign which six or any four of them were thereby constituted to take an exact survey of all the ancient statutes and articles of the said order and authorized to call before them all such persons whether officers of the said order or others as could give any light or information concerning that affair and after a serious deliberation to pen down what in them they conceived meet to be explained and what to be added whereby to render the order more illustrious that the same being presented to the sovereign and the society at a chapter holden might be resolved on in part or in all to be put in excution if it seemed so good to that king  this affair moved very slowly but toward the latter end of his reign the earls of worcester montgomery arundel surry and lecester five of the six commissioners abovenamed having held diverse conferences and debated several matters represented to them and at a chapter convened at whitehall the   th of may anno  0 jac i did present to the sovereign certain articles subscribed with their hands which for the honor of the order they thought requisite to be duly observed  by the first of which they made provision for a further progression and advancement of the illustrious institution in proposing that every year a commission from the sovereign should be granted or continued to such knights of the order as the chapter should pitch on to deliberate and weigh all affairs that fell under the order and that the year after an estimate by the knights in chapter should be exhibited of their resolutions and proceedings by virtue of the said commission this with eight other articles were confirmed by the sovereign and twelve of the knightscompanions the   d of may following in a chapter held at whitehall and so prosperously their endeavors succeeded that on the feast day of st george at windsor in the ensuing year the earl of worcester being then the sovereigndeputy with ten knightscompanions more gave their assent to eight other articles most of them concerning the almsknights which the morning after had the approbation of the sovereign and before the celebration of divine service by his deputy and companions assembled in the chapter house the observation thereof was duly decreed  king charles i designed and endeavored the most complete and absolute reformation of any of his predecessors and at the solemnity of st george held at windsor the  th of october in the  th year of his reign he commissioned nine knightscompanions viz the earls of mulgrave pembroke montgomery arundl surry salisbury carlisle dorset holland berkshire and suffolk with command to assemble four times in a year to take into their consideration the affairs of the order all which but the earls of mulgrave and dorset met at whitehall the  d of january following where some few matters fell under their consultation this commission was seconded by one of a larger extent about three months after and directed to the said knightscompanions or to any eight seven six five or four of them empowering them to meet and devise and exactly preponderate all the statutes and ordinances of the order as well such as were established at the foundation as those that had been since made by explanation or addition and to weigh advisedly whether any thing had been enacted that had caused doubt or ambiguity or stood in need of any change or amendment and if upon mature deliberation by them thus convened there should appear any contrariety or defect for want of plain expression or other omission fit to be supplied tending to the honor of the order that then the sovereign might upon return of their proceedings resolve upon some general declaration in chapter to reform and reduce into one body all the statutes and ordinances thereof that the same being compiled and settled in one perfect model might be so consigned to posterity free from all future questions and doubts  never theless not any thing was done upon this commission though it stood in force even from the  th to the   th year of this kings reign but where the neglect lay history does not fully inform us though it may be conjectured by what follows  at the feast of st gorge celebrated by prorogation at white hall for the year      upon the   th   th and   th days of april      diverse petitions for reformation and reducing of matters to their pristine constitution were presented to the sovereign by the chancellor and read some of which more especially tending to set off and increase the honor of the order were received and decreed by the sovereign and the rest referred to the said knightscommissioners the first of those decrees which at that time had its sanction was to revive and renew the powers given in the former commission and thereupon a new one dated the  th of may following was issued under the great seal of the order and directed to the earls of mulgrave darby pembroke and montgomery arundel and surry kelly salisbury dorset holland barkshire suffolk lyndsey exeter marquess hamilton duke of lenox the earls of darby moreton and northumberland or to three or more of them to meet and consult of any matters contained in the statutes or for honor of the order these knightscommissioners were endowed with all the plenary powers given in the foresaid commission dated   car i unto which was granted a further addition for the better effecting the sovereigns care that three or more of them should meet at the sovereigns court and begin to put the said commission in execution in whitson week next ensuing attended and assisted by the chancellor of the order and all or any other officers or such of them as they should fix on or find serviceable and being assembled to have free liberty to hear propound and debate of whatsoever shall fall under their cognizance or that they should conceive conducible to the honor and perfect establishment of so illustrious and noble a body and to prepare all matters of such their resolutions and debates to be laid before the sovereign at the next feast of st george and so successively at every chapter so appointed by him to receive his full determination approbation and royal assent with further power to adjourn from time to time after the first opening and reading of the said commission their meetings to be in such places and on such days as should seem most convenient to them  now who would suppose that after so noble an intention of the sovereign and his earnest solicitude to issue forth a second commission his hearty recommending and exciting their deligence for a speedy dispatch and lastly his expecting an account of their transactions the next feast these honorable persons companions of the order should need a spur to accomplish so laudable a design but it was so  for although the commission was opened at white hall the  0th of may following in the presence of the earls of pembroke and montgomery salishury holland marquess of hamilton and duke of lenox commissioners yet sir thomas row chancellor in his letter to dr christopher wren dated the  th of june      sadly complained that it was much as he could do to draw together five of the knightscompanions to open and read the commission and this quasi in ransi was in confusion and hurry and all that was transacted was to appoint another convention at court in msummer week then next ensuing and charge the chancellor to prepare matter for propositions and observations upon the statutes fit for their consultations against that appointment according to the tenor of the commission and in another place writes that he found such difficulty to procure meetings and as certain non chalance in every one as if it were but a ceremonious affair and so few hearty in it that he feared he and the officers should wait to little purpose and so indeed it fell out for albeit he attnded in midsummer week according to their direction yet there was nothing dispatched save only the adjourning of their meeting to london  some little progress was afterward made in this affair at white hall the  th of february following where three of them were present viz the earls of brkshire lindsey and northumberland who ordered the chancellor register and garter to prepare an abbreviation of the statutes and reduce every thing of one head into an act to keep up to method and avoid confusion  the  st of february after another assembly of seven of the knightscommissioners was held at white hall in whose presence a few points were debated but little or nothing concluded    as concerning the annals of the order or the books wherein the several resolutions and decrees occasionally made in chapters and wherein other historical and ceremonial matters relating to it are recorded t will not be amiss to give some account of them in this place  the first in order of time is an old paper book written in french called registrum chartaceum hitherto fortunately preserved in the paper office at white hall which probably was bgun by john coningham for we find him      a little before the annals commenced made canon of windsor and register of the order and in regard the same handwriting is carried on from the beginning of the book down to    hen vi inclusive where follows an hitus till anno    hen vi that the annals began to be set down with another hand and that he shortly after died in      henceforward these annals are entered with promiscuous hands which may be presumed the proper handwritings of the registers of this noble order as they succeeded each other in the office  after we find richard sidnor mentioned in the register anno    hen viii who subscribed his name at the foot of every leaf the annals were penned in one hand until anno    hen viii that robert adrydge d d and one of the canons of windsor succeeded him and then it is evident the writing also was changed to an old set roman hand which ran on to the end of    hen viii in which year he was advanced to the bishopric of carlisle and this book breaks off in the   st of his reign  besides this there is another book that goes by the name of the black book wherein the annals of the order are transcribed in latin concerning which there passed a decree anno   hen vii that it should be fairly copied out and afterward that the sovereign should be put in remembrance of it but neither of these decrees was put in execution nor was this confirmed till toward the end of the reign of king henry viii this book differs very little from the registrum chartaceum for therein is nothing enrolled relating to the order except one of the exemplars of the founders statutes and a catalogue of the first twentyfive knightscompanions before the  th year of king henry v the annals of the order until that time being entirely lost it has the same hiatus or intervals from    to    hen vi from   to  0 of edw   from   to   hen vii and from  0 to    hen   it also runs parallel therewith for the most part and that it was compiled by dr aldrydge whilst he continued register is collected from some passages in the preface of all the sovereigns ending with king henry viii the transcription of this book was finished anno    hen viii for so far is written as also the appendix with one and the same hand in a middlesizd text but anno   hen viii another hand appears which with some variation is continued to the end of   edw vi where this book breaks off  the register of the order was obliged to provide two books and therein to enter the ordinances statutes and acts of this noble corporation one to be lodged at the chapter house at windsor and called index windesoriensis and the other being a duplicate of the former to remain in his own custody ready to expose to the view of the sovereign whenever he should demand it this latter was called aulae registrum  as to the general directions for compiling these books and the particulars they are to consist of we are informed from the said statutes and constitutions for besides the entry of all the scrutinies taken in chapter and elections made thereupon it is his office to record the penalties inflicted on knightscompanions and the reconciliation of all delinquents with other acts and their causes appertaining to the order all which are decreed to be recited before the sovereign and knightscompanions at the beginning of the chapter yearly if occasion be to correct and reduce into method moreover he is to record all the policies in war exploits transactions and memorable achievements both of the sovereign and knightscompanions according as he can best attain the knowledge of them by his own diligent search or the assistance of mr garter which having consigned to writing from year to year is to be perused at the next chapter by the knightscompanions for their approbation and correction and being reiterated the second time in the chapter he is to see that they be fairly engrossed in the said book for a perpetual remembrance  and because the time perfixd for rehearsal of these particulars in chapter had in succeeding years been employed in other affairs in one of those articles which the knightscompanions exhibited to king jac i the   th of may anno jac r  0 and ratified the   d of may following it was decreed that nothing of this nature or any other act in chapter should be registered before it had been perused and passed the consideration of the then knightscompanions or at least four of them who when they should set times apart to consult of the affairs of this order for which they were chiefly commissioned might then also make use of such opportunities as should give this business dispatch with more convenience upon mature consideration had of those injunctions the then register at a chapter held    nov    car ii presented the continuation of the annals of this order which he had ranged in order to register in the liber carolinus and submitted them to the approbation of the knightscompanions whom the sovereign had commissioned to inspect the affairs of the order which tender when they declined he proposed that it might pass the examination of the prelate but they not giving the ir assent to it in regard the register himself was under the obligation of an oath to deal with the utmost fidelity in his reports it was decreed that the said annals should be fairly recorded in the book without any further inspection  besides the abovementioned particulars there were materials of another nature decreed to be collected by the chancellor of the order and garter king of arms to be digested first and after entered by the register for whereas one part of the chancellors duty was to make a narration every year in chapter at the feast of st george of the illustrious exploits of the knightscompanions as well as the actions that tend to eclipse their glory so the register was to note these and record them from a perpetual era or memorial of their honor or disgrace  and it is part of garters duty diligently to enquire after the valiant fortunate and renowned acts both of the sovereign and the rest of the knightscompanions and relate them with all exactness to the register for his engrossing but how sparingly these are put in execution the annals themselves bear witness however sir edward walker garterking has drawn up an account of the shining actions and characters of the knightscompanions beginning with thomas earl of strafford and continuing it down to his son which he delivered dr ryves the register for the use aforedirected  among the articles established at the feast of st george    jac i the last is that the then register should compose a book wherein should be orderly transcribed the form and manner of all the solemnties ceremonies and processions at the celebration of the order as also of taking down and offering the defunct knights achievements that the knightscompanions might have free recourse to it but such book never was extant  for the safety and preservation of the annals the knightscommissioners determined the   d of may an jac i  0 that a secure and convenient place within the castle of windsor should be appointed in which all acts concerning the order should be reposed and to which every knightcompanion at all times might have access and upon the remove or decease of the register of the order the book containing the account of all such transactions should be committed to one of the knights of the order  the second of these books is called the blue book so called being bound in blue velvet it begins with the first year of queen mary and ends at the   th of king jac i  the third being bound in red velvet is denominated the red book it commences where the blue book leaves off and treats of the like acts and entries and is carried down to    car i having first given a full account of the installation of the prince afterward king charles ii and as to great part of this work it was performed by the elegant and judicious dr matthew wren bishop of ely and register of the order whose excellent pattern his brother and successor dr christopher when has copied in its following tract this bishop compiled a ms a d      wherein by way of comment upon king henry viiis statutes he has comendiously shown what alteration there has passed in the law of the garter a work performed with great judgment and excedingly useful to the curious  the fourth and last book is liber carolinus and commences    0 wherein the annals are brought down to the beginning of    0 by ryves then register and in a chapter convened at windsor the   th of april anno   car ii it was decreed that there should be two of these books compiled the one printed in latin in the custos of the register at windsor and the other in english to be reserved at whitehall and called registrum aulicum  cap vii the habit and ensigns of the order the habit and ensigns of this most noble order are most eminently distinguishable and magnificent and consist of these particulars viz garter mantle surcoat hood george and collar for as the romans were very exact and particular in assigning each degree a peculiar habit and vesture by which the quality and rank of their citizens might be discernable the distinction of apparel was afterward taken up by diverse other nations whence every military as well as ecclesiastic order of knighthood did appropriate to it self a peculiar dress ensign or badge as a mark of distinction one from another to set off the luster and honor of their several societies  the four first viz the garter mantle surcoar and hood were assigned the knights companions by the founder and the george and collar by king henry viii and all these together are called the whole habit or ensigns of the order which we shall treat of succinctly beginning with the garter  the royal garter challenges the preeminence for from it this famous order received its denomination it is the first part of the habit presented to foreign princes and absent knights and that wherewith they and all other elect knights are first adorned and of so great honor and grandeur that by the bare investiture with this noble ensign the knights are esteemed companions of the greatest military order in the world  the materials whereof it was composed at first is an acanum nor is it described by any before polydore vigil and he but in general as to the ornamental part of it it was adorned with gold and precious stones and had a buckle of gold at the end to fasten it about  the garter  the sovereigns mantle  hood  surcoat  the collar and great george  ribbond and george  a knight companions mantle  cap and feather    to the illustrious potent and most noble henry duke marqss and earl of kent etc constable and govr of his maies royal castle and honr of windsor lord l of the county of bedd and custos rotuloru for the same  bedchamber and of ye most  privy council to his majes and knight of ye most noble order of ye garr this plate is humbly inscribed m  gucht scul   the leg but there is no doubt but it was wrought with rich embroidery and the motto raised with gold pearl and sundry sorts of silk as may be guessed from the garters anciently placed on the left side of the knightscompanions mantles and those other little embroidered garters wherewith their surcoats and hoods were heretofore embellished  but of those wrought in the last age we have more particular satisfaction for we find the garter sent to emanuel duke of savoy anno   and   philip and mary was set with letters of goldsmiths work the buckle and pendant of the same and on the pendant a ruby and a pearl hanging at the end the garter made for francis ii anno   elizabeth was richly wrought with letters of gold set off and garnished with stones the buckle and pendant weighing three ounces and an halfquarter was richly set with rubies and diamonds the french king henry iv had a garter of purple velvet embroidered with letters of gold and decked out with diamonds and rubies and the garter of christian iv king of denmark was embroidered with gold and pearls but that garter sent to gustavus adolphus king of sweden outvied all others conferred by former sovereigns each letter of the motto being composed of small diamonds and for every stop a diamond within a range of diamonds above and below on the sides of the garter and besides other diamonds on the buckle and about the same to the number in all of      the garter which king charles i wore upon his leg at the time of his martyrdom had the letters of the motto composed likewise of diamonds which amounted to the number of     it came to the hands of captain preston one of the usurpers captains from whom the trustees for sale of the kings goods received it and sold it to ireton sometimes lord mayor of london for  0  l but after the restoration the kings attorney general proceeding upon an action of trover and conversion verdict was given for the king against him for  0  l and  0 l costs of suits in trinity term    car ii  the motto of king charles ii was set with diamonds upon blue velvet and the borders wrought with fine gold wire the diamonds which framed the letters of the motto were rose diamonds much of a size or proportion but those which framed the stops tablediamonds the total which set each letter composed the stops ilot holes and adorned the buckle the table was two hundred and fifty the hinge of the buckle was pure gold and on it the sovereigns picture to the breast curiously cut in flatstitch crowned with a laurel and the military garb of the first roman emperors the table or pendant was gold and on the backside thereof engraved st george on horseback encountering the dragon  this noble ensign the garter was at the erection of the order appointed to be wore on the left leg a little beneath the knee which usage still presides and the placing it thus on the sepulchral portraictures of knightscompanions was an early custom for on the alabaster monument of sir william fitzwarin who was interred in the northside of the chancel at wantage in com berks    edw iii he lies there with his surcoat of arms upon his breast and the representation of a garter but without motto carved upon his left leg in the same posture lies sir richard pembridge elected a knightcompanion temp edw iii and is portraicted on his monument in the south side of the cathedral of hereford below the pulpit and encompassed with a rail of ironspikes  the next monument whereon the garter was depicted was that erected for sir simon burley beheaded a d      and reared in the northwall near the choir of st pauls london thenceforward the practice became more frequent and then the motto began to be cut thereon insomuch that it is now the constant and just practice to do it whenever the knightscompanions are exhibited in effigies  and although this ensign was first designed in ornament to the left leg yet it was not confined so solely thereto but was anciently used to incircle the escutcheon of st georges arms worn by the sovereign and knightscompanions on their mantles who within a small space after used it to surround their own proper coat of arms which their successors have retained as their peculiar privilege permitting it to none but to their principal officer the prelate of the order  the first example that occurs is the beforementioned of sir francis burley where on the front toward the head is his own arms empaling his first wifes set within a garter wanting the impress but another having the same empalement placed below the feet is surrounded with a collar of ss of the same form with that about his neck  the monument also of joan wife of ralph nevil earl of westmoreland on the south side of the choir in the cathedral of lincoln bears the arms of nevil empaling those of joan his wife who died a d    0 incircled within a garter and fixed on this ladys monument daughter to john of gount duke of lancaster is there such a collar of ss placed about a square but the paint being faded was rendered unintelligible  another antique instance is that escutcheon sable three ostrich feathers argent surrounded with the garter affixed in the glasswindows of greenwichchurch in kent by humfrey duke of gloucester and supported with a greyhound and an antelope it is reported these three feathers were the ensign of king henry iv which were conferred by john of gaunt his father who bore them for his device and placed in a field sable as here but the pens were powdered with ermin for a difference from the black princes feather which were argent as the kings pen was or and the duke of somersets compony argent and azure  the arms of sir lwis robessart lord bourchier knightcompanion tmp en v we find encompassed with a garter on each side his monument in westminsierabbey  at the interment of richard duke of york father to king edw iv at every corner of the majestyescutcheon set over the image of the dsunct was an esutcheon of the arms of france and gland quartrly and our agels gold holding the same within a garter and so some of the funeral esutchons of john viscount wells who died    hen vii were surrounded with the garter as others bearing his ladys arms  at the interment of thomas duke of norfolk in thetfordabbey who died    hen viii there was provided a shield of his arms within a garter and a coronet affixed over it a target also of the arms of george earl of shrewsbury within a garter was born at his funural anno    hen viii  it was the custom begun about the reign of hen vii when the obsequies of any foreign prince were celebrated in england to paint an escutcheon of such princes arms within the collar of the order whereof he was sovereign or a fellowcompanion as those of the french king charles viii celebrated at st pauls london had escutcheons of the arms of france within the collar of the order of st michael at each end of the hearse and when the obsequies of john king of portugal were solemnized at st pauls there was among others one large escutcheon of his arms within the collar of the golden fleece the funeral rites of the emperor charles v being performed in westminsterabbey    and    dec      there were ten great escutcheons compassed with garters to show he was a fellow of this order and upon the same account where princes were sovereigns of one and companions of another order their hearses were hung with escutcheons of their arms surrounded with the collars or principal badges of both those orders as at the interment of francis i the french king celebrated at st pauls london   edw vi the escutcheons were the arms of france encompassed within the garter of st george and collar of st michael at the obsequies of hen ii of france anno   eliz at st pauls also there were some escutcheons of his arms incircled both with the garter and collar of the golden fleece having been a knightcompanion of both these orders under the joysts was a majesty escutcheon of black taffaty of this kings arms within a garter crowned with an imperial crown and in several places of the hearse were fastened other escutcheons of his arms within this principal ensign of the garter  king hen viii was the first that introduced into his great sal the eschutcheon of his arms incircled within a garter as may be seen placed on either side his portraicture siting on his royal throne since him all succeeding sovereigns have born their arms after that manner not only in their great and privyseals but in those other appertaining to their courts of justice and generally in all matters where their arms were visible except coins in imitation of whom the knightcompanions have done the like  but there were an    car   certain half crowns stamped in the west of enand containing the sovereigns arms so encompassed regally crowned and supported and this was the first money whereon the royal garter appeared after him king charles ii having an eye to the advancement of the honor of this order caused the irradicated cross of st george encompassed about with the royal garter to be publicly stamped in the center of his silver coin struck upon the recoinage of it ano    car    there were other medals heretofore stamped upon several occasions wherein the grter was designedly expressed and enclosing shields of their arms as that in the year      frederick prince palatine of the rhine was crowned king of oema and robert cecil earl of salisbury created lord treasurer both knights companions of this noble order moreover gold rings have been cast into the figures of garters the ground on the outside enameled with a deep blue through which the golden letters of the motto appearing set them off with an admirable beauty and it seems such rings were in vogue since the preface to the black book of the order makes mention of wearing the garter on the leg and shoulder and sometimes likewise subo ins the thumb interdum pollice gestare by which we may naturally conjecture that gold rings were formed into the fashion of garters and bestowed by some new installed knights upon their relations and friends to wear in memorial of so great an honor conferred upon them  among the officers belonging to the order the prelate is permitted to bear hs proper arms impaled with those of his see within the garter and the rest only to wear the badges of their offices surrounded with the same to express their peculiar relation  besides the manner of bearing arms within the garter of this order the garter either in whole or part has been by way of armory but without the motto as in the seal belonging to the office of garter king of arms where the garter enclosing a crown is placed on a chief between a lion of england and a flower de lys of france and to instance in family we find argent three demygarters azure buckled and garnished or granted by king hen vii to his servant peter nerborne and sable a garter or between three buckles of the second to be born by buckland or bowland in com northampton     the second ensign of the order is the mantle which is the chief of those vestments which the sovereign and knightscompanions make use of upon all solemn occasions relating to the order that this pattern was derived to us from the ancient greeks and romans is not at all to be disputed since it so little varies in fashion from their pallium or toga for the grecian pallium was a sort of long cloak which only wanted a collar or cape and the roman toga as proper to them as the pallium to the grecians and the custom as antique as romulus himself for he is recited by plutarch to have worn it the pallium is more fully described to be a kind of upper robe that covered the whole body made fast on the right shoulder with a fibula or clasp it was usually worn over the tunica or short coat whence the proverb tunica pallio propior and is more particularly observed to have been a garment fashioned without sleeves that reached down to the ancles  in describing this upper robe called the mantle the sovereigns being distinguished from the knightscompanions only by a long train we shall first set down its various appellations it is mentioned by in the records of the order secondly the materials whereof it consists thirdly the color fourthly the quantity and last of all the ornamental trimmings that nothing be omitted to satisfy any curious enquirer  name in the founders statutes it is called mantellum and in hen v manteau both which we render mantle but the exemplar of the founders statutes entered in the black book and the statutes of king henry viii call it trabea which rosinus reckons among the different kinds of mantles or gows and in  0 art of king hen viiiths statutes it is applied both to the mantle and surcoat sometime it is styled chlamyda sometime stola but in other places more pertinently pallium and toga  materials that mantle prepared for the founder against the first feast of this order appears to be fine woollen cloth and it is not improbable this material was chosen rather than any other richer to the intent the founder might give the preference to our native commodity although there is permitted in the statutes of institution a permission for the proxies of foreign princes to bring over with them mantle of silk and velvet when they came to receive possession of their principal stalls either because other countries were better stored with such commodities than our english cloth or that it might be more agreeable to represent the state and grandeur of foreign princes as accounting silk or velvet the nobler representation  what duration the wearing cloth had is not directly set down but the first time we discover their manles to be of velvet is about the beginning of the reign of king hn vi which sort of silk has thence remained until this day about this period it is observed that the mantles of foreign princes were made here of velvet for so was that trnsmitted to the king of portugal elected anno      concerning the mantles of the knightscompanions there is no doubt but they were of the same materials with those made for the sovereign viz at first of fine woollen cloth and when the sovereign exchanged it for velvet they followed his example but we cannot meet with equal satisfaction in this point because the knightscompanions provided this robe at their own expense and their private accounts herein passing through so many contingences were of no great durability but their surcoats were of the sovereigns donation and consequently the particulars of them remain on record in the rolls and accounts of the great wardrobe  the color of these mantles is appointed by the statutes to be blue and of this color was the founders by which as by the groundwork of the royal garter it is not improbable he alluded to the color of the field in the french arms which a few years before he began to quarter with those of england but the color of the surcoat was changed every year as will appear by and by of the same color were the velvet mantles made temp hen vi who though he altered the stuff did not vary the dye it is apparent that the blue color was retained to king edw ivths reign for when this sovereign transmitted the habit and ensigns of the order to julian de medicis the mantle was of blue velvet  but in king hen viiiths statutes there is no mention at all of the color of this upper robe save only of the mantle which the proxy of a foreign prince was enjoined to bring with him when he came to assume the stall of his principal which though it does not come directly up to the poin yet it is to be observed to be of blue velvet and it is highly probabe that the blue color remained still to be used for within a few months after the compiling the said statuts it is plain the mantle sent to james king of scotland was of blue velvet and in the ancient form of admonitin and signification appointed to be spoke at the investiture of foreign princes and then in plea it is called the mantle of celestal olur likewise the mantle sent to  duke of savoy   and   ph and mar was of the same composur  in queen elizabeths reign upon what ground history is silent the color of foreign princes mantles was changed from blue to purple for of that color were the mantles sent to the french kings charles ix anno   eliz and hen iii ann    eliz so also to the emperor maximilian   elizabeth to fredrick ii king of denmark an    eliz to joh casimire count palatine of the rhine anno    eliz to christiern iv king of denmark an j r iv but that sent to fredruk duke of wirtemberg in the same year was a mixed co our of purple and violet  thus the purple color came in request and continued till about the    of king charles i when he determining to restore the color of the mantle to the primitive intitution gave directions to mr peter richaut merchant to provide himself with a quantity of rich blue velvets from genoa and upon their arrival into england signified his pleasure by sir thomas row the chancellor that all knightscompanions should purchase as much of the said velvet as would furnish them with new robes against st georgesday next ensuing compliance to whose will all the knights paid obedience at the rate of thirty seven shillings a yard being the price the sovereign paid to mr richaut for the velvet of his own robes and the first essay of these mantles was to honor the installation of the prince afterward king charles ii  and because there were many knightselect to be installed after the restoration it was ordained at the chapter held at whitehall the   th of jan anno    cr   called to consider of the preparations of the grand feast then at hand that directions should be given to the master of the wardrobe to negotiate abroad for excellent velvets of sky color and crimson and other materials agreeable for the mantles and surcoats both of the old knightscompanions and those that were then to be installed which was accordingly effected and they were transmitted in time to accommodte them at the said feast  though the just number of else of cloth for the sovereigns mantle at the first institution are not et down yet in the total for his mantle hood and surcoat there was allowed ten else of long cloth the mantle of king henry vi took up one piece five else and three quarters of blue velvet and those sent to frederck ii and christian iv kings of denmark and to the french king henry iii contained each twenty yards of velvet  this we find to be the allowance for foreign princes and ae the more full and extensive by reason of their long train which being more scanty in the mantles of knightssubjects eigteen yards was sufficient to make one of them the full length of king charles ii from the collar behind to the end of the train was three yards the length of the foreside one yard and three quarters from the foot along the bottom to the fixing on of the train was two yards and from thence the length or compass of the train two yards  the left shoulder of each of these mantles have from the institution been adorned with a large fair garter containing this motto honi soit qui mal y pense these were distinguished from the lesser garters anciently embroidered upon the surcoats and hoods of the sovereigns and knightscompanions by the name of garters gross  within this garter was the arms of st george viz argent a cross gules and was heretofore wrought in satin with gold silver and silk but in descending times greater expense and magnificence became the practice of the order for it was embordered upon velvet with damask gold and sundry sorts of purls plates venice twists and silks and the letters of the motto and borders of the garter composed of fair oriental pearl the garter fixed upon the mantle of king charles ii was encircled with large oriental pearl so were the letters of the motto and the cross within the garter the diameter of which was seven inches but the depth from the upper part to the end of the pendant ten inches  temp hen vi it seems to have been the mode to embellish the mantle with three or four velts drawn down the sides and round the bottom as it appears by the monument of john talo earl of shrewsbury in the southwall of the chancel of whitechurch in com salop  about that time the lining of this robe was white damask and afterward white satin but of later date it was lined with white taffaty which continues yet in vogue  for exemplary ornament the mantle had fixed to its collar a pair of long strings anciently woven of blue silk only called cordons robestrings or laces but of later days twisted round and made of venice gold and silk of the color of the robe at each end of which hung a great knob or button wrought over and raised with a rich caul of gold and tassels thereunto of like silk and gold  and at the collar was usually fixed an hook and eye of gold for its firmer affixing of it to the shoulders     the third ensign of the order is the surcoat or kirtle which although we find no place for it in the founders statutes is nevertheless as ancient as the mantle or upper robe that is only taken notice of there for such a vesture king edward iii then made together with his mantle and a hood to celebrate the first feast of the order in  its original it owes to the greeks and romans amongst whom this garment had its determinated tunica and was worn next under the toga but amongst them was both narrower and shorter it was girt close to the body with a girdle and so fitted that the hem of it reached a little below the knee or to the middle of the ham it was the proper mode of the roman citizens and by its trimming were the three degrees among them known for the senators tunicks were embroidered or purfled over with broad purple studs the knights with narrow ones and the plebeians plain  in setting forth the surcoat which was heretofore annually bestowed by the sovereign or the knightscompanions and therefore called his livery we shall as in the description of the mantle treat somewhat of the name materials color quantity and garnishing of it  as to the name in the old rolls of the great wardrobe it is styled roba but more properly as the founders first surcoat is called tunica which name it bears in the red book of the order in english it is rendered gown kirtle surcoat undercoat and robe the appellation of gown is attributed to surcoats of the sovereigns and foreign princes temp hen vi edw iv and hen vii but since and very lately it has been bestowed also on the surcoats of knightscompanions and that of kirtle sometimes given to those sent to foreign princes as appears by the books of warrants in the great wardrobe but the rest are terms of a later date as the first mantles so the first surcoats were composed of woollen cloth and though the cloth of the mantles was in some space after changed for velvet yet the surcoats continued afterward to be of cloth at least till after the office of chancellor of the garter was erected by king edward iv as is manifest by the precedent of this livery in the sovereigns great wardrobe but in process of time they became velvet which sort of silk is yet retained  the color of this vesture was anciently changed every year commonly into blue scarlet sanguine in grain or white but the color of the mantles remained the same as at the institution until queen lizabeths reign and then it commenced blue and it is remarkable that the surcoats of the knightscompanions were always of the same color with the sovereigns  the founders first surcoat was of the same cloth and color with the mantle viz blue but in the   th year of his reign he altered it to black and of the same color were those he conferred that year upon thse following knightscompanions viz the back prince the earls of ulster richmond and salibury edmund of angly sir richard la vacle sir ugh wrotsly sir reginald cobham sir bartholomew burghest the lord mohun sir waler manney sir nle loring sir walter pavely sir william fitz warin sir miles stapleton the earls of stafford warwick and suffolk and sir thomas ughtred the motive that induced him to pitch upon this able color was conceived to be a kind of humiliation because the pestilence began again to spread its malevolence which had furiously raged eleven years before the surcoats which the sovereign gave the dukes of lancasier and  and fourteen other knights anno    edward iii were of cloth sanguine in grain those twenty four provided for the feast of st george anno   ruard ii were violet in grain whereof one was for the sovereign the other twenty three for the knightscompanions following john king f castile and leonard duke of lancaser the earls of cambridge buckingham derby kent warwick stafford salisbury northumberland and nottingham the lords nevil basset and john holland sir guy bryan sir william beauchamp sir thomas percy sir nele loring sir john sulby sir lodowick clifford sir simon burly sir richard burley sir bryan stapleton and sir sultan de la trane  anno    richard ii there were ordered against st georges feast twenty three surcoats of white cloth for the sovereign and twenty two knightscompanions and the    and    year of the same king the sovereign bestowed on the same persons surcoats of long blue cloth after the original model the twenty two surcoats made up for the feast of st gorge anno   henry v were of white cloth anno  henry vi the sovereigns gown or surcoat was of scarlet as was that sent to the king of portugal in the   th year of the same king anno  henry vi the sovereign had white cloth and so were the surcoats given to twenty knightscompanions more in the  year of his reign afterward the beforementioned four colors began to be disused for the surcoat presented to julian de medicis temp edward iv was purple velvet and toward the latter end of the reign of king henry viii and since it is upon record the surcoats of the sovereign and all the knightscompanions were crimson velvet nor did the color suffer a mutation in the surcoat though king charles i restored the mantle to its first primitive color anno    regni sui  there has been some disproportion in the quantity of the cloth allowed in the provision against one and the same feast for anno    edward iii the earls of stafford warwick and suffolk as also sir thomas ughtred had then for each of their surcoats fix else of cloth perhaps the tallness of their stature required it when the other fifteen knights were allowed but five else being the same quantity the sovereigns surcoat had contained in it at the same time  the dukes of holland and clarence anno   henry v with the earls of arundel were allowed eight else apiece the dukes of bedford gloucester and york the earls of westmorland and warwick the lords gray fitz hugh and roos six else apiece the earls of dorset with six barons and five knights batchelors but five else apiece afterward when the number of else of cloth garters and furrs came to be ascertained for each degree all the knightscompanions even the prince of wales were not to exceed five else but since velvet came in plea the allowance for surcoat and hood has been eighteen yards when the surcoat reached down to the feet but now it being the fashion to wear if shorter the allowance is stinted to ten the length of king charles iis surcoat was one yard and an half and of the sleeve one yard wanting a nail  the ornamental trimmings of these garments are next worthy of note especially at the time of instituting this order for they were then and a long time after powdered all over with little garters embroidered with silk and goldplate in each of which was neatly wrought the motto honi soit etc besides the buckles and pendants to those small garters were silver gilt of these garters there were no less than   0 upon the first surcoat and hood made for the founder  in king richard iis reign the little garters that adorned the surcoats of the sovereign and the other knights were wrought in embroidery upon blue taffaty with cyprus and soldat gold and silk of diverse colors and the letters gold and as the sovereign was not limited in the proportion of cloth or velvet for his surcoat no more was he confined to the number of garters wherewith to adorn it nor do i find that any of the knightscompanions were until the precedent of the livery of the garter was settled for anno   henry v the dukes of holland and claren the earl of arundel the dukes of bedford and gloucester had each of their surcoats adorned with   0 garters but the duke of york and the rest wore but  00 the settlement in the precedent of the livery was in relation to degrees of honor a greater or less number of garters thus  a duke      0 garters a marquis     0 an earl     00 a viscount    0 a baron     0 a baronet    0 a knightbatchelor  0  about the reign of king henry vi the sovereigns number of garters did not much exceed those which the founder allowed to himself at the institution for the surcoat and hood of the said king consisted of     and the king of portugal anno    henry vi   0 garters but this drapery of their robes became at length quite obsolete perhaps when cloth was altered to velvet and the plain surcoat has to this day continued in use  while these surcoats remained of cloth they were lined with bellies of pure minever fur only the sovereigns was purfled with ermin and of these it seems a like proportion was at first stated to all the knightscompanions viz  00 bellies yet in the reign of king richard ii some difference began in the allowance to the knightscompanions for a baron and all degrees upward had  00 bellies but under a baron   0 only however anno   henry v the barons were tantamount to the knightsbatchelors for all degrees above a baron were allowed a fur of  00 bellies but the barons and knightsbatchelors furs were only   0 bellies  afterward by the precedent of the garter there was another proportion limited the prince a duke a marquis an earl had each of them five timber of pure minever allowed to a surcoat but the viscount baron baronet and batchelorknights but three timber apiece in time these furs were disused and the surcoats came to be lined with white sarcenet to which temp eliz white taffaty succeded and that still continues  what became of the old surcoats since the knightscompanions had new ones every year the black book of the order informs us that on the eve of the feast of st george the knights wore to vespers the sovereigns livery or surcoats used by them the preceding year which after that night they threw off for the new surcoats were worn on the feast day but the ensigns and ornaments of this kind were disposed of to the use of the college  the hood and cap comes in the next place to be spoken of which hood in king henry viiis statutes and the black book of the order is called humerale but in the rolls of the great wardrobe capucium in the french it is chaperon a word used in the statute anno   richard ii c   and also retained in the old english copy of henry viiis statutes made of his reign and annexed to this treatise they were anciently wore for defense of the head against the inclemencies of weather but of later times caps and hats have supplied their place how they sat upon the head may be observed in the portraitures of the first founders as also with some variety of fashion in succeeding ages yet is not the hood quite thrown by since it is still kept reclining upon the back almost like a pilgrims hat  this hood was ordained and is yet retained as part of the habit of this most noble order and though neither it nor the surcoat is mentioned in the statutes of institution or in either its exemplars nor does king henry v lay any stress upon it yet it is of equal antiquity with the rest as appears from the rolls of the great wardrobe and henry viiis statutes have made remarkable observation of it for the mantle surcoat hood and collar are called the habit of the order and in the black book anno    henry vii at the investiture of philip king of castile the mantle kirtle hood and collar are expressly called whole habit  it was heretofore and now is generally made of the same materials as the surcoat and was anciently trimmed and set off with a small proportion of garters lined with cloth of a different color and such as would best strike the sight but now with taffaty as is the lining of the surcoat  as to the cap which was instituted to succeed the hood it has been and yet is fashioned of black velvet lined with taffaty but the figure has several times varied for temp henry viii it was flat in queen elizabeths reign it was a little raised in the head but in king jamess time they were much more highcrownd this cap has been usually adorned with plumes of white feathers and spriggs and bound about with a band set thick with diamonds so was the cap for the installation of king charles ii and sometimes the brims have been tacked up with a large and costly jewel  this custom of wearing caps and feathers at the grand solemnities of the order had for some time about the beginning of king james i reign been omitted and thereupon in a chapter held the   th of april anno  0 jac i this commendable custom was reestablished  to these may be added the cross of the order encompassed with a garter which by the sovereign was ordained the   th of april   car i to be worn upon the left side of the cloaks coats and riding cassocks of the sovereigns and knightscompanions of the prelate and chancellor at all times when they were not adorned with their robes and in all places and assemblies but not embellished with pearls and stones that the wearing thereof might be a sufficient indication to the world of that height of honor they arrived to from the said most noble order instituted for persons of the greatest merit and worth  and it was not long after ever the glory or star as it was usually called having certain beams of silver that shot out in form of a cross was introduced and annexed to it in imitation as thought of the french who after the same manner wore the chief ensign of the order of the holy ghost being the representation of a dove irradiated with such like beams  and whereas some painters affirm the symbol of the holy ghost to be thus adorned congruous enough yet censure it improper for a garter let them consider that king edw iv erected his white rose with the like glory whereof both the stone work and wood work of st georges chapel in windsor manifestly illustrate whose antiquity makes a precedent for it long before the institution of the order of the holy ghost but this king assumed this device upon appearance of three suns which suddenly united together into one immediately before his successful victory at mortimers cross a happy era he thought himself obliged to perpetuate and they mistake who suppose it to be the garter that is thus irradiated whereas it is something else more worthy of the glory for from it not the garter do the rays diffuse viz the enclosed cross of the order celebrated as glorious since it darted its bright beams from heaven when it appeared to constantine the great as the same is represented on a silver medal on the one side whereof was a bust in profile or side face of king charles i and on the reverse this badge of the order within a garter inscribed honi etc a cross irradiated dispersing its beams in a rhombular form of eight angles beyond the orbit or bounding lines of the said garter having for circumscription prisci decus ordmis auctum         having finished our discourse concerning the robes of the order we shall speak of the robes and hoods assigned to the queen knightscompanions wives and other great ladies by the donation of the sovereigns set off and embellished with minute garters and lined with rich furs which robes they were adorned with during the solemnity of the feast of st george a custom almost as ancient as its institution the first mention we find recorded of the feminine habit occurs anno   r ii when the queen the sovereigns mother the duchess of lancaster the countesses of cambridge buckingham pembroke oxford and salisbury the ladies philippa and catherine daughters to the duke of lancaster and the lady mohun had such kind of robes and hoods provided for them they were made of cloth violet in grain like as the sovereign and knightscompanions that year the robes lined with fur but the hoods with scarlet and both embroidered over with little garters and the proportion of cloth furs and garters were stated according to their several ranks and degrees for the queen had eight else and half an ell of scarlet for the lining of her hood the sovereigns mother had allowed her one whole piece and a double proportion of scarlet but from the large quantity it is conceived she had two robes and hoods made at this time besides the particular number are but eleven persons and cannot else reach the total of the robes that were made up and expressly set down to be twelve the duchess of lancaster had the allowance of half a piece and half an ell of scarlet the countess of cambridge seven else of cloth and half an ell of scarlet and the rest of the ladies the same proportion of cloth with the knightscompanions i e each five else apiece and half an ell of scarlet according to their cloth was also their proportion of minever the queens allowance was two furs each containing three hundred bellies of pure minever the sovereigns mother had twice that proportion the duchess of lancaster and countess of cambridge had the same allowance as the queen but all the rest of the ladies had only one fur of two hundred bellies besides the embroidered garters to deck out the twentyfour surcoats of the sovereign and knightscompanions and the twelve robes for the queen and other ladies amounted to the number of   00  against the feast of st george anno ii r ii there were prepared fifteen robes and hoods for the queen and other ladies of the same livery and suit with the sovereign and knightscompanions viz white long cloth and blue cloth for the lining of their hoods bearing the same proportion in all things as the former anno    rich ii the ladies robes and hoods were sanguine cloth and the lining of their hoods cloth in grain and in the   th rich ii they were blue cloth and long cloth in grain for lining their hoods in both these years we find the duchess of aquitaine had double the proportion of cloth allowed her as had also the duchess of york viz fourteen else the queen having then but the former allowance of eight else and yet her proportion of lining both for the robe and hood was no more than allowed the queen  but anno   henry v the same quantities of cloth minevers and garters were the same to ladies of all degrees and that was to each five else of white woollen cloth only the queen mother had eight else of white cloth and eight else of black cloth a fee containing two hundred bellies of minever and an hundred embroidered garters and    henry vi the master of the great wardrobe was commanded to make ready the like livery both for color of cloth number of else bellies of minever and garters for the countess of suffolk against the approaching feast of st george  a plainer narrative is made of these liveries anno    edw iv when at the feast of st george at windesor the queen the lady elizabeth the kings daughter and duchess of suffolk the kings sister had for their livery murrey gowns embroidered with garters  besides these robes worn by the ladies at the festivals of the order there seems to be some imitation of wearing a garter also on their left arms as the knights did on their left leg as it is observed on the countess of tankerviles monument where she is so portrayed  after a long disuse of these robes anno    car i there was an endeavor to restore it for the deputy chancellor solicited the sovereign in chapter that the ladies of the knightscompanions might be granted the privilege to wear a garter of the order about their arms and an upper robe at festival times according to ancient usage upon which motion the sovereign gave order that the queens pleasure should be known herein and the affair left to the ladies particular request and the year ensuing upon the deputy chancellors report at another chapter at windesor it was then left to a chapter to be called by the knightscompanions to preponderate of every circumstance how it were fittest to be effected for the honor and luster of the order which was appointed to be held at london about allhollantide next but the unhappy war breaking out this matter entirely broke off    there remains now the collar and george brought in by king henry viii and first of collars in general which is an ornament not of late but ancient invention and the wonderful consent of most nations plead for it sacred writ sets down the collar of gold for one of the ornaments pharaoh conferred upon joseph the images of isis and osiris were represented with such like collars in a manner extending to their shoulders as kircher informs us their workmanship seems wonderfully curious being intersected with various lines and divided with tablets and precious stones the collar was of an illustrious original among the romans and gave denomination to the family of torquati descended from l manlius whom the soldiers surnamed torquatus because he fought with a champion of the gauls anno v c     and having foiled him in fight cut off his head and then plucked off his collar bloody as it was and put it about his own neck in further memory of which action were found several roman coins referring to l torquatus consul with l cotta anno v c     and it is remarkable that when one of another tribe was adopted into this family he did also assume this badge of honor as in the coin of d junius silanus though the fashion of the work some what differed from the former  in pristine times none but kings and princes wore collars and therefore their use seems of dignity and power as is evident from daniel where the assyrian kings used this ornament afterward men famous for wisdom and council had them as a distinguishing badge as in the example of joseph and from the proclamation of belshazzar king of babylon who proposed it as a praemium to him that could interpret the handwriting upon the wall and men famous for military achievements had it conferred upon them in recompense of their merits thus collars were of the number of the dona and praemia militaria among the the romans and the honor of receiving them thought worthy to be consigned to posterity in marble inscriptions from them the later emperors received it and we read of investing a knight of the holy sepulcher with a collar at his creation where as soon as the ceremony of his ordination is over the padre guardian kisses the new made knight and puts about his neck according to the mode of the ancients a golden collar with a cross hanging at it  most aptly therefore have the sovereigns of military orders annexed this ornament of the collar to their habit and conferred it on the fellows and companions many of whom have meritoriously deserved it for their great wisdom and valorous exploits and for this reason it was instituted in additional glory to the ensigns of the garter composed in a peculiar manner in relation to the name and title to the wearing of which the sovereign obliged both himself and knightscompanions and his and their successors  this collar was ordained to be of gold thirty ounces troy weight but not to exceed it howbeit that collar sent to gustavus adolphus king of sweden weighed thirtyfour ounces and a quarter and that of king charles i    ounces and an half which after his sufferings fell into the hands of thomas harrison one of olivers majorgenerals and was by him delivered to the trustees for sale of the kings goods they      sent it to the mint with diverse of the regalia to set the stamp on work for the first gold that the upstart comonwealth coined  it was appointed by king henry viiis statutes that this collar should be composed of pieces of gold in fashion of garters the ground enamelled blue and the letters of the motto gold in the midst of each garter two roses placed the innermost enameiled red and the outermost white contrarily in the next garter the innermost rose enamelled white and the outermost red and so alternately but of latr times these roses are wholly red  the number of these garters are so many as be the ordained number of the sovereign and knightscompanions at the institution they were twentysix being fastened together with as many knots of gold and this mode hitherto has continued invariable nor ought the collar to be adorned or enriched with precious stones as the george may be such being prohibited by the law of the order  at the middle of the collar before pendant at the table of one of the garters in the collar is to be fixed the image of st george armed sitting on horseback who having thrown the dragon on his back encounters him with a tiltingspear this jewel is not encompassed with a garter or row of diamonds as in the lesser george but in round relief it is allowed to be beautified and set off with diamonds and other enrichments at the pleasure of the knightcompanion who possessed it and upon that score it has been frequently adorned with variety of costly work whereon the diamonds and other precious stones being set to that advantage as might upon its motion and agitation dart forth a resplendent luster  before the establishment of this article by king henry viii it appears that the knightscompanions were invested with collars at their installations for the black book makes mention of a collar among the ensigns of the garter wherewith philip king of castile was invested anno    henry vii but whether a collar of sss or of another model is not specified nevertheless this scruple is in part cleared up by an old memorial of the ceremonies at the creating henry lord stafford earl of wiltshire   henry viii where it is said in the annals that after he was invested with the robes of his state and dignity the collar of the garter was put about his neck at constituting him a knight of the order and to make it more conspicuous in a vellum book of the statutes sent to maximilian the emperor signed   0  by the register t rowthale and in another of edward stanley lord monteagle elected ann   hen viii the forty first article enjoins a collar to be worn by each knightcompanion expressly called the collar of the order which though it be not in all respects consentient to that prescribed by king henry viiis statutes yet there is not much variation and it is reported to be a gold collar coupled together by several pieces of links in fashion of garters with a vermilion rose and the image of st george hung thereat the reason of the knightscompanions wearing it at the times appointed the license for putting it to mending the command not to enrich the collar but the george only and under a penalty not to sell pawn or alienate it upon any necessity whatsoever are wholly the same as was afterward enjoined by king henry viii so that he did but only annex to his body of statutes a decree which for the greatest part had been put in practice before in the   th hen viii upon interpretation of the eleventh article of the statutes the collar is there enumerated as part of the entire robes that a knightcompanion is obliged to wear for a more convincing proof that the collar of garters was used before king henry viiis reign the monument of sir giles daubeny plainly delineates who departed    henry vii in westminsterabbey where his portraicture in the robes of the order is adorned with such a collar as king henry viiis statutes do afterward describe  as the garter sent to gustavus adolphus king of swedn so the great george pendant at his collar weighing seven ounces was set with large and resplendent diamonds to the number of eightyfour  in what regard this noble ensign of honor the colla has been with the sovereigns and knightscompanions not only of the order of the garter but other military orders may be collected from the picturs of some of them as well as from their seals coins and medals for in these they have been pleased to exhibit their effigies and escutcheons of arms and omitting foreign examples the collars both of the garter and thistle were expressed in the coronation medal of king charles i in scotland      though in that of his coronation at westminster and afterward in that of king charles ii      the collar of the order of the gater are only put over their royal robes  these ornaments of the collars have been affixed sometimes encircling the shields of their arms and in a sal of charles the bold duke of burgundy sovereign of the order of the golden fleece placed to an instrument dated    0 it is worthy of remark that collar adorns the neck of the lion of flanders but the sovereigns of the garter usually encompassed their arms not within the collar of the ordr but the royal garter that being its principal ensign and sometimes having no shield of arms the void space within the garter exhibits their arms  observable is the seal of charles count palatine of the rhine wherein is a shield quarterly of the palatinate and bavaria obscuring the lion guardant its supporter his four sss only appearing quadrangularly and his head a top ensignd with an electoral crown this shield is encircled both within the garter and collar of the order and is the first example wherein both these ensigns are jointly together it is very frequent to express the collars of different orders together thus i have seen the arms of robert dudley earl of leicester entourd within the garter and a collar of the order of st michael having been knight of these orders and the funeral achievement of the late james hamilton douglas duke of hamilton had the garter and a collar of the thistle about it and in a plate under the effigies of the duke of aspernons a shield of his arms quartered is encompassed with the chiefest ensigns of those three orders whereof he was a brother and companion viz with the garter and the collars of st michael and the holy ghost and the older the order is in the roll of antiquity whose chief ensign is there represented the nearer ought it to be placed to the escutcheon of arms being the more honorable post a mistake was committed in the marshalling these collars when the duke of chevereux affixed it over his stall at windsor the collars of st mithael and the holy ghost are placed nearer to his escutcheon than that of the garter    and whereas we have spoke of another kind of collar called a collar of sss worn as badges of lower and inferior honor it will not be amiss to inform our judgment in other affairs concerning them wicelius informs us from a book in the library of fulda where in the life of the two brothers simplicius and faustinus both senators and suffered martyrdom under dioclesian there is a description of the society of st simplicius consisting of noble personages in their own families and describing the collar wore as the badge of it says thus it was the custom of those persons to wear about their necks silver collars composed of double sss which denote the name of saint simplicius between these double sss the collar consisted of twelve small plates of silver in which were engraven the twelve articles of the creed together with a single trefoil the image of st simplicius hung at the collar and from it seven plates representing the seven gifts of the holy ghost as to the manner of their martyrdom they were bound together by the neck to a stone and thrown over the bridge into the river tyber  at what time the collar of ss s came into england is not fully determined but it will appear at least three hundred years since and worn as an ornament for women as well as men for on a monument in the collegiate church of warwick the figure of margaret wife to sir william peito said to be interred temp edw iii has a collar of ss s drawn about and set close to her neck which the sculpture in the antiquities of warwickshire by mistake represented like a ruff there was also a collar of ss s about the neck of sir simon burleys statue in st pauls london  in the ancient creation of an esquire in england part of the ceremony was the kings putting about his neck a silver collar of ss s and seldom in his titles of honor contemns not the old ballad the tanner of tamworth to prove the creation of esquires in king edw ivs reign by conferring such collars on them but that the golden one was the undoubted badge of a knight as may be instanced by many undeniable examples deduced from the monuments of such persons temp hen vi ed iv hen vii hen viii and since and so legally appropriate thereto that in the act    h viii made for reformation of apparel there is a proviso entered that knights notwithstanding might publicly wear a gold collar of ss s though since it is grown obsolete and useless favin tells us that our hen v instituted an order surnamed knights of the ss s on the day of the martyrs st crispine and crispianus which though he found nothing of it in our english historians yet from the chronicle of juvenal des ursins where he treats of the battle of agincourt he collected this following relation  the king of england exhorted his men and commanded that if any had trespassed against another they should be reconciled and confessed to the priests otherwise no good success would accrue to them in their attempts he advised them to be civil in their march and to do their duty well and agreed upon these conditions that those of their company who were not of gentle extraction he would make so from the fountain of honor and give them warrants that for the future they should enjoy the privileges the gentlemen of england had and to the end they might be distinguished from others he granted them leave to wear a collar powdered with the letter s among the variety of collars of sss now in vogue there are these following the lord mayor of londons collar is composed of gold having a knot like one of those that tie the garters together in the great collar of the order inserted between two ss s and they again situated between two roses viz a white rose within a red and in the middle before the breast is a large portcullis whereat hangs a most rich jewel set with large diamonds  the collars of the lords chief justices of both the benches and the chief baron of the exchequer are in memory of the said st simplicius a senator and consequently a gownman formed of the letter s and a knot alternately having a rose set in that part of it which falls out to be in the middle of their breasts and another on their backs the five flowers of these roses are constituted of five large pearls  those collars which appertain to the kings and heralds of arms as well as to sergeants at arms having been bestowed by former kings and renewed to them by king charles ii to be worn upon days of solemn attendance are composed of sss linked together in the middle of the breast is a rose at each of which hangs three small drops of silver but the sss in the collars worn by the kings of arms are made somewhat larger than the other and in that part lying on either shoulder is a portcullis taken in between the sss which are wanting in the rest  the general difference of the collars appropriate to the beforenamed degrees is this knights have allowed them collars of silver gilt but esquires only silver and therefore in the creating of an herald in part of that ceremony he is made an esquire by putting on him a collar of sss of silver and so is a sergeant at arms  the kings of england have sometimes been pictured with a collar of sss about their arms in like manner as the garter does surround them as appears from an impression of king henry viiis privy signet whereon his royal arms crowned are encircled with a collar of sss to the lower end of which are affixed two portcullisses    we come now to the lesser george of the order and we do not find that the effigies of st george was at any time worn by the sovereign or knightscompanions before the breast or under the arm as now used till the   th of henry viii but then that king decreed in a chapter held at greenwich the morrow after st georges day that every knight should wear loosely before his breast the image of st george in a gold chain or otherwise in a ribband the same to be fastened within the ennobled garter for a manifest distinction between the knightscompanions and others of the nobility and knights who according to the mode of those times wore large gold chain the ordinary ensigns of knighthood and thus the wearing the medal or jewel usually called the lesser george to distinguish it from the other work at the collar of the order first received the injunction and has since been frequently used  this george was for the most part pure gold curiously wrought but diverse of them were exquisitely graved in onyxs and agats and with such a happy collection of the stones that heightened and received their beauty by the skill of the artificer in contriving the figures and history the natural tincture of the stones have so fitted them with colors for flesh hair and every thing else even to surprise and admiration in this jewel is st george represented in a riding posture encountering the dragon with his drawn sword  by the last article of king henry viiis statutes it was allowed to be enriched at the pleasure of the possessor as is the great george which for the most part has been curiously enameled and the garter about it set with diamonds and of what weight and bigness these lesser georges were may be gathered from that sent to the french king charles ix being an ounce and an half and half quarter weight the variety of workmanship in those gold chains whereat this jewel hung was usually great according to the fancy and pleasure of the persons for whom they were wrought but within a short space wearing the lesser george in silkribbands as well as goldchains was promiscuously used and ad libitum so were the symbols of foreign orders as diverse coins and medals declare but the color of these ribbands when they came first to be wore was black john dudley viscount lisle the lords st john and parr so used them at their investiture    henry viii and several pictures of other knightscompanions about that time confirm the same that small chain whereat hung the lesser george transmitted to emanuel of savoy ann   and   ph and mar was formed of twelve pieces of gold in every of which was set three small diamonds and of twelve other like pieces wherein were three rubies and twenty four pearls  it appears by a letter of sir richard st george knight clarencieux dated july  0th      that the blue ribband had some years before been additional to the ornament of the order and it is reported that robert earl of essex observing in france the jewels of the order of st michael and st esprit worn in blue ribbands upon his return was the principal motive those ribbands whereat the george hung were exchanged into that color and in a picture of queen elizabeth drawn toward the declension of her reign her lesser george is represented hanging before her breast in a blue ribband and this color was more caressed and grew in great repute by reason it was the ground of the garter and nearest the color of the mantle of the order so that toward the latter end of the reign of king james i because the dye of the ribband had not been peculiarly expressed in any statute and the blue and azure accustomed for some years past it was decreed that for the future it should be always of blue and no other nor in time of mourning it self should be changed  the manner of wearing this ribband in time of peace was of later times pendant about the neck down to the middle of the breast where the lesser george hung but since for the more convenience of riding or action the same is spread over the left shoulder and brought under the right arm where the jewel hangs  but where the pictures of the sovereign and knightscompanions are drawn in armor there even to this day the george is represented as fixed to a gold chain instead of a blue ribband and worn about the neck not brought under the right arm as exhibited on the three pound pieces of gold stamped at oxford by king charles i      and a medal of charles count palatine of the rhine dated       among the invaluable jewels and other curiosities of king charles i which came to the hands of the trustees appointed for sale of his goods were these  l s d a george containing     diamonds sold for      0 a george cut

set with fair diamonds and after the defeat given to the scotch forces at worcester   car ii was strangely preserved by colonel blague one of that kings dispersed attendants who resigned it for safety to the wife of mr barlow of blarepipehouse in staffordshire where he took sanctuary from whom robert milward esquire received and gave it intothe hands of mr isaac walton all loyalists it came again to blagues possession then prisoner in the tower whence making his escape he restored it to king charles ii  it is worthy of remark that besides the sovereign of the most noble order of the garter other princes of christendom have assumed the bearing st george encountering the dragon in like posture though not so anciently nor upon the same grounds and foundation as they probably having elected him patron and guardian of their countries or families such as the emperors of russia the dukes of mantua and the counts mansfield in germany as their seals and coins plainly demonstrate  in the great seal of borice feodorwicke emperor of russia affixed to his letter sent to queen elizabeth dated at mosco june   th   0  was a double headed eagle displaid having each head crowned and bearing an

occasions which require a fuller conformity and the wearing the whole habit i e the garter mantle surcoat hood collar great george and cap ar first the high festival of the order commonly called st georges feast whether it be solemnized on the   d   d or   th of april annually or any other days within the year by prorogation as is apparent by all the bodies of the statutes  for first it is ordained that the knightscompanions should be arrayed in the whole habit on the eve of st george before the sovereign proceeded to the chapter to hear divine service and being so robed should attend on the sovereign to the chapter house thence to the chapel and return with him back in the same manner until after supper as well those that minded to sup as those that should not sup nor might they disrobe until the sovereign or his deputy had put off his or declared it seasonable for his or their doing so  by the same statute they were enjoined to wear the whole habit on the feast of st george both at their progression in the morning to the chapter house or chapel at their return to dinner from thence to the second vespers and back to supper as also till supper was over and until the sovereign or his lieutenant took leave of the rest of the knightscompanions  secondly it is manifest from king henry viiis statutes that the eve the day of st george and morrow following were to be observed with solemn service and holding of chapters wheresoever the sovereign was resident though the grand feast were prorogued to a longer duration and when by reason of such prorogation they should convene in any place besides windsor to attend the sovereign for the solemnization of st georges day they then must adorn themselves with the whole habit from beginning of the first vespers until the last evening service of the same day  thirdly on such other days of the year whereon the grand feast is held by prorogation and during such part of the eve and day of the feast as is before appointed when it is held on its proper day  fourthly by absent knights whenever the grand feast of st george should be celebrated and wheresoever they should happen at that time to reside if at liberty and not under restraint to keep it in like manner as if then present with the sovereign or his deputy in the place where he should celebrate the feast the time of wearing the whole habit in this point extends but to the end of the second vespers as in the second instance above  fifthly the knightscompanions are to wear the entire habit at the feasts of installation when they assist at that ceremony where if it commence in the evening they are not to disrobe themselves till after supper and being the next morning habited as before then to proceed to the chapter house or chapel and not to divest themselves till dinner is ended  the less solemn occasions are those which require the wearing the mantle or collar of the order only  and they are first upon the morrow after the grand feast day when the sovereign and knightscompanions proceed to the chapel and make their offering then it suffices that they barely put on the mantle which service being finished they were wont to leave it at the chapterhousedoor as they retired out of the chapel  secondly as often as chapters are called and in what place soever assembled either for elections or other causes as it shall please the sovereign to nominate and as often as it is requisite for the sovereign or any of the knightscompanions to enter into the chapel of st george at windsor and in reference hereunto is the article    e   was that their mantles should remain in the vestry at windsor that upon any sudden emergency they might be in readiness for in the inventory of the chapel taken   r   we find remaining at that time in the vestry a mantle appertaining to the sovereign another to john duke of britain a third to john holland earl of huntington another to edmund langley earl of cambridge and one to thomas holland earl of kent all of them then surviving and by a decree past at the grand feast   h   the mantle of the young sovereign was appointed to be left at windsor as the statutes required and this article was confirmed by king henry viii by virtue whereof the mantles of the emperor charles v and anna duke of montmorency were left in the custody of the dean and canons of windsor and heretofore in the bill of drawing up matters necessary for the installation of a knightcompanion there were usually two mantles set down one expressed to be left in the college and the other for all other occasions that might intervene  these mantles thus ordered to be reposed in the college upon emergent occasions were anciently committed to the custody of the blackrod as granted by letters patent with the office   h   and after the death of the owners devolved to the dean and canons of windsor either for the public use of the knightscompanions when they casually came to windsor or else sold sometimes to the heirs of the deceased or others who succeeded in the order as that of charles v was to the earl of bedford and that of the constable of france lent to the earl of warwick ann   eliz which appears from the accounts of the chanter of the college temp h   h   h   q eliz and jac   who in all times answered the full benefit thereof to the college as being a certain perquisite to the dean and canons which they accordingly had and enjoyed  and yet we find some of the college made overbold with the robe of sigismond the emperor and sold it while he survived but the archbishop of york who as chancellor of england visited the college      secured the money from being distributed among those that sold it and reserved the dividend to the dean and chapter that should chance to be living at that emperors expiration and commanded for the future under pain of excommunication that no dean and canon should imbezil or aliene any knightscompanions mantle while he was alive but the same should be decently and faithfully kept and preserved but we are informed that this statute was altered ann   eliz and one drawn up to this effect that the knightscompanions should be bound by oath to take care by their wills that after their decease all the ornaments which they had received should be restored the robes to the college and the jewels to the sovereign that gave them  in the last place the times of wearing the collar of the order with the great george appendant which is not only enjoined to be worn as part of the habit at the grand feasts and feasts of installation but also at other times when not any of the rest of the habit is ordered saving the garter is to be worn as in special at the principal and solemn feasts of the year and other feastdays to which a particular order in chapter ann   eliz thus directs the holy days and sundays within the twelve days st matthias day holydays in easterweek st marks day st philip and jacobs day holy days in whitsunweek st peters day st jamess day st bartholomew st matthew st luke st simon and jude st andrew st thomas   besides these the sovereigns and knightscompanions have been accustomed to wear this ensign upon the anniversary of the sovereigns coronation of the gunpowder treason and of later times on the sovereigns birthday so formerly upon some occasional ceremonies not relative to the order as when a knightcompanion has been created into titles of dignity and honor he had the collar of the garter added to his investiture as appears in the case of henry stafford created earl of wiltshire ann   hen   and at a chapter held may   d      that such knightscompanions as should afterward assist at the funeral of any knightcompanion should wear the collar apert at the said funeral and it was so observed by the dukes of ormond and richmond the earls of manchester and sandwich at the obsequies of george monk duke of albemarle  howbeit the custom is otherwise as to wearing the garter the principal ensign of the order for though it be enjoined to be wore at the grand festivals etc yet it does not imply that it might be left off for indeed it ought daily to be worn both by the sovereign and knights companions and therefore was it decreed even in its institution that if any knightcompanion should in public be found without one buckled about his leg upon challenge he should be mulct a noble to the dean and college of windsor by king henry viii the fine was raised a mark payable as before to any of the five officers of the order or to the dean besides which fine the knight lies liable to a check but to alleviate the strictness and obviating other inconveniences king henry v admitted of a qualification and in case of riding with boots ordained that it might suffice if the knightcompanion wore some ribband or silklace to represent the garter though in this very article there is a proviso that no knightcompanion should enter into chapter without his garter buckled about the leg  in short king henry viii ordained that the goldchain whereat the lesser george in that age hung should be worn all other days in the year except the principal and solemn feasts whereon the great collar was ordained to be worn and except in time of war sickness or long voyage in any of which cases a silklace or ribband with the image of st george thereat was sufficient and the blue ribband having since succeeded in place of the cold chain the injunction of this statute extends to it in all particulars  the present habits ensigns and badges belonging to the officers of the garter

added the chanchellor and garter and all of them sworn to be of the council of the order among these the prelate and chanchellor are usually nominated the principal the other three the inferior officers of the order  in this chapter we shall give some account of their institution oath habit ensigns privileges and pensions for as to the nature of their offices and their duties they are for the general recorded in the black book under the title constutiones ad officiales ordinis garterij peculiaritr attinentes etc upon the establishment anno    hen viii      and annexed to his statutes and more particularly their duties will occur in several places of the ensuing discourse where they properly fall in to be treated of as follows  the prelate is the first and primier officr and in the founders statutes called praelatus odinis and that the then bishop of winchester william de edyngton was the first prelate is very obious from thence he is an officer of honor only and has neither pension nor fees allowed him by the said constitutions this office is vested in the bishop of winchester for the time being and from the annals of the order it is manifest his successors have continued prelates to this day except the interruption only of a few months anno   ed   immediately after the publishing this kings statutes wherein the other four officers were consituted a new to attend the order but the prelate wholly laid by  what high reputation this see has been favored with may be collected from an act of parliament   en viii concerning the placing of the lords in parliamnt chamber and other assemblies and conference of council whereby thi bishop had place assigned him next to the bishop of durham who has place by that act next the archbishop of york though before in respect of the prehemenence of this noble order he had precedence and place granted above all bishops and next unto the archbishops at that officers admittance he is obliged to take an oath in the presence of the sovereign or his lieutenant which consists of these particulars    to be present in all chapters whereunto he is summoned    to report all things truly without favor or fear    to take the scrutiny faithfully and present it to the sovereign    to keep secret and not disclose the councils of the order    to promote and maintan the honor of it    to withstand and reveal what is designed to the contrary  this oath is read in chapter by the register of the order the gentleman usher of the blackrod holding the book whilst the prelate kneels between the sovereigns knees  of the robe as the knightscompanions had their surcoats bestowed on them at the sovereigns charge and therefore called the kings livery so had the officers of the order their liveries or robes out of the sovereigns wardrbe and in particular the prelate of the order for in the rolls of the great wardrobe we find that william de edyngton had allowed him for his robe of the sovereigns livery against the feast of st george anno    ed iii one cloth of sanguine grain and a large quantity of furs for trimming it up and we find this robe so assigned the prelate to be of the suit or color of the knightscompanions surcoats the same year viz sanguine in grain and that he had a great allowance of furr for his being a mantle was lrger than any of the knights surcoats though they are both called by the same name roa in the rolls of the wardrobe anno   rich ii william de wkam then prelate had the same allowance one cloth of violet in grain and other materials but the discrimination was in the bellies of minevers whose number was now much increased and that the same allowance was bestowed on him in the   th and   th years of the said king but in these three instances the color of the cloth was different and suitable to the knightscompanions surcoats those very years viz violet in grain white and blue and anno     hen vi the robe of henry beaufort cardinal and prelate was white as then were the surcoats of the knightscompanions whence it is evident the livery formerly allowed the prelate annually varied in color as did the knightscompanions surcoats  in that ancient precedent of the liveries of the garter remaining in the great wardrobe wherein the surcoats of the knightscompanions are reduced to a stated proportion in the measure of the cloth number of furs and garters modeled out according to their state degrees there the prelate has the following allowance for his livery    yards of woollen cloth    timber pur    timber gross minever   timber de biss   by all which it is manifest what materials and color the prelates robe was of at the institution of the order and for a long time after nor do we find any variation until the reign of king hen viii and then this habit was ordained to be crimson velvet lined with white taffaty faced with blue and thereon down the opening before upon the bordures sundry royal cognizances on the right side the rose of england crowned on the left side opposite one of king edw ivs badges viz a rose within the sun beams crowned and then the aforesaid badges again vice versa with more damaskings on the right side the flower de luce of france crowned and on the left side king edw iiis peculiar badge viz the sun beams issuing out of a cloud and those badges repeated in alternate situations every badge interpolated with an area of embroidered damasking fory of these clouds wrought of gold silver and silk having in the middle the saxon letter e of gold were provided to him several garments made for that king    edw iii and embellished with stars as the lft shoulder of a knightcompanions mantle so the right shoulder of the prelates robe is enjoined to be embroidred with a scutcheon of st georges arms encompassed with a garter and adorned with cordons of blue silk mingled with gold after a while the color of this robe became changed to murray the allowance of velvet    yards of white sarcenet for lining    yards and a garter for the shoulder embroidred with purls of damask gold but    eliz for the livery of bishop watson then newly admitted the quantity of velvet was increased to    yards but the lining and garter remained as it was so also the cordon having buttons and tassels of blue silk and venice gold the like robe in all particulars were made for bishop cooper and bishop bilson his successars temp eliz  about    car i the prelate and chancellor petitioned the sovereign to restore them their ancient rights and privileges of honor in relation to their ensigns and robes upon their outward garments whereupon    car i it was ordered in chapter that the knightscommissioners newly established by that chapter should take into their consideration the robes the prelate and chancellor were to be invested with and certify the sovereign the acient color and fashion but nothing was effected until after the restoration and then by warrant under the signet of the order dated february       car ii the prelate had assigned him for his livery of the order one robe of purple velvet containing    yards and  0 yards of white taffaty for lining as also the arms of st george within a garter wrought with letters and purls of damask gold and pearls having laces buttons and tassels of purple silk and venice gold but what inducements the sovereign had for so changing the murray color for purple has not reached our intelligence the time he is obliged to wear this robe is in express text of the constitutions to be yearly on the vigil and day of st george wheresoever he is at liberty whether it be in parliament or any other solemn occasion or festival whatsoever  the honors conferred on this officer are that his post in all proceedings and ceremonies of the order is on the right hand of the chancellor that he has the privilege of marshalling his arms within the ennobled garter and accordingly has it been customary to surround them impaling his see he has allottd him convenient appartments within the castle of windsor in a tower situated on the northside called winchester tower and as often as he shall arrive thither or to any other place at the sovereigns command upon the affairs of the order he ought to have alowed him of the court livery for himself and retinue according to the stipends that earls resident in court do possess   car i this officer so well as the chancellor had the honor allowed him to wear upon the left part of his cloak coat and riding cassock at all seasons when he should not be invested with his robe and in all places and assemblies a scutcheon of the arms of st george but not enriched with pearls and stones but not long after there was some restraint upon this act though i do not find it repealed    the institution of the chancellors office his oath robe badge and pension next follows to be handled at the erecting this noble order the common seal was ordained to remain in the custody of whomsoever the sovereign should please to lodge it but expressly to be one of the knightscompanions among whom in after times sir john robertsack is styled custos siilli ordinis having the custody of it by decree   hen vi by a prolepsis of speech styled chancellor in the black book but king edw iv finding it requisite to fix the office of chancellor of the garter in a person distinct from the knightscompanions and subservient to them decreed in a chapter at westminister    rgni sui that the seal of the order should be resigned to richard beauchamp then bishop of salisbury to keep during pleasure and he to be called chancellor of this most noble order not long after by letters patent under the great seal of england dated the  0th of oct    edw iv this king declared that though this office was not expressed by the founders statutes yet was it nevertheless very useful and therefore for the advancement and good of the order he constituted an officer named chancellor and forasmuch as this office was of great import and concern and required an expert and able person it was his further pleasure that none but a bishop should execute it moreover considering the chapel of st george at windsor was founded within the diocese of salisbury and having regard to the prudence and diligence of the said beauchamp who out of mere love to the order attended daily the progress of the work wherewith the king was then in hand for enlarging the chapel at windsor he did therefore ordain the said bishop for the term of his life chancellor of the order and after his decease his successors bishops of salisbury should always have and hold the said chancellorship nevertheless provided that the kings concession should be put in execution by the advice of the knightscompanions and without prejudice to the bishop of winchester in those things which ought by the statutes of institution to belong unto him  this office thus conferred upon beauchamp personally for life and perpetually to his successors bishops of salisbury by virtue of this grant continued chancellors nor does it appear that any other person had been invested therein until ann   e vi that sir william cecil then principal secretary of state was made chancellor  for upon reformation of the order by that king his statutes wholly excluded the ecclesiastics and appointed that the chancellorsoffice should be executed by a knight qualified with honor and reputation to manage a post of that care and fidelity he thereupon appointed sir william cecil chancellor and here first entered a secular person notwithstanding which in a charter to the bishop of salisbury   eliz containing the charters of queen mary h viii and h vii and in another   car i the forementioned letters patents made to beauchamp by king edw iv are therein recited totidem verbis and confirmed as a tacit reservation of the right and title of those bishops whenever the sovereign should have a benign and propitious aspect toward that see the first of these bishops who concerned himself for recovering this high station to that see was bishop cotton who upon the death of sir edward dyer sometime chancellor petitioned the sovereign   jac i and prayed restitution thereof to the church of salisbury but before any determination the two chief justices and chief baron was advised withal who were of opinion that this office was not completely or sufficiently annexed to the bishopric of salisbury by king edw iv but cook in his institutes reports the point void upon the incertainty of the grant for that a new office was erected and not defined what jurisdiction or authority the officer should exercise and there is assigned a third reason that the grant was in the sovereigns disposal because the patent was obtained without fee with one or more of these opinions the sovereigns judgment being swayed he forthwith nominated sir john herbert one of his privy council to the chancellorship and so this affair remained silent until anno    car i when john davenant bishop of salisbury upon sir francis canes decease remonstrated to the sovereign his claim to this office whereupon at a chapter held at windsor  th of dec that year the sovereign proposed to the knightscompanions present that though he had made election of sir thomas row for his chancellor that time yet understanding a claim made by the bishop of salisbury that the place was annexed to that see he commanded the lordscompanions to take the pretense of right into their considerations to which proposition of the kings they answered that they thought it not their duty to search for the title of any person but that if the bishop did produce his evidence and proofs he might present it in chapter to be considered  upon this encouragement the bishop presented a petition which was read in the chapter at windsor the   th of april ensuing to this effect that king edw iv by letters patent had erected this office of chancellor and did then grant the same to richard beauchamp bishop of salisbury and his successors for ever in consideration that the chapel of st george was within their diocese that those bishops had enjoyed the same according to the charter which charter had been confirmed under the great seal of england by some other kings and queens and lastly by the king himself but that the use and exercise of that office had for many years been discontinued from them praying therefore an hearing and examination that the right of the said church might be preserved and restored to the substance of which it was objected  first that the great seals of england did not work within or upon the statutes and rules of the order of the garter  second that no grant could prescribe the present sovereign it being a law fundamental within the order suprema lex was suprema voluntas  third that it did not appear by the records of the order that the office of the chancellor was any otherwise conferred upon richard beauchamp bishop of salisbury than quam diu regiae celsitudini complaceret  to the first it was answered by way of exception as to the grant of offices forasmuch as the great seal of england was took into and became legal within the order in like cases and not any patent for an office had past under the seal of the order but under the great seal of england and in particular the office of the chancellorship which had not been transacted if any legal defect had been therein  to the second granting it was so as was objected it appeared that the sovereign was as much at liberty to restore this office to the sea of salisbury as continue it to secular dignities  to the third what was alleged out of the records of the order related only to the time of delivering the seals to bishop beachamp but afterward when the office was erected by letters patent it was then granted to him during life something was replied from the judges opinions even in this case ann jac r vi but the sovereign thought it was not then well canvassd and weighed to permit the chapter acts of this order wholly independent from other laws to receive construction and determination from the common law and therefore declared that the bishop ought to be heard and to that purpose gave him orders to prepare the vouchers and proofs of his pretensions in vindication of his petition and to send them to be delivered to the knightscommissioners elected for the affairs of the order for their consideration at the next chapter which was accordingly put in execution and then refierred to them again to be considered prepared and abbreviated to be perused by the sovereign for his final determination but the scotch war shortly after breaking forth and troubles running high at home the further prosecution was laid aside and not revived until the   th of nov anno    car ii when seth ward bishop of salisbury took encouragement upon the former grounds and the sovereigns favor to set on foot this claim by a petition presented to the chapter then held at whitehall where after a full debate and mature deliberation had of its equity and just foundation he obtained a decree for reestablishment of this office on the bishops of that see upon the first vacancy dated the   th of nov      and present his majesty the sovereign the dukes of york and ormond earls of oxford and manchester prince rupert earls of bristol and sandwich and the duke of monmouth  of the oath the oath the chancellor takes at his admission which we find to be the same with the prelates and in the like humble posture upon the knee and usually administered by the register of the order as to his robe it was at first the same with the prelates both for cloth and color but his proportion of cloth far less having allowed him but   yards when the prelate had    nor but   timber of minever gross where the prelate had    beside a large quantity of other furs nor was the color confined to one kind until the constitutions of this office appointed it to be crimson as was the prelates for no doubt it was before annually changed as his was to the color of the knightscompanions surcoats however by the picture of the ancient habits of the officers it is conspicuous it was debared the royal badges wherewith the prelates rose was embroidred when the color of the prelates robe was changed to murray the chancellors had the same alteration and was trimmed alike in all other particulars the proportion allowed to sir thomas smith for his livery anno    eliz was    yards of murray velvet    yards of sarcenet for the lining one garter wrought with pearls of damask gold for the shoulder one lace or cordon with buttons and tassels of blue silk and venice gold and the same materials and quantities were afterward distributed out of the sovereigns great wardrobe to the succeeding chancellors  but anno    car i the prelate and chancellor endeavoring a reformation in this habit the dye both of the prelates and this officers robe was changed into purple  besides this robe the chancellor of the order has an honorable badge of distinction assigned him to wear first granted to sir william peters and his successors the  th of october   and   ph and mar viz a golden rose enclosed within a garter which he and his successors chancellors of the order have ever since worn daily about their necks at first it was pendant in a goldchain but since in a purple ribband it seems something of this design had been in agitation a little before so soon as the chancellorship became vested in a layman for king edward vis statutes did ordain that the chancellor should wear about his neck a cross of the order with a red rose in a white of gold all compassed within a garland of red and white roses  and because it was suggested to king charles i that there were different accounts and uncertainties contained in some books concerning the wearing of this badge he by warrant dated at oxford the   th of december in the   st year of his reign      ordained sir james palmer knight and bart chancellor of the said order and his successors should wear about his neck at all times in honor of his said place that thereby he may be known to be of that office and dignity as has been accustomed a medal or jewel of gold enamelled with a red rose within a garter of blue enamel with this sentence inscribed honey soit qui mal y pense or such an one as we or the rest of the knightscompanions of the said most noble order of the garter do or shall from time to time hereafter wear in our collars of the said order in particular reference to us or them and in the reverse thereof he shall bear the escutcheon of st george enamelled within a garter also in reference to the order it self which he only shall wear hanging by a light purple ribband or in a gold chain as has been accustomed  among the officers of the order the chancellor is seated next beneath the prelate and in all proceedings and sessions goes and sits on his left hand and as it was ordered by the constitutions of the officers that if the chancellor happened to be a layman he should be also a knight and have other personal endowments so did king charles i conceive it requisite to confer some further mark of distinction upon this officer in relation to place and precedence without the order to which effect there passed a decree in a chapter assembled by the sovereign at whitehall the   d of april      present the earls of mulgrave montgomery rutland carlisle holland suffolk pembroke arundel and surrey salisbury dorset barkshire and northampton that sir francis crane the present chancellor and all others that should succeed him in that place hereafter shall in right of that place in all assemblies and upon all occasions be ranked and placed immediately aftr knightsprivycouncellors and before the chancellor of the exchequer the persons holding both places being in pari gradu and consequently before all others whom the said chancellor is to precede etc  and to the intent the chancellor of the exchequers place may be certainly known may the  0th    jac i it was thus established that the knights of the most noble order of the garter the privycouncellors the master of the courts of wards and liveries the chancellor and under treasurer of the exchequer chancellor of the duchy the chief justice of the court of kings bench the master of the rolls the chief justice of the court of common pleas the chief baron of the exchequer and all other judges and barons of the degree of the coif should have place and precedence in all places and upon all occasions before the younger sons of viscounts and barons and before all baronets etc  the aforesaid constitutions provide the chancellor of the order an habitation within the castle of windsor as well as the prelate which is the southwest tower in the lower ward of the castle called the chancellors tower the possession thereof had been for some time in the power of others and therefore by a chapter convened at white hall nov  th   car i it was restored unto sir francis crane then chanellor of the order and after his decease to descend to his successors these constitutions also ordained him the like liveries at the table and court of the sovereign as were allowed to the prelate  at the first erection of this office the chancellor had no pension awarded him until the constitutions in reference to the officers were established at that time there was conferred on him a pension of  00 l per annum in consideration of his employment or else an allowance proportionate in fees offices or other promotions over and above his lodgings in the castle and liveries at court but as to fees and perquisites there are none to be claimed by this officer and for that reason he not only possesses the said pension but all his disbursements allowed him even to paper wax and wafers and indeed those who enjoyed the office esteemed it as a degradation of their post to receive either fee or gratuity for any affair transacted within the order and sir thomas row sometime chancellor affirmed that his office was an office of honor and not of fees and that he had always excepted against fees for the disbursement of the sovereigns money though he acknowledged some had bestowed on his clerk a small gratuity for the bare engrossing of an alms knights patent but nothing farther  and because the custody of the seals of the order appertains to this officer it will be here the fittest place to mention something of them by the statutes of edw iii they were to have a common seal this is confirmed by the statutes of king hen v and since named the great seal of the order the use of this is not only to seal the original statutes appointed to remain perpetually within the treasury of windsor college as also those copies of which each knightcompanion is obliged to conserve one but likewise all letters of license to any of the knightscompanions desirous of winning honor abroad and all mandates and certificates relating to the order  after what model the first seal was composed we have no exact relation polydore virgil tells us that when the founder of the order had fixed choice of st george for its patron he represented him armed and mounted on an horse bearing a silver shield and thereon a red cross but whether st george thus designed was on the first seal or only a scutcheon of his arms as in latter times is uncertain but his author observes that the founder habited his soldiers in white jackets or coats and on their breasts and backs sowed red crosses parallel to the arms assigned to st george as well as to the kingdom of england put under his patronage which arms the sovereigns of the order have ever since exhibied in their standards but besides this common seal king hen v in the  th year of his reign instituted a privy signet in case the sovereign should be called out of this kingdom upon weighty affairs the intent thereof was to affix it to all acts passed by the sovereign beyond sea to distinguish them from those of his deputies in england king hen viiis statutes ordain the making both of a common seal and signet and direct that the arms of the order should be engraven upon each of them the common seal used in his reign was a garter within it a shield having the cross of st george impaling the national arms the said shield encompassed with two branches hanging from the regal crown which debruses part of the garter the signet being designed after the same manner but less temp jac i it suffered no other alteration but only in the national arms by admitting the quarterings of scotland and ireland and newfashioning the crown omitting the suspension of the shield  there was a seal made at the beginning of the reign of king cha i which being esteemed too little for the grandeur and honor of the sovereigns commissions it was afterward decreed in chapter held   th of april    car i that a new one should be made of a larger size with the accustomed arms and motto and the care thereof committed to sir thomas row chancellor which command he executed with all due care and regard as is manifestly evident by the nobleness of the design one representation being st george in armor adorned with a waveing mantle his bever open his helmet plumed holding a shield of his arms in his left hand and striking with a sword in his right his body mounted on a bold horse trampling over a dragon which assails the champion the whole figure is well contracted and the sun a rock the bones of devoured men and a mountain in lointon in it is circumscribed magnum sigillum nobilis ordinis garterij having the enrichments of festons between every word placed pentagonally the other representation is the royal garter imperially crowned enclosing a shield of the arms of st george impaling the sovereigns arms the same bordered with fretwork and other ornaments in cartouche in the same decree direction was given also for a new signet the former being thought too big for letters and this was an oval shaped so from its impression which was the garter crowned wherein was st george and the sovereigns arms impaled  it was at the same chapter further decreed that all legations to deliver this order to foreign princes all other acts bearing the style of commissions all patents of offices and fees all grants or licenses sent out of the kingdom should be sealed with this seal which should be henceforward called the great seal of the order so also the book of statutes sent to elect knights or foreign princes being fixed to a label of blue silk and held according to ancient custom and that all letters concerning the order whether of signification of election or lieutenancy or summons upon prorogation or other directions from the sovereign should only be sealed with the signet moreover these seals were appointed to be thenceforth born before the sovereign in all public assemblies during the celebration of st georges feast or in other its solemnities by the chancellor of the order in a purse of blue velvet and command given to sir thomas row to provid one acordingly on the foreside of which purse was richly embroidred by a goldsmiths with venice gold and silver gold and silver purls and plates and variety of naples silks the arms of st george impaling the sovereign surrounded with a garter crowned having a very fair running work or compartment round about it the charge of which amounted to    l    s  0 d  by the statutes of institution it was ordained that in case the knightscompanions to whose care the sovereign did commit the seal of the order should upon lawful occasions be absent from court it behooves him to leave it behind him with some other knightcompanion to present to the sovereign to the intent it might be always in readiness but if the sovereign be out of his kingdom then the disposal of it was committed to the deputies and the signet of the order should have a warrant for all such acts and decrees as should b confirmed there  the distance from court was by the constitutions restricted to  0 miles and by the statutes of king hen viii to  0 upon consideration whereof we find sir thomas row chancellor having some occasions ano    car i to be absent above  0 miles tendered the seals to the sovereign who was pleased to dispense with the statutes and permitted him to keep them nevertheless    the registers oath mantle badge privileges and pension fall next under our consideration he was one of the three constituted at the institution of the order under the title of registrator and registrarius and so is called in the statutes of king hen v elsewhere in the books of the order scriba and actuarius what were the first registers names we cannot discover till the reign of king hen v but it may be presumed they were canons of windsor because this office was at first assigned to one of that college besides the registers from the reign of king henry v to the beginning of king henry viiith reign were also canons of this college among whom was john coningham and the first found called so as the fragments of a glass inscription in clare church near windsor where he was rector attests the first dean of windsor constituted register of the order was john vesey anno   hen viii many of whose successors in this deanery have since been admitted nevertheless as they were canons not deans of windsor and it is not improbable the deans were elected to this office as being enabled to support the reputation of the registership with the revenue of his deanery better than any of the canons with the addition of the pension but at a chapter held at whitehall the   d of april    car i the sovereign thought it convenient that the office of dean and register should concenter in one and the same person as formerly and therefore commanded this his pleasuer to be enrolled among the annals of the order that so it might pass in the future times from example into rule  by the constitutions of the office a secular person is made capable of it no less than an ecclesiastic how be it he is to be a man of singular integrity eminent quality a knight and signalized for experience and learning but if an ecclesiastic then must he be a person of consummate erudition a professor of divinity or law either canon or civil and a dignitarian in some cathedral church or else a canon at windsor  the substance of his oath in the statute of the institutions was that he should enter upon the registry with all fidelity the scrutinies elections penalties reconciliations and all other acts relating to the order to which was added that he shall faithfully discharge his duty in all things but in king hen viiith days the oath enjoined him differs nothing from that of the prelates and chancellors  at his admission he takes this oath kneeling while the prelate used to pronounce the words as anno   mar   and   ph and mar but in his absence as anno   eliz the chancellor administered it anno   car i the prelate chancellor and register took their oaths at one time and then it was thus ordered first the register took it kneeling between the sovereigns knees the black rod holding the evangelists and the garter read the words out of the black book this done the register read the words of the prelates oath when he was sworn and in the last place did the like to the chancellor after this manner did garter read the words to the registers admitted    car i and    car ii we cannot trace the habit this officer had assigned him at the erection of the order but it afterward appears that his allowance was the same with the chancellors consisting of   yards of woollen cloth and   timber of minever gross equalent to what those knightscompanions had allotted who were under the degree of an earl the habit he is pourtrayed in at a proceeding of king hen viiith reign shows it to be ecclesiastical a black gown a surplice over that reaching to his ancles and thereon a mantle of furs but the constitutions of his office restricted him to none wherein there seems a defect since they have assignd habits to the garter and black rod notwithstanding by a draught of the officers in their ancient dress it is plainly demonstrable to be a mantle somewhat of a russel color faced with a pane of blue whereon is embroidred a flowerdeluce crowned gold then another pane red thereon a lion passant gardant crowned gold and so they are alternately placed to the bottom to this mantle belong cordons of silk blue and yellow  since that time not only the registers but also garters and black rods robes underwent some alterations for by a decree in chapter called at st james jun     and   ph and mar these officers were assigned mantles of crimson satin lined with taffaty and a scutcheon of st georges arms embroidred on the left shoulder but not encircled with a garter having the same buttons and tassels as wereappointed to the prelate and chancellor the proportion of satin assigned to each mantle was    yards and as many yards of white taffaty  and though the registers mantle was ann    eliz composed of the preceding materials and had like trimming yet they agree not in their proportions here being allowed    yards of crimson satin and but    of taffaty from hence these mantles continued immutable until the  0th of feb    car ii when there issued a warrant to the master of the great wardrobe to prepare for this officer as also for garter and the black rod for their liveries mantles of scarlet satin each containing    and  0 yards of white taffaty for lining but consonant in all other punctilios with the former yet why the color was altered is not expressed  the register seems to have been represented with a scrowle in his hand for his badge and by the proceedings in queen elizabeths reign pictured with a book both proper symbols of his office in dr christopher wrens registership the sovereign commanded him to cover the red book of the order with crimson velvet and assigned for the garter two pens in saltire interlacing the garter above with these two letters c r crowned all being richly embroidred as also the border with venice gold and silver and various colors of naples silk by harrison the sovereigns embroiderer with a clasp in imitation of the garter surrounding the representation of st george which cost    l    s   d this book he was ordered to bear before his breast on all solemn occasions when he wore his mantle and for his better convenience he made a belt and an ouch to hang it by  so high a regard had the sovereigns of this order not only to this officer but likewise to garter and black rod that they took them into a particular protection and by the constitutions of their offices granted them that they their goods and servants should severally remain under the safeguard of the sovereign and if any injury or violence should chance to be offered them either by subjects or foreigners whenever they should exhibit their complaint to the sovereign either himself or the knightscompanions should afford them justice but if the adverse party should refuse to submit his cause to the sovereign then the sovereign and knightscompanions should show themselves so far inclinable toward these officers as to be ready to allow them all favor countenance etc consistent with justice and equity  upon the strength and security of this ancient privilege to avoid the prolongation of a law suit dr christopher wren register petitioned the sovereign in chapter held at whitehall the   th of april    car i against one thornhill who under pretense of digging for saltpeter had so undermined his pigeonhouse built on the rectory of knol magna in wiltsh that it fell down and upon reading of the petition it was resolved by the sovereign and knightscompanions that they would confider the grant in the constitutions and until it was farther declared the chancellor of the order should have power upon information of any rigor upon controverse begun in any other court to write letters under the signet of the order that all vexation against them should be superseded until information of the cause were given to and determination in the cause resumed by the sovereign or leave of him obtained to proceed after this it is set down that thornhill was summoned before the lords commissioners of the navy and his negative answer given in and represented to the sovereign in another chapter convened the  th of october ensuing whereupon it was ordered that the chancellor should write to the same lords commissioners and another to the earls of pembroke arundel and dorset three of the knightscompanions to empower them that they or any three of them should cause the said thornhill to be brought before them and likewise write to any of the inhahitants of knoil to view and testify the truth to hear any further proof on the behalf of either party and to give sentence according to justice that so a tedious suit of law might be prevented and the dignity of this most noble order protected these commands of the chancellor being executed and certificates returned from the country the knighs companions in a chapter held the   th of may    car i were moved to peruse them but before they could meet thornhill fled and the prosecution of this business ceased upon the same footing was it that the said dr wren obtained from king cha i his gracious protection for himself servants and estate literally expressed in the late war as t violaters of that order would answer this our contrary at their peril daed at oxford under the signet of this our order the   th day of dec in the   th year of our reign  this officer by the constitutions has a pension of  0 l per annum or proportionable in fees offices or other emoluments and ann   and   ph and mar the same numerical pension was conferred on owen oglethorp dean of windsor out of the exchequer until some ecclesiastical preferment of like value should devolve on him the same was confirmed to dr maxey by decree in chapter    jac i and afterward to dr beaumont by letters patent under the great seal of ngland  0 jac i but there needed no allotment of lodgings at windsor to this officer as there was to the rest since both the canons and dean were provided of houses belonging to their ecclesiastical dignities within the college at the erction of the order    the fourth officer of the order is garter he was ordained by king henry v with the advice and consent of all the knightscompanions who for the honor of the order was pleased he should be the principal officer within the college of arms and chief of the heralds the services enjoined him relating to the order were in preceding times performed by the windsor herald of arms an officer created with that title by k edward iii much about the time of his erecting this order and an annual pension of  0 marks payable out of the exchequer by letters patent for life which was confirmed by king r ii  sir william brugges was the person first created garter and called in the institution of his office jartier roy darmys des anglois but elsewhere styled willielmus brugges alias dictus gartier rex armorum this sir william became a great benefactor to st georges church at stamford and in the windows of the chancel caused to be represented king edward iii with his twenty five knightscompanions kneeling habited in their mantles and surcoats of arms but now much shattered and defaced john smert his successor had this office conferred on him by letters patents under this title rex armorum de garteria and john wrythe was styled principalis heraldus and officiarius inclyti ordinis garterij armorumque rex anglicorum but sir gilbe rt dethick leaving out heraldus joined principalis rex which still continues  in the constitutions of his office he is called garterus rx armorum angliae whom the sovereign and knightscompanions have decreed to be a gentleman of blood and arms of unspotted reputation and born within the kingdom of england besides as king hen v did before so does king hen viii declare that he shall be chief of all the oficers of arms dependant upon the crown of england  the substance of his oath administered by the register at his admission whilst he humbly kneeleth at the sovereigns feet in the chapter house is    to yield obedienc to the sovereign and knightscompanions    to kep silence and not disclose the secrets of the order    to mke signification of the death of each knightcompanion    to execute all things fathfully committed to his care    to enquire diligently after all the noble acts of the knightscompanions and certify them to the register    to be faithful in the exercise of his office  and such an oath sir christopher barker took at a chapter held at greenwich    hen viii when he was made garter  as for a particular habit we do not find any inserted in the great wardrobe whence it is presued he was at first distinguished from the rest of the officers of the order by his coat embroidred with the sovereigns arms like as the provincial kings then wore but after the constitutions of the officers were estabished there was assigned him a habit or mantle in all respects resembling the register saving that the ground whereon the lions and flowerdeluces were embroidred was entirely red and this to b wore only at the public solemnities of the order queen mary commanded it to be made of crimson stin and so it remained till the restoration when the color was altered to scarlet  this officer is appointed to bear a white rod or scepter at every feast of st george the sovereign being present gilded at both ends and at the top the arms of the order impaling the sovereigns arms portrayed on an oblong cube crowned but no directions are given in the constitutions for this crown no for that ducal one on his head wherewith his effigies has been represented and yet at all great solemnities is never used that we can discover there was assigned him by queen eliz a badge of gold to be worn daily by him and his successors before the breast in a gold chain or ribband and thereon ennamelled the sovereigns arms crowned with an imperial crown and both surrounded with the garter but sir edward walker when made garter obtained the sovereigns leave to impale therein st georgess arms with those of the sovereigns which badge is alike on both sides  there is an house appointed for his habitation within windsor castle called garters tower it was by chapter annexed for ever to the office of garter and restored to sir william segars possession  d of may    0 by the constitution of his office he is to be allowed barons service in the sovereigns court and his table served next after the dean of the chapel with such liveries as of old were accustomed  it appears that king hen v after his erecting this office died before he had settled a pension upon sir william brugges for supportation of his little estate which the knightscompanions taking into consideration and that he might more honorably comport himself to the service of the order till the young king should come to age they being assembled in a chapter with the consent of the prelate decreed the said sir william to receive of each of them at every feast of st george as is set down viz of the bishop of winchester prelate   marks dukes    marks   of every earl    nobles baron or baronet   nobles knight bachelor   nobles   the first payment was agreed to be paid down and so to remain in force annually with request to the absent knights that for the honor of the order and causes in the instrument expressed they would approve of their ordinance which passed under the seal of the order dated at windsor      afterward king hen vi in consideration of his services to his father and himself with consent of his council granted to the said brugges by letters patent a pension of  0 l er annum out of the fee farm of the city of winchester during his pleasure which pension upon the surrender of his patent he granted anew to him and agne his wife for their lives and the longer liver of them and when this office upon sir william brugges death was devolved on john smrt guyenne herald   april    hen vi he had the yearly sum of  0 l granted him therewith for life out of the exchequer but his successor john wrythe norroy obtained an increase of pension to  0 l per annum made payable out of the small customs of the city of london this annual sum was afterward confirmed to garter by the constitution of his office and an augmentation from the then knightscompanions additional to the pensions granted by their predecessors upon the death of king hen v  of a duke    pounds a marquess    marks an earl    marks a baron    nobles a knight bachelor   nobles   in succeeding times the sovereign thought fit to augment this pension to  0 l per annum now payable out of the revenue settled upon the order and the knightscompanions yet to enlarge their sallery which they did the sovereign assenting by the decree made in a chapter held at windsor       and    sept an      wherein it was ordained that their officer sir william segar garter knight king of arms of that order should then and from thenceforth have renewed and paid unto him certain annual fees and pensions anciently enjoyed by his predecessors with a surplus of  0 l per annum which his majestys act of royal bounty has given to his said servant for his better support and maintenance as also of prince charles prince of wales the sum of   l and of every duke of the blood   l all other estates viz a duke not of the blood   l a marquess   marks an earl   marks a viscount   nobles a baron  0 s and a knight bachelor that shall be of the order    s   d all which said sums of money according to the several degrees of their estates are to be paid continues the decree unto the said garter or his assigns yearly at st georgess feast or immediately after as well by the knights then present as by those that shall be absent or hereafter are to succeed in the said order and after the decease of the said garter to his successors for ever  at st georgess feast celebrated at windsor       and    of april anno    car ii sir edward walker then garter representing by petition that the annual pension of the installed knights then in arrear for one year amounted to    l    s   d according to their proper proportion the sovereigns share he being to pay for all stranger knights amounted at that time to    l    s   d and humbly praying that his majesty would grant to him and his successors an  00 l per annum out of the revenue settled to the use of the order in lieu not only of those said pensions payable from the sovereign and knightscompanions both strangers and subjects but for resigning his claim to his annual pension of  0 l in consideration for preparing scutcheons and removal of achievements this petition the sovereign was pleased to refer to a commit of the knightscompanions who namely the duke of albemarl the earls of lindsey manchester sandwich and stafford who being attended by garter and weighing the event of the petition offered their opinions to the sovereign to grant him the said  00 l per annum in lieu of what he offered to quit whereby the interest of this office might be preserved in a more compendious method than it was his majesty exempted from those small payments for strangers and the knightssubjects themselves were discharged from their annual pension and his majesty ratifying the same shortly after sir henry de vi the chancellor was ordered to pay unto garter and his successors the said annual pension of  00 l which was accordingly put in execution as an equivalent for all fees and salaries relating to the order of the garter  the duty of this officer in general is to perform or cause to be effected all transactions whatsoever the sovereign or prelate or chancellor shall enjoin him in relation to this most noble order     the fifth and last officer is the blackrod this officer was instituted by the founder king ed iii but whether at the first erection of the order does not appear howbeit within a few years after    e iii the king conferred to william whitehorse esquire for life officium hostiarii capellae regis infra castrum de windesore with a fee of    d a day out of his exchequer  anno   hen iv this office is called officium virgarij comitivae de la garter infra castrum regis de windesore and under that denomination was confirmed to thomas sye with the fees and emoluments thereunto expressed in the patent to his successor john athilbrigg ann   h   it is styled officium virgarij sive ostiarij etc afterward it has the title officium virgaebajuli coram rege ad festum sancti georgii infra castrum regis de windesore and ever since it runs in the patents by the appellation of virgaebajulus virgarius or nigrivergifer but in the constitutions of his office he has the title of hostiarius and under the restriction of these qualifications that he be a gentleman of blood and arms born within the sovereigns dominions and if he be not a knight at his admission into the office he ought then to be knighted as garter was entitled the principal officer of arms so was the blackrod for the honor of the order appointed the chief usher in the kingdom and as he is so and frequently called gentleman usher of the blackrod so we shall wave as we did in garter all things appertaining to his employments otherwise than what directly is included in this most noble order  in a chapter held at whitehall the   th of february   car i it was decreed that the office of the blackrod should from thenceforth successively as soon as the same should become void james maxwell esquire then enjoying it be annexed to some one of the gentlemenushers dailywaiters whom the sovereign should appoint  this was carried upon the petition of the gentlemenushers dailywaiters seconded by the lord chamberlain the earlmarshal and others knightscompanions as is evident from another petition of theirs to the sovereign in chapter assembled at oxford the   th of january  0 car i but some years after this      the lord lanrick secretary for scotland had on mr maxwells behalf obtained the sovereigns warrant for letterspatent under the greatseal for two lives maxwells and mr alexander thayn the longest liver of them whereby the said decree was frustrate to the gentlemenushers of which making complaint in the last mentioned chapter the sovereign and knightscompanions in regard this latter grant was not only repugnant to the preceding decree and the greatseal surreptitiously gained but ought likewise to have passed the seals of the order ordered peter newton esquire to be presently sworn into this office nevertheless after the restoration a d    0 newton being then dead the gentlemenushers dailywaiters petitioned again and thayne was demanded to put in his answer and the result of the whole was after mature deliberation in a chapter held at whitehall the  0th of february    car ii the decree which fixed this office to one of the gentlemenushers dailywaiters was confirmed and john ayton one of the petitioners was sworn gentleman usher of the blackrod which was performed by the register in the presence of the sovereign the chapter sitting  the form of the oath given to this officer temp hen viii was truly and faithfully to observe and keep all the points of the statutes of the order as to him belonged and appertained  he has the like habit with the register and garter before described but his ensign and badge is somewhat different from garters for first it was ordained that he or his deputy should carry a blackrod whence he has his title before the sovereign or his deputy at the feast of st george within the castle of windsor and at other solemnities and chapters of the order on the top of which there ought to be set a lion of england this rod serves instead of a mace and has the same authority to apprehend delinquents and such have offended against the statutes of this most noble order and where he apprehends any one of the order as guilty of some crime for which he is to be expelled the order the manner of it is by touching them with this blackrod and his fee for it is   l  he has assigned him a golden badge to be openly worn in a gold chain or ribband before his breast composed of one of the knots in the collar of the order which tie the roses together and encompassed with a garter being alike on both sides which was conferred on him and his successors by decree in chapter held the   th of april   eliz  it is as ancient as hen vths reign for there is a house in windsor castle granted to this officer by letterspatent during life and the same provision is made for him by the constitutions of his office it is situate on the south side of the castle in the middle ward the said constitutions give him baronservice at court and livery thereto appertaining and besides these the keeping of the said castle and the two parks adjacent  king charles i having taken into his hands the little park of windsor and bestowed it upon james maxwell then usher of the blackrod he at a chapter held at whitehall the  th of november      decreed that as the custody of the said park was conferred on maxwell in right of his office so the same should for ever after be annexed thereto and not to be disposed of but under the great seal of the order and that only to the usher of the order for the time being  lastly this officer had anciently a fee of    d per diem which we find continued down in the letters patent whereby this office was granted besides which the constitutions of his office allow him an annual pension of  0 l heretofore paid him out of the exchequer but by king charles i assigned him out of   00 l per ann settled upon the order touching which and the payment of the officers pensions upon the new establishment is the next section     king james i taking into his royal breast the constitution of this most noble order that it was in the nature of a distinct sovereignty governed by laws and conventions proper to the body and himself as sovereign in matters immediately relating thereunto had the sole and uncontrollable authority of revising adding or explaining and finding that the pensions paid to the officers of the order as those to the almsknights and some other expenses had been anciently made payable out of his exchequer by virtue of the great seals of england or otherwise by privyseals and conceiving it incongruous that the officers should claim their pensions by virtue of any other seal than that of the order for it is in some kind derogatory to the honor of the order to permit other seals to be used within the same he thereupon with twelve knightscompanions in a chapter held at whitehall the   d of may  0 jac i passed a decree that all things concerning the order should hereafter be ratified under the seal of the order only and in particular that the grants of poor knights places after their being signed by the sovereign should be passed under the seal of the order only and none other and the year following the chancellor was ordered that he should take advice of the sovereigns attorney general how by virtue of the seal of the order the pensions given to the poor knights might be paid and received his majestys further pleasure being that all grants and payments concerning the order should afterward be confirmed under the seal of the order only and by virtue thereof  as to the almsknights patents this decree was of force and validity but in the other generals how far it was pursued we know not for in some of them it grew obsolete and useless but in a chapter called at windsor the   d of april  0 car i a debate arose about setting a part of the annual sum of  000 l out of the receipts of his majestys exchequer to be employed particularly in discharge of expenses toward the feasts of the order legations to foreign princes payment of the officers pensions etc disbursed for the necessity and reputation of this noble order afterward at a chapter held the   th of april    car i that sovereign ratified his royal assignation and increased his bounty to   00 l per ann settling it for those designs in a perpetuity for ever and making it payable out of the customs in the port of london but to be received by the chancellor of the order for the time being as treasurer of this money of which he was to give up an account to the sovereign and knightscompanions yearly at st georges feast and in pursuance of this ratification the attorney general had instructions to draw up a book for his royal signature to warrant its passing under the great seal of england which was dispatched the letterspatent bearing test at westminster the   d of january    car i immediately after sir thomas row the chancellor of the order presented a list of the ordinary fees and charges of the order upon which it was agreed to that there should issue out a standing commission to the chancellor under the great seal of the order to warrant the yearly payments and he to be discharged according as the said patent had provided this commission passing the great seal the  d of may    car i the sovereign thereby empowered the chancellor to make payable out of the yearly revenue of   00 l all and every the yearly fees pensions salaries and other payments due and payable to the officers of the order almsknights or others appertaining to the order either by charter grant or assignation under the seal and signet of the order or by any other lawful way whatsoever

thomas row and in his absence beyond sea sir james palmer deputychancellor received out of the sovereigns receipts of subsidies customs and imposts the   00 l per ann out of which they paid the annual pensions abovenamed under the title of certain and ordinary charges as also such as come within the denomination of accidental and extraordinary expenses of which kind in their time were  mantles when

used in dispensations and prorogations blue wax for the seas of the order by which we are easily informed what ought to be accounted extraordinary expenses toward the discharge whereof this sum was to be employed as far as it would reach to mitigate the cost the great wardrobe formerly stood taxed with provisions of the order both for foreign embassies and expenses at home  the manner of the chancellors passing his account as directed by the said commission was thus done by sir james palmer he humbly moved the sovereign in chapter held the  0th of october    car i that it would please him to view the disbursements made for the expenses of the order which thereupon being examined by the knights in the sovereigns presence the same were found agreeable to the directions of the commission and the payments justified by the acquittance of every officer to whom any fee was due no payment having been made without the sovereigns hand first to authorize it allwhich being seen and allowed the account wherein his disbursements exceeded his receipts    l    s  0 s was esteemed equitable and just and passed by the subscription of charles then prince of wales the earls of pembroke and montgomery salisbury holland rkshire duke hamilton and the earl of northumberland     the executions of these offices is the last thing here to be described for though all the officers are strictly obliged to give personal attendance to their offices yet in case of sickness absence out of the kingdom or other emergent reasons the sovereign is pleased to dispense with them and constitute others to officiate in their stead who on such occasions wear the robe of that officer whom they represent so in case of vacancy the absence of the prelate at the grand feast celebrated at windsor    hen vi is noted in the black book to have been upon just cause and the bishop of bangor officiated divine service and next morning celebrated the mass pro defunctis the following year his place in these religious duties was supplied by the bishop of salisbury as ann    and    hen vi and at all times of the prelates absence the sovereign has made known his will what bishop should supply for him the office of chancellor has been executed by proxies and to this may first be referred a passage in the black book where dr tailor has the title of vice chancellor of later times when sir thomas row was employed in an embassy into germany sir james palmer knight one of the gentlemenushers of the privychamber was deputed by the sovereign to the chancellorship during his absence having the purse with the seals delivered to him the  th of may    car i being sworn by the register of the order durante deputatione and beneplacito regis which clause was likewise annexed in the deputy chancellors oath    car ii upon sir thomas rowes return and indisposition    car i sir james was again deputed chancellor and a third time    car i continued deputy chancellor unto the death of sir thomas row of which the sovereign being informed at oxford      reserved the disposal of this office till sir jamess return to court and then commanded him to wear the badge and ribband about his neck till a chapter of the order completed his admittance  in the vacancy of the registership ann   h viii thomas ruthall bishop of durham supplied it and ann    and    eliz dr day dean of windsor executed the office and attended at the feasts of st george as deputyregister dr george carew then register having license by his patent to execute it by himself or deputy being dispensed with by the queen in case of

supplied his place  the office of garter has been supplied by deputation for in those embassies with the ensigns of the order to foreign princes where special occasions detained garter at home some of the kings or heralds of arms have been ordered upon those employments upon the recommendation of garter to the sovereign where of there are several instances the last of gregory king esquire lancasterherald who lately carried over the habit to the elector of hanover so also in case of vacancy for we find that clarencieux king of arms executed this office after sir gilbert dethicks death in january    eliz being then sent with the earl of darby to the french king henry iii as also in reference to the preparations the   th of april following and service performed thereat and at the

the king into scotland peter newton esq supplied his place at the feast at windsor  th  th an  0th of october anno    car i  chap ix    we come now to treat of the election of a knight into the order according to the statutes of institution which ordains that whenever any knightcompanion happens to depart this life the sovereign or his deputy after certain notice had thereof should forthwith by his letters summon all the knightscompanions then within the realm who were able to come to meet him within six weeks after such notice in what convenient place soever he pleased to assign for the electing a new companion into the society thus did the law of this most noble order in case of death and to prevent vacancies at first provide wherewith we evidently find the practice of elder times did punctually concur for as soon as garter in discharge of his duty had made certificate to the sovereign of a knightcompanions decease or otherwise to the register of the order all fitting diligence was used to fill up the vacant stall within the space limited by this statute or immediately after and for the quicker dispatch letters of summons were issued to the knightscompanions to give personal attendance at the election in an ancient one upon the death of sir henry fitz hugh knightcompanion temp henry v these particulars were no less pursuant to the statutes than worthy observation  i the day whereon the defunct knightcompanion died is therein set down  ii direction is given for celebrating masses according to the tenor of the statutes  iii intimation that a stall is become void by the knights decease  iv the law of the order vouched which appoints an election of another knight within six weeks after certificate made of the death of the former to avoid as much as may be an interval in succession  v the sovereigns power asserted where he sees cause to prorogue the election  vi an injunction to attend personally at the election under a penalty expressed in the satutes  vii the day place and hour for appearance is with certainty appointed to the end all might accommodate themselves to be present  viii the end of coming is mentioned with full disposition and preparation to perform what the statutes in this case required  ix lastly direction is there given to the knight summoned that in case his coming to the chapter was impeded he should certify the reason of his default against the time of his appearance of the validity whereof the sovereign was to be sole umpire  and generally of these topics and to this purport were the letters of summons in succeeding times composed  the beforementioned branch of the statutes of institution has been sufficiently enforced by incorporating it into the statutes temp h v and h viii no has it since undergone any alteration howbeit some further addition and explanation were annexed to them    jac i at a chapter held at windsor the   th of april that year where it was decreed that the sovereign being advertised of the death of a knightcompanion the knightscompanions remaining at court should move him to declare his pleasure whether h would that letters should be sent to all the knightscompanions within the realm to attend his person for the choice of a new knight at a day by the said sovereign appointed according to the ancient statutes of the order or be pleased to defr the election until the feast of st george at what time elections have been most usually made and according as he resolved in what place it should be so it ought by letters directed to the knightscompanions within the realm to  made known unto them  this deferring or prorogation of the election was no new thing though not indulged by the statutes or declared law before this    jac   as is evident by the letter of summons sent after the death of sir robert dufrevil knight companion temp h   wherein notice is taken of the limitation given by the statutes after certificate of death viz six weeks within the space whereof a new election was to commence yet where a chapter for election could not conveniently be summoned within that limited time it was sufficient if the sovereign declared as he did in the said placart and entered in the black book that being then involved in other business he could not well attend this affair and therefore deferred the time for election unto the eve of st george next following  but of later date this formal way of summons by letter has been discontinued and only remained to such as are remote and warned only by a verbal message for the chancellor of the order having consulted the sovereigns pleasure as to the day and place usually acquaints garter therewith who thereupon goes immediately to the knights companions then at court and desires their attendance at the chapter according to the sovereigns designation  and here it is to be remarked that no knight elect ought to be summoned to a chapter of election or are rendered sufficient of giving their votes therein until they be completely installed either in person or by proxy nor indeed did any necessity intervene or require it till the late rebellious times when the castle of windsor being garrisoned by the parliaments forces it was not possible for the duke of york and prince rupert to take possession of their stalls as the law of the order enjoined therefore the then sovereign whose right it is did    jan      dispense with their installations in st georges chapel for the present and invested them with the privileges of the order among which the power of voting in chapter was one provided those princes should first take the oath given at installations and afterward perform the accustomed ceremonies so soon as it should be thought convenient and the castle was restored to the possession of his majesty in compliance to which proviso they both then took the oath and on the eve of the first fast of st george after the restoration the duke was installed and on the eve of the second feast    car   by the earls of northumberland and berkshire and the prince by the duke of albemarle and earl of lindsy     the place of election but at what time soever the ceremony of election is purposed the same ought to be celebrated in chapter for so is the assembly of the sovereign and knightscompanions called where or whenever convened whether at the solemnity of st georges feast the ordinary or most accustomed time or on other days specially set apart by the sovereign and when the sovereign thinks fitting in the interval of feasts to elect any foreign prince or other person stranger or subject h

the sovereigns almost constant court and abode has been the usual place whereunto all the knights companions have been specially summoned and peculiar chapters assembled for eletion in the intervals between the vacancy and st georges feast however while king charles ii was in exile and wanted the complete number of knights to constitute a full chapter he was necessitated not only to dispense with the ceremony of election in chapter but also in supplying the defect of a scrutiny by making his own election yet after his restoration whitehall recovered her wonted honor and april the  st    car ii at a chapter called and held in the bedchamber there the duke of richmond the earls of lindsey manchester and strafford were elected     in the next place we are to consider what number of knightscompanions ought to be assembled to make up a complete chapter of election  by the statutes there should be six in number at the least besides the sovereign or his deputy the due observance of which has been so strict formerly that elections have been deferred where chapters have been deficient in that number for proof of which the duke of gloucester ann   hen vi then deputy to the sovereign at that time in france for celebrating the feast of st george at windsor forbore to proceed to election because the number of knightscompanions the assembled was less than the statutes required and ann  0 hen v no election was solemnized though one stall was void by the death of the lord clifford and probably for that reason for the ear of bedford then the sovereigns deputy had but three knights present with him ann    or rather    humphry duke of bucks being deputed to celebrate the feast of st george at windsor although there was at that time four stalls vacant yet did no nomination pass one reason because there was not present a sufficient number to complete the election so when the same king celebrated the grand feast personally at windsor anno    regni sui having but three knights attending him thereat the election was prorogued for the very same reason in like manner       and    hen vi the elections were retarded for at the first of them there were present but two knightscompanions besides the sovereigns deputy and a the two last but four besides the sovereign though the egistrum cartaceum ann    names five by adding the duke of somerset at the feast of st geoge celebrated at windsor a d      temp edw iv the sovereign fully resolving to constitute an election and having but five knightscompanions present calys pursuivant at arms was dispatched to london for sir john astly to repair thither and complete the chapter rather than violate the laws of the order january the   st    car ii being designed for the election of christopher duke of albemarle and there being convened but five knights at the chapter the election was put off till the third of february following at which time a proportionable number of knights being present his election received their approbation     yet in cases of necessity only and to illustrat the power and prerogative of the sovereigns where the exigency requires it though not to be made use of where there is a possibility to perform the rules and injunctions of the statutes the sovereigns for diverse reasons have been induced to dispense with this branch of the statute for want of a plenary number to complete a chapter and the first liberty observed herein was made use of by king henry viii ann    regnisui who upon the death of the lord montjoy very speedily assembled a chapter at whitehall where no more than five knightscompanions being present the absence of the rest were excused by special grace and favor and the injunction of the statute as the annals subjoin concerning the number of nominators were by the same clemency dispensed with because of the exigency of the time and place and immediately upon taking a scrutiny james v king of scotland was elected into the fellowship of this illustrious order but from that time to the rebellion there occurs not any thing of this nature but the wickedness of those days created new exigencies and projections which occasioned or rather enforced the sovereign king charles i most unwillingly to awaken and rouse up this dormant prerogative which he put in execution at a chapter purposely assembled for the election of thoms earl of strafford held at the city of york the   th of september    car i where at that time and place he dispensed with the defect of number of six knightscompanions having then with him four only some of the rest being engaged in his service against the scots  afterward when several of the knightscompanions so much adhered to the long parliament that all summons were ineffectual to draw them to their attendance upon their sovereign though but to celebrate the grand festival of their patron much less to the completing chapters of election to which they were obliged by the oath taken at their installment the sovereign was constrained to extend further his suprem authority and thereupon at the feast of st george celebrated at york the   th   th and  0th of april ann    regnisui in a chapter held on the eve of the sai feast by himself and but four other knights companions it was ordered that letters of dispensation should be drawn up for the insufficient number as wanting six knights to hold a chapter of election and for authorizing the knights then present to deliver in their votes according to custom in other scrutinies that so the sovereign might proceed to the election designed by virtue of which dispensation the duk of york and prince rupert were elected fellows of this noble society  the like dispensation was made at oxford upon the  d of march anno  0 car i there being but five knightscompanions present with the sovereign at which chapter william prince of orange and bernard de foix duke of espernon were elected  last of all in reference to the holding three several chapters preparatory to the feast of st george and grand installation celebrated at windsor the   th   th and   th of april    car ii one of which chapters was held for the election of four knights and to deliberate with the surviving knightscompanions the sovereign was pleased the   th of march preceding to pass the like dispensation under the signet of the orde and his own sign manual for this defect and thereby made those three chapters as legal as if the number of knightscompanions had been complete     we are now arrived at opening the chapter whereinto neither the sovereign nor any of the knightscompanions are to be admitted without the ornament both their mantles and garters as the statutes ordain and the law is still in force though the chapter has been assembled elsewhere than at windsor as for instance one called at whitehall for the election of john count palatine of the rhine anno  0 eliz the earl of huntingdon and the lord gray of wilton not having their mantles then at court were not permitted to enter into the chapter to give their votes  king charles i determining to call a chapter for electing the foresaid thoms earl of strafford at york where neither he nor any of the knightscompanions then attending his person had the robes of the order with them and taking into his royal consideration the statutes now mentioned did by his authority as sovereign of the order dispense with those knights then present for coming into the chapter without their mantles  afterward upon other emergencies that owed their origin to the late rebellion the sovereign did the like in some subsequent chapters held at oxford  after the restoration a dispensation passed the signet of the order dated the  0th of january    car ii the great seal being under the hand of the graver but not finished he was necessitated to mak use of his supreme authority for holding a chapter the   th of january following in regard the knightscompanions then in being were not as yet provided of new robes  presuming then that a full number of knights in obedience to their summons are attending their sovereign habited in their mantles and garters and entered into the chapter house at windsor or other place appointed for this assembly the sovereign having taken his seat at the upper end of the table and given leave to the knightscompanions to it the occasion of their being called together is first declared either by the sovereign himself or the chancellor of the order by his command  the next thing in course is to exhibit to the sovereign information of all the vacant stalls and if the sovereign chance to be in foreign parts an information ought to be transmitted to him by his deputy or lieutenant but if in england and present in the chapter then to be presented him by the chancellor or in his absence by the register or other officer of the order  after this they singly debate how the place of the defunct knight shall be suppyd and sometimes where two or more stalls are found void whether they shall be all filled up at that time or if not how many knights shall be elected pro hac vice  but when the scrutiny is intended to be taken in the choir of st georges chapel at windsor these or the like particulars referring to election are commonly considered of on the feast day in the chapter held immediately before vespers wherein it is most usually ordered that the scrutiny shall be taken in the chapel that following afternoon and so it was decreed on st georges day anno   edw vi viz that the elections of knights should be taken that evensong in the chapel  this being effected the chancellor begins to collect the knightscompanions votes and this is frequently termed the taking the scrutiny for the ampler view of the nature of which action and ceremony we shall proceed to certain considerationspreparatory thereunto beginning with what concerns the nomination of the persons to be proposed to the election     and first that knightscompanions only present in chapter have the sole right inherent in themselves to nominate and propose persons to the sovereigns election consentaneous to the bodies of the statutes that even from the institution of this most noble order it has not ever suffered any deviations  it is worthy of remark that anno    eliz the feast of st george being celbrated at greenwich the earl of warwick and lord burleigh were seized with a fit of the gout upon the feast day which retarded them from evening prayer whilst the scrutiny was taken whereupon we find their indisposition of body and absence noted in that scrutiny where their nominations should else have been set down had they been present and upon the same occasion was what robert cook esquire clarenceux king at arms informs us that as for those knights companions who happen to be absent when the scrutiny is taken although this absence is occasioned by accident of sickness or with the sovereigns license nevertheless in regard of this their absence at that very time their votes may not be received  those knights companions that come late to the chapter forfeit likewise the privilege of giving their votes for that time which so happened to prince ruert and the earl of strafford at the chapter held for the election of james duke of monmouth in the privy chamber at whitehall    mar       although none of the absent knightscompanions can give a proxy to vote or otherwise send their suffrages into the chapter or chapel there to pass in nomination yet formerly circa temp h   and h   when diverse of the knights companions were frequently employed in the wars of france and consequently so fixed to their commands that they could not personally attend the feast of st george at windsor it was usual for the commander there in chief with consent of those knights companions to make a formal certificate or presentment but not to pass it by way of nomination or vote for that the law of the order did not permit to the sovereign or his lieutenant and knights companions assembled at the feast of such persons famous for martial valor and virtue with an account of their gallant acts and achievements attested by other persons of honor as were at that time and in that kingdom in the sovereigns service and seemed worthy candidates for the honor of the election to the intent victorious and brave persons might be preferred to so noble and sublime a post an example whereof we find preserved by the industrious and learned dugdale  my lord the duc of bedford remembers as by the statutes of the order of the gartre the election of the stalls void he says in the voy of the brethren and of the fellowship being at the time of the fest in the presence of the soverain or his deputy that thinkyth to my said lord that for his acquital to knighthood that fytteth him to give in knowledge to the king soverain of the order and to his fellowship of the same order the great honors of the notable knights that from time to time exercyseth and have exercysed in knighthood and especially in the service of their soverain lord and of such notable knyghts as my lord of bedford for the time remembers him of he has by the advyce of them of the fellowship of the order being now in france in the kings service and givyng in charge to the said garter king of arms of the order to show their names to the king and to expound part of their deeds acts and of their worthyness first to expose the honor of sir john radeclyff that has contynowed all the time of the victorious king that last dyed whom christ absolve at the first landing of him at quies de caux where the said radeclyff receyved the order of a knight and after contynowed the siege of hareflew and after with my lord of excester at the battle of vallemont and of quies de caux and also sithen the death of the said victorious king radeclyff being seneschall of guyen has brought by his labor in knyghthood to his sovereign lords obeisance within the duchy of guyen many dyverse cities towns and fortresses and in especial deserved great and notable meritsat the siege of the city of bazates which siege was accorded appointed and set day of battle and of rescous the which day was kept and houlden with great power on both sides and under banners displayed the enemies doubtyng to fight with radeclyff required him of apoyntment they to depart under saufe conduct from the said field the which saufe conduct he granted them for the term of eight days like as they required the honor and empruse rested in the said radclyff and to his high merit for incontinent followyng was delyvered to him the reddyssion and possession of the said cytty of bazates and also the said radeclyff was at the battle of assincouert and has contynowed and exercysed the armies the space of xxviij wynters unreproched and in the time of his esquierhood was at the battle of srewsbury and at the journey of husks with the lord gray at the discomfiture and taking of owenson  sir thomas ramston sir rauff butler sir william oldegall sir robert harlyng sir gilbert halsall item my lord the duc of bedford bseecheth the king sovereign of the order to have also for recommendyd to his good grace and highness other of his subjects and servants now being in his service in the realm of france which has done and yet does take great pain by their knyghtly labor daily to serve the merit of worthyness and prowess as sir robert hungerford sir thoms beamont sir john popeham sir nicholas brdet sir rauff nevll sir edward wyver sir john robesart sir tire robesart sir william bretton sir thoms kyngton sir richard hankford and dyverse other  but lest it may be supposed by some that the knightscompanions present in chapter can at their pleasures nominate or propose to elect such persons as they deem meet so they be qualified according to the statutes this privilege is to be understood of knights subjects only for in all cases concerning strangers the sovereign does but barely grant them sufferance and may direct and confine the knightscompanions to the nomination of such as he at any time intends to honor with election which prerogative was particularly asserted    eliz and   car i  in the first of these instances the blue book of the order records that at a chapter held immediately before vespers on st georges day the earl of huntingdon then lieutenant for the sovereign made known to the knightscompanions that the sovereign did permit them or leave it to their pleasure to choose into the order whatsoever foreign prince they should by their votes approve of  here we have two points that offer themselves to our consideration first that the knightscompanions have not the liberty to nominate what foreign prince they please but the same is derivative from the sovereign and only by his permission secondly to weigh the paragraph well that nominare ought to be rendered or understood here by the word eligere and that the power delegated to the knightscompanions from the sovereign was only to nominate not elect for it immediately follows that the knightscompanions went from the chapter to the second vespers and while the divine offices were celebrating the prelate received their nominations and that very evening the lieutenant presented them to the sovereign for her to consider of which had been insignificant and useless if the knightscompanions had been empowered by her license to have made the choice themselves but the contrary is evident for the next morning all the knightscompanions attending the sovereign in chapter she herself confirmed there the election not of any foreign prince but of the earl of sussex and the lord buckhurst  in the other instance anno   car i the sovereign in a chapter held before vespers on st georges day signified it to be his pleasure three stalls being then vacant that out of foreign princes the nomination of whom says the annals in that very place belongs only to the sovereign i e the sovereign has the prerogative to dirct the knightscompanions to name or impose upon them the nomination of such foreign prince he pleaeth they the knightscompanions should pitch upon which must undoubtedly be understood to nominate or enter down into the scrutiny not elect gustavus adolphus king of sweden and henry prince of orange for a little after it is evident when the scrutiny was presented to the sovereign that himself not the knightscompanions made election of them  and it is further manifest by the scrutiny there inserted that both those princes were named by every of the knightscompanions then present according to the sovereigns signification which has been usually done at all other times upon the like occasions but concerning the third person then to be elected the sovereign intending him to be a knightsubject left it entirely to their pleasure to nominate whomsoever they thought worthy of their votes since this time the nominations in like cases have been sufficiently acknowledged by the knightscompanions themselves to be a prerogative belonging solely to the sovereign for to the end they might more expeditiously and clearly show their compliance it was moved in a chapter held at oxford march the  d    car i that it might become a custom for the sovereign to declare beforehand whether he wouldelect any foreign prince and whom that so the knightscompanions might be there to name him in the scrutiny     another consideration in our progress toward the act of election is appertaining to the number qualifications and dignities of the persons nominated which may be more conspicuously resolved from another branch of the beforementioned article viz that every one of the knightscompanions present at the election should nominate for himself nine very sufficient persons whom he should judge free from all reproach and scandal whether subjects to the sovereign or foreigners provided they are known not to favor or abet any party at enmity with him that is to say three earls or others of higher degree three barons and three knights wherein the things chiefly observable we rank under five heads  for the first of these their number every knightcompanion assembled in chapter is enjoined to name nine neither more nor less so also faith king henry vs statutes nor are king henry viiiths any ways dissonant and in this particular the statutes have been hitherto inviolably observed except in one case as to numbers and the mysteries wrapped up in them we shall not further insist upon but why our royal founder selected this particular number above all other unless he had some eye and tacit reflection on the nine worthies or a treble threefold cord and symbol of perfect stability and solid amity the number nine is accounted to signify can with no great facility or certainty be decypherd  as to the second point they ought to be of unspotted character the injunction in the statutes of institution takes order that the persons designed for election should be free from all reproach and of untaintted reputation and according to those of king henry v are to be the best and most sufficient knights and freest from reproach to the same purpose the exemplar in the blackbook such as are fittest and whom they who nominate believe to be free from ignominy and dishonor and to this act of nomination belongs part of the second article in henry viiiths statutes that no knightcompanion should name any person whom he thinks or esteems in his conscience to have upon him any spot of reproach but on the contrary in another place of the same statutes it is provided that they be nominated and proposed out of the number of the most worthy and select knights  how tender the knightscompanions were in pristine times of infringing this particular is proved from a notable passage which happened ann    hen vi at a scrutiny taken the  th of february in the bishop of londons palace where john de foix earl of kendal a gasoigner by birth which makes the example more eminent that a stranger should have so great regard to the honor of the order not being acquainted with the quality and merit of knights and honorable persons amongst us so well and demonstrably as to nominate such whom he was confident were irreprehensible forbore to mention any persons at all and certainly seeing the statutes put very considerable qualifications upon the deputies and proxies made choice for the installation of strangers as elsewhere shown much more cution and regard ought to be used both in the nomination and election of knights into this radiant and illustrious society  the third head the statutes render indifferently capable of being nominated or elected either knights subjects or strangers free princes or their subjects and it was so even at the election upon the first choice where among the twenty five eected knights twenty three of them were subjects and this was the constant custom not only in the remaining part of the founders reign and during those of his three successors but has continued ever since as appears from the scrutinies taken and entered throughout the annals of the order  of those who have gained admission into this noble order by election we shall in the last chapter give an account in a complete catalogue of them and likewise insert the names of such as have missed their election yet are not to be buried in oblivion out of this very respect that by their standing candidates have the fame of being enrolled in the principal register of honor now in the christian world it cannot be supposed we should give a list of all for that were a task too laborious and would prove too numerous but only of those of eminent quality in foreign parts with the era when the

were rendered incapable of nomination who were known to act in contrary interest to the sovereign as the exemplar in the blackbook expresses more copiously such as are not his adversaries or abettors or willing defenders of his adversaries sometimes the knightscompanions being more wary and discreet in nominating them to put either disrespect upon the sovereign or offer violation to the statutes  in the last place concerning the degree rank and dignity of the nine knights proposed to be elected the statutes of the institution set forth that they be first three earls or persons of great dignity secondly three barons and thirdy three knights or as it is in henry vs statutes trois contes ou de greegnear estat trois baner ets and trois batchelers these degrees are to be ranked in three classes and they distinguished by three divisions all including the three degrees aforesaid  whereas all other bodies and exemplars of the statutes make positive mention of earls only yet the statutes of hen viii in this point are more ample by expressing the first class dukes marquesses and earls or persons superior to these in degree wherein the highest dignity is comprehended  we may observe the different title viz banert that henry vs statutes has given us instead of baron and not only in this article but in all other where there is occasion to treat of barons and yet the record intends by it no other than the person it mentions for though a banneret had its denomination a vxillo it usually signified a degree of honor next below a baron both in a later and a modern date yet formerly among our records it is expressedly synonymous to baron as is sufficiently cleared up by our most learned seldom and in this sense is to be taken here and not as a distinct title of lower degree because we observe the bannerets ranked in all scrutinies before king henry viii established his statutes except one with the knightsbatchelors not with barons  the title of the third and lowest rank in this classis in the statutes of their institution are called milites bachalauri and in those of king henry v batchelors and elsewhere bachalauri and bachelauri equites which in common acceptance are the same with milites though thus rendered to evince their difference from knightsbannerets who are of a superior degree of honor and here we may observe that there is no place in a scrutiny for any under the degree of a knightbatchelor and though three of the nine mentioned are set down to be barons and three other earls or of higher degree yet must these six be such as have had conferred on them the order of knighthood else their names are rejected and neither given or taken in nomination for the words of the statute expressly are that each of the knights assembled at the election shall name nine knits  thus king carles i anno   rgni sui designing t invest james marques of hamilton with this order conferrd the honor of knighthood upon him immediately before his nomination and the annals in that place put this commentary remark thereupon because by the statutes it is provided that none should be elected into the order that have not been dignified with the title of knight  yet the cermony of knighting the person designed to be elected was not so strictly regarded but sometimes this branch of the statute was either wholly passed or else confounded with the second article throughout the several bodies of the statutes which prohibits the choice or election of any person into the society as this does the proposal or nomination and thereupon perhaps it was conceived that although the nomination election and sometimes delivery of the ensigns of the order was first dispatched and past yet it was sufficient if the honor of knighthood was conferred afterward as in the cases of william earl of derby and thomas lord burleig anno    eliz where the register obsrves that as soon as their election was over and they ushered into the chapter the earl of derby who it seems had not been knighted before was dubbed knight with a drawn sword according to custom after which they had the garter and george put on by the sovereign her self  in like manner ulrick duke of holstein and henry earl of northampton immediately after their election the last day of st georges feast ann   jac i and before they received the ensigns of the order had the dignity of knighthood conferred on them by the sovereign and in like manner the earl of sussex ann   c i which the redbook of he order recites that as soon as it was undrstood that the earl had not received the order of knighthood before the sovereign immediately drawing his sword knighted him which was not done till after his election and investiture with bth the george and garter  thus did the ceremony of knighthood succeed the election of charles prince of wales the   st of may ann    car i for after h had been elected and invested with the ensigns of the order by the two senior knights the earls of pembroke and montgomery and of arundel and surry were entreated by the rest of the knightscompanions to present his highness to the sovereign in the name of all the rest to be initiated a knightbatchelor he was conducted by the said earls his supporters into the presence chamber in windsorcastle where before the chair of state he most solemnly received the order of knighthood from his father king charles i  to honor which knighthood and the memory thereof four of the chief nobility then present were knighted viz the earls of essex st albans and elgin and viscount grandison being conducted from the great chamber to the sovereigns state each between two batchelorknights  afterward the law in this point began again to be more rightly understood and by that time james duke of york came to be elected which was the  0th of april    car i at the feast of st george celebrated at york the sovereign appointed and accordingly conferred knighthood upon him the day before which he received upon his knees being conducted into the presence chamber between two of the nobility who were also knights the marquess of hertford and viscount grandison in honor and commemoration whereof four other noblemen received the honor of knighthood at that time the earl of carnarvan the lords george d aubignie john stewart and bernard stewart each supported by two knights  and thus prince edward count palatine of the rhine and george duke of buckingham being designed by king charles ii to be admitted into this noble order were both first knighted at st germains in france      and afterward had the ensigns of the order sent unto them by the hands of sir edward walker knight garter who in right of his office invested them therewith  yet in the case of prince rupert who was elected with james duke of york ann    car i his want of knighthood became no impediment because he was a prince in another country viz count palatine of the rhine and duke of avaria and might therefore justly challene a privilege to come within the rule of foreign princes  but the sovereign to arrive as near to the intention and observance of the statute as he could where there was a possibility to do it and the honor would be well accepted by the prince thought it requisite by commission under the great seal of england to empower thomas earl of arundel and surry and george lord goring both being then in holland or either of them to knight the said prince before putting on the garter seeing it could not possibly be done before his election which was intended to be sent by him by the hands of sir john borough garter but death intervening the sovereigns intention was frustrated although the prince upon his coming afterward into england received both the garter and the george from the sovereign himself at nottingham nevertheless without knighthood which o excuse it may well be alleged that the sovereign might not recollect this part of the ceremony it being a time of so great turmoil and fatigue occasioned by the then setting up of his standard  however upon the   th of january      when a decree past in chapter then assembled at oxford that both the duke of york and the prince should enjoy all emoluments and privileges of the order though they were not as yet installed which ceremony was to be completed as soon as windsor was out of the power of the rebels the prince before he received his oath was conducted by the earl of berkshire and duke of richmond and lenox unto the sovereign and had conferred on him the honor of knighthood there being at the same time two of the nobility knighted in memorial of that solemnity the lord henry seymour second son to the marquess of hertford and the lord capell conducted each between two knights     we are now come to speak of the scrutiny it self in reference to which we shall consider by whom it ought or has been usually taken and the manner and form thereof  by the statutes of the institution the collecting the knightscompanions votes and entering them in the scrutiny solely appertains to the prelate of the order and upon him is this office devolved not only by the other bodies of the statutes but by the constitutions of his post and the obligation of his oath whose right we find duly asserted upon this persons taking a scrutiny anno    eliz  the statutes likewise provided that if the prelate was at any time absent then the dean of windsor or the register or the senior residentiary of the college or the secretary or scribe of the order should undertake the employment and elsewhere it is mentioned expressly in the absence of the prelate whose particular duty otherwise it was and among the various examples enrolled in the annals of the order these examples abundantly confirm it the prelate of the order collected the suffrages from the knightscompanions anno   hen v when john earlmarshal and four other knights were elected the like did henry beaufort lordcardinal prelate of the order upon the election of john king of portugal anno    hen vi and when the duke of suffolk was chose anno    hen vi the prelate then also gathered the suffrages which he likewise did upon the feasts of st george celebrated in the   th   th   th   th   th  0th   th   th and   th years of queen elzabeths reign sometimes the scrutinies have been gathered both by the dean of windsor and the register of the order jointly as we find by the election of john lord talbot ann   hen vi of sir john falstaff ann   hen vi and the duke of quinbery ann   hen vi all received at the feasts of st georg celebrated at windsor  it is more than a bare conjecture tha the dean at those times received the votes from the knightscompanions on the sovereigns side while the register collected those on the princes for it is observed that in king henry vths reign in posts of different nature one whereof was to signify the sovereigns pleasure to the knightscompanions about their paying due reverence first to god and afterward to himself and the other in a ceremonia which directs the manner and order of mulcting the knightscompanions in both which the dean performed the service on the right hand the choir the sovereigns side and the register on the left  sometimes the register of the order took them alone as at the election of john earl of arundel anno  0 hen vi and those of the earl of morteyn and sir john gray ann    hen vi moreover it is plain that when the office of register was not filled and thomas ruthall bishop of duresme executed it during its vacancy the bishop himself ann   hen viii collected the suffrages the like did william day dean of windsor in the absence of george carew dean of the chapel and register of the order at the feasts of st george held at whitehall anno    and    eliz  this duty was executed by the register from the   th year of king henry viii to the period of his and his sons reign as the blackbook of the order fully evinces as also on st georges day ann   eliz by john boxhall and at the feast of st george held ann   jac i by giles thompson who in the several times were registers yet we must not mistake that what they officiated was on their own behalf but supplied the place of the prelate  in the beginning of queen marys reign we find the chancellor of the order began to perform this service being by king henry viiiths statutes adjoined to those other offices before described to collect the scrutinies in absence of the prelate and thereby made capble of the employment which afterward is tacitly remarked to be performed as if in hi own right when the register has only effected it in the chancellors absence though in reality it was no other than as in the instance of the bishop of duresme and dr day aforesaid who took the scrutiny in the vacancy of the office and absence of the register  anno   eliz the register in the absence of the chancellor who was sick upon the feast day of st gorge collected the suffrages and ann   eliz gorge carew then register of the order took the votes of the knightscompanions in absence of sir william petre chancellor of the order so also ann   jac i where the cause of the chncellors absence is noted to be sickness and ann   jac i to be death  in the first of these instances we find the prelate expressly set down to be there in the two following his presence is employed for it is said that the fourofficers o the order did attend both feasts whereof the chancellor being wanting the prelate must needs be one  now all these passages seem to relate to the right of the chancellors rather than the prelates by this remark that every of the scrutinies were taken in the absence of the chancellor which looks something like a cautionary remark that denoted the right of execuing this office to the chancellor rather than the prelate  when a deputychancellor has been admitted to officiate in the chancellors absence he and not the prelate has taken the scrutiny though present as at the election of charles prince of wales the  0th of may    car i and at another taken the   d of may following and the same when the suffrages were collected for the election of the duke of york and prince rupert at york anno    car i  but there is one passage more upon taking a scrutiny anno    jac i which seems advantageous to the chancellor in this point where it is said that when the knightscompanions had given their votes as say the annals the chancellor who according to his office was to receive them presented them to the sovereign howbeit in truth there is no sufficient foundation for the register to insert this as done by the chancellor by virtue of his office or any one act or chapter that has suspended or made void the right of the prelate which is reserved by him even by the patent for erecting the office of chancellor especially in those affairs which respecting the order ought by the statute of the institution to appertain to him but since the stated time of performing this ceremony in the chapel the prelate if present is presumed to be officiing at the altar in discharge of another part of his duty upon this consideration has the service been then imposed upon the chancellor and others  lastly we find the scrutiny to be oce taken by garter ann    car i at the election of thomas eal of strafford but this was at a time when not only the prelate but all the other officers of the order excepting sir john borough garter were absent and consequently this service so executed ought rather to be judged to have been done in the prelates than chancellors right     but whosoever gathered the suffrages the time when they entered upon this duty in the intervals of feasts where the occasion required a peculiar chapter for an election was usually after the chapter had been opened and the matter of election proposed by the sovereign after which he proceeded with all possible reverence and respect  howbeit upon an extraordinary occasion in the interval of the grand feasts the sovereign has sometimes called an assembly of the knights companions to be convened at the castle of windsor who in the choire of st georges chapel not chapter house after the more solemn manner have delivered in their nominations and returning thence into the chapter house he there continued the election thus did king henry viii upon the  th of june in the   th year of his reign in reference to the election of the lord henry fitz roy so styled in the scrutiny and ranked among the barons for as yet he was not created duke of somerset and richmond and ralph nevil earl of westmorland  on the  0th of may anno    car i being trinitysunday the sovereign caused a chapter to be held that afternoon in the chapter house at windsor for the nomination and election of charles prince of wales at the breaking up whereof the sovereign and knightscompanions proceeded immediately to st georgess chapel where at eveningprayer which was not within the compass of the feast for that began not till next day the scrutiny was taken  and besides those examples which show the nominations have been collected upon peculiar occasions in the choire at windsor there are one or two instances they have been also taken in the chapel at whitehall as on the   th of may ann   car i at the choice of edmund earl of dorst henry earl of holland and thomas viscount andover as on the  th of july the same year whereat the duke of chevereux was pitched upon  the suffrages have commonly been collected at the second vespers or in the time of eveningprayer on st georges day or on that day whereon the feast of st george has been celebrated by prorogation and with this distinction of time the taking of diverse scrutinies are marked  however there occurs one scrutiny gathered in the chapter house at windsor on the eve of the grandfeast at which the person immediately elected was sent for in and had the ensigns of the order conferred upon him when immediately the sovereign made his progression to the chapel and after some small interval the elect proceeded to his installation and this was the case of james marquess hamilton ann   car i who lying under an obligation to commence his voyage next morning toward germany whither he had the commission of general of  000 foot in assistance of the king of sweden occasioned this his sovereigns indulgence and quick dispatch  when the scrutiny first began to be collected in the chapel is treated of somewhat general and indefinite ann             eliz it was during the time of eveningprayer and in like manner ann   jac i and    car i and when the feast of st george was solemnized at whitehall the   th of april    car i the annals say that the sovereign recreated himself with the melody of evensong during which the chancellor collected the votes of the knightscompanions  but in some other places the time when this matter was transacted is restricted to a precise time or some particular part of evening prayer as anno    and    eliz whilst the choire sung the service and the like anno    jac i but   car i while the anthem was sung after the second lesson but more frequently after the first lesson as in the   and   car i while the anthem was singing or whilst they were hymning the anthem of the blessed virgin called the magnificat and which is all one with that anno    car i viz as soon as the first lesson was read or at the first lesson which is remembered to be the usual part of the service in which the nomination ought to begin    0 the manner of the order the knightcompanions votes ought to be collected when the scrutiny is taken in the choir when the register informs us upon the celebration of st georgess feast at greenwich    hn viii as entered into the black book that he used his diligence in going to and fro from one side to the other to demand and redemand the suffrages from the knightscompanions according to the variety and disposition of their stalls which same methods in eisdem terminis the chancellor observed anno    eliz and without question was generally performed at other seasons for the annals describe it to be performed de more   eliz or juxta ordines constitutionis anno    eliz  that the officer who collects the scrutiny is obliged to begin at the youngest knightcompanion and so proceed upward toward the eldest is evident from the order mentioned to be in vogue an   and  0 eliz as also    car i but to give a more particular account of this ceremony as it stood temp car i and doubtles long before though not recorded in script is as follows  first the officer arose and went into the middle of the choire directly over against his own seat he made two reverences first toward the high altar and next to the sovereign then he proceeded up to the choire near the hault pace against the stall of the junior knightcompanion and there made like reverence this done he went up to the stall of the said junior knight and with a singular reverence to him only demanded whom he pleased to nominate which having taken making to him a second reverence he descended into the choire and thence passed to the next senior knight on the other side unless by reason of the vacancy of the stall he sits on the same side with the junior and having received his nomination from the second knightcompanion he again crossed the choire to the third and in like mannner he ascended according to he seniority of the knightscompanions present always crossing the choire where there was occasion ntil he arrived at the senior knihtcompanion and having thus received all their nominations he returned into the middle of the choire and after accustomed reverences took his seat  this method in collecting the votes as to the general and in the choire ought likewise to be observed when they are taken from the knightscompanions in chapter they being ranked in due order on either side of the table according to the seniority of their elections and situations of stalls in the choire the officer beginning with the junior and thence gradually ascending to the senior knight  and that we may rightly apprehend after what form every knightcompanion ranketh the names of those persons he proposes and how each classis is distinguished and divided the following scrutiny will manifest which was taken off may anno    hen vi upon the vacancy of one stall happening by the death of sir henry tanke clux a german and the first scrutiny found marshalled among the annals of this most noble order  nominabant principes barons equites dux exoniae duc norfolciae dom lovell dom

own name perixt to those persons for whom he condescends his vote to the intent it may appear by whom the knights candidates are nominated and these are ranked in three several divisions  the first contains the degrees of earls marquesses dukes princes kings and emperors yet at a scrutiny taken anno    hen vi in a chapter held at brainford albro vasquez dalmadea who immediately following is styled comes averentiae is by a mistake ranked but in the second division among the barons and twice among the knights votes of the marquess of suffolk and earl of shrewsbury but this error perhaps owes its original for want of due knowledge either of the law in the statutes or his degree the latter of which is the most feasible to conjecture for being a stranger his title might not be so generally divulged nor is it taken notice of in the scrutiny it self though in the annals immediately after it was rectified  and to show the probability of this point the earls of oxford devonshire and arundel whose degrees were sufficiently known at a scrutiny taken anno    hen vi are ranked in the second division among the barons and anno   hen viii the earl of darby is three times so placed and again    hen vi the earl of devonshire twice but this happened not through oversight or neglect of the statutes but because at these nominations wherein they are so ranked the first division to which they appertained happened to be filled up with those other higher dignities belonging to the same class viz kings or dukes as when the beforementioned earls of oxford devonshire and arundel were set down in the place of barons the king of portugal the dukes of warwick and norfolk were put in the class of princes and so it happened in many other instances  on the contrary anno    and    eliz iv the lord rich gray one of the queens sons by her former husband sir john gray of groby knight in respect of his alliance to the royal family is ranked in the first division among the princes under the title dominus richardus filius regnae and afterward anno    edw iv set only among the barons as well with the former title as this richardus dominus gray but anno    edw iv he is thrice registered among the princes and as often with the barons whence it is observable that to be enrolled in the rank of princes may be afforded of courtesy to persons of high eminency and blood but then as they can lay no claim to it by their merit so such of the knightscompanions as rank them lower suffer no diminution in their honor  wherein the second division are ranked the barons and viscounts for viscounts in all scrutinies after the first erection of that dignity were on the same level with the barons until the   of jac i excepting only john dudley viscount lisle anno    hen viii who by every knight the duke of norfolk excepted is ranked in the first division of princes and in a scrutiny then taken robt cecil viscount craneborne is the second viscount in the list that has been ranked with princes whence it became the frequent practice in succeeding scrutinies until anno    car i and then upon a question put in chapter convened at westminster    may    car i whether earls sons and viscounts were eligible with barons it passed in the affirmative and that by general usage except in the two cases just mentioned and about the same time we find it reiterated near that time for in two scrutinies taken the   th and   st of that instant may the viscounts are therein reduced to the second division and ranked with the barons  the knightsbatchelors and bannerets held the same rank in king hen viiis statutes in all scrutinies with barons  but though the word in king hen viiiths late statutes is baronettus instead of banerettus yet is this frequently obvious in some ancient books and records as well as in those ancient writers long before the title of baronet was conceived or brought into use  in the last place he who demands those suffrages the knightscompanions present is by the statutes of institution to receive them in writing for in a scrutiny taken anno   hen vi at the election of john lord talbote and turnival the dean of windsor and the register of the order wrote down the votes and nominations of every singular knight present at the day of election  and at another scrutiny anno   hen vi to fill up that which by an error in the black book is set down sir henry fitzhugh it is inserted that the dean and register wrote down in order according to their seniority the votes of the knightscompanions and after the scrutinies began to be entered in the annals it is evident the general practice kept pace with the injunction of the statutes only there are two instances of an election confirmed without taking a scrutiny in writing one in the case of the princes henry and christiern iv king of denmark where the knightscompanions in a chapter convened at whitehall    of july   jac i gavein their votes viva voce and immediately the sovereign admitted them both into the illustrious society the other was the case of james marquis hamiton elected the  d of feb  0 jac i with the vocal consent of all the knightscompanions  it is worthy observation that this method and the omission of taking the scrutiny in writing is not only contrary to the law of the order expressly set down for a more stable consignation of the action and more faithful transmission of it to poterity but exceeding prejudicial to persons of honor and distinction whose names would otherwise survive with great veneration among the candidates of this illustrious order and of which honor many deserving persons will be hereafter deprived if the injunctions of the statutes be not observed in this particular respect  sect xi the presentation of it to the sovereign the knightscompanions having delivered their suffrages the officer by whom they are collected humbly presents to the sovereign the nominations for so it is recorded the prelate of the order acted in the  th of hen the vth if these votes were taken in chapter the paper usually was immediately presented to the sovereign who made his election before the chapter broke up but if gathered in the chapel though it was given to the sovereign yet the choice was not made then but the morning after and this was the manner in the  d and  th years of queen eliz another time it has not been presented till the vespers were finished but in the practice of latter days the scrutiny has not been given up to the sovereign till the next day at the opening of the chapel before morningprayer as in the        0  0 years of queen eliz demonstrates and was the accustomed practice of the   th year of king charles the first of ever sacred memory the last presentation was transcribed in a little book and with all due reverence offered upon the knee before any other affair was transacted in the chapter  this has been the general use as we are ascertained anno   hen vi the dean of windsor and the register of the order having collected the vote of every knight they were immediately given into the hands of the sovereigns deputy and in the same nature were they presented on the  th hen vi when john duke of bedford was lieutenant in the  0th of queen eliz when the suffrages were collected by sir franc walsingham the chancellor he gave them up to the earl of sussex then lieutenant to the sovereign  but it is evident from several passages in the blue book of the order that the lieutenant afterward delivered them to the sovereign as is apparent from the records of the  0th   th   th and the  0th year of queen eliz  in the   th year of k james i some exceptions arose upon the chancellors not presenting the scrutiny to the prince who at that time was the sovereigns lieutenant but to the sovereign himself which was an error he fell into as well as some of his predecessors as the  d  d and   th of eliz demonstrate  the sovereigns considerations upon the qualifications of those to be elected     as the knightscompanions are under an obligation by the statutes to nominate no person but who can bear the test of the aforementioned qualifications there is a standard of honor provided for the sovereign to measure the extraction quality and merit of the person proposed to be elected least it might chance through the indulgence of the sovereign this fountain of honor might be mudded by the choice of inferior and undeserving persons for the statutes run  because this order consists of goodness and honorable virtue does not admit unworthiness and villainy and so by consequence secludes all persons of mean exraction and merit  the qualifications for election are exhibited in the  d article as in the   th are included those of nomination the words of the institution are that none shall be elected into the order and refer only to the act of election for if we consult the rest of the statutes and compare them with this passage they run according to this tenor that none shall be elected and chosen a companion of this order these refer more principally to the time of the election and not to the investiture with garter and george and installation from the expressions of admitting and receiving knights into this order as the examplars of the statutes of institution set forth and this is farther illustrated from another passage in the  d article of henry the viiis statutes where the word reproach is mentioned aith the guilt thereof so incapacitates a mans election that for the future it is a bar and utterly disqualifies im for that honor  there are two points requisite for qualifications and endowments first to be a gentleman of blood and  dly a knight without reproach by the statutes of henry the  institutions no man ought to be elected unless e be a gentleman born the examplar in the black bok says unless he be worthy upon the account of birth and arms and in another passage that he be one eminent for his demeanor and good report which intimates the conjunction of blood and virtue which make up the noblest composition the statutes of king henry viii are more extensive than those and say he must be a gentleman by name arms and blood and least this character might seem intricate and perplexed a gentleman of blood is defined to be one descended of three descents of nobles viz of name and arms both by his father and mothers side  it is certain gentility does not receive its perfection in the person it was first devolved on but is rather completed by succession for among the romans though the father was freeborn and of the equestrian cense yet it was farther requisite that the grandfather should be the same or else they could not obtain the ring one of the symbols of the equestrian order as pliny informs us gentility has its beginning in the grandfather its increase in the father and full ripeness in the son and consequently in the constitution of gentility the father and grandfather conveying a luster to the son make it entire and complete for its incongruous to suppose a ripeness in the son unless there had been a former increase in the father and a longer series from the grandfather  the memorable instance of the lord william paget who was divested of the garter five years after his election upon pretense of his not being a gentleman of blood by either father or mother proceeded not wholly from the defect in point of extraction as haward relates but rather from the prevalence and practice of john dudley duke of nrthumberland by whose means he was most unjustly deprived of the garter repenting perhaps at the great honors he had done this lord by his a character of him to king edward vi when he procured him a new grant of those arms under the great seal of england when he was earl marshal which he had some time before received from the garter principal king of arms  but admit the defect of blood and arms for three dscents were the true cause of the recaling his gate that it might be conferred upon the earl of warwick eldest son of the said duke who out of courtesy is called so in which relation both haward and stow have mistaken for they were bestowed upon sir andrew dudley brother to the duke for though he was put in the scrutiny entered among the annals of edward vi in the sixth year of his reign upon s georges day yet was the earl neither then nor at any other time elected  the ensigns of this most noble order as soon as queen may ascended the throne were with as much honor restored to the lord paget and with as great and absolute an authority as they were disgracefully taken from him and in confirmation of this lords restoration he had the garter buckled on his leg and the collar and the oder put about his shoulders with the george depending by two of the knightscompanions present and the garer king at arms was ordered that he should take care his achievements should be replaced over his stall at windsor which is the  th on the sovereigns side it is observable that the very records of the order brand his degradation as injustice as if it were inferabe that when honor is conferred upon the account of virtue and exquisite endowments the consideration of these supplies the defect and obscurity of extraction the sovereign whose prerogative it was to declare and interpret the statutes being present in chapter thought t to qualify the law and gave him this honorable commendation that he had highly deserved of the nation by his prudence and counsel  and though there is only inserted in the examplar of the black book virtue and good report for a qualification yet the same was observed by the sovereigns and lieutenants in foregoing time with great circumspection and that the magnanimity fortitude prudence generosity fam reputation and other virtues and excellencies wheter innate or acquired of the person proposed to election have by prudent inquisition been inspected and brought to the tochstone before they have been admitted into so oble and illustrious a body  those qualities were chiefly considered and esteemed y henry v for which reason at an election in the th year of his reign he gave the preference before ther tha were nominated and presented unto him to john earl marshal william earl of suffolk john lord clifford sir lewis rbertsack and sir here tank clux  humphry duke of gloucester deputy to k hen vi tod in the same steps and did weigh by the strict rules of fortitude and prudence the gallant and noble actions and deserts of john lord talbt before the election and gave in an approation worthy of his own judgment and that candidates merit and for this reason it is expressed in the annals of the order that such noble and hroick qualifications should have the favor of election preferrable to others as is evident in the matter of choic of sir nicholas carew in the   th of hen viii that he was a very fit person upon the eminency of his extraction and fame and the many noble and worthy actions he ad perfomed so as that all present did without any delay unanimously approve of his election and after this tenure run the commendation of henry earl of cumberland a his election vi the many famous and loyal achievements performd by im both at several other times and then mre especially when the tumult of rebellion began to beak forth in those borders where he had his habitation  the  d point to treat on is that no one is qualified for election unless he be a knight or as it is expressed in one of the examplars in the hatton library unless girded with the unstained girdle of knighthood so singular a egard the law of the order hah to this particular qualification above the rest and least chance or inadvertency might let slip a person not knighted into the scrutiny were the words inserted ut minimum that he be at least a knight before he be elected when the sovereign come to make his choice it is evident from the  d article in the statutes that it has long since received this constrution as apears by an eminent instane in the   th of hen viii the feast of st george bing clbrated at greenwich and the sovereign being present having elected the lord roos afterward earl of rutland into the society of this most nble order and being advertised on the morrow after s goges day while the mass of requiem was celebrating that he had not before received the dignity of knighthood accrding to the statutes which psitively enjin that whosoever is eleced into this s ciet should be in degree at least  knight that is actually knighted beforehand and though the lord ros wa at the time of his election a baron of this realm which is a higher degree of honor than a knight the sovereign after mass reassembled the knightscompanios and annulled the election and commanded the garter and gerge so lately conferred to be taken off and in the same place dubbed him a knight and then he was elected again with an unanimous consent and so declaed by the soveregns own mouth and was restored to his ensigns and ornaments by the dukes of nofolk and suffolk agreeable to this it is recorded in the red book of the order that none of the english scotch or welsh nation how considerable soever otherwise in the prerogative of blood r virtue can be elected into this most honorable society but that he ought to be first ennobed and rendered capable by this first dgree of knightly honor  but this law does not bind foreign princes for by a decree at witehall in    charles i these words ut minimum are explained to relate to all subjects of what degree oever within the sovereigns dominions but foreign princes ought not t e knighted as the basis and first degree of chivalry the statutes of institution as to those beforementioned not only enjoin them to be knights but to be fre of all infamy and reproach in hy vs statutes it stands chivalier sans reproach which answers in the latin eques ireprehensus and the argument used by the duke of bedford for prmoting the election of sir john radliff was that he had contined and exercised the armies the space of twenty eight years without reproach king henry viii determined this word reproach ino three species first when a kigt th been convicted of heresy against the catholic faith or suffered any public punishment for such offense hee heresy is reckoned among those dfects that deprive men of honor because it bends its force against the catholic church which not only renders a man in the balance of honor of no weight and esteem but more than all other sin makes him infamus and therefore when by tngue pen or actions a man endeavors to rample under foot the sacred law he scandalizeth government and educeth others  the second point is when any knight has been arraigned cnviced and attainted of treason howeer q elizbeth qualified this poin by a decree made n the first year of her reign that in case any persons so convicted were pardoned by the sovereign and restored in blood every such gentleman in name arms and blood and descended as aforesaid being otherwise qualified according to the ancient statutes of the order should e thenceforth accounted eligible and might be chosen a companion this decree it is presumed owes its original upon the occasion of restoring in blood william marquess of northampton and the lord robert dudley after earl of licester who had been attainted of high treason in the first of q may and we find that in the next feast of st george they recovered their privileges of honor and were preferred in nomination and on the last day of the feast were elected into this most illustrious society  though the marquess of northampton had been formrly elected in the    h   and was restored in blood as i said before it is very remarkable that it was thought it to descend to a new nomination and election as appears from the decree it self as it was performed upon the third of june anno primo eliz  the last point of reproach is where a knight companion has fled from battle in which the sovereign or his lieutenant or other captain having the kings authority were present when banners were displayed and both sides proceed to fight now for a person to behave himself cowardly in the fight abandon his colurs leave his prince friends and companions in hazard of life are undoubtedly concerns of a very high and reproachful nature and draw down dishonor upon the order the sovereign and knights companions and a sufficient indication of a pusilanimous mind that prefers to drag an infamous life and makes his honor a sacrifice to a reproachful safety for the resolution of a right martial spirit ought either to return decked with victory or die upon the bed of honor  by the laws of king edward the confessor the soldier that runs from his colors either in land or sea service his life and estate were made liable to answer the oence and our acts of parliaments have made it felony without benefit of clergy for as much as such desertion endangers the estate of the king nobility and cmmonwealth  but the danger is of a far more dismal hue when officers or he that commands in chief or who has any post of trust assigned him either quit it or is found defective in his duty as was thomas earl of lancster who quitted the army at the siege of berwick the consequence of which proved an abortion to the whole design and for which he was roclaimed traitor anno    e   and therefore whoever is culpable of any of these three poins of reproach is disqualified from being elected into ths most noble order before we proceed any farther it may not be improper to take notice of an error which polydore virgil has interwove with one and which erhardus celius in his history of england has copyed from that author but refuted by the learned pen of dr heylein viz that the knightscompanions have certain laws belonging to their order whereby they are obliged to help ne anoter and in time of battle never to betake themselves to shameful flight the statute law of the order is silent upon the first clause nor is the latter otherwise to be taken than one of those points of reproach spoke of in the second statute of k henry viii which nlls the election of the person nominated if he be pccant in that point now that which gives some umbrage to the knights mutual assistance and deence is founded upon an article in their statutes which prohibits the arming themselves one against another to create a mutual affection and to extinguish feuds which is the life and soul of society and which the founder to prevent inconveniences had a great regard to and therefore he ordained which has been confirmed since by other statutes that none of the knightscompanions should arm themselves against any of their fellows unless either in the cause of his sovereign or his own just quarrel and this clause it was that gave the handle to both paties that sided with the houses of york and lancaster some firmly adhering to henry vi whom they accounted svereign of the order and others taking part wih edwad iv as esteeming him sovereign de jure though not de facto  but more firmly to tie this knot of amity among this noble faternity least they should unhappily egage in factions one against another and proceed so violently as mg t commene into actions of blood and slaughter it was ordained that if a knightcompanion should happen to be retaned in the service of a foreign prince to take up arms in his quarrel and after his adversary desired to entertain another knightcompanion on his side also he that was last invited was bound to wave ths offer and in no wie to give his consent and upon ths the knightcompanions were obliged to make special precautions in that their engagements that if any of his fellows were retained on the other side and that if he knew not that another of his fellows had been engaged with the adversary so soon as it came to his knowledge he was obliged to relinquish the service he before had undertaken  t these three points of reproach we have set down we find in a manuscript that belonged to heny gey third muquis of suffolk a fourh added to these other three points of reproach in these words  that if any knight of the order from henceforth by prodigality or riot wilfully or negligently dispend sell alens or do away his patrimony or livelihood by reason whereof he shall not be able honorably to maintain himself and his estate in such hnourable manner as may conserve the honor of the said order and of himself in this case he shall be summoned by the usher of arms of the order called the black rod by commandment of the sovereign his lieutenant or deputy to appear before his majesty or his commissioners and the knights of the order at the next chapter ensuing there to be examind before the sovereign or his said commisioners and the knights and companions of the said order and if he be found in such great default of prodigality insolent riot or wilfl negligence that then the sovraign with the advice of the company of the said order may deprive and degrade him of the said order at the said chapter if it be their pleasure  though this fourth point is not inserted into king henry viiis statutes yet the substance thereof seems to be approved of before for we find among some orders prepared by the marquess of exeter and other knightscompanions at a chapter at windsor the twenty fifh and twenty sixth days of may anno   henry viii one of them was something to this purpose      amongst the number of these candidates the sovereign is chiefly to regard those who have most voices or whom he conceives most requisite to contribute to the honor of the garter and most beneficial to himself and of most advantage to his crown and kingdom we find the law has not always reserved the greatest number of voices as will appear from the annals yet it has sometimes confirmed the election as in the case of the duke of queenberry an   henry vi where after a due and sufficient examination taken of the scrutiny the duke by the consent of most voices was eected into the stall of thomas duke of exeter and so was the election of sir nicholas carew the twenty fourth of april in the    henry viii  it is remarkable in a singular instance that when two knights had on either side equal voices which was the case of sir john fastolf and sir john radcliff the first being esteemed more worthy by the sovereigns lieutenant obtained the election  the second inducement relates to such as in all appearance may bring most renown to the order and advance it to a higher pitch of greatness and these have in a great measure been effected by enrolling foreign princes into this illustrious society whose valor and great merit have proclaimed them deserving both of nmination and election and upon this consideration k clarles i of blessed memory upon consideration had of the gloious achievements and high renown of gustavus adolphus king of sweden judged it a part of his respect not only to render him all offices of kindness and friendship as to a prince nearly allied and his most special friend but also to impart to him as far as in him lay the greatest and highest honor that might be and especially such wherewith the military virtue of so great a captain was wont to be adorned  but the principal motive thought requisite to elect foreign princes into this society of honor has been expressed in the commissions of legations to be in respect of their glorious merits ennobled by the luster and grace of their heroic virtues their eminent nobleness grandeur prowess and magnificence the renown of which fame ad divulged and spread abroad throughout the world  where the advantage of the sovereigns service was thrown into the balance no consideration could outvie its pretensions as in   h   justifies whose eminent service for his king and country was the sole motive that crowned his election and the great zeal and affection which john jaspar ferdinand de marchin showed for the cau se and service and the recovery of the just rights of king charles ii was the strongest inducement that swayed that sovereign to choose him in the tenth year of his reign a knightcompanion of this most noble order but the last inducement is of the greatest latitude for the sovereign has a power to reject whosoever he pleases though they do exceed in multiplicity of voices and in other qualifications and even to elect a person that is but once mentioned as was shown in the person of casimire the fourth king of poland an    henr vi who having only the single vote of the lord scales yet upon respect to the sovereign how advantageous he might be for his and his kingdoms interest obtained the election  and of later date as the preambles for the carrying the ensigns to foreign princes set forth the advantages the sovereign has conceived to possess himself of in the improving confirming and establishing of a most strict and inviolable bond of friendship and fair correspondence between him and foreign princes their realms and subjects has been a grand inducement to elect such princes into this most noble order     upon the vacancy of any of the knightscompanions stalls the election of others to supply those is a prerogative of the sovereign and in some cases to his lieutenant for it is recorded in the black book of the order in henry viiis statutes that if any stalls fall vacant it should belong to the sovereign to elect new knights wheresoever he was resident upon condition the chapter consisted of six complete knightscompanions but if he chanced to be out of his realms and the number was deficient and that his lieutenant held the feast of st george at windsor in such a case the election belongs to the lieutenant who is first to be certified of his sovereigns pleasure and what esteem he has for the candidates to the intent such information may guide or direct his election  this power of election is fully acknowledged by the knightscompanions themselves to be in the sovereign as the fragment of a letter demonstrates sent from the chapter convened at windsor upon the feast of st george to henry v then in france viz that the sovereign in what place soever residing may as is most fitting elect into a vacant stall there being a sufficient number of knights called to this election such as he shall judge serviceable to his crown or do exceed others in deserts and nobleness of descent and at publishing the election of duke emanuel of savoy in the reign of philip and mary who were joint sovereigns of the order it is styled the election of the king and the queen  this grand prerogative of the sovereign being not duly weighed by polydore virgil occasioned his tripping in this affa and drew in claudius coteraeus into the same palpable mistake for writing of this order and the succession of new knights reports in his history of england that one knight is received in the room of another deceased by the choice and election of all the rest and erhard celly in his anglowirtemb does as falsely affirm that no person may be received into this order not so much as by the sovereign unless with the common consent and suffrage of all the knightscompanions  but these passages are altogether erroneous the knightscompanions only nominate the persons but the right of election remains solely in the sovereign of the order for whosoever is honored with his choice is immediately admited and pronouncing barely the name of the person in chapter constitutes the election after the scrutiny has been taken and presented to the sovereign he peruseth it himself or the chancellor or some other officer of the order that gathered it reads it over to him afterward the sovereign resolves forthwith upon some one or more of the knights contained in the scrutiny and then publicly declares the name of him or them he does elect and by the bare act of his pronunciation they commence elected knights except now and then the sovereign is pleased to give his reasons why the knight is elected by him  but though this act of election be solely in the sovereign yet the consent of the knightscompanions is frequently recorded in the annals and sometimes mentioned in the commissions of legations to foreign princes not that the single act of election is in truth the act of the whole chapter or is made invalid withot the joint consent of the knightscompanions present at the election but their consent so expressed is to be taken as an honorary respect given them by the register intimating rather an applause or commendation of their sovereigns choice as being in their opinions just and right according to the merit of the elected than a material circumstance tending to the ratification of the election made by the sovereign as if defective without it      among other duties incumbent on the register and expressed in the statutes of the order this is one that the register s office is to set down and record for a memorial the elections or scrutinies and names of the knights elected but in succeeding times a scruple arose if this was not needless when the scrutiny should be taken yet no election made to clear up which doubt in a chapter held in   elizabeth on st georges day it is recorded as the sovereigns will and pleasure that thenceforward it should be enacted and received as the sanction of a law within this order that if any nominations were taken from the knightscompanions the same should be entered into the annals though there were no election made of any person into the order at that time which we presume was so decreed out of great deference to those princes and noble personages who in descending times should by the glory of their exploits appear but worthy of a bare nomination into so resplendent and illustrious an order and in pursuance of this decree there is frequent mention made of the delivery of the scrutiny into the hands of the register in order to be recorded  the blue book says anno    elizabeth that the chancellor himself delivered the knightscompanions votes to the register to be committed to writing for a perpetual memorial and accordingly the register as his duty obliged him transcribed them and put them in their proper place with all care and fidelity anno    of the same queen it is said the votes were delivered to the register who took care to record them according to usual order yet maugre this law the entry of scrutinies has been sometimes omitted either by the registers forgetfulness of the decre or some accidental miscarriages in some places of the annals in the room of scrutinies we find excuses entered as it is said anno    elizabeth that the prelate immediately after vespers presented the scrutiny to the sovereign but because there was no election made of any new knights in regard of hurry or weighty and pressing affairs it was laid aside and through neglect lost or at least came not into the registers hands to be inserted in its proper place and when the dean of windsor collected the scrutiny at vespers anno    elizabeth it is said no election was made nor any thing else done the like excuse is made anno   charles i but the fault is thrown upon the chancellor for though the scrutiny had been taken by him during the vesper of the feast day yet would he not suffer it to be entered in some places we find anno    elizabeth the votes being presented they were left with her and anno    charles i the scruny of agernoon earl of northumberland never came to the registers hands  but the law yet remains in force that all nominations and votes of the knightscompanions ought to be entered among the annals whether election be made or not unless it shall please the sovereign upon some emergency to forbid it as appears but by one example of such a prohibition viz anno  0 eliz where by the queens special command the scrutiny then taken was not recorded among the acts of this most noble order but then it is dclared that the register took care to set down all the passages as they happned the nams only excepted and why the scrutiny is not inserted in the registry an    of eliz gives this account that upon assembling the knightscompanions it seemed good to the sovereign for several urgent reasons best known to her self to give commandment that for that time they would wholly forbear all scrutiny of votes and nominations of persons except which there was nothing wanting to heighten the solemnity of that assembly but this in the annals is said to be praeter morem contrary to the usual custom     anno    of eliz there is a remarkable occurrence not to be passed over for the earls of rutland and derby the morrow after st georges day were desirous to have seen the scrutiny which was committed into the custody of the dean of windsor to be registered in pursuance of the beforementioned decree anno   eliz but he returned a modest denial and said it ought not to be seen before it was registered the earls not satisfied with this answer requested the opinions of the knightscompanions present at the feast on this affair who upon mature deliberation adjudged the point against them and since it has been a standing rule that no knightcompanion ought to see whom the other has named     it has chanced that though the nominations for election have been received presented and perused yet the sovereign has thought expedient to defer it upon several considerations and principally where an intent was to keep an open stall but we must understand this of such scrutinies as are taken of course at the vespers on the feast day  and the most memorable example of this kind is that of the emperor sigismond who expired in the   th year of k henry vi whose stall was reserved twenty one years and then determined that prince edward the sovereigns only son should fill it up being at that time about six years of age this is the first emperor whose election we find registered in the annals being abcu the  th of may in the  th year of henry v styled sigismundus imperator almanicus  and keeping a vacant stall was sometimes given as a reason by the sovereign for his deferring an election as is plain from an    car i when the scrutiny taken the day before was read over in the chapter house the sovereign declared that he would receive no man into the order before his son charles whereupon all the knightscompanions gave their opinions that this resolution was rather the effect of justice than fatherly indulgence since they all acknowledged him to be more a prince by merit and towardliness of his youth than by the fortune of his birth at which the sovereign expressed his satisfaction no otherwise than by silence  and in like manner anno    charles i when the chancellor of the order gave up the scrutiny to the sovereign he declared  that he had a purpose to have chosen prince rupert his nephew a knight of the order but being then a prisoner with the emperor he would not elect any at that time whereupon a vacancy of a stall was reserved it has sometimes been the sovereigns pleasure to defer elections without expressing the cause as in the    of elizabeth though she perused the scrutiny in chapter yet the blue book informs us that the said sovereign made no election though two stalls were vacant thus was it in the        and    of k james i where no other mention is made than this none were admitted into the order this year  sometimes we find these prorogations f elections recorded as solely done by the will of the sovereign and at other times by the sovereign and the approbation of the knightscompanions to the first of these we find a memorial in the    of elizabeth on the    of april that the knightscompanions had a message sent to their chapter held before morningprayer that it was the pleasure of the sovereign to prorgue the election to the following year and so it was in the  0th of charles i though the nomination was taken by the chancellor and presented to the sovereign in chapter the sovereign did not think fit to make any election at all and for a testmony of the second we meet with this instance in the   th of elizabeth that with the concurrent approbation and assent of all the knightscompanions then assisting the sovereign thoght fit to put off the election to another time as to the seeming difference of the sovereigns absolute authority and yet the knightscompanions approbation we have cleared up that point in the act of election for though it is his unquestionable authority and prerogative to prorogue elections ad libitum yet out of respect and honor to the knightscompanions their approbation has been sometimes expressed     when any knightcompanion has received a summons to appear at a chapter of election and does wilfully refuse or withdraw himself he was to be mulct a mark for his disobedience which king henry viiis statutes enlarged to twenty shillings payable to the dean and college of windsor to pray for defunct souls and at his next appearance in chapter he was to remain kneeling in the midst of them before the sovereign or deputy till he was restored to their favor yet upon a just cause signified to the sovereign some time before under the seal of his arms he was excused if it was found just and feasible if not it was rejected and he remained punishable  and for greater caution this clause was formerly inserted in the letters of summons where after the time and place for election was certified and command given to observe both the letter concludes thus et se estre ny poues nous signifies soubz etc and if it cannot be accomplished that is if the knightcompanion could not meet at the time assigned to perform what the statutes oblige he should then signify to the sovereign under his seal the cause of his impediment so that he might perceive by his excuse whether it was worthy of acceptance or he in fault or not  cap x the investiture of a knightsubject with the garter and george if the knight chance to be at windsor that is newly elected or wheresoever the chapter is held after the sovereign has signified his pleasure in the election of the person the garter is immediately dispatched out of the chapter to give him the intelligence as is apprent upon the choice of the lord howard and sir henry marney anno   henry viii who was dispatched from the chapter to conduct them to the sovereigns presence to be invested with the principal ensigns of the order the garter and george  and as garter has been accustomed to signify in person the election of a knight in like manner an election is signified by the letters of the sovereign when he is pleased for the greater honor of the person to weave by verbal notice in such cases it is the chancellors office to draw up the letters and they are to pass both under the sovereigns sign manual and signet of the order such a particular mark of distinction and honor was conferred on our sovereign of blessed memory king charles ii sir john borough garter carrying the letter  charles rex  our most dear and entirely beloved son having to our great comfort seen and considered the ripeness of your youth and conceived joyful and pregnant hopes of your manly virtue in which we are assured you will increase to your own honor both in prowess wisdom justice and all princely endowments and that the emulation of chevalry will in your tender years provoke and encourage you to pursue the glory of heroic actions befitting your royal birth and our care and education we with the companions of our most noble order of the garter assembled in chapter holden this present day at our castle of windsor have elected and chosen you one of the companions of our order in signification whereof we have sent unto you by our trusty and wellbeloved servant sir john borough knightgarter and our principal king of arms these our royal letters requiring you to make your speedy repair unto us to receive the ensigns of our most noble order and to be ready for your installation upon the   st day of this present month  given under the signet of our order at or castle of windsor the  0th of may in the   th year of of our reign      to our dearly beloved son prince charles  this is the only instance we have met with where a letter was sent to an elect knight and he at the same time present at court but when an election is confirmed and the person remote from the court then the general tenure of the letter is both to signify his election and summon him to his investure with the garter and george as was performed by the earl of derby and sir edward strafford to king henry of france  but where the sovereign is pleased to mention particular services to recommend the election of a knight the preamble of the letter is worded accordingly and as this is a case not very frequent it will not be amiss to exemplify it in the choice of sir john falstoff where the letter runs thus  we considering the virtuous fidelity you have shown and the honorable exploits you have done in the service of our thrice renowned father and that in our service also you as many others have given proof of that honor and those deserts wherewith god has endowed you always suffering as is the part of a good subject the pains and toils of war for the vindicating and maintaining of our just right claim and title have chosen you one of our companions of our order  when the letter barely signifies election that is when the sovereign does not design a present investure with the garter and george but defers it till he takes possession of his stall the day of his installation is inserted toward the end of the letter and upon his appearance at windsor so soon as he appears in the chapter house the garter is first buckled about his left leg then follows his investure with the rest of the ornaments of the order and lastly his installation and this was the case of henry earl of northumberland anno    henry viii whose investure of the garter was deferred till his appearance at windsor and then the whole cermony was performed at once    if the elect knight be at hand where the chapter is convened and the garter has been sent to make known to him the honor and conduct him into the chapter house to receive the garter and george before they break up intimation being given of his approach the sovereign sends out two of the knightscompanions to meet him who after a mutual salute conduct him between them to the presence of the sovereign garter going before them thus was ubrick duke of holstein anno   jac i introduced into the chapter between prince henry and the earl of dorset and christian duke of brunswick anno    jac i between william earl of pembrook and philip earl of montgomery to receive the garter and george the  th of november anno    charles ii christian prince of denmark being elected at a chapter held at white hall and then absent the garter king was dispatched next day by the sovereign to inform him and to desire his presence the next day that he might receive his investure which accordingly was done being conducted between the earls of lindsey and manchester into the chapter garter preceding them and after three obeysances they brought him up to the sovereign among knightssubjects we find the lord burley and the lord gray were conducted to the sovereign by the lord clynton and the earl of bedford anno    elizabeth cum multis aliis anno   jac i robert earl of salisbury proceeded up to the sovereigns throne between the earls of nottingham and dorset in the reign of king charles i the earl of northampton was conducted to receive the garter in the chapter house at windsor between the earls of pembrook and montgomery and when king charles ii appeared upon his letter of summons at the chapter held in the withdrawing chamber in windsor castle to receive his investure two of the senior knights viz philip earl of pembrook and montgomery and thomas earl of arundel and surry were sent out to conduct him in who brought him between them unto the sovereign the gentleman usher of the black rod going before  the duke of monmouth being elected at a chapter held in the withdrawing room at white hall the   th of march anno    charles ii garter was immediately sent to him in the sovereigns bedchamber who being met at the door by the earls of lindsey and manchester both the garter and the black rod passed to the lower end of the room before the duke and the two knightscompanions whence they proceeded up to the sovereign with three reverences at the election of james duke of cambridge in the same room at white hall december   anno    charles ii garter was also sent forth into the bedchamber to acquaint him that the earl of manchester and the duke of monmouth were apointed by the sovereign and chapter to bring him in thither that done the aforesaid knightscompanions arse and went to the duke whom meeting at the bedcham door they took their compass about the rest of the knightscompanions then standing and brought him between them from the lower end of the room close before the sovereign the garter and black rod prceeing    the knight elect being thus introduced to the sovereign bows with all reverence and formerly a short gratulatory speech was the vogue that set forth his acknowledgment of his sovereigns royal favor and the grateful respect he bore to the knightscompanions for his election  anno    hen viii we find sir nicholas cew after he had been conducted into the chapter house at windsor to receive his investiture thus to address himself giving infinite thanks both to the sovereign and whole society for that they had vouchsafed to receive him into the honor of this most illustrious order being a person in hs own esteem most unworthy thereof in the next place professed that whereas he was preferred in this choice before many others much more deserving than himself it was not to be attributed to his merits or any thing by him performed but merely to the sovereigns bounty and the favor of the knightscompanions toward him  the conferring of so singular an honor being thus thankfully owned the ceremony of investiture egins the garter first takes place as the most ancient and chiefest ensign and then the george but the complete investiture is not performed until the elect knights are installed at windsor formerly the manner of robing of them was performed on this wise first the elect knight set his foot upon a stool and then one of the knightscompanions by the sovereigns appointment as his substitute backled the enobled garter about his lef leg as may be seen in the antiquities of wawickshire in an old draught of the combats of sir jon astler who was nrolled in this ilustrious bdy and is o represented but o late date the elect knight keeled on his right knee whilst this ceremony was performed in which space the words of amonitin and signification at this part of the inestiture were read the admonition upon the buckling of the garter in the english statutes of k hen viii is set down on this manner  sir the loving brethren of the order of the garter have received you their brother and fellow and in token of this they give and present you this present garter which god grant that you receive and wear from henceforth to his praise and glory and to the exaltation and honor of the said noble order and your self   afterward it was decreed at a chapter held at windsor the  th of august anno   and   pil and mary to this effect that not only the same advertisements which were wont to be given to strangers at their investitures should be likewise given to knightssubjects that for the future should be elected and installed and with a farther proviso that among the knightscompanions there should not be any difference either in ceremony or habit  hereupon the aforesaid tenure ceased to be used upon the fixing of the garter and one form remained at the investiture of strangers and knightssubjects which is pronounced by the chancellor if the sovereign or his lieutenant be present otherwise by the register  to the laud and honor of almighty god his immaculate mother and st george the holy martyr tie or gird your leg with this noble garter wearing it to the increase of your honor and in token and remembrance of this most noble order remembering that thereby you being admonished and encouraged in all just battles and wars which only you shall take in hand both strongly to fight valiantly to stand and honorably to have victory but against the investiture of k charles ii the words of the signification being better weighed and considered were thus methodized  to the honor of god omnipotent and in memorial of the blessed martyr st george tie about thy leg for thy renown this noble garter wear it as the symbol of the most illustrious order never to be forgotten or laid aside that thereby thou may be admonished to be courageous and having undertaken a just war into which only thou shall be engaged thou may stand firm valiantly fight and successfully conquer the princely garter being thus buckled on and the words of the signification pronounced the elect knight is brought before the sovereign who puts about his neck the george pendant at a skycolourd ribband at which part of the ceremony the admonition used at the adorning of an installed knight with the collar of the order only changing the word collar for ribband is pronoced but were altered upon the occasion assigned before  wear this ribband about thy neck adorned with the image of the blessed martyr and soldier of christ st george by whose imitation provoked thou may so overpass both prosperous and adverse adventures that having stoutly vanquished thy enemies both of body and soul thou may not only receive the praise of this transient combat but be crowned with the palm of eernal victory greater respect is conferred upon foreign princes who receive their election here than abroad because the sovereign most usually performs the investiture himself a was solemnized upon philip king of castile when the sovereign took the garter from the king at arms and sixed it on his leg and prince henry fastened the buckle  queen elizabeth her self buckled the garter about the leg of john csimier count palatine of the rhine and hung about his neck a gold chain with the george at i and the like honor did king james i confer upon the duke of holstein in the  d year of his reign  sometimes it hapens though very rarely for the sovereign out of his secial grace and favor to condescnd to honur a knightsubject this way though when queen elizbeth was pleased to adorn the lord buleigh with the garter the annals record it to be done as it were by the by the same favors she bstowd though at different times upon henry earl of sussex and the earl of shrewsbury king james i invested henry earl of northampton with the principal ensigns of the order as a person worthy of so great an honor and the blessed martyr placed both the garter and the george with his own hands upon king charles ii  sometimes the sovereign has but performed part of the investiture and laid his commands on the senior knight to do the rest thus anno    henry viii the sovereign reached out the garter to the marquis of dorset and commanded him to buckle it about the leg of the earl of devonshire which whilst he was about the duke of norfok gave him his assistance and the sovereign put on the gold chain at the investiture of christian duke of brunswick anno    jac i the sovereign put about his neck the blue ribband whereat hung the effigies of st george and the earls who introduced him to the sovereigns presence buckled on the garter thus did the sovereign to william earl of northampton anno   car i and the earl of pembroke fastened the garter about his left leg  this order of investiture began to be inverted anno    jac i the george and the ribband being first put on and the garter last and so was it performed when the prince of denmark dukes of monmouth cambridge and albemarle received their investiture in the reign of king charles ii the garter as it was the first so is the principal and most worthy ensign of the order and in the practice of all former times had always the preference given to it the investiture with these two ensigns has generally been performed by the two senior knights at the command of the sovereign but always in his presence the chapter sitting but if absent then by his lieutenant for in    eliz the lord buckhurst being elected at whitehall and coming to court wholly ignorant of the affair and after the sovereign was risen yet leaving the chapter sitting her lieutenant invested him both with the garter and george after the solemnity is completed the elect knight renders most humble thanks to the sovereign and with due respects salutes the knightscompanions who resalute the elect knight and joyfully receive him into their society if two or more elect knights receive this investiture at one time as soon as the senior is invested and his humble thanks presented he moves downwards toward the chapter house door and there stands till the next junior knight is invested and if there be more so on until the chapter break up    where a knightsubject at the time of his election is far distant from court or beyond sea and the sovereign determines to send him the two principal ensigns of the order the charge of this employ does of right belong to the garter for the proof of which there are diverse precedents  the letters heretofore sent from the sovereign along with the ensigns of the order to the elect knights have for the most part been drawn after the form of those that certify the election and differs only in the last clause which requires the elect knight to repair to the sovereign the difference lay not in the body but in the direction of the letter which was always worded according to the quality of the person to whom it was sent as to a knightbachelor the direction was to our trusy and wellbeloved and to an earl right trusty and rigt wellbeloved cousin to a duke right trusty and right entirely beloved cousin etc  the forms of those letters sent upon like occasions to knightssubjects when king charles ii was beyond sea were penned after another model and contained other additional particular clauses as   power to wear the star of silver about st georges cross   the great collar of the order and   to style themselves knights and companions of the order of the garter in as ample a manner as if they had been installed at windsor with an assurance of receiving the whole habit there when the sovereign was restored to the possession thereof  and it appears from some of these letters that by reason sir edward walker garter was otherwise employed in the service of the sovereign when they were transmited the sovereign pitched upon other persons to cary both the letters and ensigns of the order and yet continued the garter in the rights of his office however sir edward esteeming this devolving his employment on others as an invasion on the rights of his office and having a just regard for the interest of his successors no less than his own humbly petitioned king charles ii for redress and obtained his gracious reference thereupon to several knights of the order to examine the matter and to give in their report what they found and what they thought proper to be effected therein and upon whose report the sovereign did him full right by his gracious declaration for the dukes of buckingham and hamilton and the marquis of newcastle to whom this affair was referred gave in their report to the king at breda may       0  we george duke of buckingham william duke of hamilton and william marquis of newcastle knights of the most noble order of the garter having read and considered the within written petition do find the allegations therein mentioned to agree with the statutes and ancient practices of the said order and that garter king of arms and his deputies ought to bear all letters patent appertaining to the brethren of the said order and all elections to the knights elect and we do therefore make this report to your majesty to the end you may be pleased to mantain the petitioner in his just rights and that no example lately made may be brought in precedent against him or his successors in the said office  g buckingham  hamilton  w newcastle  it was formerly the practice to send the book of statutes under the common seal of the order together with the letters signifying an election and the ensigns of the order no less to a knight subject than to a stranger that he might peruse and advise thereupon whether he would accept of the election or not for so it appears anno   hen vi by the letters sent to sir john falstoff  within a few days after prince rupert was elected into this order being then in holland a commission of legation was prepared to be sent thither with the garter and george by sir john borough knight to perform the investiture with them but sir john dying prevented the ceremony some time after the prince had been in england the then sovereign thought it to lay his commands on sir james palmer chancellor of the order to attend his highness to declare the reason why the said commission was not sent and executed as was designed as well as to deliver him the commission it self to the intent being prevented of receiving his installation at windsor because that castle continued in the possession of the rebels it might remain with him as a memorial of his sovereigns princely favor and respect to his quality and merits and for a farther evidence of his being admitted into this most noble order since there was no other memorial thereof but the minutes of his election and this commission and accordingly on monday the   th of january      the chancellor accompanied with dr christopher wren register and sir edward walker newly made garter attended the prince at his lodgings in oxford who having notice of their design received them with all obliging civiity and the chancellor in an eloquent speech made known to his highness his sovereigns commands and the intent of his coming which was no sooner finished but sir james palmer presented his petition to the prince who gave his majesty many humble thanks for this gracious message and acknowledged his majestys favors beyond his desert but promised he would study to be more worthy by his actions than in return of words with many thanks to the chancellor and other officers of the order for their trouble whereupon they took their leave and the chancellor went immediately to his majesty and gave him a narrative of what they had done  v it was an ancient custom and part of the ceremony belonging to the investiture with the garter to give him an oath whether he was a stranger or a subjectknight which we find styled the oath in such cases accustomed to be taken and which was to this effect that the knight should well and faithfully keep and observe so far as god should enable him all that was contained in the statutes of the order but this of late has been disused and not imposed unless upon foreign princes  it is observable that anno   hen vi a particular commission was issued to the earls of warwick salisbury and suffolk with power to any two or one of them to receive this oath from sir john falstoff upon his investiture which was besides the oath his proctor was afterward to take at the installation which sir john empowered him to do on his behalf which was such oath as should be required at the time of installation  although we have fully treated of the ceremony and manner of investing a knight elect with the garter and george we shall subjoin two or three considerable instances as most proper to this place  when philip prince of spain anno   mariae had these ensigns of the order sent him the sovereign joined garter king of arms with the earl of arundel to perform the investiture who upon notice of his arrival on the coast of england set forward on their journey to southampton where on friday the  0th of july they took water and meeting the prince before he landed entered his barge and gave him notice of his election in a short speech which being ended garter having the garter in his hand kissed it and so presented it to the earl who forthwith fastened it about the princes leg and after garter had presented the earl with the george hanging at a chain of gold he put it likewise about the princes neck the ceremony of investiture being thus performed the prince came on sore at southampton and on the uppermost stair were ready attending his landing the marquis of winchester lord high treasurer of england with diverse other lords the prince gave the lord williams his white staff and made him lord chamberlain of his household and sir anthony brown master of his horse presented him from the queen a horse with a footcloth of crimson velvet richly embroidered with gold and pearls having the bridle and all other furniture suitable whereon he rode to the cathedral and after prayers to the lodging prepared for him  concerning the garters investitue of the earl of warwick at newhaven in france the first of may anno   eliz is as follows the garter repairing first to the earls lodgings put on his mantle in the next chamber to the earls and proceeded into the earls chamber where having made three reverences he buckled the garter about his left leg and after put on the george and the ribband about his neck reading to the earl the words of the signification appointed to be pronounced at the investiture which being concluded gater retired into the room where he had put on his mantle and there disrobed himself and so the ceremony ended  it was the custom about these times for the nobility allies or friends to the elect knight to send hin by the garter several garters and georges as marks of congratulation for the honor he was to receive which the garter delivered to him when the investiture was finished and he had put off his robe with the particular services and respects of those friends who had bestowed them for thus was it with the earl of warwick at newhaven and the lord scroop at carlise anno    eliz at the garters return to court he is obliged to deliver an account to the sovereign how he has discharged hs employment and by special directions from the eect knight who presents the highest respects he can express as well to the sovereign as to the rest of the knightscompanions for honoring him with a reception into so illustrious a body  we shall close this section with a brief account of the investiture of the duke of gloucester on easter day in the morning being the   th of april      in reference to which ceremony there was provided    a garter with the motto to be tied about his le leg    a george in a ribband to be put about his neck    an embroidered cross of st george with a garter and star to be sewed on the left shoulder of the dukes cloak    a velvet cushion whereon the ensigns and ornaments of the order were to be laid  for the honor of the order and his said highness sir edward walker garter humbl proposed that he might be assisted by two or four knights in performing his duty  that his highness the duke might receive the ensigns of the order in the presence chamber of the princess royal or in his own accompanied with the queen of bohemia her royal highness and some other persons of honor and quality  that his highness having placed himself under the state garter should take the cushion upon his arms on which were to be laid all the particular ornaments just now mentioned being assisted with the knights and a passage left for him to mke his three obeysances he should proceed up toward the duke and lay the cushion with the ornaments upon a stool set near his highness for that purpose  that he should signify to his higness in few words the cause of his coming and then deliver into his hands the sovereigns letter  that his highness having received it should break it open and deliver it back to the garter to be read which he having done should return it to his highness  that after this he should proceed to the investiture of his highness with the ensigs of the order  which being done he briefly represented unto his highness in a speech somewhat of the quality and splendour of the order  and lastly to kiss his highness hand and so depart and according to those proposals and in the same order were all things performed    the sovereign of this most noble order defrays the charges of the garter whensever and as often as he is dispatched to any elect knightsubject either with letters to signify his election or to invest him with the garter and george and this is commonly proportioned according to the length or the shortness of the journey the allowance for the journey which sir gilbert dithick garter made into the counties of lincoln and cumberland first to the earl of rutland and then to the lord scroop when queen elizabeth was sovereign appears to have been  0 l  besides the sovereigns allowance to the garter he receives honorable gratuities and rewards from the elect knight himsef after he has performed the investiture and these have usually been proportioned according to the estimate of the honor he receives and the particular affection he has for the garter and the service done by him among whom anno    henry viii we find the earl of arundel bestowed on thomas wiothsley garter ten pounds in angelts being then at his manor of dwnley and ralh earl of wstmoeland elected at the same time with the aforesaid earl being at mileend gave to him six pounds thirteen shillings and four pence the earl of northumberland in the    of henry viii bestowed on the garter for the verbal certifying him of his election four pounds though he went no farther than the chapter house door  lastly anno    elizabeth the earl of rutland honorably received the garter at newark and the lord scroop gave him thirty pounds in gold a velvet cloak and a gallaway nag and to william dethick york herald who accompanied garter to carlisle ten pounds  but since these times the knights elect have enlarged their gratuities to garter for his service upon this occasion  cap xi of preparations for the personal installation of a knight   the inauguration of a knight of this most noble order consists in a conjunction of many ceremonies and contains the most solemn part of those which compleateth all the rest and till this great solemnity be regularly and duly performed the person elected has not the honor to be enrolled among the number of founders but barely passes for an elect knight and no other for the statute expressly says that in case a knight elect die before his installation he shall not be named one of the founders and the reason assigned for it is because he has not had the full possession of his estate and in this point do the other bodies of the statutes agree but when the ceremonies of installation are completely finished without all doubt the knight is amply vested in possession of all honors and privileges appertaining to the founder of this most noble order but to spur up each elect knight who is either a subject to his sovereign or resides within the realm and consequently i better able to provide for installment than one remaining in foreign parts for the completion of his honor or else to wave the act of election he has the space of one year allowed him by the statutes for installation otherwise his election is ordained to be absolutely null and void nor can there be any motive sufficient to retard the sovereign from proceeding to a new election unless the elect knight send or produce an extenuation or excuse for such his delay t to be excepted by the sovereign or his deputy and the whole of that resplendent body or that the sovereign himself think t to defer the ceremony of installation for some time longer for which reason when certain articles tending to the honor of the order had been prepared by the sovereigns lieutenant and ten knightscompanions in a chapter held the   th of april anno    jacobus i ratified by the sovereign and ordered to be observed one of them was for accelerating the installation after the knight had been elected yet qualified with this exception unless for some special cause the sovereign should think fit to defer the same until the eve or day of st george next following the time of election    the feast of installation has not been hitherto assigned to any certain period of time but has always depended upon the will and pleasure of the sovereign to affix a convenient day which has been granted upon the request of the knights elect or some other of the knightscompanions whose favor and esteem with the sovereign was best able to prevail such a one do we find anno    elizabeth who on the behalf of the earls of shrewsbury and cumberland obtained the   th of june the said year to be appointed for the installation it sometimes happens that though the day of installation be prefixed yet something extraordinary intervening it has been prorogued to a farther and more convenient season for the sovereigns affairs and the most remarkable instance is set down anno   and   philip and mary when the earl of sussex the lord gray and sir robert rochester knights elect had their installation together with the feast of st georg prorogued to the  0th of may in the year aforesaid but many urgent affairs relating both to the king and the queen fell out about that time not only the grand feast but the solemnity of their installation were prorogued to the  th of december and stood so by several prorogations to the  0th of february next ensuing yet it was ordered that the earl of sussex should be immediately installed which was performed on the  th of january and the lord gray the  0th of april following but sir robert rochester never obtained that honor  though the time of installation be arbitrary and uncertain yet has the place from the first institution of the order been appointed only to the sovereigns free chapel of st george within whose choice are erected the sovereigns and knightscompanions stalls and under its sacred roof their banners and achievements are affixed as monuments of their high merit and so great honor for though the celebration of the grand feast of st george happened to be removed from windsor by a decree of the   elizabeth yet the feast of the installation was excepted and ordered to be solemnized in that place for anno    jac i it was provided among the orders that after an election made of a knight of the order his installation should be performed at windsor according to the ancient customs and statutes of the order when the sovereign has been pleased to prefix a certain day for this solemnity of installation there are several things to be obtained previous to it   a commission to admit and instal the elect knight   letters to each of the commissioners and the elect knight to repair to windsor   warrants for the sovereigns livery   a bill or warrant for the removal of stalls and achievements all signed by the chancellor of the order with the sign manual of the sovereign and lastly the knights own preparations among which his achievements are to be ready to be hung up as soon as he is installed    no elect knight can be installed unless by the sovereign of the order himself or by his commission drawn up in writing and passed under the greatseal of the order directed ether to his lieutenant or knightscommissioners there is but one instance to be found where the sovereign has been pleased to honor a knight by installing of him himself and that was philip of castile and leon anno    henry vii yet it is feasible enough that sigismond the emperor and some other foreign princes of rank and eminence might be installed by other sovereigns though there is no memorial le upon record in reference to installation by commission it was ordained by the statutes of institution that in case the sovereign should be absent out of the kingdom at the time of installation of any of the knights so as he could not personally perform those things his office obliged him to it should be lawful for him to constitute as his deputy in this affair whomsoever of the society he should think fit and he to have power and authority in the sovereigns name to perform and execute these things which it would have been in his own part to have done had he been present by virtue of this article the sovereigns deputy or lieutenant performed the ceremony before the reign of king henry viii which was usually done at the feast of st george but in the commission given out for installation formerly the lieutenant was first mentioned and the knightscompanions appointed for his assistance at the said feast were joined with him in the commission for installation but of late the commission has passed to the lieutenant alone king henry viii by his statutes enlarged the power of his deputy and they run to two or more of the knightscompanions that should exercise the same by the sovereigns letters of commission and by the privilege of this article whenever after the sovereigns did constitute an installation otherwise than at the feast of st george they then delegated their authority to such of the knightscompanions as were judged most proper to perform this ceremony the year after the enacting this statute there is a commission recorded to be issued out to the marquess of dorset and the earls of devonshire and kent to instal the lords ferrers of chartley the substance of which is in our annals the particular powers these commissions have granted to them are to accept and admit the knight into the order to receive the oath and to instal him and their general power is to effect and accomplish every point which belongs to his due admittance and plenary instalment    besides the commission impowering the soverigns lieutenant or knightscommissioners therein nominated to the installation of an elect knight it has been a matter frequent with the sovereign to issue out letters of summons under his privy signet both to the commissioners for installation and elect knights under the signet of the order those to the commissioners are directed severally to each nominated in the commission who are to give them notice of the instalment and to require their repair to windsor against the day assigned that they may proceed to their installation those directed to the elect knights ass likewise under the sovereigns sign manual and signet of the order and if there be two or more knights appointed to be installed on the same day the like letter is sent to each of them the dfference being only in the direction  besides these letters sent from the sovereign the chancellor if the sovereign be absent in his circular letter to the knightscompanions gives them an intimation of the designed installation upon the feast of st gg and if the feast be held either by the soveign or his lieutenant he dspatcheth a letter to the prelate of the order intimating the sovereigns commands for his attendnce at the dy appointed and if it be performed by commissioners he issues hs letters to the three inferior officers of the order purporting the same command the conveyance of which appertains to the garter and are left to his care and trust by the constitutins relating to the order whose allowances and rewads upon these and such like services in their due pace shall be considered    the third matter to be obtained by the chancellor of the order is the sovereigns warrant directed for the master o the great wardrobe for the time being to deler so much velvet for the livery of the order as will mke the knight elect a surcoat and hod and as much sanet or taffety as will serve to line them o such a warrant there is an ancient precedent in latin etered in the blak book f the order where it runs nos ideo volumus and pripimus ut hinc tabellioni virgas octodecem subrubi ostri d more tradas cum tanto albe serio quanto vstimentum inde consiciendum infulciri poterit pro lveraa qm  cant sua etc there is likewise inserted another predent in english of the like nature for the delivery of these materials to sir john wallop knight elected anno    henry viii and in the same form run all the warrants of queen mary and queen elizabeth  over and above these there is a warrant and scheme prepared for the sovereign to sign wherein is described the order of the stalls of windsor as he would have them stand at the ensuing election by the virtue of which the garter is empowered to shift or remove the plates and achievements of the present knightscomanions so that room may be made for the elect knight or knights and to fix the new plates and atchievemets withn and over the stalls in such order as they are ranked in the scheme as soon as the sovereigns pleasure is known concerning an instalation garter brings to the chancellor of the order the names of the present knightscompanions placed in the order they then sit in their stalls to the intent he may preent them to the sovereign who upon observing the series wherein they stand already he may easier determine how to alter and place both them and the new elect knights anno    elizabeth the ofice of the garter being vacant this employ was put upon the clarenceux and the sovereigns warrant for removal and placing of plates and atchievement was delivered to him fie days before the installation of the earl of rutland the lords cobham and scroop who thereupon fixed them according to the direction given upon what ground this alteration and removal came to be made and continues still in vogue though it was otherwise at the institution of the order wherein we must have recourse to the statutes and the antique practice grounded upon them aong the statutes those of the institution did ordain that if any earl baron or knightbachellor should depart this life he that succeeded in his place of what condition or state soever should possess the same stall which his predecessor held before without changing so that it might happen for an earl or a duke to succeed a knight and vice versa it was thus at first constituted by edward iii that it might be known who were the first founders of this mst noble order  now how puctually this article of the statutes has been observed that none chosen along time after the institution of the order should interrupt or change this course we shall demonstrate conceiving it very material to eye those tables yet preserved in the chapterh in windsor wherein are collected the names of all those knightscompanions who succeeded one another in each stall until the beginning of henry viis reign  from which series of succession we shall remark how exactly the law in this point has been observed even to king henry viiis reign when it received some alteration in this point for we find in the annals several knights designed for the stall of their immediate predecssors by the honor only of election although prevented of installation by death or other accidents and the statutes do not only bind him who shall chance to attain the honor of installation but him who shall succeed or come after the defunct knight first therefore we shall instance in foreign kings among whom we find ericus king of denmark to have received installation in henry vs reign not according to the state and dignity of a king but into the stall of that knightcompanion whom he succeeded viz the duke of bavaria john the first king of portugal a knight and companion likewise in henry vs time was installed in the second stall on the sovereigns side which belonged to henry duke of lancaster his first predecessor and to this king did succeed in the same stall his son edward king of portugal anno    henry vi to whose successor humphry anno    and casimir king of poland were elected anno    henry vi into the sixth stall on the princes side at that time vacant by the death of the duke conimbero whose first founder was sir john mohun alphonsus king of arragon and naples anno    henry vi was elected into the stal of don altro vasques dalmeda cunt d averence being the seventh on the sovereigns side sir hugh courtney first possessing it ferdinand king of niples and sicily elected anno   edward iv was installed on the third on the princes side ralph earl of stafford having been first istalled therein and lastly we find alphonsus king of sicily and jerusalem being elected by henry vii received his installation on the princes side whose predecessor was thomas beauchamp earl of warwick  in the second place if we descend to foreign princes it is remarkable that william duke of guldes elected by richard ii was installed in that which sir john beauchamp possssed and william earl of holland haynal and zealand in that which appertained to sir john chandos philip duke of burgundy in the time of henry v into the stall of sir john clifford and anno    henry vi henry duke of brunswick was elected into the duke of suffolks stall  and as the statute was carefully observed with reference to the election and installation of foreign princes so no less in relation to the princes of the blood at home among whom let us observe in the third place the ranking the sons of the founder of this most noble order where we see lyonel duke of clarence his third son to have been installed in the sixth stall on the sovereigns side whose immediate predecessor was sir john beauchamp in like manner john of gaunt duke of lancaster his fourth son was instaled in the seventh stall on the princes side having sr thomas holland for his predecessor and a founder his fifth son edmund langley duke of york possessed the stall sir hugh courtney did before and the sixth son thomas woodstock duke of gloucester enjoyed the stall sir john gray did before this rule was likewise observed strictly in relation to the sons of king henry vii  if we review the aforesaid tables we shall find that as the knightscompanions of higher dignity assumed the stalls when they became vacant though often of the lower sort so some of the inferior rank among them have had the honor to be installed in seats of a uperior class and this by the virtue and due of the law  amongst these knightscompanions we shall enumerate sir philip la vache a gascon who in the reign of king richard ii was first installed in the princes stall being vacant by the death of john of gaunt though aferwards removed to the third stall on the sovereigns side sir nicholas sarnesfield standard bearer to the founder who succeeded hugh earl of stafford and after him sir illiam arundel immediate successor to sir nichlas were both installed in the second stall on he soveregns side as likewise sir john robsart sir gilbet talbot and sr john gray etc were installed in the second or third stalls on the sovereigns side  these instances already asserted are sufficient to manifest the usage and practice how the knightscompanions have succeeded in the stalls of their immediate predecessors down to the reign of henry viii and was consonant and agreeable to the ancient law of the order  but we are to observe that though each knight was by the beforementioned article constituted to succeed his immediate predecessor in the stall void by his death yet there is an excepion as to that of the prince of wales this stall is the first on the left hand at the entrance into the choir of st georges chapel at windsor and where n edward the black prince was installed from this stall does the whole range of stalls on the same side take their deomination and to which the prince of wales as soon as he is elected into the order has a due title though this stall de jure appertains to that prince yet heretofore when the sovereign had no heir then was it for the present dispsed to some other knight otherwise a defect in the full number of knightscompanions would have ensued  the first that obtained that honor besides the prince of wales was john of gaunt duke of lancaster decreed him by k richard ii who never had issue and removed from the seventh stall thither but the first companion that happened to be instaled in it was sir philip la vache just mentioned which was a great honor done to one of his rank but it fell to him by the then law of the order being elected into the rom of the said duke who did possessed f it but king henry iv coming to the crown and his eldest son being created prince of wales laid claim to the stall by virtue of that statute and had it assigned to him nevertheless that the former possesso might suffer as little diminution as might be in the honor of hs session he was removed no lower than to the stall which king henry iv lately held when he was earl of derby  upon the death of henry iv henry v being sovereign sr john dabichcout suppled the vacancy and was installed therein and he dying in the fifth year of that king ssessd thereof his plate continues in that stall to ths da and the emperor sigismond succeeds sir john dabrichcourt in the princes stall  some few years before king henry vi died he had a son born and though the emperor federick was elcted into the oder anno    henry vi yet was that sall resered for the prince though he never ossssd i and the emperor    henry vi was instaled by poxy in the duke of smersets stall then latel deceaed  in edward ivs reign the right of this stall retuned again to edward his son the prince of wles and in heny viis to prince arthur but upon his deh to maximilian son of frederick king of the rmans and after emperor enjoyed it so did he empror charles v his grandchid in regard there was no son as yet bn to the svereign  but prince edward being born while the stall was possessed by cha les v it chanced likewise that the king o the scots died which caused king henry viii to reserve his stall for that prince although he never had possession of it or was elected into the order though we find him once registered in a scrutiny king hny viii dying prince edward became both by i heritance and succession sovereign of this most nobe order  from this time to the eighth year of king james i there was no prince of wales who fiing he princes stall vacant at hs entrance upon the english thrne did in a chapter in the first year of his reign adance the french king henry iv fm the second stall on the sovereigns side into it and appointed prince henry t be installed in that kings vod seat where he continued till anno   jac i that christierne iv king of denmark came to be installed by proxy an the prince was mved lower to make way for him though he was senior both by election and installation anno   jac i upon the death of the french king not the prince whose right it was since he was created prince of wales but the said king f denmk was translated to the vacant sal and hereupon prince henry was returned again to the second stall on the sovereigns side which he enjoyed as long as he survived and upon his death prine charles was removed into it and there remained all king jamess reign  when king charles ii came to be installed the sovereign finding him prevented from assuming the pinces stall the king of denmark being yet alive assigned to him the second stall on the sovereigns side wherein himself sat whilst prince of wales and where hitherto his plate remains as a fixed memorial of his installation therein  although it has been made apparent that the knightscompanions at their election or installation succeeded the immediate defunct knight in his stall yet we may observe that sometimes after installation as an especial signal of favor and indulgence the sovereign has been pleased though very rarely to advance a knightcompanion to a higher stall than that wherein he was first placed and though there be no such permission granted by the law of the order yet we find john of gaunt duke of lancaster removed from the seventh stall on the princes side to the princes stall it self and it is said to be done by the decree of the sovereign and the knightscompanions and no doubt but as this was done by so good authority and so upon no less enducements to the sovereign and the whole society we shall here mention a few of these extraordinary cases william henalt earl of ostervant was advanced by king richard ii from the eleventh stall on the sovereigns side to the duke of britains being the second on the princes side humphry duke of gloucester in the reign of king henry vi was removed from the eleventh stall on the sovereigns side to the second on the same side and richard nevil earl of warwick by the consent of the knightscompanions in chapter anno    henry vi was translated to the duke of buckinghams stall the lord bonvil to the lord scaless seat sir thomas kyriell to the place of the earl of shrewsbury and the lord wenlock to the stall of viscount beaumont but king henry viii thinking it requisite for the sovereign of this most noble order to be empowered by a general how to act that at pleasure which the former sovereigns did not but by the power of particular acts or orders in the chapter after he had confirmed the ancient law of succeeding in the stall of the immediate predecessor and not to suffer an alteration without the sovereigns license in the next article he estabished this privilege upon himself and successors that if there were any place or stall void the sovereign at his own pleasure might advance and translate any knight of the society into the void stall so that it were higher than that wherein he sat before  this in effect did vacat the ancient law of succeeding in stalls though at the same time he seemed to confirm it to the knightssubjects for afterward translations preceding to installations became so frequent that the right an elect knight had to his predecessors stall was seldom enjoyed however hereby he confirmed a power to gratify such of the knightscompanions as he should think it to advance without having recourse to a chapter and from hence began the custom to issue out warrants under the sovereigns sign manual for the translation of stalls and consequently the alteration and removal of such of the knightscompanions helms crests banners and plates who should receive a higher exaltation  besides the power established upon the sovereigns of this most noble order of translating stalls when a vacancy happened they farther added this larger prerogative that the sovereign once in his life might if t pleased him make a general translation of all the stalls at his peasure except of emperors kings princes and dukes who should keep their stalls and places unless advanced to a higher room and stall in which translation the long continuance in the order and the praises worthiness and merits of the knightscompanions were to be considered and remembered  but this branch of the sovereigns prerogative as far as we can find was never put in execution though the translation anno    henry viii bordered something upon it perhaps left it might raise too great feuds among the knightssubjects forasmuch as that of translating only when there happened a vacancy begot great emulations which at length introduced a change to which we shall pass after we have taken notice of a clause added in the twenty second article of king henry viiis statutes relating to princes  it is observable the ancient law of succeeding in stalls in relation to them was wholly altered for king henry viii upon the establishment of his body of statutes not only appointed those strangers then present of the oder to be seated next himself but that all empeor kings and princes should hold their stalls after their estates and the very next unto the sovereign though knightssubjects upon vacancy become removable at pleasure  for this reason the emperor maximilian ii and after him rudolph ii his son had the princes stalls assigned them after their election into the order and several of the kings of france were placed in the next below being the second on the sovereigns side and when there chanced to be more than one king at a time in the order the second stall on the princes side was assigned him for precedence was measured now by dignity and state and not by the antiquity of the order as appears from the king of bohemia anno    henry viii and the king of spain anno   elizabeth princes strangers according to their regality and illustrious extraction had their situation next to kings as is manifest from the dukes of savoy montmorency and holstein anno   elizabeth and frederick prince palatine and maurice prince of ange anno    jac i  but notwithstanng these assignments of stalls to strangers they were nevertheless subject to removal sometimes to stalls higher than their own upon the death of a stranger who died possessed of a superior one and sometimes again to others lower for the advancing a knight of greater degree and distinction where the upper stalls were already supplied else they could not be so ranked according to their respective quality as the statuts enjoin nor indeed would any stranger king have accepted of an election unless he was placed in a distinguishable stall suitable to his dignity ferdinand emperor of germany is an instance of advancement in anslation of stalls for after the death of the emperor charles v his brother he was advanced from the second stall on the princes side

second on the side of the sovereign likewise henry frederick prince of orage was advanced from the third of the sovereigns to the second of the princes upon the death of the king of sweden anno  0 charles i  when the french king charles ix was elected anno   elizabeth the superior stalls were already filled with strangers and there was no exedient left to give him the sall the sovereign designed him but by the removal of some of those knightsstrangers lower and upon this emanuel duke of savoy was displaced to the third on the sovereigns side  but the french king was not installed until the   th of january anno   elizabeth and before that it was concluded to remove the king of spain to the duke of savoys stall as void before and to instal the french king in the king of spains which was accordingly done so that upon this occasion there were four strangers and five knightssubjects removed lower to make way for the french king  the  0th of april anno   jac i the duke of wirtemberg was installed in the third stall on the princes side and the year following advanced to a higher  the   th of may ensuing ulerick duke holst had assigned unto him that stall from which the duke of wirtembeg was advanced but against the installation of christierne the fourth king of denmark the duke was removed back to his sea wherein he was installed and the duke advanced into the vacant one all which will appear more conspicuous from the appointment of stlls on these occasions which follow  a remove of banners and plates at the installation of frederick duke of wirtemberg anno

anno   charles i was advanced from the third stall on the sovereigns side to the second on the princes side that became vacant by the death of the duke of brunswick yet the year after upon the admission of gustavus adolphus king of sweden he was removed two stalls lower and the prince elector palatine one  we pass on now from the removal and translation of a knightsubject after he had been installed to the assignment of his stall at the time of the installation it self where it is worthy of remark that on the   th of april anno   eizabeth in lieu of the ancient law which appinted each elect knight to succeed in the stall of his predecessor a new one was introduced being composed as was conceived upon a more just level than the former  as far as was possible to extinguish all danger that might arse from emulation the words are that all knights who for the future were admitted into the society of the order should take and be installed in the lowest stall according to the course and seniority of their election except only strangr kings and princes  upon which it chanced that when a knightsubject elect was to be installed all the knightscompanions beteen him and the vacant stall were removed higher that the space might be supplied and if two or more ere to be installed together they possessed the lowest tals according to the seniority of their election and thugh the manner and order in removals is become a ing of course and rendered familiar and easy yet it cannot be effected or the achievements banners or  displaced unless by a warrant issued from the vereign to justify the garter for such his removals which will plainly appear by the insertion of these shemes  the order of stalls as they stood at the feal of st george anno    eliz elizabeth regina    the

earl of warwick   earl of worcester   lord burleigh   earl of derby  0 ld how of eigh    lord scroop    earl of ormond    void   the first of these schemes plainly evince how the stalls were ranked on st georges eve anno    elizabet and the other how modelled against the installation f the earls of essex and ormond and that of sir christopr hatton the   d of may anno  0 elizabeth which demonstrates those three elect knights appear to be installed in the lowermost stalls as the last mentioned decree enjoins and by reason the earl of essex and sir christopher hatton were settled on the sovereigns sie the vacancy in the eighth and twelfth stalls of the same side became filled up the earl of huntington being advanced into the eighth the lord gray in the ninth and the earl of pembrook in the tenth stall by the advance of the earl of worcester into the seventh on the princes side the vacancy is there supplied and the other knights seated below him by a like removal left the twelfth stall for the earl of ormond and the thirteenth void  the same order was observed by king james as appears by another scheme of the stalls settled on the  d of july anno   jac i at the election of the duke of lenox the earls of northampton mar and pembrook  stalls altered at a chapter held at windsor the   july anno   jac i james rex    the sovereign   the prince   earl of nottingham   earl of ormond

earl of cumberland   earl of worcester   ld how of walden   lord montjoy   earl of sussex  0 lord scroop    lord burleigh    earl of southampton    earl of pembrook   from hence it is evident that these elect knights were installed in the lowest stalls and so continued throughout the series of his reign and since except the prince of wales and charles duke of york sons to the said sovereign for the prince was installed on the second on the sovereigns side and upon that election of the duke o york anno jac i the second stall on the princes side was assigned him and the morrow after st georges day upon which he was elected he made a solemn progressin to the chapel in order to take possession of it upon witsunday following at a serious debate it was determined in chapter that notwithstanding he was the sovereigns son yet he should have no more preeminence than other knightscompanions and that his achievements which had been set up over the second stall on the princes side should be removed to that stall next above the viscount rochesters and to be conserted wih the earl of montgomery before whom he had the preference on whitsunmunday as they proceeded to the chapter house in order to their installation and where it was farther decreed that all princes not absolute shud be installed thenceforth in the princes place but after this had passed endeavors were used to advance the duke into the stall he was first appointed to and the kings of arms were consulted upon this point who certified that richard duke of york second son to king edward iv was installed in the fourth stall on the princes side and had precedence of the duke of suffolk and the earls of dowglass and essex who were elected long before him that henry duke of york second son to king henry vii was installed in the third stall on the sovereigns side and had the preference of the duke of buckingham and the earls of oxford and derby his seniors and in the last place that henry fitz ry duke of richmond base son of king henry viii had place and precedence before the dukes of norfolk and suffolk and other knightscompanions upon which grounds it was thought requisite that the issue of the sovereign should enjoy the same privileges in this affair as those princes that wee strangers and therefore at another chapter assembled a white hall on eastermonday being the   th of april anno  0 jac i the order which passed the year before for making the duke a puisne was abrogated and he was translated to the second stall on the princes side and paired with prince henry as may be seen by the stalls then settled and entered into the blue book of the order  we need not bring any more corroborating circumstances of the observation of the chapter act made anno   elizabeth as it relates to knightssubjects which has been punctually performed but since strangers are therein excepted it will not be amiss to note that the rule and practice coninued as was established by king henry viii viz that they were installed in seat next to the soereign according to the illustriousness of their dignity and birth  we shall mention one instance of the manner of placig both strangers and knightssubjects at one and the ame time at the first coming of king charles i to the crown there were of both conditions to be installed in one dy to wit the duke of brunswick a stranger prince the earls of salisbury and carlise knightssubjects elected by king james i in the   d year of his reign and on the   th of may following the earls of dorset and holland were elected with the viscount andove and the duke of chevereux the  th of july after and when the removal of stalls was propounded for the admission of these seven elct knights it was agreed too that the dukes of brunswick and chevereux should be installed in the uppermost stall among strangers as king henry viii had before ordained but the knightssubjects in the lowermost salls according to the pristine practice as appears from the decree anno   elizabeth and from the settlement of salls then made and thus entitled  a remove of banners and stalls at the feast of st george and installation holden at windsor the          days of december anno      at which time were installed the dukes of brunswick and chevereux the earls of salisbury carlisle holland dorset and the viscount andover as follows charles rex    the

srangers and subjects were to be installed a debate arose in the chapter held at white hall the  0th of april anno    car ii about placing their achievements over th stalls upon which the following order was issued out  charles rex  whereas diverse elect knights and companions of our most noble order of the garter are by our special appointment to be installed in the chapel of our castle of widsor upon the   th day of this instant and that some of them who are strangers do not as yet nor are likely to appear either in their own persons or by their sufficient poxis at the said instalment

without some expedient taken therein to prevent it tee bing no reason nor is it our intention that thse noble persons should suffer tt prejudice for want of that usual fomality and for which they are

princes are placed in the upper stall nearst the sovereign according to their dignities and degrees and all the knightssubjects as to the time of their elections it is to be oberved upon thi settlement that though the earl of southampten dd not receive his garter and george till the svereign upon his happy arrival in england conferred it upon him with his own hand yet according to the time of the election place and precedence were allowed him which was in january an dom      in the isle of jersr ome ew days before duke hamiton and the marqus of nwcastle were eected  it was ordered by the svereign and knightscomptions convened in chapter on the  0th of january anno    car ii that thenceforwrd all princes strangers of what conditin soever should have pcedce among themselves according to the seniority of their elections and installations upon which the sovereign under the signet of the order authorized the garter upon the  0th of march to set up their achievements in st

  duke of ormond   earl of southampton   earl of bristol   count marshin  0 earl of sandwich    duke of richmond    earl of manchester    duke of monmouth   but upon mature consideration of a law made by henry viii for placing of strangers and for another founded by queen elizabeth for knightssubjects the sovereign by the consent of the most noble companions present at a chapter held the   th of november      was leased to ordain first that the prince of wales and such emperers and kings that should be of the order should be placed in the neaest stalls to that of the sovereign according to their elections and installations  then that all other soveeign princes and princes of the blood should be placed in their stalls next unto the kings according to the seniority in the order and thirdly that all other his majestys subjects and strangers not of the dgnity abovementioned should be installed in the lowest stalls according to their antiquity in the order and the acient practce  and whereas the stall rmed the princes had been long vacant the sovereign king charles ii by the advice of the most noble comanions at the same chapter was pleased to order that the present king of sweden should by his proxy be placed in that stall and his achievements bung up tereon accordingly in convenient time which order was strictly put in execution and the stalls at the feast of st george anno    car ii were thus ranged  charles rex    the sovereign   king of denmark   prince elector palatine   prince of orange   pr elector of saxony   duke of buckingham   earl of bristol   count

 prince tarante   eal of sandwich   duke of richmond  0 duke of monmouth    void    void    void     having dispatched the ancient law of succession into void stalls and of translation from one to another we come now to consider what is farther to be prepared for the knight elect against the day of the great solemnity at his own expense the chief of which are   a mantle or upper robe with its appurtenance   a collar of the garter and great george   a cap of black velvet adorned with plumes   a helmet crest mantlings and sword   a banner of his arms   a plate of his arms and stle   a cushion to carry his robes and collar upon   lodging escutcheons   though the kirte on the surcoat was anciently given by the king to the knightssubjects yet we do not find the mantle of the order was no indeed of a ater date unless now and then as a distinguishing mark of favor but the sovereign always bestows the mntle upon strangers as well as the whole habit when he has elected them into the society of the order and upon sending of the whole habit over by garter to the king of portugal anno    hen vi the mantle surcoat and hood were accounted for in the great wardrobe and is to this day practiced  however of late the sovereign has been pleased now and then to confer the mantle upon a knightsubject witness king james i anno    did to james marquis of hamilton and king charles i anno   to theophilus earl of suffolk and the year ensuing to william earl of northampton and anno    sir james palmer by his sovereigns direction paid for the velvet and taffety of the earl of kellys mantle and surcoat to sir peter richaut and put it upon the account of the extraordinary expense of the order  king charles ii as a signal mark of his favor caused seventeen mantls with the usual liveries of surcoat and hood to be made ready against the grand feast of st george anno    which he confered not only among the new elect knights but upon the earls of salisbury barkshire and nothumberland that were three senior knigtscompnions  the collar of the order and the great george the elect knight is to provide himself unless where the sovereign is pleased to bestow the mantle which is always accompanied with the collar and then a like warrant issus to the mster of the jewelhouse as was used for providing the seventeen collars anno    car ii  the black velvet cap beforementioned and described with the helm crest and mantlings together with a sword and girde are to be got in readiness by the care and direction of the garter but at the expense of the knights eect all which are to be set over his stall as soon as i installation fees are paid  this honor that every knightcompanion shall have his helm crst and sword affixed over his stall at the chapel of st george is particularly provided for in all the seveal bodies of satutes and are ordained to remain there during the lives of the possessors in  of im that bears them and a tstimny f the defense  the church as the oaths of military orders requie  the hems upon this occasion are composed of steel and of a more than ordinary proportion those for soveeign pices are framed open with large bars but those for the knightssubjects are made close about king henry viiis reign the knighssubjects helms were parcel gilt with fine gold in oil wrought with curious works and burnished with fine gold but in the reign of queen elizabeth and since that time it has been the custom to gild their helms all over and place the arms of st george in the middle before the vizors  the mantlings that hang down on either side of the helm together with the wreath are in some places called appendixes and are all of tissue or cloth of gold and formerly lined with sarcenet but in the reign of queen mary they were exchanged for white satin for so were the mantlings of anthony bown viscount montague and william howard lord admiral lined  at the bottom of these mantlings hang a pair of gilt knobs burnished with gold from which spring out tossels either of gold or slver consentaneous to the metal in the knights court of armor mixed with silk of the chief color in his arms  upon the helm and mantlings is placed a wreath of corded silk of the knights colous which was formerly of sarcenet but now of taffety  the crest of the knight is placed either upon these weaths or issuant out of a crown or ducal cap turned with ermin and of what kind sever the crest is the same is neatly carved in wood and either gilt or wrought in directly before the helm an armed sword hangs down the pomel cross and chape are gil the scabbard is made of the same tissue or cloth of gold as the mantlings are as is the girdle that belongs to it but the buckles and pendants are of copper gilt  the custom of setting up the hem crest and sword over the stall of the knights is as ancient as the istitution of the order but when the banners were first hung up we have not so clear a conviction for neither the statutes of institution nor those of henry v make mention of them  the first time they occur to us we find to be in anno   hen vi in the black book of the order where the banners of the king of portugal is particularly poke of among the achievements then set over the sall but they are more particularly mentioned in the bdy of king henry viiis statutes  the fashion of the sovereigns and all the knightscompanions banners are square yet it does no where appear what the exact standard was yet we find them in the reign of queen elizabeth to be two yards and a quarter long and a yard and three quarters broad besides the finge which is composed of gold or silver and silk of the colors in the weath and on them are wrought upon taffetysarcenet double sarcenet or rich taffety with fine gold colors on both sides the patenal coat of the knightscompanion together with his quartering or so many of them as he pleases to use and the garter is to take care they be warrantably marshalled  and because a sigle coat was not conceived to stand fair enough in a banner of this proportion the sovereign has been pleased to grant a new coat to bear in quarters his paternal one if he wanted it as king james i did to robert carr viscount rochester to whoe paternal coat he first added a lion passant gardant or in the dexter part as an especial gift of his favor and then invented a new cat to be born in quarter therewith viz qarterly or and gules a lion rampant sabe over all june   anno   jac i  these banners of arms are fixed to the end of long saves painted in oil formerly of the color of the wreaths but now red their ends are put into sockes of iron well fixed in the wall directly over the knightscompanions helms and crests and frequently lined with fustian to preserve them  there is moreover to be provided a copper plate gilt whereupon are engraved the escutcheon of the knights elect arms in colors enamilled with his quartering helm crst and supporters and underneath his style and titles of honor enccled with a garter which plate the garter usually takes care to provide and is to be fixed on the back of the knights stall assigned for his installaton  a veet cushion is likewise to be provided to carry the knights elct mantle collar hood and book of statutes before him in the progress into the chire in order to his installation at the installation of the lord treasurer ston and the earls of exeter and lindsey who were istalled anno   car i the materals and garnishing of these cushions are recited severally to contain one yard and a half of crimson velvet one ell of rich taffety for their lining four yards of fringe and four great tossels  lastly there have frequently been made ready a convenient number of lodging escutcheons of the elect knights arms environed with a garter and his style and titles placed underneath it having been an ancient custom for the knights to distribute these escutcheons at the inns in their passage to and at windsor as a memorial of their installation  what falls under the care of the garter to prepare and make ready the expense sometimes has been cast up and the account stated and defraid beforehand by which means he was in a better capacity to furnish out the ceremony for so did the earls of shrewsbury and cumberland anno    eliz  besides these mentioned to be prepared and provided either by the chancellor of the order or the garter the knight elect must take care of other affairs more particularly relating to himself and his retinue such as are apparel the number of his attendants and servants th their clothes and liveries his coach and saddle horses both for himself and them with other material circumstances to set off his cavalcade and proceeding with greater pomp and gallantry the provisions for diet at windsor if the feast be kept at the elect knights chrge and expense are to be considered of and very often some clark of the sovereigns kitchen is to be consulted in the management of that affair  the hall or room where the grand dinner is to be kept as well as the chapter house and chapel ought chiefly to be decked and adorned with rich and umptuous furnture against this solemnity over and above what is commonly used the hall or dining room is to be set off with rich hangings and if the sovereign or his lieutenant hold the feast there must be placed a cloth of state at the upper end of it the chapter house is also to be hung and a rich carpet spread upon the table set about with velvet chairs and cushions and because in the late times of rebellion and plunder this place was not exempr and nothing was found there upon the rsturation king charles ii in a chapter convened the  o january anno   th of his reign caused directions to be given to the master of the wardrobe to provide velvet for chairs to furnish the chapter house and cushions to be used in the choir of st georges chapel which accordingly were prepared against the following feast  against the installation of philip king of castile and leon anno    henry vii the table in the chapter house was covered with cloth of gold and the forms with baudkin before the sovereign was laid a cushion of cloth of gold whereupon a crucifix lay and the evangelist turned open to a place of the cannon with several tapers burning on either side at the upper end of the table toward the right hand was set a chair for the sovereign under a golden canopy with cushions of cloth of gold and on the left hand a stool with like embellishments for the king of castile  in st georges chapel the high altar is to be richly adorned with plate the sovereigns stall with a canop and other usual ornaments and the stalls of the knightscompanions present at the ceremony with velvet cushions as to the furnishing of other places in the castle of windsor on so solemn an occasion we shall relate the account of the ceremony of the installation of the king of leon and castile just now mentioned the words are thse  to wit of the great rich cobbord which continually stood in the great hall which was all gult plate or of the great and rich beds of estate hangings of rich cloth of old or of the rich and sumptuous clothes of arras with diverse clothes of estate both in the king s loggings and in the king of castiles loggings so many chambers haulls chapels closettes galleries with odir loggings so richly and very well appointed with diverse odir things that i suffice or cannot discern and as i suppose few or none that there were that ever saw castle or odir loggings in all things so well and richly appointed and the great continual fare open household so many noble men so well appareilled and with so short warnying heretofore as i think has not been seen  cap xii the personal installation of a knightsubject   formerly the knights elect proceeded from london to their installation at windsor in the nature of a solemn and stately cavalcade which was performed on horseback with the greatest grandeur and exceeding pomp whether we refer to the great number of their honorable friends who on gallant coursers rode along with them or the multitude of their own attendants well mounted the magnificence of whose apparel jewels gold chains rich embroideries and plumes of feathers of their lords colors struck amazement and even dazzled the eyes of the spectators  equivalent to this pompous show was the feast which contained in it all manner of stateliness and plenty as well of provision as other incidents that might increase its glory in which the elect knights who kept it at their own expense strove not only to outvie their predecessor but to excel one another that all ambassadors and strangers esteemed it one of the goodliest and noblest sights that was to be exhibited in christendom  but to make the splendour of the cavalcade no less conspicuous to the city of london than to the town and castle of windsor the knights elect have taken up their lodgings sometimes in the strand sometimes in salisburycourt in holborn or within the city and for intent they chose to pass through some eminent streets that the people might the better survey them and receive the greater satisfaction to illustrate which matter we shall descend to some particulars  anno    eliz gilbert earl of shrewsbury in order to his cavalcade was lodged in mr greshams house now known by the name of greshamcollege whence he rode through the city accompanied with many of his honorable friends and a numerous and gallant train of attendants and servants to charing cross where he met george earl of cumberland his companion elect and thence both rode together toward windsor within a mile or two of which place garter king of arms me them and marshalled their attendants in order and then the elect knights proceeded with their gallant tran through the town into the castle in this order    trumpets two and two   gentlemen in blue coats and gold chains   gentlemen of note   garter   gentlemen ushers   the two elect knights earl of ormond and baron of effingham with their footmen about them   noblemen knights and gentlemen of quality   all their servants in the rear custom and peace contributed to make the cavalcades more glorious during the reigns of queen elizabet and king james i and especially that o robert earl of salisbury and thomas viscount bindon may   st ano   jac i who arrived at windsor honourabl accomanied with a great appearance of nobility knights and gentlemen of figure  but the fate of this solemnity much like that glorious body of the sun whose luster at such times it stroe to outshine had now and then its interpositions and intermitting clouds at other times long nights and the splendour and glory thereof but struck the sight now and then when the pleasure of the sovereign grew auspicious or the honor of the order became fixed upon more generous sirits but to speak imartially there may grow an excess in such solemnities even to shme and surfeit and the best cure to prescribe for it is a long abstinence nor was this festial at all times ree from this distemper but then a quick application of the sovereigns soon rectified it by taking away the cause and prohibiting excess in their attendants  for this reason it was that king james i observing those excesses the elect knights run ino upon this occasion and willing to cheque the growing inconveniences at the installation of francis earl of rutland sir george villars knight afterward duke of buckingham and the viscount lisle anno    of his reign fobid livery coats for saving charge and avoiding emulation and shortly after in a chapter at witehall anno    with the consent of the knightscompanions then assmbled to put some restraint upon the number of attendants decreed that every of the knightscompanions should have fifty persons to attend him unto the annual solemnities of the oder and no more  in the installation of william earl of northampton anno   car i we find this stinted number increased to fourscore who began his cavalcade to windsor from salibury house in the strand and certainly would have exhibited a more glorious show had not a continual rain for three days space impeded him nevertheless that what he designed with so much splendour and

somerset house in the strand to windsor castle when king charles ii was to have been installed which though it proved abortive yet ought not to be omitted by reason of the chancellors letter to each knightcompanion to make preparation to attend him thither  may it please your lordship the kings majesty sovereign of this most noble order of the garter having determine to create the prince his eldest son knight and to propose him in election to be a companion of his order for the better convenience of his istallation has rorogued by a commission under the sel of his order given the  th of february now remaining in my custody the celebration of the feast of st george from the       and    of april next whereon it should have been solemnized unto the       and    of may immediately ensuing and thereby given command to all the knightscompanions and officers of this order that they should attend his royal person at his palace of white hall upon those days appointed in discharge of the duty of my place and by special order i do signify unto your lordship his majestys will and that it is his pleasure for the more honor of the prince and the noble feast of his election and installation that your lordship should be attended with your servants and retinue according to solemn custom and be prepared to accompany his higness from somerset house in the strand unto the castle of windsor upon the   th of that month and assist at the ceremony and feast of his installation upon the day following praying your lordship that you would be pleased to take knowledge hereby both of the time and place designed and of the sovereigns order i humbly rest  in all due obedience and observance thomas row st martins lane feb          when this letter was issued out the sovereign intended to create the prince knight of the bath which ceremonies were intended to begin at the old palaceyard in westminster upon the   st day of may anno    car i and to solemnize the feast of st george upon the   d of the same month at white hall and to take the scrutiny that evening for his election into this order the next day was designed to invest him with the garter and george and the day after to set forward the cavalcade toward windsor wherein also the knights of the bath intended to be created with the prince were to ride with their robes but this resolution being altered stopped the progression of the cavalcade and in the room of a knight of the bath he was created a knightbatchellor at windsor  formerly it was the manner for the sovereigns lieutenant to ride to windsor attended with a gallant and glittering train and no small number of his own gentlemen and yeomen richly attired and in every punctilio lio fifty set out as was seen in the cavalcade of the duke of norfolk earl marshal of egland and lieutenant for the sovereign for st georges feast anno   eliz who had attending him twenty of his own gentlemen and yeomen at the time the earls of northumberland and warwick were to be installed but this was never put in practice but when the sovereign appointed the istallation and the feast of st george to be celebrated together  the lieutenant and his assistants or sometimes the knightscommissioners if the feast of st george be not then solemnized being arrived in the castle immediately retire to their lodgings which for the most part have been prepared at the deans house whose rooms are the fairest in the castle and the best tted for accommodation next to those of the sovereigns in the uper ward and for the knights elect they were at all times furnished with lodgings in some of the prebends houses  the offering in the chapel on the eve of the fest   if it so chanced that the installation was performed by commissioners and the cavalcade proceeded from london in the morning of the day receeding the installation and arrived at the castle of winsor early that afternoon then the knightscmmissioners have been accustomed only to put on their mantles and entr st grges chapel to offer but without the attendance of heralds or any solemn procession into the choir sae one of the prebends where having placed themselves in their stalls with usual reverences and heard an anthm they passed up to the altar ith the verger and garter before them and there made their offerig both of gold and silver according to the usual custom as soon as vspers were finished after the same manner they descended from their stalls and dearted to their lodgings and in this case the knightscommissioners did not lay by their mantles till supper was ended  in this nature was the ceremony of offring on the ee of the instalation performd by the lord admral and earl of omond commissioners for the instllion of the earl of shrewsbury and cumberland anno    eliz but at the installation of the earl of rutland an others anno    eliz the lord hunsdon one of the commissioners for that solemnity refused to make hs ofering alone though he arrived timely enough on the eve o the feast at windsor castle because he wanted the company of viscount mountague who was a joint commissioner with him that arrived not till the morning after  this offering of the knightscommissioners coming to the castle on the eve of the installation is founded upon an article of edward iii which runs to this effect that if any of the knightscompanions being upon a journey should accidentlly pass by windsorcastle he is to turn in thither in honor of the place and prepare himself to enter into the chapel to offer first putting on his mantle without which he must never presume to enter into it but upon emergencies and allowable causes he is to be excused  after the knightcompanion had entered the castle the canons resident were by the aforesaid article appointed to meet and recieve him and with due reverence conduct him into the choir if it was at the celebration of high mass the knight was obliged to stay and hear it in honor of god and st george but if he arrived in the afternoon he was to stay till the canons and the rest of the choir had sung the anthm de profundis which no soner was ended but he proceeded to the high altar and offered and returned to his stall with uual reverences and then departed  but if the knightcompanion passed through the town of indsor and neglected to offer at the chapel as often as he oted i he was bound upon his obedience to walk a me on fot to the chapel in honor of st geoge a upon defailure to offer a penny which by king  viiis statutes is enlarged to a croat upon the expcation of this article tere arose a dispute about the jst distance intended from the castle and that the kightscompanions might be sensible o the reah of the injnction it was thought requisite by king heny viii to set down a certain bound which in his sautes is declared to be two miles within which if any of the knightscompanins come and do not repar to the chapel and offer he is liable to the mulct before specified  upon hunting or other pastimes the forest afforded they used to send their offering in money to the canons which being received the knights took it for a dispensation of the ceremony enjoined by the statues  endeavors were used to have this article interpreted with greater latitude which so far took effect that at a chapter called at windsor the  0th of october anno    car i it was ordered that some expedient might be found out to save the knights from the breach of their oath if they came within the limited distance of the place and passed thence without offering but no farther progress being made in that affair the law stands as it did  the supper of the eve   the supper after their arrival at windsor is but in the nature of a private meal and prepared for the lieutenant or commissioners or knights elect most commonly at the deans house anno    eliz on the eve of the installation of the earl of rutland and lord cobham the commissioners suped together with such lords and gentlemen of figure as came along with them and no nobleman had above one servant to atend him at the table and the rest provided for themselves at their proper inns sometimes they have been permitted to sup in some appartments of the sovereigns lodgings for so it was at the installation of the lord russel and other elect knights anno    henry viii and likewise of the earl of shrewsbury and lord hunsdn anno   eliz the lieutenant and knights supped in the great chamber there in the same regularity that was used at other times and in the   th of queen elizabeth when the earls of shrewsbury and cumberland were installed all the lords and gentlemen supped together at one long table set in the council chamber  the order in proceeding to the chapter house   before we come to the particular ceremonies of the installation transacted either by the sovereign or in his absence by his lieutenant or commissioners we shall premise this general remark that since neither the statutes of institution nor those of king henry v afford us a formulary for the personal installation of a knight elect yet those enacted by king henry viii do briefly exhibit the order and method of it and we must farther observe that if the installation be appointed together with the feast of st george then either the sovereign or else his lieutenant and assistants are present but if at any other season then it passes by commissioners only  after such time therefore as the sovereign his lieutenant or commissioners have prefixed the hour wherein to proceed to the chapter house in order to the installation which has generally been dispatched in the evening all the knightscompanions and elect knights the officers of the order and of arms the prebends of the college and almsknights are to give their attendance viz the knightscompanions and elect knights and officers of the order on the sovereign in his inward lodging the elect knights and officers of arms in the presence chamber the prebends and almsknights in the great chamber where they waited the sovereigns coming forth  the attendance to be given upon the sovereigns lieutenant and such of the knightscompanions as are appointed for his assistants is by the officers of the order and of arms the prebends and almsknights either at his lodgings or elsewhere he shall deem meet to appoint from which the knightscompanions are exempt for though the knightscompanions have sometimes proceeded to the chapel before the sovereigns lieutenant at an installation yet has it been at such time only as they accompanied their sovereign to windsor to hold the feast of st george and if the sovereign through any indisposition or weighty affair could not pass down to the chapel on the eve of the feast yet they being obliged by the statutes to celebrate vespers did upon this occasion proceed thither though not upon the account of installation as it fell out at the installation of prince henry and four other knights anno   jac i when the progression began from the presence chamber and thence passed to the chapel in the following order    almsknights   prebends   pursuivants   heralds   ulster king of arms   lion king of arms   clarenceux king of arms   the four elect knights   knights companions  0 garter    register    black rod    chancellor    the sovereigns lieutenant leading the prince in his hand at the installation of the duke of brunswick and five other elect knights the   d of november anno   car i the knightscompanions like wise proceeded before the sovreigns lieutenants though the sovereign was at windsor but not in the cavalcade  upon the sovereigns commissioners neither the knightscompanions nor the prelate nor chancelor do give their attendance only at the grand feast of s george anno    car ii the chancellor then waiting on the sovereign at windsor in the duties of his place out of a singular regard to his royal highness the duke of york attending the commissioners in the proceeding to his installation for at that time he was comptroller of his household  the proceedings on this solemn occasion have been generally ordered on foot yet upon extraordinary incidents have been marshalled and disposed on horseback in manner of a cavalcade as was ued at the installation of philip king of castile anno    hen vii and that when the lord russel and other elect knights were installed anno    hen viii king philip when the earl of sussex was installed anno   and   ph and mar honored him with his presence and riding on horseback with several of the knightscompanions from his lodgings in the castle down to the cloister door at the east end of the chapel and there alighting proceeded directly to the chapter house the proceeding was on horseback at the installation of the earl of shrewsbury and the lord hunsdon anno   eliz and at the earl of nortumberlands and earl of wawicks anno   at the installatin of francis duke montmorency the viscount hereford and the lords buleigh gray and shandos anno    eliz the sovereigns lieutenant and knights assistants did robe themselves in the sovereigns lodging in the castle and meeting in the presence chamber proceeded downwards toward the uer halldoor in the upper ward of the castle when taking their horses adorned with foot clothes they proceeded on horeback to the west door of the chapel  if the progression was begun on horseback at the beginning of the feast so it continued as often as the sovereign his lieutenant or commissioner went to the chapter house or chapel and their returns were marshalled in the like order at their setting out  the servants and attendants belonging to the knights elect if they be taken into the procession pass on first two and two in a rank according to their quality and those who are the most inferior the foremost next the alm knights in their habits and usual order  then follows the virger of the college  after him the prebends or canons but what attendance they have given heretoore at the installatins the memoirs of this illustrious society is wholly silent in for in those schemes let us of proceeding to installations in the reigns of king henry viii king edward vi queen mary and part of queen elizabeth we find them no inserted though since they are next to the prebends of the college the pursuivants heralds and provincial kings of arms proceed i a body  after them the knightssubjects elect unless the prctor of an absent kightsubjct pass at the same time in this pceding who take place after the provincial kings and i i so chnce that the prctor to a stragerpe be present at the same time he is to proceed between the knightsubjects proctor and the knightssubject elect but prince henry at his installation anno   jac i moved in a place superior to all the knightscompanions and was paired with the earl of nottingham the sovereigns lieutenant for that occasion where two or more elect knights prepare for their installation at the same time they take place according to the seniority of their election going two and two together and if the number be odd the junior elect knight paseth alone formerly the elect knight passed in his ordinary apparel wearing over it in days of yore a short gown afterward a cloak and of latter times a coat as did the earl of northumberland anno   eliz and the earls of pembrook and derby anno    eliz and the annals of the order make this remark upon the earl of sussex and the lord buckhurst anno    of eliz of charles duke of york an   jac i but this was before any peculiar under habi was appointed to the knightscompanions for now there being a cloth of silver doublet and trunk hose established to be worn at the feast of installation and of st george the elect knight proceeds in this dress as did the duke of albermarle anno    car ii  in this proceeding to the chapter house he wears only the garter about his leg and the george and the rbbond wherewith he was invested either about his neck or as of late drawn under his right arm which being oitted by sir george villars and viscount lisle is noted to be contrary to order  the earl of rutland with his fellow elect knights anno    jac i proceeded barheaded as did the duke of lenox anno   car i as well as the duke of albermarle anno    car ii  the elect knight does not always make one in this proceeding but sometimes stays at his lodgings in the castle as did the earls of shrewsbury and cumberland anno    eliz or else at some other convenient station adjoining to the chapter house till he be sent for in thither to receive investiture with the surcoa as the duke o montmorency did and other elect knights anno    eliz who went privately from the sovereigns lodgings down to the house of mr french then one of the prebends and rested in the parlour unil they were sent for sometimes the knight elect goes privately into the eastisle of the chapel behind the high altar and there remains till called in as did the duke of monmouth ann    car ii  if the sovereign be present at the installation the knightscompanions proceed next after the knights elect according to the order of their stalls but if the sovereigns lieutenant then his assistants go in their places as at the installation of the earl of shrewsbury and lord hunsdon anno   eliz makes plain the proceeding being ordered after this manner    vergers   almsknights   officers of arms   electknights   assistants to the lieutenants   officers of the order   earl of arundel lieutenant if the installation be dispatched by commissioners then the three inferior officers of the order immediately follow the knight elect and proceed next before the commissioners and they were thus marshalled at the installation of the earl of northampton anno   car i    the earls servants   almsknights   prebends   heralds   electknights   officers of the order   the sovereigns commissioners yet anno    eliz at the installation of the earls of pembrook and derby we find the officers did recede the elect knights but it was through inadvertency at the istallation of the earl of northampton some qestion and date arose cncerning the precedence of thee three officers in this proceeding where it was at length concluded that from the castle to the chapel they should proceed before the commissioners ut in returning from the chapel to the castle they should follow  we presume the question whatsoever it was chanced not to be propounded till the proceeding was ready to pass on and then started on a sudden because the heralds as the annals note did not quickly discypher the matter that it proceeded more from surprise than want of ability to resolve  this determination which took place was barely grounded upon conjecture and if seriously considered will appear disconsonant to precedents and practice both before and since where all returns are marshalled answerable to their setting forth unless the condition of any person in the mean time suffer a mutation  it is observable that when installation pass by commissioners only these three inferior officers wear their robes but bear not the ensigns of their office in the proceeding and this seems to be deduced from particular injunctions laid down in the constitutions belonging to the officers of the order which appoint garter an blackrod to bear the ensigns of their offices at the feast of st george when the sovereign or his deputy shall be present whence it may be inferred that if either chance to be absent they are under no obligation to bear them for at the installations of frederick king of denmak and john casimire count palatine of the rhine anno    eliz no ensigns were born by the officers and so was it practiced the year after at the installations of the earl of rutland and lord cobham as the redbok of order plainly sets forth but if the sovereign himself be present or that he constitute a leutenant in his stead the register then carries the redbook and the garter and the blackrod bear each of them their rds it is remarkable that in every proceeding to installatin b lieutenant or commissioners the garter ces the sovereigns commission in his hand before them to the chapterhose at the installation of the earls of derby and meton the officers of the order proeeded beoe the knights to the chapter house not on without the ensigns of their office but their heads cored and the reoter of this inallation gives this for a easn because there was then neither the sovereign nor his lieutenat representing the kings person prt  the sovereign sometimes being willing to confer additional honors to some elect knights has appointed their installation at such time as he personally solemnized the feast of st george as he did at the installation and election of philip king of castile anno    hen vii which for its memorableness and mixed proceeding on horseback we shall insert in this place he passed from the sovereigns lodging in the castle to the southdoor of st georgeschappel and was thus ordered    knights according to their degrees   lords after their degrees   knightscompanions in their whole habi bearing company with some of the knights of the orde of joyson d or   prelate of the order   archbishop of canterbury   the spanish ambassador   joyson d or king of arms in coat of arms   garter king of arms in his coat of arms   the sword  0 philip king of castile    the prince    king henry vii sovereign of the order anno    jac i was another instance at the feast of st george when the sovereign with several knightscompanions proceeded also to the chapel at the personal installation of frederick prince palatine of the rhine we might add several other examples but shall only mention that of the personal appearance of king charles ii at the grand feast of st george held next after his happy restoration whereat twelve elect knights were stalled at this solemnity of installation the sovereign proceeds in full robes having the sword of state bon before him by a nobleman not of the order his trainbearers etc following the sovereigns lieutenant and his assistants as also the commissioners proceed in full robe which is mentioned anno    henry viii when the earl of arundel and his assistants installed the lord russel and two other elect knights but the sovereigns lieutenan only has his train carried up which is usually performed by some of his own gentlemen  the processional way if beginning in the presence chamber is from thence in the upper ward f the castle and through the other wards in at the cloister dr and so to the chapter house but if from the deans house they go only through the cloisters into which there is an immediate passage from the deanery the proceeding having entered the east door of st georges chapel and past by the chapter house door makes a stand in the north isle while first the offiers of the order next the knightscommissioners or else the knightsassistants and the sovereigns lieutenant or lastly the knightscompanions and the sovereign with the sword born before him pass into the chapter house but the knight or knights elect do not enter but as they come in at the chapeldoor they fall off on the left hand into the east isle behind the high altar and there repose themselves on chairs or stools with cushions urposely prepared until they are called into the chapter house this has generally been the custom of which many examples might be produced but in respect to great personages they have been sometimes though rarely admitted into the chapter house with the sovereign or his lieutenant among whom philip of castile and leon anno    henry vii and prince henry anno   jac i the latter was led in by the sovereigns lieutenant when four other elect knights instaed with him sat till they received their summons to enter  sometime the sovereign and knightscompanions waved going to the chapter house and passed immediately into the choir as did king james anno   when charles duke of york and others were installed the like did king charles i but then a chapter was held in the privychamber before the proceeding set forward and in the former instance when the proceeding came as far as the east end of the chapel the duke of york etc with norry before them went out of the proceeding into the chapter house and there reposed while the sovereign oceeded on to the south door of the chapel and thence unto the choir  the ceremonies performed in the chapter house   after the lieutenants entrance into the chapter house and opening the chapter garter with three reverences presents first the commissioners of lieutenancy to hold the feast next that of installation to the lieutenant or if the installation passed by commissioners then only the commission of installation to the senior commissioner which being received he delivers it to the register of the order who forthwith reads it for to him this duty belongs as is recorded in the blackbook of the order on occasion of garters reading the commission for installation of sir thomas brandon anno    henry vii the register being then absent  when the register has read the commissions he returns them to the lieutenant or commissioners and he again to the garter as at the installation of the earls of shrewsbury and cumberland anno    eliz if the sovereign be present the chancellor acquaints him the knights elect are without otherwise the lieutenant and asistants or commissioners consult touching the calling in and receiving them and garter is usually employed in this service who with all due respect compliments and conducts him to the chapter house door but in the instance of the earls of shrewsbury and cumberland aforesaid garter went to their lodgings and having delivered his message they forthwith repaired to the chapter house their train attending them to the door at the installation of francis duke of montmorency the eal of leicester then the sovereigns lieutenant as an evidence of singular respect sent from the chapter two of the four assistants assigned him who taking garter and the officers of arms before them led him thence between them to the chapter house  when there are two or more elect knights that wait in the east isle expecting to be called i garter first cnducts the senior by election to the chapter house door and so the rest in their several orders as in    jac i by the earl of rutland sir george villars and the vicount lisle and so again    car ii as soon as garter has conducted the elect knight to the chapterhoue door two of the commissioners when the installation is performed by commissioners or two of the knightsassistants when by the sovereigns lieutenant or two of the senior knights if the sovereign himself be present receive him without who is immediately conducted from the chapter house door up to the sovereign his lieutenant or commissioners to whom he makes humble reverence when the lieutenant or senior commissioners in a short speech publishes the effect of his commission and declares to him the sovereigns bounty and ready kindness in a full admittance into this honorable society which the elect knight very humbly acknowledges and accepts when philip king of castile and leon was installed in person anno    henry vii the sovereign being present rose from his throne and gave him information of the statutes and ceremonies of the order and how he was bound by them to all which he freely and readily assented  these ceremonies of receiving an elect knight being over he disrobes himself of his upper garment then the surcoat and kirtle is taken from the table with which he is invested and during this ceremony the following words of admonition entered at the end of king hen viiis book of english statutes are read or spoken  take this robe of purple to the increase of your honor and in token or sign of the most honorable order you have received wherewith you being defended may be bold not only strong to fight but also to offer your self to shed your blood fr christs faith the liberties of the church and the just and necessary defense of them that are oppressed and needy  after this his sword is close girt about him over his surcoat by the commissioners or the assistants to the lieutenan or some of the knightscompanions and sometimes in the way of assistance garter has done this service and as soon as the ceremony is over the sovereign or his lieutenant proceeds into the choir leaving the elect knights behind them the hood was heretoore put on in the chapter house for so the statutes of king henry viii do appoint after the elect knight has been invested with his surcoat and before he proceeded to his installation but of late because it must be taken off again in the choir and laid aside that the mantle may be put on it has been esteemed a sort of diminution in the investiture to take off any part of the habit before the whole investiture be completed so that in the beginning of the reign of king james i it was judged more convenient that the hood should be carried on the cushion by garter into the choir together with the mantle and collar and not be put on till after investiture with the mantle and thus it was observed at the feasts of st george       and    car ii and though anciently it was laid over the left shoulder and so worn upon all occasions yet anno   and   phil and mar the wearing it so being taken notice of to obscure the escutcheon of st george embroidered on the same shoulder of the mantle it was decreed in a chapter held the same year    of april that for the future the knightscompanions should wear their hoods on their right shoulders to the end that the escutcheon might be the better seen and appear  nevertheless there was a question moved    jac i whether the usage of wearing the hood should not be restored to the left shoulder but it seems it was overruled and    car ii some of the knightscompanions imagining it most proper to wear their hoods on their left shoulders ran into that error but upon better information the next morning altered them to the right to foreign princes there is liberty given by king hen viiis statutes to receive if they please their habit wholly within the chapter house before they enter their stalls by which it appears that this was the custom in times past an instance whereof we have in philip king of castile anno    henry vii who was entirely invested in the chapter house with the garter surcoat mantle hood and collar the sovereign himself putting his hand to his investiture with the mantle hence king philip grandson to the aforesaid king of castile was invested with the whole habit of the order before he assumed the stall in philip and marys proceeding to the chapel he received his investiture within the west door and there the register delivered the mantle to the earls of derby and pembrook who kissing it presented it to the queen who assisted by the said earls personally invested the king therewith next garter gave the collar to the earls of arundel and pembrook who likewise presented it to the queen and she thereon put it about king philips neck and immediately the knightscompanions having robed themselves within the chapel door proceeded before the king and queen who with joined hands passed into the choir where the queen led him to the sovereigns stall which ascending they both sat therein but as the aforesaid statute leaves this to the pleasure of the stranger prince and was permitted only for gaining time so none who have received personal installation at windsor since have been fully invested before they entered the choir for instance francis duke de montmorency    eiz and frederick prince palatine of the rhine  0 jac i were both invested with their surcoats only in the chapter house but they received their mantles hoods and collars in their stalls after they had taken their oaths  the proceeding into the choir   the knight elect habited as before proceeds from the chapter house along the north isle and enters the west door of the choir in solemn order but his place in this proceeding is changed for here he is led between two knightscompanions this is noted in the blackbook to be the order wherein albra vasques dalmadea earl of averence and two others proceeded to their installations    henry vi and notwithstanding the statutes of institution and those made by king henry v are silent in the order of this proceeding yet for an elect knight to be led to his stall between two fellow knights is no modern ceremony since we likewise find that the vicount burchier  0 henry vi past to his instalment between the lord hastings and lord beauchamp but the order of proceeding is precisely set down in henry viiis statutes viz that the elect knight attended by his gentlemen and servants shall be led between two other knightscompanions the officers of the order going before them and this has been the constant practice at all installations since the knight elect prceeding either between two of the knightscommissioners when there has been no lieutenant or between two of the knights assistants where a lieutenant was constituted or lastly between the two senior knightscompanions the sovereign being present but when there has been three commissioners named then the two senior commissioners take the knight elect between them and the junior knightcommissioner proceeds before them which was observed at the instalment of the earls of essex and ormond and sir christopher hatton  0 eliz  in all cases where the sovereign is present at an installation after the custom of investing with the collar in the chapter house was left off it is generally to be observed that as soon as the investiture with the surcoat is finished the sovereign passes from the chapter house into the choir with the whole proceeding before him leaving the elect knight behind and when he and the knightscompanions have taken their stals the two senior knightscompanions by the sovereigns verbal directions descend from their stalls and stand under their banners whilst the almsknights but not the prebends officers of arms and the three inferior officers of the order pass out of the choir and proceed before them to the chapter house from whence they introduce the elect knight into the choir to his installation but if there be more than one knight installed then the two next senior knights descend and so the next till all the elect knights are conducted in and this course is likewise observed when a lieutenant is cnstituted and has been generally so practiced since the investiture with the collar was performed in the choir and particularly at the installations of the duke of lenox the ears of pembrook mar and southampn   jac i and of the duke of holstein and the earl of northampton   jac i in this proceeding to installation the register usually carries a book of the new testament for the elect knight to take his oath on as likewise the oath it self fairly written on parchment garter bears his mantle till he arrives at his stall and king henry viiis statutes place this service upon some of the knightscompanios likewise but it never appears that it was ever performed by any of them it is probable that about the time when this injunction passed it was the custom for garter to bear the mantle on his arm for so it was at the installation of the lord russel and others    henry viii but it was not long after that the laying it on a velvet cushion began the great collar of the order was likewise laid upon the cushion at the installation of sir henry sidney   eliz the earl of shrewsbury    eliz and in this manner born before the knights eect    car ii before the duke of monmouth    car ii and before the duke of albermarle    car ii with these the hood heretofore put on in the chapterhuse has of late been laid on the cushion and also the book of statuts and so born by garter before prince henry   jac i and frederick elect or palatine  0 jac i and before the knights installation    car ii and since  and here it is to be observed that when garter bears the ornaments and ensigs on the cushion before an elect knight or a proctor he is always placed betwee the register and blackrod in the proceeding lastly in this proceeding the knight elect goeh bareheaded holding his cap in his hand and so did he duke of albermarle    car ii for it hah been thought incongrous to the order of investiture as is before observed of the hood to put on any part of the habit or other ornamens that must be taken off again before the investitue is completed and the proper pace for putting on the cap is not till all the other is finished  the ceremonies of installation   when the proceeding has entered the choir the almsknights and officers of arms make their obeysances toward the high altar and the sovereigns royal stall in the manner hereafter described then they proceed to the steps before the alar an divide themselves next the officers of the order make the same reverence and lastly the two commissioners or knights assistants or knightscompaios and knightselect all three together after this the officers of the order turn aside toward the sta designed or the elect knight and approaching near it stand below in the choir whilst the commissioners or assistant or knightscompanion pass into the lower row of stalls sometimes called the midde row directly under the designed stall leading the elect knight with them who in this place takes his oath called in the annals the sacred oath of the order of the garter during which time he ought to stand between the two knightscompanions who brought him thither as at the installation of prince henry   jac i and when the earl of shrewsbury was installed    eliz it is observed that the senior commissioner first entered the lower row of stalls but    henry viii at the installation of the lord russel and others the junior assistant went up first the knght elect being thus placed the register of the order standing before them but below in the choir reads the oath for it is part of his duty to administer the same and in this solemn ceremony the new testament whereon the oath is taken generally opened in some place of the gospels is indifferently held by one of the three inferior officers of the order or sometimes the register has held it as at the installation of the earl of derby    eliz the earl of rutland and lord cobham    eliz at other times the garter has held it as   eliz when the earl of northumberland took his oath and  0 car i at the installaion of the earl of moreton but when the earl of shrewsbury was sworn    eliz the usher of the black rod performed this office  whilst the oath is administering the elect knight holds his right hand on the holy evangelists and when the register has pronounced the words he immediately responses i will so help me god and then takes off his hand reverenly kissing the book and by this ceremony seals his obligation to the statutes of this most noble order the ceremony used when philip king of castile and leon took the oath which was done in the chapter house at windsor    henry vii he laid hs hand on the cnon under which was placed the book of statutes of the order by the prelate to whom it was delivered b the register and having repeated the words of the oath and reverentl kied all those things by which he swore he took a pen from the prelates hand and signed the oath he had taken and delivered it to the sovereign then present  the form of the ancient oath appinted by the statutes of institution to be taken by a knightsubject was very short but comprehensive that he should well and faithfully observe to the utmost of his power all the statutes of the order and this was all the oath taken by the first founders and to which they also affixed their seals and so it continued without alteration or addition till toward the end of king edward ivs reign and then at a chapter held at the kings wardrbe in london it was decreed that all the knightscompanions then alive and all such as should afterward be admitted into the order should be obliged to sujoin the words following that they would aid support and defend with all their power the royal college of st george within the castle of windsor as well in its pssssions as all other things whatsoever which being drawn in form was entered in the black book but has since received many alterations and there is an instance   eliz when the oath has been dispensed with as by the duke o norfolk and others in regard the rites and ceremone of religion were then altered and no new form of an oath settled so that they only obliged themselves by promie to observe such statutes and orders as should be decreed in the next council of the order which was soon after settled and recorded in the red book of the order and is the oath taken by a knightsubject at this day  you being chosen to be one of the honouable company of this most noble order of the garter shall pomise and swear by the holy eangelists by you here touched that wittingly or willingly you shall not break any statute of the said order or any articles in them contained the same being agreeable and not repugnant to the laws of almighty god and the laws of this realm as fr forth as to you belongs and appertains so help you god and this holy word  as soon as the knight elect has taken the oath he is led to his appointed sall through the entrance ext beneath it and there placed before it in the ineim garter advancing into the lower row of stalls to the place where the elect knight stood when he took the oth presents from thence the mantle collar and book of statutes to those who led him who invest the knight elect first with the mantle by putting it on his shoulders there are some examples where the elect knight has been invested before he went up to his stal as in the case of the earl of northumberland   eliz francis duke de montmorency and others    eliz the earls of dunbar and montgmery   jac i and the prince of wales    car i among which may be numbered those installed at the grand feast of st george    car ii but this happened through a vast concourse of people in the chapel that prevented the due order  in the red book it is observed that the investiture with the mantle and collar has been sometimes performed by the black rod as at the insallation of the earl of nothampton   car i the lord treasurer weston the earls of exeter and lindsey and the marquess of hamilton   car i nevertheless this is to be understood as this officers assistance to the knightscompanions whose office it only is and no otherwise whilst the ceremony of investiture with the mantle is performing the words of admonition proper thereto are pronounced as follows  take this mantle of heavenly colors in sign and taken of the most honorable order you have received and to the increase of your honor signed and maked as you see with a red escutcheon of our lords cross to the intent that yo being always defended by the virtue and strength theref may pass through your enemies and them also overcome and vanquish so that at the last for you worthy and appved acts you may after ths temporal chivalry come to eternal triumphant joys in heaven  but at the installation of king charles ii they received some alteration and were put in the following form  rceiv this rbe of heavenly color the livery of this m st excellent order in augmentation of thy honor enobled with the shield and red coss of our lod by wh se power thou may safely pierce toops of thy enemies and be over them ever victorious and being in this tmpral wafae glorious in gregious and herick actions thou may oban eternal and tiumphant jy  next the commissioners assistants or knightscompanions lay the hood on the kights right shuler over the mantle and bringing the tippet athwart his beast tck it under the girdle at which his swrd hangs and lastly tie the collar about his shoulder over his mantle and hood and at this part of the investiture the following words of admonition are likewise pronounced  to the increase of your honor and in token of the honorable order you have received take this collar about your neck with the image of the holy martyr and christs knight st george by whose aid you being defended may pass through the prosperities and adversities of this world that having here the victory as well of your ghostly as bdily enemies you may not only receive the glory and renown of temporal chivalry but also at the last the endless and everlasting reward of victory  this form of words received likewise alteration when king charles ii was to be installed to the teor following  wear this collar about thy nck adorned with the image of the blessed martyr and soldier of christ st george by whose imitation provoked thou may so overpass both prosperous and adverse encountes that having stoutly vanquished thy enemies both of body and soul thou myst not only receive the praise of this trasient cobat but be crowned with the palm of eternal victory  anciently at the solemnity of installation when the sovereign or his lieutenant was present the elect knght after he had been invested with the mantle in his stall was immediately conducted out of the chir back to the chaterhouse where the sovereign or lieutenant used to remain till his return there to receive the collar of the order from one of them which done he is said to have received the entire possession of his habit this is contained in king henry viiis sautes and appears to have been he practice about that time as in the case of the lord mounjoy and others    hen viii and several others after in the   and   edw vi and the     and    eliz the proceeding back to the chapterhue on this occasion was much after the manner of what is before mentioned excet that here the new installed knight took his place according to the dignity of his stall but it is observable that when the sovereigns lieutenant remained in the chapter house while the elect knight proceeded to his installation the usher of the blackrod stayed behind to attend the lieutenant and as soon as the investiture with the collar was over the lieutenant proceeded to the chor in the rear and the new installed knight in place according to his stall as in the case of the lord russel and others    hen viii and the marquess of dorset and others   edw vi the proceeding having entered the choir and the lieutenant and knightscomanion taken their seats then the usual ceremonies the service of the church began  but when the installation was performed by commissioners the collar of the order was laid on the cushion with the mantle and born before the elect knight to his stall where after his investiture with the mantle and hood he received investite with the collar alo of which thre are severl examples in the time of pl and mar and queen eliz in like manner at all intallatns since where the sovereign has been present the acient custom of retuning to the chaterhouse being said aside the knightscompanions who le the elect knights to their stals did there ivest them with ther collars also as the eal of rutland si georg villas and the viscount lisl    jac i and the earl of suffolk   car i and hah been thus observed at all installations since the sovereign present  so soon as the investiture with the mantle hood and collar is over those apoined deliver the book f statutes to the new inested kight which was observed to the ears of swsbuy and cumberland    eliz the earl o rutland sir george villars and the viscount lisle    jac i and so generally to all elect knights since thi book the k ight is to keep safe in his on custody for is inuction in the laws and ceremonies of this mst n le order they lkewise gie him the black vlvet cap adorned with pumes of white fthers and this in articular was observed to be the lst ceremny perme at the istalation of king charles ii  all things lating to the full investiture being ended there remais only to complete this great cermony the instalaion it self which is perfomed in the manner followig the new invested knight standing before his stall and turning toward the high altar makes humble obeisance that way and then toward the sovereign or if absent toward his stall which done the commissioners knightsassistants or knightscomanions receive and embrace him with great civility as their fellow and companion and set him down in his assigned stall with professions of esteem and wishes for his honor and happiness of this ceremony there is a notable instance at the installaton of philip king of castile    henry vii where the sovereign personally introduced him to his stall and there placed him at which time there was a certain form of words pronounced relating to the elect knights session and act of installation no less than at his investiture but the same are not repeated  the order to be observed when two or more knights are installed in one day   in this case it seems to have been the ancient practice when the cmny has been performed by two commissioners or two knightsassistants that as soon as they had finished al the ceremonies due to the senior of them they left him possessed of his stall and forthwith returne to the chapterhoe in the usual manner and thence conducted the next senir elct knigh and so of the rest so it was at the installation of albro vasques dalmadea earl of aveenches the lord beauchamp and sir thomas hoo in the time of heny vi and so of the earl of huntington  edw vi when the two assistants after they had invested and installed the said earl eturned to the chapter house for the lord la war and so for he lord cobam and sir william hebert in like manner when the commissioners had given the proctor to emanuel duke of savoy possession of his prinpals stall   and   phil and mar they proceeded back for william lord howard so by the earl of pembrok    eliz when they had first installed the earl of deby and by the earl of cumbeland after the earl of shrewsbury had been installed  when the sovereign has nominated three commissioners they have returned altogether to stch in the other knights singly that were to be installed and alternately changed their places in the proceeding to the several installations one of them always going single before as at the installation of the earls of essex and ormond and sir christopher hatton  0 eliz when the earl of worcester the lords hunsdon and gray were commissioners and if the lieutenant had four assistants assigned him which was necessary when many knights were to be instaled the order of their installation has been as follows  first two of the senior knightsassistants conducted the senior elect knight to his installation and the other two assistants proceeded with the second elect knight the former then took the third elect knight and so altnately changed till all were installed as at the installation of fancis duke de montmorency and others    eliz and the like manner of alternate change is observed i four commissiners be constituted as at the installaion of frederick king of denmark and john prince palatne of the rhine    eliz where the kings proxy was conducted into the choi between the earl of leicester and the lord hunsdon the two senior commissioners and the prince between the earl of huntington and the lord chrles howard the two jnior comssioners  but some have been of oinion that the commissioners named to ts emloyment ought not to divide the duty and part of them to instal one and part the other and by such an alternatie to dispatch the ceremony as in ormer cae but all jointly asist at each installatin of which opinion there is an instance at the installaton f the earl o  and the viscount bindon   jac i where the  haing been brought into the choir invsted and installed by the earls of nottingham and  the to senior cmmissioners the other two commisioners wh were left behind in the chapter house to conduct the vcount to his stall remembering that all four re jot cmmisioners apprehened that the earl  lgall instaed because they as copartners in  had not asisted and this oinion being  so far that it was agreed to be impared  f salsbuy who submitted to descend into  hi stal and there all fur  ge m his oath again then led him to his stall and a second time invested and installed him and so of the viscount bindon  but this method was not only new but different from former practice as in all the cases before recited and besides where the sovereign has authorized his liutenant to perform this ceremony and appointed some of the knightscompanions to assist they and not the lieutenant have done the duty belonging to installation that part of it of investing with the collar in the chapter house the whole duty at the installation of prince hen y excepted and it is to be farther osered that the foregoing case of the joint assistance in the installation of the earl of salisbury was thought so little essential or worthy of becoming a precedent that at the very next feast when the earls of dunbar and montgomery were installed   jac i and four commissioners appointed the two snir intalled the ea l of dunbar and the two junior the earl of montgomery and so again  0 car i by the earls of danby and moeton but lastly if the sovereign be present and consequentl the knightscompanions perform this ceremon then there s generally so many of them as can go through the whoe without changing after the manner used when done by commissioners or assistants in which case the two senior knightscompanions descend from their stalls and pssing through the choir to the chapter house with the proceeing before them conduct to his installation the eldest elect knight and having performed that whole ceremo  return and take their stalls and so the rest in du  as was practiced at the installation of prince hen and othes   jac i and of the earl of rutland    jac i and at the grnd st of s geoge    cr ii but here the separate rocee n ith eah single knight to and fm the chapter house taking too much time and the day being ar spent in the ceremonies of the dukes of omond and buckngam the sovereign ordered that with the next poceedg the rest of the elect knights beg eigh besides two prxies should all be introduced a once so that each of them being placed before his s took the oath received his investure and was ld up to his stall and took possession of it by solemn instalation  and in regard so many knights elect were introduced together it was judged necessary that their mantles and collars should be likewise brought in the proceeding and each elect knight appointed one of the gentlemen that attended him to bear the cushion whereon they were laid before him to the choir door where they held them in their arms till garter in due order fetched them into the choir and here we may insert this general rule that at all installations where some of the elect knights are not sent for unto the chapter house to receive investiture with the surcoat before the senior elect knight has been conducted to his stall but left to repose themselves in the east isle of the chapel as has often happened the knights commissioners or assistants on their return to the chapter house send garter for the next senior elect knight whom they receive at the door thereof and having invested him with his surcoat and girt his sword about him proceed with him to his installation in the usual manner and the same method is observed if there were more elect knights to follow and we find it  0 henry viii    and    and  0 car i  the knight or knights having now received a complete installation the knightscommissioners assistants or knightscomanions with marks of respect take their leave of the last installed knight and descending into the choi take their own stalls but the senior knightcompanion ascends first but observe that if the salls of the knightscommissioners assistants or knightscompanions be on the ame side with the last installed knight then they descend not into the choir but as directly to them along the stalls as in the    eliz the ceremonies of installation being finished the officers of arms first next the almsknights descend from the steps of the altar and take their several sations in the choir then one of the prebends of the collge or if the soveregn be present the prelate with the sjat of the vestry before him is conducted to the alar by the verger of the chapel and there begins the sre appointed by the church which being ended the proceeding passes out of the choir in usual order either to the presence chamber or the lieutenants or commisioners lodgings as the occasion is  the offering of gold and silver   but if the installation be solemnized in the morning the service of the church having proceeded as far as the offertory two of the prebends appointed to recieve the offering are conducted to the altar by their verger and first the almsknights then the officers of arms ascend the steps of the altar again and stand in order as before after which garter summons down the knightscompanions to the offering who descend into the choir under their proper stalls as does the sovereigns lieutenant who offers first for the sovereign he reeivig the bezant from the senior knight and then retuns to h s stal and at this instant was the usual time heretofore for offering the defunct knights achievements which was altered by king james i as will be seen hereafter  the lieutenant after a short stay in his stall descends again and proceeds up to the altar to make his own offering of gold and silver and then returns as do the rest of the knightscompanions includg those ewly istlled in their due order but when the installation passes by commissioners there is then no offering made for the sovereign but the commissioners offer first and after them the other knights in due order  the ceremony of offering at the installation of philip king of cstile    henry vii is remarkable he descendd from his stall into the chir and standing before i as the other knightscompanions did the sovereign left his royal stall to roceed to the offering to which the king would have followed but the sovereign uld not permit obliging the king to proceed along with him on his left hand though he desired to perform his duty as a brother of the order so that they made their offring o near together where though the soveregn had the precedece yet twas hardly obervable  of the grand dinner at the installation  0 on the day of installation there has from ancient time been appointed a noble and sumptuous feast and though it was agreed on in a chapter   edward vi that the knights elect might from thenceforth be installed by commission without a feast yet after his reign we find the old custom of a feast at this solemnity restored  if the sovereign appoint the installation to be when the feast of st george is also celebrated and is himsef personally present the feast is then kept at the sovereigns charge and if in such case he constitute a lieutenant then the installation dinner is kept at the charge of the lieutenant and is usually prepared in some of the sovereigns lodgings in the castle but seldom in st geoges hal as was done by the earl of arundel at the installation of the ear of shrewsbury and the lord hunsdon   eliz but when the installation is kept at any other time of the year than that of st georges feast then the new installed knights are at all the expense who generally have had the dinner prepared in the deans lodgings however be it where it will the sovereign or his lieutenant commissioners or assistants together with the new installed knights proceed thither in full robes which is observed in the installation of   eliz above to be according to the ancient custom at the installation    henry viii the sovereigns lieutenant walked alone after him his two assistants and lastly the new installed knights  the lieutenants place at the table is somewhat on the let hand the cloth of state there sat the earl of arundel   eliz but the other four knightscompanions his two assistants and the two new installed knights at toward the tables end on both sides for that they could not well sit all on a side but of late years as at the installation   car i a question arose whether the lieutenant or commissioners should sit at dinner in their habits since the power given them seemed to expire when the knights were elected though unanimously allowed the new installed knights ought to do so and likewise precedents quoted as    henry viii at the installation of the lord cromwell where the kights put off their habits and dined in their ordinary apparel and so of the earl of rutland and the lord cobham    eiz where the commissioners did the same and the new installed knights kept on only their surcoats but what followed on this debate is not mentioned but the general practice at other times has been of keeping on the habit till the dinner is ended  at the second course called also second mess or second service garter accompanied with the officers of arms proclaims the styles and tiles of honor of the sovereign if he be personally or by his lieutenant present in latin french and english and cries largess thrice next the styles of the new installed knights in french or english only with two largesses and in that order they were installed and thus it was at the installation of charles duke of york   jac i of frederick prince palatine  0 jac i and the earl of rutland and others    jac i  philip king of castile dined with the sovereign in his privychamber    henry vii whose style was proclaimed by garter not in the same room but at the sovereigns great chamber door and in st georges hall after largess had been thrice cried when the sovereign constitutes a lieutenant then is the lieutenants style also proclaimed and to his other honors is added this of his lieutenancy and afterward the styles of the new installed knights as   eliz but the order of this ceremony is more particularly observed at the installation of the duke de montmorency and others    eliz where first garter cried largess and next proclaimed the sovereigns style etc in three languages then stepping two foot back proclaims the lieutenants style in french only with two largesses and after that he cried one lagess for the duke and lastly for all the other new installed knights only two largesses and the officers of arms did the like and still as garter had finished his procamation the heralds joined with him in crying largess and so with reverence departed the hall  but lastly it is proper to observe that when neither the sovereign nor his lieutenant are present then the soverigns style is not proclaimed nor those of the commissioners but only of the new installed knghts  as soon as dinner is ended the knightscompanions rise from table and wthdraw to disrobe themselves and therewith the solemnity of installation ends and if at any time the solemnity continues that evening and the following day it is only because the sovereign or his lieutenant is present on account of celebrating st geogs feast and not with reference to the installation  of setting up the knights achievements    the last thing to be done at this great solemnity is setting up the helm crest sword banner and plate of the new installed knight over his stall in the chapel of st george to which purpose they are to be provided according to the directions before given  by the statutes of institution it is ordained that the time for setting up the achievements shall be when the elect knight comes to windsorcastle that is to his installation and not before and the reason is there likewise given lest it should happen he not coming for his installation within the time limited and consequently the vacating his election ensuing that a new election being made those military ensigns might not seem to be disgracefully withdrawn and an occasion of dishonor given which otherwise could not be avoided if they should be suddenly taken down from a place so high which demonstrates that the intention of this article extends to the finishing the ceremonies of installation before the achievements ought to be set up by so carefully providing against the dshonour of taking them down in case the election should become void which must infallibly happen if the kight elect died but an hour before he were completely installed accordingly in the ancient deputations both to sir william philip and sir john falstaff power is given their proctors first to demand receive and obtain their principal stalls and next to tender their helms and swords to be hung up in the choir of windsor according to custom and for clearer information of the course of this ceremony that the sovereign empowered his commissiers first to give the deuty possession of his principals stall and after to receive the achievements and place them over it this is to be considered as a memorial of the knights being installed a companion of the order and it is incongruous in the rules of honor to have the sign or a memorial of an action precede the action it sef  again the statutes expressly provide that the knghs achievements shall not be hung up till the dues and fees enjoined are first discharged and it is certain there are no fees due nor can be claimed till the ceremonies on which they become due are entirely finished but to clear all doubts which may arise upon this point it was at a chapter held at white hall the fourth of february    car ii ordained that not any of the achievements of an elect knights stall be set up in the chapel at windfor before he be installed and the fees of installation paid  and though this was the practice anciently yet were the achievements always prepared and brought to windsor and set before the elect knights stall and in case of his not coming to receive installation then being no otherwise placed they might be the easier removed without the choir in as decent manner as could be so that the honor of knighthood might be preserved entire nevertheless to be retained for public use and the benefit of the college  where mention is made in the annals of any person employed to set up the achievements of a knight it is to be understood that he was his proctor and installed on his behalf and there appears but one single instance where one person has hung up a knights achievements when another was installed for him and this happened   th of august anno    hen vi where the lord rivers having been elected to the stall of the lord hungerford his sword and helm were soon after sent hung up by william bobden his esquire and guyen herald and he installed the  0 october following by sir william crafford his proctor but this was contrary to the law of the order  whre the setting up of a knights achievements is arly mntoned without taking notice of the installation i i to e uerstood that such knights installation was ao solemzd at that time as in the case of the king of portugal of whom the annals only note that he had taken care to set over his stall helm sword and banner and al things belonging thereto at the feast at windsor  henry vi in what manner these achievements are ixed appears by the statutes the helm and cest to e set over each knightcompanions stall and the sword to hang directly under them but the plate to be nailed to the back of the knights sll  cap xiii the installation of a knightsubject by proxy the original cause of making proxies   there was no liberty given at the institution of the order for a knightsubject to be installed by his proctor or deputy but on the contrary in the founders statutes was inserted this express prohibition that none of the knights elect should be permitted to be installed by proxy unless he were a stranger and this law continued unaltered till the reign of henry v when john duke of bedford the sovereigns deputy for holding the feast of st george at windsor   henry v and other the knightscompanions then present took it into consideration that where a knightsubject elected into the order was at that time employed beyond sea in the service of his prince and likely to continue in that service some time it was agreed that the said duke should make an address to the sovereign by letters under the seal of the order he being then employed in the war against france that in the like cases his majesty would ordain that knightssubjects might as well as strangers be admitted into the order notwitstanding the clause in the statutes  it likewise appears from that letter as well as from the bluebook that sir john gray and the lord bourchier had been installed at the aforesaid feast by their several proxies which the sovereigns deputy concurred with out of great respect to their persons left by a too rigid observance of the statutes by their absence in the wars where they were then loyally employed and might meet their deaths they should want the desired suffrages of those masses ordained to be sung for a defunct knight as had happened to several by unsuspected delays but to clear this mater for the future it was decreed   hen v that where any elect knight was actually in the sovereigns wars or otherwise employed abroad on his sovereigns affairs he should possess the privilege of a stranger in this particular which decree was added to king henry vths statutes and it was son after enjoined the elect knight on notice of his election to take care timely to appoint his proctor that he might enjoy the rights and privileges of a founder such an obligation was laid on sir john falstaff who at the reception of the garter was in france employed in the sovereigns service  but king henry viii besides his confirmation of this decree for allowance of a proxy in the aforesaid two cases farther enlarged it to such as the sovereign should either command or permit license to be installed by proxy which is to be understood of knights elect within the kingdom as well as those beyond sea by virtue of which clause the elect knight the earl of dorset being sick   car i obtained the sovereigns license to be installed by his deputy sir richard young  letters of procuration   it is observed before out of the registrum chartaceum that sir john robesart elected into the order by king henry v was installed by virtue of his letter missive sent to sir thomas bar his proxy but the same register calls it in another place a sufficient procuration under his seal of arms enabling him to perform the ceremony of his installation  the copy of this instrument is not extant but that letter missive sir john gray directed to sir john lisle to take possession of his stall and by virtue of which he was installed tells him he had chosen him for his proxy and to take his stall for him in his name etc and omitting other precedents doubtless in the cae of a knightsubject the sovereign may if he pleases nominate and appoint a proxy for installation where the elect knight has not done it himself for here all those considerations of grand respect forms of the oath etc constantly afforded to strangers have no place which is evident from the sovereigns letters of summons to the commsioners named for installation of the lord gray   and   phil and mar who at that time was prisoner in fance and his deputy sir humphry radcliffe is therein mentioned to be appointed by the sovereign herself  the first precedent of letters of procuration or depuation drawn into a solemn form is that made by sir william phelip   hen v by which having obtained the soverigns license he impowers two knights sir andrew butrely and sir john henington or either of them as their business would prmit to supply his place and take possession of his stall in the choir at windsor  qualifications of a proxy   the qalifications of a proctor nominated by a knightsubject are the same with those requisite in the poctor of a stranger of which something will fall in our way hereafter i shall therefore only in general obseve here that to neither knightsubject nor stranger the prctor is to be under the degree of a knight enobled with arms and of an honest and untaited reputatin it being jadgd proper chiefly in this point that a knightsubject should exctly observe the same rule enjoined to strangers in resect of which it is very remarkable that sir william lisle though one of the almsknights yet in degree a knight was not refused to be poctor to sir john gray   hen v  preparations for installation   the day for installation of a knightsubject by prxy being appointed by the sovereign there are to be provided for him first a commission for installation which by the chancellor of the order is presented to the sovereign for his sign manual to which is after affixed the sal of the order and appoints   to conduct the proctor to windorcastle   to put him in pession as from the soveeign of the stall assigned his pinipal   to inve him with all the benefits honors prerogatives franchises and liberties thereto belongig   to receive his mantle helm and sword and et them up in their appointed places   to add thereto all usual ceremonies   lastly an injanction to all the knights to permit all the solemnity punctully to be performed an ancient precedent of this is found   hen v in the case of sir john falstaff also   edw iv at the installation of the earl of worcester and other elect knights by their proxies  of later times the commssions granted on such occasions differ from those made for the personal installation of the knights themselves only by premising the cause of their principals absence and service he is then employed on authorizing the commissioners to admit the proxy into his stall likewise where the installation is performed by two or more commissioners the sovereign dircts letters to each of them giving notice of the intended solemnity and requirig them to attend at a day prefix to the end the proxy may be put into possession of his principals stall  and as there is upon admssion of an elect knight installed by proxy the same ground for removal of stalls as in personal installations so the sovereign issues out warrants to garter some time before the solemnity to remove the achievements and plates as usual and place them in the order such warrants direct anciently the stall for an elect knight was assigned in the commission issued for installation as in the case of sir henry inghuse proctor to sir john falstaff   henry v  the rest of the particulars to be provided against the day of installation are at the knights own charge and are agreeable with those in personal installations  proceeding to the chapter house   the next thing to be considered is the proxies place in proceeding to the chapter house and this is immediately after the provincial king of arms because as yet he has not taken possession of his princials stall which done it gives him a place in his return according to its dignity in this order the proctors of the marqus of newcastle and the earl of bristol proceeded bareheaded    car ii  and though this be the proctors usual place in this proceeding yet sir henry sidney proctor to the earl of warwick   eliz proceeded immediately before the elect knights which is the only instance of that kind  lastly the proctor as in the case of an elect knight passes into the eastisle behin the highaltar as soon as he comes within st georges chapel while the sovereign lieutenant or commssioners proceed into the chapter house and there reposeth himself till he is sent for in as in the case of the maquiss of newcastle and earl of bristol above but if the proxy pass not in the proceeding he then goes privaely to his place before the proceeding sets forward  transactions in the chapter house   after the chater is opened the first thing done is for garter to present the commission or commisions which he carried in the proceeding thither as well that for the lieutenancy if a lieutenant held the feast as of installation for admitting a prxy the order of which is observed before  the letters of procuration or deputation are next read after which the proxy is snt for into the chapter house by garter who conducts him to the door and there the commissioners or asiants or knights companions receive him but   eliz sir henry sidney exhibted his deputation after he was called in or sometimes the proxy produces his deptation before the proceeding to the chapter house as sir george howard deputy to the earl of bedford did   eliz and in such case there is no need of admitting the proxy into the charter house but that e may stay without till the sovereign his lieuenant or commissioners are ast into the choir and he sent for thither at which time the mantle was wont to be laid on his right arm at e chapterhose door by the knightscompanions apointed to introduce him  anciently as soon as the proxy was admitted into the chaterhouse and the letters of procuration were rea the mantle of his principal was usually laid on his right arm by the sovereigns lieutenant or commissiones and ar of it spread on the proxies shoulders the euteon of st george lying uppermost and the cordons laid fair to be seen and in this manner he bore it in the prceeding to the stall where he held it till service was ended but it is now ordered otherwise as by the directin of king charles ii that the mantle should be born on the left arm  but   eliz the earl of wawicks proctor had the mantle born before him into the choir by gater in the same manner as is usual to knights personally installed and not delivered him till he had taken the oath and at the delivery thereof the words of admonition were pronounced by the register as it was observed to the proxies of the marquils of newcastle and the earl of bistol    car ii  proceeding to the choir   the proxy proceeds from the chapterhuse door between the sovereigns commissioners etc but touching the order of this proceeding so much has already been said that we shall give but one instance anno   elizabeth    verger   almsknights   officers of arms   officers of the order   lord hunsdon proctor to the lord cobham   earl of bedford ceremonies performed in the choir   the proceeding having entered the choir the commissioners etc condut the proxy into the lower stall directly under that desigd for his principal where the register reads the words of the oath while the proxy laying his hand on the book repeats them after him and kisses the book and this oath his deputation impowers him to take in the name of his principal the form of the oath having no difference from the oath taken personally by an elect knight  the oath being taken in this solemn manner the roctor  led up to the stall of his principal where both the knights who conducted him into the choir first take the mantle and lay it on his arm next laying their hands on him in the name of his lord and master from whom he received his deputation set him down therein and so the ceremony of installation being fully ended the service of the church begins  if the installation be performed in the morning there is an offering of gold and silver at which time the proxy in his turn comes from his principals stall and stands before it and when the sovereign or the lieutenant for him and for himself or else the commissioners and the rest of the knightscompanions present have offered then the proxy being joined to the knight sitting in the opposite stall if present at the solemnity and having two officrs of arms before them proceeds to the high altar and there offers both gold and silver and then returns and takes his stall as the rest do in this manner the earl of warwicks proxy joining with the earl of nothumberland installed at the same time proceeded to the offering   eliz as likewise the proctor to the earl of bedford with the lord hunsdon   eliz  the ceremony of the offering being finished the service of the church goes on which being over the proceeding returns in the same order it came to the chapter house except that now the proxy takes his place according to the dignity of his stall but in regard the statutes expressly declare that after the proxy has been a mitted to his principals stall he shall neither wear the mtle nor have any voice in chapter nor enter there in the absence of him that sent him so that it was the ancient practice to take off the mantle from his arm at the chaptehouse door in his return from the choir and delivered to the verger of the chapel though sometimes to the sexton at other times to garter also to the backrd who has taken it from off the proxies arm and carried it into the charter house this doe the proxy retres prvately out of the proceeding to his lodging  i appears however but by what indulgence is not mentioned that though garter took the mntle from sir henry sidney   eiz at the chapter house door on the evening he retuned from installation yet the next morning he rode in the procession to the chapel the celebration of the feast of st george continuig with the mantle or his right arm and havig entered the choir took his principals stall bearig ikewise the mantle in the grand procession at the offering of money and during divine srvice and from the chapel to the castle to dinner and the like in the afternoon of the said day he rode on horseback in the proceeding to the chapterhuse door but there the mantle was taken from him and laid within upon the table whilst he retired into the eastisle f the chapel and at the rising of the chapter it was again delivered to him whence he proceeded in his principas place to the second vespers  next morning the lieutenant and assistants having ended the chapter the mantle was again laid on his arm and in that manner he passd to hs principals stall and afterward offered as on the feast day the morning servce ended the lieutenant and assistants returned to the chapter house dor where they put off their mantles and at the same time the sexton of the college received the mantle from him  the grand dinner   at dinner the proxy its with the lieutenant or commisioners and takes place where his principal should it if he were present and this was so observed at the installation of the earl of warwick   eliz  the style of the knight installed by proxy is proclaimed in french or english in the usual frm and place as    hen viii at the installations of the earls of beaumont and newblanke by their proxies for they we knightsubjects though not to the sovereign and therefor not improper to be made ue of as an instance to cnclude the poctor is to take care that the achievements and pate of his princial are et up n their proper places which appears not only from the ancient letters of prcuraion but also by commissions of istallation which appoint that the soveeigns deputy should receive from the proctor his principals helm and sword for there is no mention of the banner till afterward and place it over his stall  cap xiv the signification of election to strangers within what time and in what manner certificate is made of their election   in regard that strangers elect are for the most part sovereign princes whose affairs obliged them to abide in their own dominions and very rarely permitted them to receive personal installation it was thought fit to allow them several privileges by the founder of this most noble order and principally that of giving previous and timely notice of their elections and convenient time of consideration for acceptance affrding investiture in their own countries and permitting their installations to be performed at windsor by their proxies or deputies  it was therefore by the statutes ordained that when any such should be chosen into the order they should be ertified of their elections by the sovereign and besides that at his charge the garter should be sent over to them with the mantle and statutes of the order sealed with the common seal so that they might have notice atleast within four months from the time of election to the and they might advise and determine with themselves from the tenor of the statutes whether they would receive the honor of this most noble order  in pursuance of these directions it became custmary for the sovereign when he sent his letters to send also and that by way of solemn embassy the habit and ensign or the order with a book of the statutes and in case the election were accepted investiture might be received before the rturn of the persons by whom the habit was sent as upon the eections of edward king of portugal at the feast of st george    hen vi the duke of urbin    edw iv and several others  the right of bearing these letters signifying election and returning the strangers answer belongs to garter by the constitutions of his office and though certificate of election was to be made within fur months from the time of election yet king henry viii added this necessary clause that when the sovereign had any great or high impediment he might defer certifying the election till a more convenient time as may be seen in the case of frederick iii emperor of germany in the tme of henry vi who having been elected    of that king had not letters sent him to signify it till the next year it likewise appears that letters to the same effect were then likewise dispatched to the king of arragon the duke of brunswick and king of poland who had been elected eight years before  and yet we find it recorded that the habit and ensigns of the order were sent by special ambassadors to all three    hen vi two years before but perhaps this ought to be understood of their being but then designd and ordered to be sent and on second thoughts might e stopped or if sent by some accident might have miscarried otherwise it seems needless to have sent other letters to give notice of their election two years after but to clear this matter we after find a second mention of sending the habit and ensigns to the king of poland    hen vi by which it is demonstrable that the first embassy took no effect  it does not appear that king hen viii or any of his successors ever made use of that liberty granted by the aforesaid article of his statutes for deferring the significatory letters of elction beyond the time appointed by the statutes of institution as we find by the many instances of that kind francis the first king of fance was elected octber       hen viii and was installed the    january following so that it is plain the letters of notie must needs have been dispatched within the limited tim jmes v of scotland who was elected  0 jan   hen viii had notice of election immediately sent him and hen ii of france having been elected    april   edw vi had letters of signification sent him in may following and so in all examples since and when king charles ii elected any stranger wilst he was abroad letters of signification were sent them immediately after  of notice given of an election before sending the habit   here it is to be observed with how much cautio more than the former the statutes of king henry viii ordain to send letters that signify election and the book of statutes only at first but not the garter and mantle till the elect stranger having had time to consult the statutes certifies his acceptance of the orde and then and not before it is decreed to send a solemn embassy with the whole habit george and collar and consonant to this the practice has sometimes been as in the case of henry ii king of france   edw vi emnuel duke of savoy   and   phil and mar and in that of frederick duke of wirtembergh to whom queen elizabeth sent letters soon after his election and he returned thanks and acceptance by his two ambassadors who received promise of sending the whole habit soon after however the same were not sent during h life  notice of election sent with the habit   when the sovereign has been well assured of the elect strangers acceptance the same embassy as anciently before adding this clause dispatched both ceremonies the sovereigns letter signifying e ection being first presented together with the book of statutes and an accptance declared then within few days the whole habit of the order was solemnly delivered  and thus it was directed soon after the election of james v king of scots to the lord william howard sent on that embassy and in like manner at the election of christian iv king of denmark   jac i to the earl of rutland sent on that embassy as also to gustavus adolphus king of sweden and henry prince of orange within two months their elctions following on april      car i and the date of the commission for delivering the order being on june    following  the manner and order of the delivery of these letters signifying election when the habit is sent is thus first the ambassador and officer of arms having notice given them of the first audience present themselves t the stranger prince in the accustomed manner of ambassdors and delivering the sovereigns letters missive with all due reverence the ambassador after some short general compliment from the sovereign signifying that his master and the hurable society of the garter in respect of his nowned prowess valor virtues etc and to establish and increase the amity that is between them has elected him into the most noble oder of st george and that soeregs do never ect any strangr but uch as they highly honor and therefore earnestly desires it may be accepted as a true testimony thereof to which end the sovereign has sent him over and his herald there present to prform the du cremonies  but this commission of legation has sometimes been obstructed by the multitude of affirs lig on the sovereigns hands particularly in the time o car i when engaged in that unnatural civil war so that when they sent their letters of signfication it was  fit to commissionate their agent or resident at the prices court and gater principal king of arms to diver art ut the two chief and most puliar esigns of the oder viz the garter an george deferring the slemn emss till a more convenient season the first pren of which kind was  0 jc i when si ralph  and william seagar esquire gter were commiind to deliver onl for the present the grter and gerge to maurice prince of oge five days after his election and so to charles prince palatine of the rhine   car i and to william prince of orange and the duke de espernon the same reign and so likewise during the unhappy exile of king charles ii it was usual for want of more convenience to present the elect knight in confirmation of his election whether he were stranger or subject with the garter george ribband and sometimes a st georges cross radicated within a garter t be fixed on the left shoulder of their cloaks or upper garments but these things after returned into their proper channel as we may see in several cases since of which we need not instance more than that of the present sovereign and his royal highness the prince the former at a chapter of the most noble order hed at kensington    june   0     will iii was elected and on the    june the sovereign by commission under the great seal of the order constituted the earl of macclesfield and gregory king esquire lancaster herald then deputy garter king of arms to carry the habit and ensigns and to invest his then electoral highnes therewith the next day after their arrival at a private audience his electoral highness received the garter and george with the usual formalities and two days after viz    august was solemnly nvested with the whole habi of the order on    march following   0   he was installed at windsor by his proxy charles lord mohun with the accustomed ceremonies the same order was observed at the election of his royal highness the prince   april   queen anne when the lord halifax and john vanbruge esquire clarenceux king of arms n the room of sir henry st john knight garter were commissioned to carry the habit and ensigns they had their first audience on this occasion of the prince the    may who afterward received the garter and lesser george and on   june following was invested with the whole habi and ensigns of the order  certificates of acceptance   after delivering the sovereigns letter signifying election by the ambassador and the elect stranger do readily accept the order he is obliged by the statutes to rturn the sovereign a certificate of such his acceptance and desire of ratification and it is observable before the additional clause made by king henry viii this ceremonious course had been the practice of ancient times and both expected from and observed by the king of denmark who having been elected   hen v was the eighth of the same king taken notice of for not returning before that time an answer whether he accepted the honor or no and it appears before the next feast of st george he sent over his ready acceptance both of the honor of election and of the ensigns of the order and thereupon directions were given for his installation by the lord fitz hugh his proxy  but for an instance after the said additional clause there is one remarkable enough in the preamble of the sovereigns credential letters to the duke of savoy   and   phil and mar sent with the habit and ensigns of the order in which it appears that the sovereign having given notice of his election into this most noble order he had returned back his cheerful and ready acceptance of and singular satisfaction in the said choice and therefore cordially wished it might attain its due effect  in succeeding times it was thought necessary where the whole habit was sent to a stranger together with the sovereigns letters of notice to make a provisional decree which passed    car i that garter and all others whom e pleased to join in commission with him should be most punctually careful that they delivered not the ensigns of the order to any elect stranger till they were satisfied by his letters patent of his kind and grateful acceptance thereof or in case of refusal to forbear their presentation  and the same care was also taken where only the ater and george were sent as appears by the instrucions ent    car i to sir william boswel then appointed by the sovereign to present those two principal ensigns to william prince of orange where among other things he is expressly commanded to take a testimnial from the said prince of his kind acceptance tereof before he should deliver those ensigns of honor to him so likewise in the institutions of the same date for delivery of the garter and george to the duke de espernon  of an election not accepted   that sometimes this honor has not been accepted appears in the single case of philip ii duke of burgundy who having been elected by king henry v then in france had not anno   henry vi sent his answer it was therefore concluded on at the feast of st george held at windsor the said year by humphry duke of gloucester then deputy to the sovereign and by and with the unanimous consent of the knightscompanions present to send letters to the said elect duke by which he was desired to know whether he gave his acceptance or no the duke of burgundy it seems made no answer to this letter it was therefore again debated at the next years feast and then thought fit to send persons over to him with the nomination who should press him for his final answer and then it appears that the said duke weighing the statutes and reflecting on the quarrels between the duke of gloucester and the duke of brabant his uncle made a plausible excuse refusing the election lest he should be forced ether dishonourably to violate the pious constitutions of the order or the obligations of alliance and upon this they proceeded to a new ection  but this is the only instance of this kind and it has been the constant way of all elect strangers not only to accept but to receive with the highest marks of satisfaction the notice of their election and the inveititure of the order  cap xv the investiture of strangers with the habit and ensigns of the order the time for sending the habit and ensigns unlimitted   though the statutes of the order appoint and prefix a time wherein the sovereigns letters of notice to an elect knight ought to be sent yet as to the sending a solemn embassy with the habit and ensigns they do not limit any certain time but leave it wholly to the sovereigns pleasure wherein his own interest and convenience as well as that of the elect stranger is to be considered  nevertheless the statutes of institution direct that this legation shall be dispatched with convenient speed which must be interpreted to refer both to the sovereigns convenience of sending and the strangers capacity of receiving  and therefore we find it six years after the election of the kings of arragon and poland and the duke of brunswick ever we meet with the first notice of the sovereigns determination of sending over the habit for they having been elected   august    hen vi the preparations for the legation were not made till the thirty fourth year of the same king and doubtless some cause within the lmis of that convenience allowed to the sovereign by the aforesaid article of the statutes or the accident of miscarriage might fall out particularly in respect to the king of poland because three years after the former order of legation we find new directions issued for sending the ensigns of the order to him  but in king henry viiiths body of statutes this clause of sending the legation with convenient speed is wholly omitted and the sovereign is not limited as to the time so that the habit and ensigns have happened to be sent sometimes sooner sometimes later as the sovereign has thought convenient of which sufficient has been said already and we find in two elections of strangers in the two late reigns viz that of the present sovereign and prince that the legation was sent only a very few days after their election  preparations made for the legation   in reference to this solemn embassy there are several things to be provided before the ambassadors or commissioners take their journey as   credential letters   commission of legation   warrants for the habit and ensigns and   other necessaries  the credential letters are as to particulars drawn suitable to the present occasion by the chancellor of the order and directed to the stranger elect but the substance in general is that the sovereign having eected him into the society of the order has sent his ambassadors with full power to present the habit and perform the ceremonies due and accustomed as if himself were present and farther to desire him to give credit to all that his ambassadors shall say or perform on his behalf in reference to their commission as he would do to himself  these letters pass under the sign manual of the sovereign and signet of the order but it is observable that these to emanuel duke of savoy were signed both by king philip and queen mary  the commission of legation is likewise to be preared by the chancellor of the order fairly engrossed on vlom and sealed with the great seal of the order the substance of which for the most part has been as follows  first the merits and worthiness of the elect stranger to deserve the honor of election and the reasons of iducing the sovereign to confer the same upon him are elegantly set forth  secondly the persns nominated for this honorable employment are ordained authorized and deputed and therein styled ambassadors procurators and specal messengers and so are acknowledged to be by the srger elct in their crtificates of the receipt of the habit  thirdly their power authority and special command is to address themselves to the stranger elect and present and deliver him from the sovereign the garter mantle and other ensigns of the order where observe that there were four or fie jined in a commission as it has sometimes hapened then any fe four three or two were of the quorum wheeof the principal of the embassy was always one  fourthly they were empowered to require from the stranger elect his oath according to the form prescried in the statutes but this was a special case and only inserted in the commissions of legation to charles duke of burgundy   edw iv and ferdinand achdeacon of austria    hen viii and omited in all commissions since that time  and lastly to perform and dispatch those things which they should judge necessary in the same mannr as if the sovereign were present in person and this power it was thought fit to allow the ambassadors in case any thing should want to be performed which their instructions had not sufficiently provided for  the first embassy on this occasion recorded in the bluebook is that to edward king of portugal    hen vi to whom for the greater dignity o the order grter was thought fit by the chapter to be sent alone with the habit of the order and hence is the original of garters claim to this employment  nevertheless in succeeding times as the order grew into esteem some one of the knightscompanions was made choice of by the sovereign to be principal in these legations as were galliard sieur de duras sent to charles duke of burgundy   edw iv arthur plantagenet viscount lisle to francis the first king of france    hen viii and others  sometimes other noblemen or persons of quality though not knightscompanions yet crresondent to the degree of the stranger elect or to the esteem the present interest begat in the svereign were emploed chief in these embassies among whom sir charles somerse after earl of worcester was sent to the emperor mimilian   hen vii heny lord moley to don ferdinand prince of spain    hen viii and others  in embassies of this nature it was heretofore usual to join some persons of rank and quality or office near the sovereign in the commission as sir john scot comptroller of the household and sir thomas vaughan treasurer of the household both joined with the sieur de duras aforesaid and sir nicholas carew and sir anthony brown with the viscunt lisle  to these persons the sovereign thought it sometimes to add a doctor of the law or a dignified clergyman and such as had the language of the country not only the better to make such answers to questions as the stranger elect might start on perusal of the statutes but likewise to inform him touching the institution of the order or other passages relating to the founder or matters touching the honor of the garter besides a dignified clergyman was in those times thought proper to administer the oath and pronounce the words of signification at the investiture with the habit and ensigns of the order  and for these reason was john russel doctor of the civil law and archdeacon of berkshire joined in commission with the aforesaid sieur de dura and edward lee doctor in divinity archdeacon of colchester and the sovereigns almoner sent over with the lord morley and others  but of later years the sovereigns ambassador resident with the stranger elect has supplied this place as did sir thomas smith in the legation sent over to charles ix and sir edward stafford in that of the french king henry iii and sir anthony mildmay to that of henry iv  besides the aforementioned persons garter was always jined in these commissions of legtion not only to keep on foot his right but to manage the ceremonious part and of this there are so many numerous instances as are sufficient to justify the privilege of his office and maintain the interest of an ancient right besides which if it were any way disputed we find it decreed in a chapter    car i that the carrying the ensigns of the oder to stranger princes does properly belong to garter  besides those persons joined in the commission of legation there has frequently been appointed either norroy king of arms or some one of the heralds to go in quality of an attendant in this service not only for the honor of the sovereign but of the stranger who is to receive the habit in regard the ceremonies of investiture with the whole habit require the assistance of two officers of arms of which there are me precedents  lancaster herald attended the ebassy to charles ix king of france chester herld and rouge dragon pursuivant at arms on that of henry iii of france a herald likewise attended the emassy to emanuel duke of savoy york herald that of maximilian the emperor and somerset herald to henry iv of france  and whereas there went only norroy to chistian iv king of denmark it was because no more of the officers of arms could then be spared from their necessary attendance on the sovereigns coronation so in the embassy to maurice prince of orange one herald sufficed because the garter and george only were sent him and consequently there was but little service then to be performed  concerning other companions and attendans in these legations they are both for quality and number such and so many as the chief in the legation judges sufficient for the honor of the sovereign and the dgnit of the embassy and with these have usually gone several noblemen knights and gentlemen  in the third place there is to be prepared for these legations warrants for the habit and ensigns of the order and these are also to be drawn up by the chancellor of the order who is to attend the sovereign for his sign manual thereto  one warrant is to be directed to the master of the great wardrobe to deliver to garter the mantle with the escutcheon of st george within a gater embroidered on the left shoulder and tossels belonging and also the surcoat and hood  there is also another warrant drawn up for the delivery of the ensigns of the oder to garter viz the rch garter and great collar of the order with a george pendant and another george hagig in a blue ribbond together with cases for them lined with purple velvet and gilt on the outside  and sometimes these ensigns have been delivered out of the jewelhouse to the herald of arms oined in he egation in garters stead as were those sent to charles king of sweden  0 car ii but those provided for john george duke of saxony to sir thomas higgons the principal in the legation for which they gave their several receipts  the sovereigns warrant for the delivery of the ensigns sent to maximilian the emperor was directed to the lord treasurer for which garter gave his receipt but for those sent to the french king henry iv the warrant was directed to the master of the jewelhouse and out of this office have all the ensigns of the order been since delivered  there are several other necessaries to be provided which may pass as appurtenances to the former and are sometimes incerted in the sovereigns warrants for the habit of the order and at other times issued by particular warrants as a black velvet cap with white feathers and a heron sprig a girdle and hangers with the same colored velvet with the surcoat a yard of purple velvet has usually been allowed out of the great wardrobe for covering the book of statutes sent to the elect stranger and for the velom writing and binding the said book there is a fee paid by the sovereign to the register of the order which has generally been proportioned to the dignity of the receiver for this officer had allowed him for the book sent  l s d to the french king henry iv   0 0 to john casimir count palatine   0 0 to the duke of holstein   jac i       to the king of sweden   car i   0 0  but to be more particular we will insert the bill of charges for the book of statutes sent to james vi of scotland    hen viii  l s d for velom 0   0 for illumining the arms and letters 0  0 0 for writing   0 0 for binding and gilding 0     for half a yard of purple velvet 0   0 for half a yard of crimson satin 0   0 for the purple silk for the laces 0 0   for the white and green silk for the seal 0   0 for red silk for the strings and garnishing the book 0   0 for an ounce and half of venice gold 0   0 for shapng making the bag and garnishing 0     fr red sarcenet for lining the bag 0     for a box 0 0   total        this book of statutes ought to be sealed with the common seal of the order which not only the institution but all the other succeding bodies of statutes appoint besides at a chapter held at witehall    car i the law was confirmed and thereupon it was again decreed tt the book of statutes sent to any stranger prince should be sealed with the great seal of the order affixed to a label of blue silk and gold  there is also to be provided a large purple velvet cushion to carry the robes on when they are to be presented this is likewise put into the sovereigns warrant and provided by the master of the great wardrobe usually containing one yard and quarter in length adorned with fringe canl and tossels of gold and purple silk and within it a pllow of fustian filled with down  there were two velvet cushions prepared for the service of the duke of wirtemberghs investiture   jac i one of purple for the sovereigns state and another of crimson for the duke so the some year to christian iv king of denmark  two majesty escutcheons are likewise to be provided painted in oil and gilt with gold one to have the arms of the sovereign surrounded with a garer under an imperial crown the other of the strangers arms within a garter also and such a crown as is proper to his dignity both these are to be put in frames painted and gilt with their several styles fairly written under the arms and set on the back of the sovereigns stall under the state as also on the back of the stall of the stranger elect but there were three majesty escutcheons sent over in the legation to henry prince of orange in regard that at his investiture frederick elector palatine was present in case the chief person in the legation be a knight of the order then he is to have a like escutcheon of his own arms set over his own stall for so had the earl of derby provided for him at the sovereigns charge when he was sent with the habit to the french king henry iii  the remaining necessaries are such as relate to the transportation of the habit of the order viz  one pair of fine holland sheets to fold the habit in two sweet bags of taffaty to lay amongst them two trunks to put the said parcels in one sumpter saddle all which are to be provided at the sovereigns charge and is also his gift to the elect prince  what farther warrants are to be obtained from the sovereign relate to garter and such other officers of arms as are appointed to attend the legation as first a warrant whereby the sovereign ascertains a warrant for their diet and reward during their journey and till their return and on which most commonly for greater certainy of its payment the sovereigns privy seal is obtained  the allowance to garter in the reign of edw vi was ten shillings a day for his diet and ten shillings a day more as a reward and this we find allowed to sir gilbert dethick in the embassy to henry ii king of france   edw vi and the like in his legation to maximilian the emperor and to frederick ii king of denmark    eiz  and when clarenceux was sent in the place of garter he office being void by the death of the said sir gilbert to the french king henry iii the same was also allowed him and commenced nine days before his setting out and of which there are other precedents  of this daily allowance garter has usually obtained an advance beforehand for his better support by the wa  when any of the heralds were sent in garters place the same allowances were made them as if garter had gone in person as had henry st george esquire richmond heald sent with the earl of carlisle to charles king of sweden    car i as also to thomas st george esq somerset herald sent with sir thomas higgins to the duke of saxony soon after  as to the allowance to such officers of arms as are not joined in but appointed to ated any of these legations it was usually if a herald the moie of what was given to garter and if a pursuivant at ams half as much as a herald  agreeable to which was the allowance given to chester herald and roge dragon prsuivant in the embassy to henry ii king of france   edw vi an there called the old rate so also to somest herald to f ederick ii king of denmark and the french kings henry iii and iv and both the herald and pursuivant had a so a proportionable part of their daily allowances beforehand  besides which allowances menioned garter has also allowance for postage both outward and homeward for himself and servants and for transportation of the habit and other things necessary for the voyage and this by a clause added in the sovereigns warrant is left to garter at his return when he gives in a bill of particulars subscribed with his hand to the treasurer or chamberlains of the exchequer to have been disbursed by him  the warrant to furnish garter or the herald with post horses and convenient shipping to carry them over is usually had of the privy council or secretary f state either before or after the lord ambassador and is not provided for in the same ship  the ceremonies of investiture   the ceremonies performed at a stranger princes receipt of the whole habit and ensigns of the oder are highly solemn whether we consider the manner of investiture performed by the sovereigns ambassadors on the festivity and tiumphs added by the new invested prince  first the commissions joined in the legation receiving notice of their first audience are to present themselves in the accustomed manner of ambassadrs garer or his deputy going in breast wih the chief of the legation if there be only himself joined in commission with the lord ambassador and in this place william segar esquire norroy king of arms sent in the room of garter proceeded with the earl of rutland at their first audience before christian iv king of denmark  being arrived near the elect stranger they present the letters certifying election or their credential letters from the sovereign and after some short general compliment by the ambassador he makes known to him his election in the usual form which is before sufficiently spoke of  after the formality of this address is over and that the stranger has by his answer accepted of his election and consented to the reception of the order the ambassador immediately delivers him the book of statutes that he may if he pleases peruse them before he assume the habit and desires his consideration thereon next both the commissioners in the legation present him with the george and ribbond and put it about his neck as in several instances has been shown  in the interim before the day of investiture time is usually set apart for conference between the sovereigns ambassador and some of the elect princes council touching the ordering of the ceremonies and wording the oath to be by him taken garter is likewise to consider what places in the elect princes court are fit to perform the ceremony and to see them made ready and to instruct his officers what duties and services they are to undertake  if the great hall or other large room be appointed there ought to be prepared a table with a rich carpet whereon the habit and ensigns of the order are to be laid while the sovereigns commission of legation is read another table should be prepared for the stranger who receives the order and a third for the sovereigns ambassador  in the church or chapel where they are to proceed to her divine service a stall is to be erected under a cloth of state on the right hand entrance of the choir for the sovereign of the order wherein is to be fixed the majesty escutcheon of the sovereigns arms another stall is also to be placed on the same side of the choir for the invested stranger at the same distance from the sovereigns stall as is that for the elect stranger in the choir at windsor in which is to be fixed the majesty escutcheon of his own arms brought likewise over by garter or his deputy a third stall is to be erected for the lord ambassador who if a knightcompanion has an escutcheon of his own arms within a garter set over it for so had the maquiss of northampton at the investiture of the french king henry ii anno   edw vi and the earl of derby at that of henry iii under all these escutcheons of ams the styles and titles fairly written of the sovereign and each knightcompanion are to be affixed  where there is no solemn proceeding to church the sovereigns escutcheon of arms with his titles have been set up at the upper end of the room where the investiture is performed so also the stranger knights at due distance as at the investiture of gustavus adolphus king of sweden in his tent at the leaguer near darshaw in prussia    september anno   car i  besides the beforementioned preparations the church or chapel into which the new invested stranger proceeds is to be richly adorned as we find by several instances as at the investiture of king henry iii when the church of augustine friars in paris was hung with rich arras and all the choir and stalls with cloth of gold on the day the solemnity of investiture is celebrated the elect stranger sends his coach and some persons of quality to accompany the sovereigns ambassadors to his court at the investiture of henry prince of orange frederick prince palatine of the rhine sat with the vicount charleton in one boot of the princes coach and sir william segar in the other and were met by the said prince at the foot of the stairs of his court and conducted thence into his great chamber  after such time as the elect stranger and the sovereigns ambassadors have a while retired the stranger usually first enters the room appointed for the ceremony and stands under his own sate expecting the coming in of the ambassadors and notice thereof being given them they reposing in a room near proceed in manner following  servants to the lord ambassador two and two  the herald in his coat of arms bearing the mantle surcoat hood and cap in his arms and if a pursuivat attend the embassy he wearing his coat proceeds before him bearing part of the said habit  garter vested in his rich coat of his sovereigns arms also but at the investiture of the duke of wirtemberg he wore his robe of crimson satin as did clarencex at the investiture of the french king henry iii bearing on a cushion the garter and collar of the order with the great george the book of statutes and the commission of legation  lastly the lord ambassador or chief in the embassy who if a knightcompanion proceeds in his complete habit  if any other knightcompanion is present he also wears his whole habit of the order as did the constable of france at the investiture of the french king henry ii the said constable alo paired in the proceeding with the sovereigns ambassador  in going up to the sovereigns state they all make three reverences and drawig near the ambassadors servants fall off on either side for the herald to pass up to the table set before the sovereigns state whereon with a single reverence he lays the robes  then garter draws near the table also and with a like reverence toward the sovereigns state deposites the ensigns of the order  the lord ambassador follows and makes his reverence toward the sovereigns state and after turning to the stranger elect and doing him reverence he or some other fit person delivers himself in a short but grave and larned oration in which he not only sets forth the praies of the illustrious order and of the king the sovereign but also the virtues the memorable and praiseworthy actions of the elect stranger to whom the habit and ensigns of the order are sent neither are his ancestors if any of them have attained the honor of this order past over in silence that thereby his heart already breathing impatience and desire may be so much the more inflamed with an earnestnes to obtain the honor and favor of this so great a dignity  he adds besides that the sovereign having well weighed these and the like things in his mind and maturely advised thereof with his knightscompanions they were persuaded and well satisfied in themselves to nominate and choose him before others to the end that he might both himself be honored by the choice of such a person and also thereby give an increase and addition of luster to those renowned actions and virtues which already were a chief ornament to him  lastly he points toward the ensigns of the order which he declares to have been sent by the soveregn out of great love and singular affection to dignify him therewith as to a person to whom he wished as well and honorably as to any other prince whatsoever and withal entreats him kindly to accept thereof and wear them in remembrance of the sovereign and his order  this or the like oration being ended the ambassadors present ther commission of legation to the elect sranger who delivers it to his secretary and he publicly reas it  at the beforementioned investiture of the french king henry ii the bishop of ely one of the commissioners of the legation made the speech to which the cardinal of lorrain returned answer in the said kings behalf with all thankful acknowledgments of the honor of the order  after the commission is read garter presents the oath fairly written which is administered to the elect stranger where if any exceptions were before made and admitted they must be rehearsed as we find it directed in the instructions given for the investiture of james v king o scotland the ceremony of the oath being finished garter takes from off the cushion the garter and having kssd it presents it to the lord ambassador who kneeling dwn puts it with all reverence on the strangers left leg being assisted by garter who pronounces these wrds of signification  ad laudem atque honorem omnipotentis dei intemeate matris ejus and sancti georgii martyris cinge tibiam tam hoc insigni subligaculo cicumferens in augmentum honoris tui and in signum ac memoriam illustrissimi odinis nusquam oblivioni daturus aut omissurus qud o moneris ut valeas inquam and vlis in justo bello quod slum inibis stare firmiter agere fortiter and felicier omnino vincere  this being said garter takes the surcoat and with the ceremony of a kiss delivers it to the lord ambassador who after the stranger elect has put off hs cloak or upper garment and sword puts it upon him in thi manner first the lord ambassador begins at the strangers right arm and garter or the leiger ambassador if present assists at the left shoulder the stranger being thus vested with the surcoat both the lord ambassador and garter gird his sword about him with a velvet girdle of the same color at the doing whereof garter says these words  capito vestem hanc purpuream ad incrementum honoris and in signaculum ordinis accepti qua munitus non veteberis pro fide christi liberate ecclesiae pro jure and oppressorum atque indigentium necessaria tuitione sanguinm etiam fundere nedum fortiter ac strenue dimicare  after this garter takes up the mantle and hood which in like manner kissing he delivers to the lord ambassador who invests the stranger therewith and lays the hood upon his right shoulder the train being given into the hands of some noble personage to be born u garter also pronouncing these words  accipe clamidem hanc coelici coloris in signum clarissimi hujus ordinis and in augmentum etiam hnoris tui rubeo clypeo dominice crucis uti cernis insignitam u cujus virtute semper ac vigore protectus per hstes tutus abeas eos ubique superare valeas and pro clarissimis denique meritis post egregiam hanc hujus temporis militiam ad aeterna vereque triumphalia gaudia pertings  garter in the last place takes up the colar and with a kiss also presents it to the lord ambassador who laceh it about the strangers shoulders and garter utters these words  torquem hunc in collo deferes ad augmentum honoris and in signum quoque clarissimi ordinis a te suscepti cum imagine sanctissimi martyris and christi militis geogii cujus praesidio suffultus mundi hujus tam prospera quam adversa sic pertranseas ut anim pariter ac corpois ostibus hic strenue devictis non temporari modo militi gloriam sed and perenis victori palmam denique recipere valeas amen  when the ceremony of investiture is finished the lord ambassador congratulateth the new invested stranger in the sovereigns name and in the name of all the knightscompanions and then delivers him his velvet cap adorned with white plumes and the book of statutes  the stranger being thus invested stays a while in the room where he received this honor with the ambassdor and after complements of congratulation between them he goes to the church in a solemn manner having the train of his mantle born up at the entrance into the church all in the procession make three reverences the first toward the high altar the next toward the sovereigns stall and the third toward the new invested strangers stall  the lord ambassador proceeds toward the seat assigned for him and stands before it till the stranger has acended his stall and after making his reverences as before takes his then garter making the like reverences sits down on a chair placed for him before the sovereigns stall  but the herald at arms ought to be often near the stranger or else the lord ambassador to inform them of the order of ceremony because garter is obliged to attend the sovereigns royal stall  after a solemn anthem garter passes in the middle of the choir and by a reverence first to the invested stranger and next to the lord ambassador gives them the signal for descending and being both come down a ter passes up before the stranger to the high altar where he makes his offering of gold and silver being accompanied with the lord ambassador the herald laying the cushion whereon he kneels when he offers  but if a knightcompanion be sent on this legation then he proceeds first up to the altar preceeded by garter and offers for the sovereign which done he returns to his own stall next the invested stranger proceeds up receeded as before offers and returns back to his own stall afterward the aforesaid knightcompanion poceds up again and offers for himself and in this oder was the offering made when the emperor maximilian was invested at vienna january   anno  0 eiz  the new invested stranger having offered returns to his stall and the lord ambassador with three reverences takes his seat the organs etc playing all the while when the solemn service is finished the stranger descends again from his stall and with the proceeding before him returns in the same order he came to the room where he received his investiture  it is observable that the emperor maximilian out of a compliance with the protestant religion caused on the day of his investiture all prayers to saints incensing and other matters and ceremonies not used by the church of england to be wholly omitted at the service in his chapel  at these great solemnities the invested strangers have heretofore held most magnificent feasts but of late they are not so much in use and when dinner was ready they proceeded thither in their whole habit which they wore all dinner time  at the investiture of christian iv king of denmark anno   jac i the sovereigns styles and titles of honor were proclaimed thrice before they sat down to dinner and the said kings twice but when maurice and henry princes of orange received investiture the styles were proclaimed immediately after they were invested and in the same room the ceremony being performed to both in the afternoon  at the feast made by maximilian i king of the romans sir charles somerset and sir thomas wiothesley sent on the embassy was admitted to his table and sat on his left hand on the day of investiture of don ferdinand prince of spain archduke of austria the lord morley and sir william hussy sat on his right hand at dinner and dr lee and the said sir thomas wriotheey on his left these four being joined in the commission of legation  at a feast on the like occasion by the french king henry ii he admitted to his table beside the marqui of northampton the principal person in the legation the beforementioned constable of france and all three at in their full robes of the garter which they put not off till after dinner the cardinal of lorrain sat also at the kings table but it was on the other side  when the investiture was performed in the afternoon then was the grand dinner turned into a supper as it was at the investiture of maximilian the emperor and two of the french kings but when henry prince of orange received the ensigns of the order there was no feast at all but purposely omitted to prevent the difference which might have been occasioned by the precedence and place between ambassadors drinking of healths and other complements  on this solemnity and the honor they derived from it some have thought fit to transmit the memory to posterity by medals with inscriptions relating thereto such were those of gold and silver which frederick duke of wirtemberg caused to be made as also those made by charles king of sweden  certificates of having received the habits and ensigns of the order   the magnificent solemnity of investiture etc being completely finished and the ambassdors having fully performed their duties therein they are yet further to obtain from the new invested stranger before their departure a public instrument testifying the reception of the said habit and ensigns signed with his hand and sealed with his great seal this we find anciently done in several instances and is generally demanded and obtained  hereupon a clause to this effect is usually added in instructions given to ambassadors as appears from those to the lord howard and garter in the embassy to james v king of scotland namely that garter should emember after the investiture was performed to purchase and solicit a certificate from the said king of his reception of the order and taking the oath both under his seal  the form and substance of these certificates are much alike for after a recial of all the powers given to the ambassadors named in the commission of legation the stranger prince first makes certificate of his receiving and investiture with the mantle surcoat collar and other ornaments of the order and that they received them from the sovereigns ambassador with the accustomed solemnities  in some of these certificates namely from ferdinand prince of spain anno    hen viii from francis i the french king anno    hen viii and from gustavus king of sweden anno   car i we find the taking the oath appointed by the statutes to be also certified of the return of these certificates the annals of the order sometimes take notice and by a decree    car i care was taken to oblige the ambassadors to produce these certificates to the sovereign at their return  the stranger prince has been pleased sometimes to give with the certificate a particular testimonial of garters punctual discharge of his duty in the legation or of the officer of arms employed in his stead as did gustavus king of sweden in the preamble of his diploma whereby he testifies the bestowing upon henry st george richmond herald the honor of knighthood they have also usually given garter gratuities either in money diamonds or some other present of great value of which several instances might be produced  cap xvi the installation of a stranger by proxy touching the choice and nomination of a proxy   after the stranger is invested he is enjoined by the statutes be he of what state or condition soever to send in eight months after his investiture either a proctor or deputy to be installed in his behalf in the seat assigned him within the chapel of st george at windsor  the time limited for sendng in henry vths statutes is but seven months and those of henry viii allow no more and that not only after investiture but after the stranger has certified the sovereign of his reception of the order  by king henry viiiths statutes it is also provided that in case a stranger do not send his deputy or proctr within seven months witout having a reasonable excuse and such s should be allowed by the sovereign or his dput the election notwithstanding his former acceptance should be also void except so it be that the stranger be hindered or disturbed by great affairs and then might he send his excuse to the svereign or his deputy within one month after and according as the sovereign or his deputy should allow or disallow of his excuse that then the sovereign or his deputy might give unto him four months of respite more within which time if he neither come nor send his deputy to be installed for him then the said election should be void for that time  the french king francis i was so earnest for completing this honor that he dispatchd his proctor hither with all the speed he culd and most of the stranger princes have sent their deputies within the limited time there being very few instances to the contrary and those were occasioned through the multiplicity of affairs  when the garter and george only have been sent to a stranger the ceremony of intallation has been dispensed with till a more convenient time as appears from the instructions of march   anno    car i given at the sending these two principal ensigns of the order to william prince of oange and benard de foix duke despenon in regard of the interruptions then given by the rebellion here such dispensations and for the same reason was king charles ii necessitated to give those srangers whom he honored with election while he remained in foreign parts  upon the said kings happy restoration among many other things relating to the order this particular was taken into consideration in reference not only to the duke de espernon and prince maurice who were dead but those strangers also then living and at two chapters held at white hall anno    car ii directions were given to garter to place the banners and achievements of the surviving strangers over their respective stalls and the sovereign by his supreme power ndcd by the impossibilities of the late troubles to peform the installation and by reason of the time elapsed sice their elections dipencd wholly and absolutel with their installaions but at the same time declared that as the like necessity and conjuncture could never happen again so he would not on any motion or pretense whatsoever give the like disensation  it seems to rest in the pleasure of the stranger whether he will choose to send over any person of his own court or give his procuration to some one of the sovereigns sbjects to receive his stall and in his name to take possssion of it the latter of which has been done several times out of desire to favor some of our nobiity with this honor of which many instances might be given  it hah sometimes happned that a proctor for the installation of a stranger has been appointed and nominated by the sovereign of the order though the principal had named another before thus it fell out in the case of maurice prince of orange anno  0 jac i who having deputed count henry his brother to be installed for him and he having put to sea in order thereto but by reason of contrary winds not arriving in england before the day appointed for his installation the sovereign and knightscompanions ordered that lodowick of nassau kinsman to the elect prince should take possession of his stall on his behalf a case somewhat like was that of john george duke of saxony who sent over his procuration to john earl of bath and he being detained in the west on extraordinary occasions when st georges fast was held at windsor anno    car ii wrote to the chancllor of the order to obtain the sovereigns dispensation for not appearing in the name of his principal who representing his humble request to the soveregn in a chapter held on the eve of the said feast he was peasd to grant it and appointed heneage earl of winchelsea who performed the service there is also an ancient example of this kind anno   hen v where the sovereign n minated the lord fitz hugh proctr for the king of denmark which et was not done till after the sovereign had been certified that the sai king had been vested and obliged himself by oath to the observation of the statutes  in like manner it is recorded that the earl of cleveland was by the sovereign appointed deputy for the installaton of gustavus adolphus king of sweden and yet not unlike but this might be with conent of the said king though the annals herein are silent  the proctors qualifications   by the statutes of the order the proctor whether he be nominated by his pricipal or by the sovereign must be procurator sufficiens and idoneas that is such a person who has always been accounted of unblameable conversation not branded with any note of infamy but altogether irreprovable and such was dominicus franciscus deputy to charles duke of ferrara who in the blackbook of the order is characterized to be a knight of incorrupt fame nor are we to doubt but that other proctors to strangers were such though the testimonials of their virtues do not appear in the annals of the order  secondly the proctor ought to be a person correspondent to the state and dignity of the stranger that is invested which may sufficiently apear by several instances the emperor maximilian i appointed for his proxy the marquess of brandenburgh anno   hen vii francis i king of france adrian de fercelin lord of bross anno    hen viii and henry iv of france siur de chastes vice admiral of france anno    eliz  thirdly it is provided that he be a knight and without any manner of reroach and if it so happen that he have not received the degree of knighthood the sovereign is to bestow that honor before he be allowed to take upon him the execution of his deputative power for none but knights are capable of this honor or permitted to bear the ensigns of so great an order hereupon the lord willoughby of eresby proctor for frederick ii king of denmark was knighted by he sveregn the morning before he proceeded to take possession of he stall  there was one reason nowihanding why this paticular was not strictly stood upon though moved in the case and it is the ingle cae of henry rame hereditary lord of wosterwitz and bckeskaw dput for christian iv king of denmark anno   jac i for it being taken notice of that he was not a knight cerain persons were sent from the sovergn to gniy his pasure that he should be aancd to the honor o knighthood before he took upon him the ensigns of the order in his kings behalf to which he made answer that he appeared here not in his own but in the name of the king of denmark and that such a degree of honor was unusual in his own country being born in pomerania and therefore humbly desired that he might be excused from the honor upon which the sovereign was pleased to dispense with him and forthwith the said deputy but no knight was admitted to take the stall assigned to the said king his principal  his letters of procuration   the authority wherewith an elect stranger invests his proxy which ought to pass under his hand and seal do generally contain these particulars  first he premiseth the soveregns election of him into the order of the garter and his receipt of the habi and ensigns thereof then takes notice of the obligation the statutes of the order put upon him for sending a proxy to take possession of his stall in regard the dignity whereunto he is advancd in his own country will not permit him to repair personally to windsor and being not only desirous that the election and investiue should obtain its due effect but to fulfill as far as in him lies the injunctions of the statutes in what concerns the assuming of his stall and taking the oath appointed he therefore ordains authorizes and deputes a person itly qualified named in the deputation his sufficien proctor and special deputy to appear at the castle of windsor in his behalf and in his name at the next solemnty that should be held there to suppy hs room and receive pssession of the stall assigned him according to the usual form and in all resects to erfom those ceremonies and things in his behalf due and  o should apear to belong any way to the spendor or orament of the order as also to take the accustomed oath with those qualifications and in that form as had been or should be agreed on and further to fulfill ll other things which he should think necessary to be performed on thi occasion or whatsoever thing might reque a more special command than was contained in the lettes of procuration and as fully as the stranger should be obliged to and would do if he were there present in his own person lastly there is usually added a clause of ratification and confirmation of all such things as the proctor should say or do in reference to the solemnity of installation  of the proctor s reception   when the sovereign is acquainted with the arrival of the proxy and the occasion of his coming he soon after gives him audience after which a day for installation is assigned and the sovereign nominates some of the knightscompanions his commissioners to perform the ceremonies  the proctor heretofore has been received with very great state sir blthasar castilian sent hither from the duke of urbin anno    hen vii was met at the seaside by sir thomas brandon with a goodly comany of his own servants well horsed who kept company with him till they came near depford in kent where by the sovereigns command he was met by sir thmas dokara and sir thomas wriothesler garter the said sir thomas dokara had attending him thirty of his servants all in new liveries well horsed every gentleman bearing a javelin in his hand and every ycoman a bow and a sheaf of arrows and so they conveyed him to his lodging the next day they conducted him to londn and by the way there met him diverse italians and paulus de gygeles the popes vice collector to whose house he was conveyed and lodged the reception also of james lord rambovillet proctor for the french king chales ix was very noble  the preparations for installation   the preparations of the installation of a  by proxy are the same as for the proxy o a  subject mentioned as before and the form of the  mission for installation is much the same the  ains the authority wherewith the proxy is empowered and is penned with like words  the letters of notice to the commissioners  the warrants for removing of stalls and for the strangers achievements are all to be obtained by the chancellor of the order under the sovereigns sign manual to which the signet of the order is to be affixt  the strangers achievements as mentioned in the warrant are to be provided at the sovereigns charge namely his helm crest mantlings and sword together with a banner of his arms and quarterings and these the proctor is enjoined to bring along with him to windsor  sometimes a warrant has been directed to the master of the wardrobe to provide but some part of these achievements and another warrant to the lord treasurer of england to deliver garter money to provide the other part in each of which the particulars relating to either are enumerated for o were the warrants drawn up for the atchievemets of the french king henry ii at other times direction has been to the master of the wardrobe to deliver to garter the whole who thereupon puts the charge upon account  sometimes particular warrants have been directed to the master of the wardrobe to deliver several parcels of the materials for the making up these achievements as were those warrants to deliver the sovereigns embroiderer and to garter so much velvet cloth of gold etc for making the great banner and other the achievements of carles ix and henry iii french kings  it also appears that garter has sometimes laid out the money for all or part of the achievements and then delivered his bill of disbursements into the wardrobe as is manifest from those bills for the achievements of frederick ii king of denmark in count palatine of the rhine and the duke of holstein  besides the achievements some other things used at the solemnity are commonly included in the forelaid warrants the mantle of the order is not prepared at the sovereigns charge for the statutes of instiution appoint the poxy to bring one with him not that the sovereign should provide it having done that before at the legation with the whole habit nor is it found in the rolls or books of the sovereigns great wardrobe that any account is made for providing a second mantle when the proxy of a stranger came hither which had the sovereign been at such charge would not have been omitted  the proctor s cavalcade to windsor   the day appointed for the installation drawing on the proxy was heretofore accompanied from london to windsor with the sovereigns lieutenant and his assistants if the feast of st george was then also celebrated or otherwise the sovereigns commissioners with a great retinue  among the rest when the deputy of the french king francis i rode to windsor anno    hen viii all the knightscompanions that were in commission for that solemnity assembled at the lord sandys place near st pauls church in london whence they rode to the deputys lodging and thence accompanied him with a gallant equipage to the castle of windsor where lodgings were prepared for him at the deans house  in like manner anno   eliz the earls of sussex and leicester and lord clinton three of the four commissioners appointed for the installation of the french king charles ix with other lords and gentlemen took their horses at the court gate at westminster and with a great train rode to the lodgings of the said kings proxy being then at st marys spittle in london whence they went through holbourn toward windsor the earl of southampton viscount mountague sir henry le and sir edward umpton met them at langford near colbrook with their hawks and showed the proxy variety of sport with which he being well pleased they rode to his lodgings at the deans house at windsor the usual place of entertaining the strangers proxies  supper after his arrival there   the evening of their arrival passes with a sumptuous supper but the principal entertainment is reserved for the following days dinner at the installation of the french king francis i all the commissioners met together at the marquess of exeters lodgings and went to the deans house where they were entertained by him at supper all at one table at another table sat garter with certain of the deputys chief gentlemen and some of the heralds and at a third sat the rest of the heralds and other of the proxies servants  the commissioners and other noblemen who accompanied the proctor of charles ix to windsor supped also with him at the deans he himself sitting at the upperend of the table then the earls of sussex and leicester by him one against the other next the earl of southampton and viscount mountague then the lord clinton and lord herbert of cardiff after them two strangers of distinction then lower sat the lord gray and other strangers and last of all at the lower end opposite to the proctr sat monsieur dose alias st michael the french herad garter blackrod and diverse strangers supped with the dean and in the parlour and hall sat diverse pensioners gentlemen and strangers  of the proceeding to the chapter house   what has been before set down of the proceeding to the chapter house at the personal installation of a knightsubject will extend hither both as to order and circumstances yet this general rule is to be born in mnd that the place of a stranger princes proctor here is next after the provincial kings unless the proctor of a knightsubject happen to intervene and before the junor knightcompanion unless a knightsubject pass then in the proceeding of which we have an instance at the installation of the dukes of brunswick and chevereux and the earl of dorset by their proctors but the earls of salisbury carlisle and holland with viscount andover in person anno  car i when the proceeding was ordered as follows    two waiters of the sovereigns hall in their livery coats bearing white rods   amsknights   prbends of the college   offiers of arms   proctors to the absent elect knights   elect knights in person   knightscompanions   blackrod   register  0 garter    chancellor    prelate    sovereigns lieutenant    courtiers and gentlemen in the rear only in the single case of christan iv king of denmark anno   jac i as an extraordinary respect and honor his proxy went in the proceeding to the chapter house next before the sovereigns lieutenant  as we had a former example of a proctor to a knightsubject who in this prceeding past before the almsknights and officers of arms namely sir henry sidney deputy to the earl of warwick   eliz so here in the case of a stranger the viscount hereford proxy to the duke of holstein installed   eliz went in this proceeding to the chapter house before the officers of ams which proceeding was ordered as follows    gentlemen and knights   the proctor and ambassador of holstein together   officers of arms   register and garter   lord hastings and lord paget commissioners if the proxy of a stranger pass in the proceeding which the sovereign his leutenant or commissioners make to the chapter house then for the most part he gives his attendance in the presence chamber or in the room whence the liutenant or commissioners proceed and thre joins himself thereto  but sometimes the commissioners as an instance of glar respect after ther setting out have taken the proxies lodging in their way and there received him into the proceeding so did prince henry by the proctor of christian iv king of denmark and the commissinrs by the proctor of the duke of wirtembergh   jac i  it is observed that the proxies of strangers have not always gone in the proceeding but sometimes staid at their lodging till the commissioners were ready to send for them to the chapter house as at the installation of charles ix king of france   eliz the commissioners meeting they and the three inferior officers of the order robed themselves and then went to the proxies lodging and having just conferred with him took leave and proceeded to the chapter house whence they ent out garter to the proxy with invitation to come to them who was presently conducted by garter to the chapter house door where the two senior commissioners received him between them  sometimes the proxies have past privately to the eastisle of st georges chapel and there rested before the sovereign and knightscompanions went into the chapterhous or proceeded into the choir without entering thereinto for so did the earl of cleveland and the maquiss of dorset proxies to gustavus adolphus king of sweden and henry prince of orange   car i the like method was observed by the eal of dover proxy to carles prince palatine   car i and by sir george cartaret proxy to christian prince of denmark    car ii so also of the earls of carlisle and winchelsea poxes to charles king of sweden and john george prince electo of saxony    car ii  the ceremonies performed therein   when the proceeding has arrived at the chapter house door the sovereign and knightscompanions or the liutenant etc with the officers of the order before them enter to hold their consultation the strangers proxy being first requested to stay without tll his deputation or letters of procuration are read to the end they may understand the effect thereof  to this purpose we find it directed by an ancient hand that where any knight is installed by his deputy he ough to stay without the vestry or chapter house door tll he be introduced by two knightscompanions so the lord paget one of the commissioners for installation o the duke of savoy when the proceeding was come to the chapter house door acquainted his proxy with this custom and injunction which he complied with  the eastisle behind the high altar is the usual place for proxies to stay till they are called into the chapter as it is also for the deputies of knightssubjects where chairs and cushions are prepared for this occasion  the first thing done after the chapter is opened is reading the commission for installation by the register of the order but if the sovereign be present no ommission issues and next the letters of procuration this being the most usual and proper place for this ceremony  however at the installation of the french king francis i by a very unusual compliance the commissioners went from the chapter house after they had called in and invested the earl of oxford with his surcoat and hood to the deans house where the proctor was lodged and in a great chamber there showed him the sovereigns commission and in it the authority for admitting him into the stall of his lord and master upon which the proctor presented them with his procuration which empowered him to take possession of i and to perform what ceremonies related to it which instrument the register read before them this being done they all proceeded to the chapel where entering they waved their return to the chapter house and passed directly into the choir  after some time of consultation in the chapter house the proxy is sent for in thither by garter who conducts him to the chapter house door and his reception there by the commissioners is after the same manner as is ued to the knight elect or to his proxy but whether he ought to enter the chapter house or be admitted any farther than the door or porch thereof and to pass thence immediately into the choir has been some question because the practice seems to have been sometimes one way sometimes another  all that we find to prohibit his entrance therein is an expression in the short ceremonial of installation of strangers by proxy entered in the blackbook where it ays  that the mantle is to be laid on the proctors right shoulder in the orch of the chapter house because he is n to enter into it  and there are two instances where the mantle was delivered to the proctor at the chapter house door from whence some may infer that the practice of those times was also agreeable to the aforesaid direction namely that of the proctor of the french king francis i    hen viii where garter stood at the chapter house dor with the mantle and as the proceeding passed by presented it to the two senior knightscompanions who placed it upon the proctors right arm and so of the poctor of emanuel duke of savoy   and   phil and mr who entered not into the chapter house but had the mantle discussed at the door  but these instances if duly weighed cannot properly or with any advantage be alleged to prove the assron because the affairs relating to both received dispach in the proctors lodging a little before and where the poctor himself was present where the meeting of the commissioners and proctor cannot be deemed less than a chapter though not held in the chapter house from the transactions that passed there viz producing the sovereigns warrant and the proctors instrument of deputation which were both read before them by the register and the proctor accordingly admitted which being finished nothing reating to the present purpose required their passing into the chapter house or remained to be done till they came into the choir  but the general practice runs strong on the contrary side for we find that the proctor for charles ix king o france   eliz was met at the chapter house dor by the earls of sussex and leicester who took him in  between them where after the register had read as  the sovereigns commission for installation as his letters of procuration and the commissioners had admitted him deputy for the said king they all came forth and laid his principals mantle on his right arm and shoulder the train whereof was born by the earl of southamp asisted by the lord herbert of cardiff  again it is remarkable    eliz that garter condcted the proxy of frederick ii king of denmark o the cterhouse and at that place the earl of leicester and the lord hunsdon received and led him in so ao wa christian ivths proxy led thither by the earls of n ingham and dorset and in jac i lodowick count  proctor to maurice prince of orange was called into  chapter house and there lest while the sovereign and knightscompanions proceeded into the choir also in like manner was sir george cartaret proctor to christian prince of denmark    car ii and the proctors to the king of sweden and duke of saxony    car ii  nor are these instances and the practice in this latter case really derogatory to the statutes which though they prohibit the proxies entrance into the chapter house yet do not extend to any thing previous to the installation but what may happen after for the article of the statutes having first direted the delivery of the mantle to the proxy and next the assumption of his principals stall in these words dictus procurator installatus it immediately subjoins that from thenceforth that is from the time of installation he shall neither wear the mantle nor enter into the chapter nor have voice there by virtue of any power ganted him all which are prohibitions plainly relating to future examples and arising after the ceremonies of installation are past and not at all refering to what preceeds it  and it seems the law has been thus understood in regard the greater prevalence of practice has generally attended it for not only the proxies of strangers as is observed but generally knightssubjects have been called into the chapter house and there received the mantle before they proceeded into the choir  the ceremony of delivering the mantle to the proctor is performed by the sovereign his deputy or the commissioners garter presenting it to them and the manner of it was anciently by putting it on the proxies right arm or shoulder in the name of his lord and master there to hold it till the end of divine service  but as there has arisen some dispute touching the proctors entry into the chapterhuse before installation so it has happened in this pint of receiving the mantle viz whether in the chapter or stall allotted their principal of which there are examles  that part of the article in the statutes of institution relating to this point runs thus  that the mantle tempore installtionis prcuratoris shall be laid on his arm etc but whether this shall be construed to that instant of time when the proctor is brought to the stall of his principal or to some greater latitude as during the time of istallation including the very first action or beginning of the ceremony namely the being called to the chapterhous door and entrance into it is the question because there are instances in both but the latter is most waantable by the statutes and general practice  the article in henry viiiths statutes being much more clear in describing and explaining the ceremonies of installation than any of the former the particulars of which in every point seems to be excellently regulated having mentioned the sovereign or his deputies laying the mantle on the proxies arm it immediately follows as the very next thing to be performed in course of time that afterward he shall be led by two knights from the chapter house door to the stall and there being shall make is oath and be installed it gives no account of laying the mantle on the arm of the proctor at the instant of installation in the choir that being directed to be done before it is also recorded in the blackbok where this ceremony is more fully treated that garter shall take the mantle upon his arms and deliver it to both the knightscommissioners and that they according to the tenor of the statutes shall lay it on the proctors right shoulder in the porch of the chapter house  besides the ancient usage of receiving the mantle in the chapter house or at the chapter house door either before or in the proceeding to the choir of which many instances may be given there are several modern instances where the mantle was born to the choir and sometimes the collar of the order with it not by the proctor but by garter before him and delivered in his principals stall as in the proceeding of the proxy for the duke of wirtembergh anno   jac i when after he had taken the oath and was led into the dukes stall not before was the robe laid on his arm and so was it done in many more installations which manner has so far prevailed as to be the continued practice garter carrying the mantle on a cushion before the proctors into the choir and laying it after they have taken their oaths on their arms in such manner that the cross of st george may be conspicuous  of the proceeding to the choir  0 concerning the proxies proceeding into the choir king henry viiiths statutes direct that he shall be accompanied companied and led by two knightscompanions of the order from the door of the chapter house to the stall assigned to his principal agreeable to which is that passage in the blackbook that as soon as the two knights have placed the mantle on his arm they shall take him between them and conduct him to the stall of his lord and thus assisted have all proxies proceeded to the choir  since the custom of receiving the collar in the chapter house was laid aside the sovereign or his lieutenant with the knightscompanions so soon as the mantle is delivered the proctor or as of late that he has been admitted according to the purport of his deputation proceed to the choir leaving the proxy behind them in the chapter house and after they have taken their stalls the sovereign directs two of the knightscompanions to descend who taking the almsknights officers of arms and the three inferior officers of the order before them pass to the chapter house and bring thence the proxy to his installation in this proceeding the proxy goes bareheaded as did the earl of dover proctor to charles prince palatine of the rhine and sir george cartaret proctor to the prince of denmark anno    car ii  the ceremonies of installation    when the proceeding has entered the choir and paid the accustomed reverences both toward the altar and the soveregns stall and the alms knights officers of ams and of the order taken their usual stations the two commissioners knightsassistants or knightscompanions and proctor make their reverences together and then they conduct him into the lower stalls directy before the stall appointed for his principal the foresad officers of the order standing below in the choir if there be more than two commissioners then the two senor conduct him as before while the rest of the commissioners take their station below in the chir before their proper stalls and there stay till the stallation be finshd and the like do the lieutenatsassisants except the two senior that are imloyed in the ceremony  the poxy thus introduced into the lower salls stands there while the register pronounceh the oath of the order to him which he repeats distinctly laying his hand on the new testament and afterward kisseh the book  the ancient oath appointed by the statutes of institution is short and without limitation in all points the same with that a knightcompanion takes at his personal instalation viz faithfully to observe to the utmost of his power the statutes of the order but afterward the sovereigns and fellows of those other orders of knighthood as the golden fleece monsieur st michael etc before their admission into the order of the garter sued for and obtained the allowance of some relative exceptions or provisos to be added to the aforesaid oath which usually were such as stood with the interest of their religion their great state or dignity or precedent obligation to the order they had before accepted  in the blackbook is a precedent of the oath to be taken by an emperor whereby he is obliged to promie on his royal word and give his faith on his honor and the holy evangelists that he will faithfully and truly to the utmost of his power observe the statutes in every branch and article thereof at least so far as they can or ought to be observed by him and so far as they shall not be ctrary or derogatory to those whereunto he has before given his name and sworn and saving all other conditions agreed on there are besides this other precedents in the annals of the form of the oath from the proctor of an emperor or king and of every other inferior degree wherein are several exceptions before agreed on and when philip king of castil and leon sovereign of the order of the golden fleece was personally installed at windsor anno    hen vii and took the oath without limitation yet he soon after obtained the sovereign desation that the use of the collar and other ensigns of the order might be left to his pleasure and that he might n be obliged to be present at future chapters  other exceptions have been admitted but were obtained with great difficulty and much debate left the dgnity and reputation of the order should nstead o beg kept up be lessened the forbearance of some cistances that has been yielded to having sometim been brought into precedent to the prejudice of the oder  the exceptions that were allowed the archduke of austri when he took the oath at hs investiture at noremberg anno    hen viii were as follow  not to wear the garter and collar but at some certain times in the year at his own pleasure  that if he were not in place convenient to go to hear mass on st georges day he should cause a priest to say it in his presence  not to be obliged if busied in weighty affairs to wear the garter colar or whole habit of the order on st georges day longer than during divine service nevertheless he prmised if he could not than wear it for a whole day together he would willingly wear it on some other solemn day within the compass of the year  of another nature were the exceptions which francis i king of france procured to be admitted into the oath taken by his proctor anno    hen viii viz to observe the statutes of the order of the garter so far as they were consistent with and not contrary or prejudicial to the statutes of the order of st michael and other orders which his principal had before taken of other princes  such like exceptions hve been generally allowed to kings and sovereign princes but as to the proxies of such strangers not sovereign princes but subjects the form of their oath is usually framed by the indu gence of the sovereign with just limitations not only to their obligation of the statutes of any other order they had accepted or any oath formely taken but sometimes to the fidelity and allegiance which they owe their sovereign lord and prince  after the oath has been administered to a strangers proxy with such or the lke exceptios before set down the two knightscommissioners pss up with him into the higher row of stalls and so to that assigned to his principal where being arrived the take the mantle from gater and lay it upon the proctors left arm with the escutcheon of st george uppermost according t an order in a chater hed anno    car ii which was to be a standing rule for the future and is now observed  in the act and ceremony of instllation the commissiones who first conducted the prox i to the choir jointly embrace him then the proxy makes hi double reverence and lastly the commissioners according to the custom of installations set him down in his principals stall where he has used to remain during divine service but by the aforesaid order in chapter anno    car ii the proxies are prohibited sitting in their stalls but directed to stand before them uncovered with their mantles on their right arms until divine service be ended  the two knights between whom the proxy proceeded to installation descend into the choir and stand before their own stalls and after a while first the senior commissioners and then the other ascend into them with usual reverences and then divine service begins  the proctors offering    the proctor having received possession of his principals stall stays in the choir and performs the following ceremonies the chief of which is the offering of gold and silver according to the degree and seniority of his principals stall in case the installation be in the morning but if it be celebrated when st georges feast is held by the sovereigns lieutnant the proxy ought not to offer till the lieutenant has first offered for the sovereign and the lieutenant also offers for himself before the proctor if his stall be higher than the strangers for whom the proctor is installed  the proctor in offering does it with all the ceremony as if his lord were present when the knightscompanions descend from their stalls which ceremony begins with the junior knight he also descends in his turn and places himself below in the choir before the stall of his principal and if he have an opposite knightcompanion he joins himself to him and poceeds toward the altar to the offering with the officers of arms before him but if no knightcompanion e opposite he then proceeds alone having his tain born and a knightcompnion or some other great personage suitable to his degee attending on his left hand to give him the offering wh ch he offers kneeling on a cushion an after him the rest of the knightscompanions pesent offer every one according to the seniority of their stalls  after the offering the poctr taking his way by the east end of the stalls retuns back to the stall of his pincipal and divine service being finishd and like honor in all respects showed to his proxy as if his principal had been present he ought to remain in his masters stall till his next junior knight has left his stall and then descend after him and stnd below before his stall till his turn come to join himself again to the proceeding and so to pass out of the choir  sometimes the proctor has been received at his coming down from his lrds stall by the two knightscommissioners who installed him as were the pctos of federick ii king of denmark and john cunt palatine of the rhine between whom they also prceeded to the chaptehouse door in the same manner the were conducted into the choir but notwithstandig this the proctor ught rather to take in his return the place of his principal as he did at the offering and which is indeed his right and so the poctor of fancis i went behid alone in his principals place and followed the knightscommissioners from the chir to the place where he ged and this method is since followed  the dinner    when the installation has past in the morning there has usually been prepared a great dinner at the sovereigns change we need here only menon what is different in this particular from the personal insallatin of a knightcompanion  the proxy washes alone its at the hief place of the table alone and is served alone bt the other kightscompanions sit at the end of the tale but if the svereigns liuteant be resent the poctor ies at the same tale with him and then a little before the send course is brought in the sovereigs sile is prolaimed with the usual ceremony in latin french and english but otherwise only the sile of the new installed prince and but once the sle and tiles of christian iv king of denmark were proclamed in latin and of muri prince of orange in french  dner being ended all rse in order and wash first the proxy alne and after him the knightscommissioners and ccompanying the proctor to hi chamber where leaving him they retire to their own lodgings and there put off their habits  when the solemnity of installation is over the proctor is to take care that garter forthwith set up the achievements of his principal over his stall and fix the plate of his arms on the back thereof in memorial of the ceremony of inauguration to which end also medals have frequently been struck to perpetuae the honor so received  cap xvii the duties and fees payable by the knightscompanions at their installations touching the fees due to the college of windsor   such was the pety and bounty of our ancestor that they thought no work well performed without being attended with some charitable donatio epecially if it had relaion to the church whereto they generally bore a venerable esteem hence was it a the istallation of the order ordained that every kightopanion should at his entrance bestow a certain sum of

the end that every one entering into this mi itary order might thereby more worthily obtain the name title and privilege of one of the founders of the order it being supposed a worthy and just thing that whosoever obtained this privilege should add some small increment to this foundation  not long after establishing the statutes the titles of marquess and viscount becming special dignities it was decreed anno    he vi that a marquess should contribute   l   s   d and a viscount   l    s   d which was confirmed by king henry viiiths statutes  and though in all the bodies of the statutes the sovereign of the order is charged with payment of fees to the college yet is it to be understood only of those sovereigns who were not before the assumption of their sall elected into this oder  upon

obliged to pay them the first example whereof that we meet with is an order   hen vi which appointed that the usual fees due for the installation of the king of denmark should be discharged by the sovereign as the satute enjoined  to this purpose privyseals were issued to the lord teasurer for the time being to pay the fees to the register of the order out of the exchequer which was the constant custom till king charles i in the   th year of his reign settled an annual pension of   00 l upon the oder and by a commssion in the said year empowered the chancellor of the order and his successors to pay out of the same not only the ordinary but also extraordinary charges of the oder wherein the fees for nstallation of strangers are included  notwithstanding the sovereign as we have shown dishargd the installation fees due from strangers yet they or their proctors for them did always bestow particular rewards on the college the officers of the order and of arms the almsknights and some others who attended the solemnity and in particular garter had anciently bestowed on him a rich gown to wear at the time of installation but of late he has been presented with some other thing of considerable value they also were liberal to the officers of arms as appears by several largesses given to them by their proctors and in general to the greatest part of those that gave their attendance  cap xviii of the grand feast of the order the grand feast appointed to be celebrated annually on st georges day   by the statutes of institution it is ordained that a solemn festival should be annually celebrated on the   d day of april or st georges day in honor of the patron of the order as is observed in other military orders erected since this of the garter to which this seems to give rules of holding their festivals on the anniversary of their patrons thus philip duke of burgundy on his erecting the order of the golden fleece taking st andrew for its patron appointed the festival on st andrews day lewis xi king of france appointed michaelmas day for holding the feast of the order of st michael and so the festival of the duke of savoys order of the annunciade on lady day the duke of bourbons order of the knights of our lady on the conception of our lady  th december and other instances might likewise be given if it were necessary  the anniversary of st george fixed by the church to the twenty third of april   that the   d of april was the day whereon st george suffered martyrdom by beheading appears from the greek hexamiter before his commemoration which was the day observed both by the greek and latin church as also by our predecessors the saxons  st george s day made festum duplex   after the sovereign and knightscompanions had increased the honor of their patrons festival our church began to take greater notice of it being now also esteemed among us as the patron of the nation and therefore they bestowed an addition of honor upon it by making it festum duplex ad modum majorum duplicis   hen v  the place for celebrating the grand feast assigned to windsorcastle   the founder of this most noble order having fixed on this day for performing its solemnities he made choice of that of his nativity the casle of windsor which for a long time after was inviolaly observed there either upon the very day or some other appointed by proogation not long after for which way of prorogation allowance was given by the statutes of the order and of which the registers are full of istances  st georges day kept apart from the grand feast and how then observed   how this noble order flourished from its foundation to the time of henry v no account can be given since the annals thereof are wanting to his reign but then it appears to have been in considerable slendor but the civil wars toward the end of henry viths reign eclipsed it for a while under king eward iv when things were a little settled it seemed to recover and in kg henry viiiths time was at a greater height than ever however though the several branches of the order received some augmentation from the influence f this monarch yet the grand feast began to decline by a removal of the observation of st georges day from windsor and a prorogatory celebration of the grand feast to other times  the article of the statutes causing this great alteration from the original design of the first institution gives the sovereign power to prorogue the grand feast at his pleasure but then it is evident from the same statute that st georges day was nevertheless ordained to be duly oblerved by it self in what place soever the sovereign f within the realm should then reside windsor hereby being not excluded  it farther implies the sacred rites and offices to be performed with other matters concerning the order for besides the particulars therein enumerated this general clause is observable that what other urgent affair sever relating to the order should offer it self to be performed the same might be treated of and receive dispatches in the chapter held where the sovereign then should be as fully as if he were at windsor castle  so that henceforward all things began to be ordered both on the eve the day of st george and the morrow after with as great state all affairs as legally dispatched and all ceremonies as magnificently performed except that of offering up of atchieements which is peculiar to the chapel of st george at windsor only as could be observed at the grand festival it self  and how by virtue of this article and with what ceremonies st georges day was held when the grand feast was prorogued is evident from a full and ample precedent    hen viii now remaining in the office of ams  for though the sovereign with    knightscompanins were at windsor that year upon the       and    of april yet at that time they observed only the feast day of st george with the eve and morrow after but deerred by order in chapter the celebation of the grand feast to the  th of may ensuing  the grand feast neglected by king edward vi   from the accession of this prince the sovereignty of this order became more neglected so that during his no anniversary of st george was kept at windsor y a grand festival  this is supposed to be owing to the common calamity of that age wherein most ceremonies solemn or splendid especially such as related to divine services came under the denomination of being either superstitious or idolatrous insomuch that at a chapter held at greenwich   edw vi an abolition being intended for such ceremonies as were not consonant to the kings injunctions lately prescribed it was then decreed that then and for ever from thenceforth at the feast of this most noble order no other ceremonies should be observed han such as were appointed by his majestys letter  that no procession should be made with going about the church or churchyard but the kings majestys procession lately set forth in english to be used his majesty and other knightscompanions sitting in their stalls at the entry such reverences to be made to the kings majesty only as was heretofore the offering to be in the box for the poor without any other reverence or kissing any paten or other thing but only at the return due reverence to the king as was used before the mass of requiem to be left undone but yet both on st georges day and for next day a mass to be sng with great reverence in which immediately after the words of consecration is said the priest shall say the pater noster and so turn and communicate to all or so many of the order or other after they have done as shall be disposed to receive the communion according to the order prescribed by his majestys book of communion and without any other rite or ceremony after the said communion to be used except some godly psalm or hymn to be sung in english and so to end the said service all chapters and other rites concerning the order n being contary to these to remain as they have been used  this decree seemed to mean nothing less than a prohibition to the holding the grand feast at windsor at least the neglect of its celebration there whilst king edw vi lived and though toward the end of his reign some care was taken for a permission to hold the said feast either on st georges day or some other appointed by prorogation yet it was without any regard to the ancient and usual place for when the act passed commanding the days therein mentioned to be kept holy and no other whereby this was involved among many other saints days then prohibited to be kept as not being found among the feasts then established it was considered that a proiso and allowance should be entered in the aforesaid act for the celebration of this feast particularly by the knightscompanions which act though it suffered a repeal by queen mary yet stands in force at this day being revived by king james i his repealing that statute of   mar cap    removed from windsor by queen elizabeth   but the most fatal blow given to the growing honor of the castle of windsor was a decree in chapter held   eliz with the consent of the knightscompanions then present viz  that if on the vigil and day of st george the feast was not held at windsor according to the usual custom it should nevertheless be sufficient if the observation thereof were kept at the same place where the sovereign should then happen to be where also the rest of the knightscompanions were obliged to be present no less than if the feast had been held at windsor  and so severe was the latter part of this decree against the flourishing condition of that place that it commanded also  that no other solemnity under the notion of st georges feast should thenceforth be celebrated at windsor except upon occasion of the installation of some illustrious person and then also not without express leave of the sovereign  and to say truth this statute was but too stricty observed during her reign for we meet but with one feast of st george held there till   jac i unless we mistake the feasts of installation for those of st george ut then the sovereign who was yet in scotland et his commission dated   april to the earl of nottingham his lieutenant to prorogue the festival to the  d july lowing and after constituted him to hold the feast which was performed the     and   days of the said month with all pomp and ceremony the king himsef being then at windsor was prevented from being present by some occasion not mentioned  thus after a long interval the honor of the feast was restored which had this effect toward the end of king james i reign and that of his son and successor king charles i that it begat a reunion of the feast and place whereby the castle of windsor famous for the institution of this most noble order retrieved its ancient honor of having its solemnities celebrated there  of prorogation of the grand feast   having thus noted that from the beginning of king henry viiiths reign till of late years the grand feast was seldom observed upon the precise day of st george and that the occasion how both day and feast came to be celebrated apart took its rise from the indulgence of the statutes in point of prorogation it is necessary farther to observe that this prorogation is of two sorts either absolute as being enjoined by the statutes or else abitrary at the sovereigns pleasure upon intervening reasons  in the first of these the founders statutes enjoin that if the feast of st george shall happen within fifteen days next after easter day it shall be prorogued to the sunday frtnight or fifteen days after easter day and the reason is there given that every of the knightscompanions might have opportunity of coming thereto without being constrained to ride upon any of those three holy days preceedig easter day the same rule for prorogation where there is a concurrence of these two feasts is likewise enjoined by the statutes of king henry v and king henry viii  and when the grand feast in this cae of easter has been kept before the expiration of the said fifteen days the knightscompanions then absent to avoid the penalty for their not appearing have made excuse that the ancient statutes of the order were violated in keeping the feast within fifteen days after ester as was aledged when sir john denham lord treasurer as president held the feast of st george at windsor    april   eny vii  anciently where the register mentions the grand feast to e held at windsor beyond the day of st geoge it is observable upon calculation that easter day in those times ell too near the   d of april to celebrate the feast on without breaking the law which was the real cause of those prorogations of which there are many instances  and as the knightscompnions had prohibitions put upon the solemnization of their feast in case of its interering with ester so had the church of england in their observation of st georges day in reference to several other festivals and this continued till the time of the reformation begun by king edward vi but since the grand feast has been celebrated upon any of them indifferently the feast of easter only excepted  the second sort of prorogations which are merely arbitrary and wholly dependent on the sovereigns pleasure yet warranted sufficiently from the words causa postulante mentioned in king henry viiis statutes as likewise the great latitude given the sovereigns of this most noble order in reference to their affairs in the sam statutes the first precedent of which was ann   hen v when about august four months after st geoges day that king being engaged in the wars of france ordered the feast to be celebrated at caen in nmandy and with great solemnity created fifteen kights into the order  there are several other examples particularly one   hen viii when the king being at etham on st georges day it was in a chapter there held decreed that the accustomed feast of st george should be observed at windsr   th of may ensuing and from this time it became annually customary to keep the day of st george where the sovereign at that time made his abode on which day and the day after the usual solemnities were observed but as to the solemnization of the grand feast it el that was in one of the chapters then hed adjurned to some farther time and then solemnized at windso by prorogation not by the sovereigns themselves but by their lieutenants and their assistants appointed for that purpose  but to proceed with the causes of prorogation which were either for some weighty reasons or upon emergent occasions anno   mariae the sovereign celebratng the feast of st george at st jamess philip prnce o spain and the earl of sussex were on the morrow aer elected into the oder whereupon it was likewise dcre that the inauguration of these two elect knight till the prince came to england which happening   st july following the grand feast together with that of the elect knights installations were appointed to be celebrated at the same time  again   and   phil and mar at a chapter held   d april the feast of st george together with the installation of three elect knights was appointed to be held at windsr the  th of may ensuing and by a chapter summoned the  d of may before the appointed day for holding the feast the same was prorogued to the   th of december following upon the pressing affairs of the king and queen but before that designed time came another chapter was held on the   st of october wherein it was again prorogued to the first sunday after twelfthday viz   january if by that time the king who was then in flanders should return to england but that not happening it was farther prorogued to the  0th of february and thence by another decree to st georges day of which there are many other examples and sometimes upon other occasions but still at the sovereigns pleasure  of commissions of prorogation   there is no precedent of commissions for prorogation ancienter than    car i left by sir thomas row wherein notice is taken of all the adjournments of the grand feasts from st georges day preceding til that time with the reasons thereof and chiefly upon consideration of the spreading sickness together with a cmmand to the knightscompanions and the officers of the order to attend the sovereign on the new assigned days for celebrating the feast  as to the substance hereof the succeeding commissions very near agree yet with some little difference as first the preambles are general and run thus wereas upon special reasons and other important affairs etc except the commission issued   th february      where the peamble was fitted to a special occasion and runs thus  wereas we have determined to create the prince our eldest son a knight and to propose him in election as  companion of our most noble order for the more convenience of his installation we have thought fit to defer the feast of st george etc  but in the commissions of prorogation of the grand feast   th february    car i the place appointed for celebration is omitted which defect we find in the abovementioned precedent also yet afterward that material part came to be incerted and first of all in that commission of the   th february    car i where the place being the city of york is put into the body of the commission and when the civil war drew on and the sovereign could not well ascertain any place then the grand feast was appointed to be kept at any such place as on a nearer view should seem convenient afterward it varied something and came to be inserted thus  wheresoever we shall then be or thus at such places as we shall timely appoint  the most ordinary course preparatory to the issuing such commissions of prorogation has been by the sovereigns declaration in chapter or otherwise the signification of his pleasure to the chancellor of the order at any other time who thereupon drew up the commission and presented it to the sovereign for his sign manual and then affixed thereto the great seal of the order but where the chancellor was not at hand to receive the sovereigns commands in this case it was conveyed to him by some other hand with command to summon the knightscompanions and officers accordingly for so it was done to sir francis windebank knight secretary of state by his letter to sir thomas row    car i for prorogation of the grand feast  and as all the preceding adjournments of the grand feast have been either decreed in chapter or directed immediately from the sovereign so there is a precedent where the lieutenant has been empowered to prorogue the same yet to the time and place appointed by the sovereign and inserted in the commission of lieutenacy and this was in a commission   jac i directed to charles earl of nottingham  that the grand feast ought to be celebrated on a year  0 though the prorogations of the grand fea have been occasionally made use of on the aforesaid important reasons yet no such adjournment or prorogation is legally to be enlarged beyond st georges day ensung because once within the compass of every year the grand feast ought to be solemnized for so it was ordained by the statutes at the institution of the order and confirmed likewise by the succeeding statutes and when our historians take notice of the grand feast they seak of the same thing that it ought annually to be performed whence it is frequently called in the registers annua festivitatis solemnitas annua celebritas annua and the like  of late times an occasion happened that brought this of the statutes into a solemn debate in chapter which for the resut thereof became very remarkable  at a chapter held at white hall  d february    0 the sovereign proposed to the knightscompanions that having prorogued the celebration of st georges feast fro time to time to the     and   of march so near lent that if the feast were not held on these days it could not be done within the compass of that year because the   d of april for the next year did fall on good friday and s consequently must have been kept in lent this year or not at all and consideing the great and impotant affairs of the pliament he moved the question whether if there wee no feast kept this year it would be any blemish to the honur f the order and whether he might not dispense with the saute and defer it til next year they all cnfessed the soveeigns dispensing power yet some of the knights seeing from the institution to that time no prent was ound where the grand feast had been wholly omied but that some of the sovereigns even thugh engaged in war byond sea either solemnized the feast in their own psnce or by commission in england which was averred by the chancellor to be both the fundmental and constant practice humbly besought the sovereign not to begin to make any breach in the constant order so long and ninteruptedly continued whereupon it was resolved by general vote that the feast should be celebrated on the aforesaid days of prorogation  by which determination it sufficiently appears of what moment the sovereign and knights cmpanions then conceived it to the honor of the order to follow the statutes for the celebration of the grand feast once every year besides it is observable that it was not thought expedent to be dspensed with even on the most pressing and important occasions but rather than the statutes should suffer any violation the feast was then solemnized though they were so straightened in point of time as not to have above two days to make preparation for it  and though indeed on the breaking out of the unhappy civil war the sovereign was obliged to defer the solemnity from year to year it was not to be looked on as any precedent and on the restoration of king charles ii it renewed its former order  cap xix of preparations for the grand feast of the order of letters giving notice of the time and place   among many other things which are necssry to be prepared beforehand the first of cuse is the letters directed to all the kightscompanions and officers of the order resident within he kingdom to give them notice of the time and place when and where the feast is to be hld   leer of dispenlaon to such knights as the sovereign shall please to excuse from their attendance at the feast   commssion of lieutenancy or sometimes of assistance when the sovereign cannot personally solemnize the same   warrants for the removal of achievements if there be then occasion   escutcheons and styles to be set on the back of each knightcompanions stall if the feast be held elsewhere than at windsor   the chappl to be decently adorned   the great hall or other place for the grand diner to be prepared and very nobly furnished   and lastly officers to be apointed besides those of the order of arms who are to give peculiar attendance on the sovereign at this grand solemnity  as to the first of these points the chancellor is to attend the sovereign some convenient time before the approach of st georges day to learn his pleasure therein and whether he is inclined to prorogue the day etc  if the sovereign be inclined to a prorogation thn the chancellor is to draw up a commission fr that purpose after this letters issed out anciently under the sovereigns sign manual both to his lieutenant when he hods not the fast persoally and the knightscompanions giving them notice of the time and place but of late the chancellor has been appointed to dispatch these letters in his own name  but whether the feast be held upon st georges day or any other by prorogation the sovereigns pleasure was usually known so long before the apointed time that these circular letters issued out sometimes t three four five or six months before the assigned day an in cases where there has been farther prgatins cre has been taken to isse out new commissin in the like convenient tim before the old were expired as may be observed by what has gone before that o those knightscompanions who are most remote from court man have sufficient time to prepare either for atndace or on just occasion to apply themselves to the svereign for letters of dispensation for abence and farther that the abent knights may thereby take notice of the day set because such are obiged to hold the feast in their own houses at the ame m  bsies the letters directe to the knightscompanions the chncellor is likewise to write hi  o each of the officers of the order to give them the like notice  of dispensations for not attending the grand feas   it having been complained of by the chancellor of the order and taken notice of by the sovereign and knightscompanions in a chapter held at the celebration of the grand feast    car i at white hall  that of late years diverse knightscompanions had neglected both their attendance on the sovereign at the feast of st george or to send under their seals of arms their probable excuses and petitions for license and dispensation contrary to the most ancient statutes and their duty  it was therefore among many other things decreed tha for the future every knight of the order should be bound to attend on the usual days or such as should be assigned by prorogation but in case of sickness or other important business to reard them they should under their sals of arms to the chancellor signify the reasons for requiring a dispensation for their absence twenty days atleast before the usual or assigned time to be presented by him to the sovereign and on neglect of so doing except in sudden accidents should not be excused but incur the penalty of the statutes  and it is evident that this way of enjoining the knightscompanions to send the reason that prevented their attendan under their seals has been very ancient for the blackbk rerds an order in chapter held at a general feat   he vi o this very purpose and ejoned farher that when suc absent knights were present at the ne feas ey should be obliged to give the reasn hy te should no iur he penalty of their former absence since the saues ejin it  in pursunc of the eforementioned decree sir thomas  the chancellor added to those his letters dated    m    and directed to the  ude he seal of the order this following postcrpt  accoi to o cts made in chapter in the presence of the    april     concerning he neglect of he  i  attendace upon his  george and a cmmand expres  so ch to your lordship i have the true copies of the acts themselves it being resolved in case of omission of your lawful and timely excuse under your seal of arms and in occasion of absence in keeping the solemnity in your own house that no dispensation shall be given but your lordship shall incur the penalties of the ancient statutes which are that you shall not be permitted to the chapter nor to your seat the next year but shall stand before it as do the choiristers in procession then you shall go before and not in your place among the knights and shall offer last and that this penance being done you shall come before the seat of the sovereign and ask absolution but if two years successively your lordship shall omit your attendance or timely suit for dispensation ou shall pay twenty marks and that sum to be doubled for every year of such omission till you are reconcild and pardoned by the sovereign whereof i beseech your lordship to take knowledge  it aterwards appears by an order past in chapter  th october    car i that this early notice to be given from such of the knightscompanions as upon the reasons already mentioned should be absent was designed chiefly in favor of the officers of the sovereigns household who by knowing in due time who should be absent and who not might make timely and certain provision for the feast  upon notice sent by the chancellor to the knightscompnions as aforesaid if any of them should happen to be any way indisposed or have other lawful exuse for not repairing to court and attending the feast they may acquaint the chancellor therewith whose duty i is to represent it to the sovereign and thereon to procure his leters of dispensation for their absence if the sovereign consents  which letters are to be conveyed by garter or carried by whomsoever he shall appoint for which there was a fee by the mile allowed him by the following order past at a meeting held by the knightscommissioners for regulating points relating to the order    car i  whereas it having anciently been the office of garter king of arms to disperse and send letters of prorogation dspensatin and other command of the sovereign to the absent knights which in man cses must be chargeable it as this day ordred that if he should send ay act of avour or dispensation to any knight absent from his majestys court or four miles from the city of london he to whom such dispensation should be sent should pay his servant or messenger for every days travel as much as is allowed and paid any other messengers of his majestys house or chamber  variety of occasions and accidents as grounds to move the sovereign and inducements to obtain his dispensation are extant in several letters sent to sir thomas row when chancellor on the aforesaid injunctions decreed    car i but they all agree in the causes we have mentioned  of commissions of lieutenancy   touching the third particular and preparing commissions of lieutenancy in such cases where the sovereign cannot personally celebrate the feast as also commissions for those whom he thinks fit to appoint for his assistants the reader is referred to the head in the next chapter under which there is an account of constituting a lieutenant and here only observe that the chancellor is to draw up these commissions and attend the sovereign for his hand and after to pass them under the great seal of the order  warrant for the removal of achievements   if there be occasion for removal of any of the knightscompanions achievements at the grand feast which indeed has seldom happened unless an installation were celebrated at the same time then does the chancellor obtain the sovereigns warrant directed to garter for the performance thereof but of this we have already said sufficient under the head of preparations made for personal installations of a knightcompanion  escutcheons of arms and styles   heretofore when the celebrations of st geoges day were kept at any other place besides windsor caste it was thought most necessary to provide large paper ecutcheons wherein were marshalled the arms and quarterings of the sovereign and each knightcompanion in metal and color encompassed with a garter and thereon crowns caps or coronets peculiar to each dignity with their styles and titles fairly printed underneath but without crests or supporters to be set on the back side of their stalls on the eve of the feast but the sovereigns arms were impaled with those of st george over which an imperial crown was placed and these in defect of the plates and banners set over their stalls in the choir of st georges chapel at windsor did serve for directions for the knightscompanions that by the view of them they might the more readily and certainly know their proper stalls  we have not met with any memorial of this usage that reaches higher than anno    hen vii when the sovereign holding the dy of st george at cambridge kings college chapel was furnihed with escutcheons of the knightscompanions arms but to show the use was ancient there is this note put into the memorial as was yearly accustomed anno    hen viii the soereign being at windsor on the eve of st george appointed he service of the church to be ceerated in his chapel in the upper qudrangle of widsor castle and there being present with him thirteen knightscompanions ech of them had set over their heads an escutcheon of their arms  ths manner the stalls were afterward solemnly  and enlarged to absent knights b an oe of chapter held at greenwich anno   edw vi wherein the svereign and knightscompanions agreed tha from thenceforth every stall upon st goges eve should have an escutcheon of the arms of them which are absent as well as those that were present at their sveral cos and charges  but this cnnt be understood of the salls situate in the chape of st george at windsr fr sies that we have met with no ancet acout o any such cusm in that place we find a mmorial  the cntary when quen elizaeth in the sixh yar of er  held the feast of s george upon i proper day at windsor castle namely that there was no  of the knightscompanions arms set up there but only the plates and without all doubt had it been the usage to fix escutcheons in the choir of that chapel as at other places they would not at that time especially have been omitted because then the sovereign appeared upon an extraordinary occasion and where many things were added to heighten the glory of that grand feast by reason the peace between england and france was to be proclaimed at this festival in the presence of the french ambassador and was accordingly done with great solemnity on st georges day in the morning at the eastentrance in the lower ward of the castle at the top of the hill toward st georges chapel and to which place the sovereign in her whole habit of the order the french ambassador being near her with the five officers of the oder and knightscompanions before her and before them the officers of arms and trumpets proceeding in a stately and well ordered cavalcade and after clarenceux king of arms had ended the proclamation they continued the proceeding thence to the chapel in the same state and order  as to the practice and constant usage of setting up escutcheons of arms since anno   edw vi and at such time as st georges day was held elsewhere than at windsor we have seen variety of testimonies  the care of ordering and providing of which belonged to garter but the sovereign of the order was at the charge notwithstanding the said order anno   edw vi which heretofore we see was paid out of the treasury in the exchequer and since the establishment of   00 l per annum settled by the late sovereign king charles i to discharge he ordinary and extraordinary expenses of the order the allowance issued thence and was paid y the chancellor of the order but now the charge is placed upon garter he having an allowance therefore included in the augmentation of his pension anno    car ii  we find privy seals to have issued as high as the iteenth of queen eizabeth for the annual allowance    l for escutcheons employed for the use aoresaid and that the price some time before was about that rate r the three and twenty escutcheons provided against st georges feast anno   and   phil and mar came to   l   s and   d and those five and twenty set up the followig year   l    s and   d some differences the also being in the work which enhanced the price viz those provided for princes at   s and   d a piece and each of the rest at   s  the sovereign the prince of wales and stranger kings and princes have accustomably had at these times majesty escutcheons set up over each of their stalls but the rest of the knightscompanions lodging escutcheons only and we have seen an account of some majesty escutchens prepared for every st georges feast from      to      to wit one for the sovereign another for the king of denmark a third for the prince of wales and a fourth for frederick count palaine of the rine at   s and   d a piece but so many knightscompanions as attended the sovereign at those feats had each a lodging escucheon at   s and   d  from the marshalling of arms quartered in the knightscompanions escutcheons and ordeing their sles printed always in french there are several things no les useful than worthy of observation for first though the plates of arms and quarterings fixed in each knightcompanions stall at windsor continue there without alteration or very seldom changed from that orde hrein they were marshalled at that time of their intlation yet these escutcheons and styles annually set up o admit of frequent alteration as there is occasion either by adding more quarterings altering the styles or amending any thing that is amiss  for instance whereas the duke of savoy before   eliz bre gules a cross argent it was then ateed into five coats that is to say in the first quarer westphalia saxe mderne and angry in the second chablais in the third aouste and the fourth as the first and over all in the middle the aforesaid escutcheon of savoy  when the lord hunsdon was installed ano   eliz he had twelve coats of arms thus mashalled in hs pte four four and four the first cay the second specer the thrd smerset the ourth  the fith omnd the sixth hoo the seventh rochfod the egth seyomer the ninth malmains the tenth wiinghm the eleventh s ledger and the twelh  but anno   eliz his escutcheon eceived an addition o our other coats viz beauchamp warwick berkley and gerd and they were inserted next to somerset the third coat in this said plate  but on the contrary where ambrose earl of warwick had twenty one coats put into his plate anno   eliz and they marshalled in this order five five five an six namely first sutton second paganell third gray of ruthin fourth hastings fifth quincy sixth malpas seveth somery eighth valence ninth talbott tenth warwick eleventh beauchamp twelfth berkley thirteenth lise fourteenth gerard fifteenth guilford sixteenth houlden seventeenth west eighteenth and nineteenth quarterly de la ware and cantilupe twentieth mortimere of wigmore and twenty one greely at the feast of st george held at white hall anno   eliz his escutcheon contained but sixteen viz four four four and four namely first sutton second paganell third somery fourth malpas fifth gray of ruthin sixth hastings seventh valence eighth ferrers ninth quincess tenth chester eleventh talbot twelfth beauc amp thirteenth warwick fourteenth berkley fifteenth gead sixteenth lisle so that there were seven coats taken out of the former namely guilford holden west de la wae and cantilupe quarterly mortimere and greely and two added viz ferrers and chester  but the greatest and frequentest variations are in the styles and titles of honor set under the escutcheons and these relate unto and are occasioned principally from their attaining or resigning of offices or dignities  we find that the style set under the escutcheon of ferdinand the empire at st georges feast anno   and   phil and mar was as follows  du trs hault tresexcellent and trespuissant prince ferdinand par la grace de dieu roy des romans de hungaie and bohemie archduc daustrie duc de bourgoigne etc chevalier du tresnoble order de la jarretiere  but anno   eliz in the said emperors style the ttls of king of hungary and bohemia were left out because maximilian his son had a little before obtained both those kingdoms  in the reign of queen elizabeth the styles of philip king of spain who while queen mary lived was cosovereign of this most noble order run thus  du tres hault tresexcellent and trespuissant prince philip par la grace de dieu roy despaigne des deux cicels and jerusalem arch duc d austriae duc de bourgoigne millan and brabant compte de hapsburghe flanders flanders and tiroll chevalier du tresnoble order de la jarretiere  but at the feasts of st george anno       and  0 eliz the title of catholic prince was also given him  the instances relating to knightsubjects are very many there having been almost every year some additions or omissions  in the duke of norfolks style anno   eliz the lieutenantship of the north was omitted in the earl of rutlands at the same feast president of the council in the council in the north was added the marquess of winchester caused the title of baron st john to be omitted because his eldest son bore that title and was a baron of parliament  it may be further observed that a stranger elect having received the habit and ensigns of the order has been allowed the honor of having an escutcheon of his arms set on the back of that stall designed for him notwithstanding he has not been installed  of adorning the chapel   the chapel where divine service is celebrated at the time of the grand feast whether it be that of st georges at windsr or elsewhere as the sovereign is pleased has at all times been adorned with rich furture the care and oversight whereof at windsor is committed to the dean of the college but at other places to the dean of the chapel  the altar by the gift of pious benefactors was ad rned with vessels sumptuous both for their materials and workmanship but temp hen viii and edw vi most of them were disposed of so that king james i taking notice that very litte plate and other ornaments were belonging to the chapel was pleased to make some provision for the adorning thereof which was at length effected by the free contributions of the knights themselves  for at a chapter held at white hall    jac i it was decreed that every knightcompanion should give to the use of the altar in the said chapel a piece of plate of the value of  0 l at the least  this decree was confirmed anno   car i the dean and canons of windsor being empowered to demand and receive the sums of money as above which they were to bestow in plate for the use of the altar and accordingly they agreed for the quantity of plate hereafter mentioned which was delivered anno      viz  ou dr two little candlesticks chased and guilt for wax candles 0   0  two chalices with four pattens     0  two great candlesticks neat for tapers        two little basins        one great basin   0 00  l s the value at    s the ounce came to   0  0 besides nine cases 00   0  but to make some farther addition to the glory of this altar king charles ii at the time of his installation offered two large gilt waterpots weighing     ounces ten penny weight amounting by the excellent workmanship to    s the ounce and to the sum of     l  0 s some sacred ceremonies were performed at the consecration of this plate not very necessary to be spoke of here but all these with the other goods and monuments belonging to the kings free chapel and teasury at windsor were ried and taken away by the parlament army king charles ii therefore after the reauration anno      by the consent of the knightscompanions did levy and collect and by his own bounty furnished the chapel again with the following plate  a pair of gilt flaggons bought with money collected from the knightscompanons   0 ounces a pair of wrought flaggons with great bellies aving the figure of st george on horseback on the cover etc bought with the knights money     ounces one small basin    ounces and an half a pair of plain gilt chalices and covers bought also with the knights money     ounces and a

trumpeters sergeant trumpeter dum major four drummers and a fife cap xx the order of the ceremonies on the eve of the grand feast of the beginning of the grand feast   the celebration of the grand feast with the ceremonies devised to set forth and illustrate the glory theref has been worthy the observation of the first institutor and all succeedng sovereigns well knowing that what is once slighly oberd will soon all into disesteem if not into contempt therere they have been very particula to the day the hor and the place where the sovereign and knightscompanions are to meet  as to the first although st georges dy or such other day as the sovereign shall please to nominate and apoint by prorogation in lieu thereof be the principal and grand day of the feast yet the eve of that day des the feast take commencement and determines not till the third day following the whole solemnity taking up three days inclusively  and this is clear from several articles of the statutes wherein the course of the ceremonies to be obser at the grand solemnity are set down whether observed on the eve the feast day or the morrow after and these three days together did the sovereign hold the grand feast whether they personally celebrated the same or deputed other of the knightscmpanions to that employment the cause of the commissions of deputation limitting their power either in general during the time of the feast or in particular upon the day of st georg the day and that following viz the last day of the feast in like manner when in succeeding times commissions of prorogation of the grand feast were made use of we find the three days continuance of the feast to be particularly mentioned in the body of those commissions namely the day wherein by such appointment the feast was to begin the grand day it self and the day whereon it ended  the directions given in the statutes for the order and course of this solemnity to begin with the eve ru thus every year upon st georges eve shall be an assembly or meeting of all the knightscompanions of the order at windsor castle etc and the same is positively enjoined by all the other bodes of the statutes  and as the grand feast is generally said to commence in vigilia sancti georgii or as it is otherwise expressed in the blackbook in vigilia in future celebratis or vi divi georgii or in vigilia festi so has the time of thus preceding day several other denominations given  in the same register vesper ante diem sancti georgii in vesperiis georgianis in vesperiis fesi in vesperiis commitionem and at other times pridie divi geogii pidie georgianae solenitatis pridie festi pidie eriarum divi georgii and sometimes per vigilia and lastly in plam english st georges eve all which signify one and the same thing and are but various names given to the evening of the day foregoing either that of st george or that whereon the grand feast is appointed to be held by prorogation  thus we see that the founder began his solemnity upon the eve of the feast day which doubtless was in conformity to the custom of the church who made the vigils and eves part of the ensuing festivals and as ushers to the grand solemnities  as the eve was appointed by the founder for the commencement of the anniversary of the grand feast so to make the time more certain the statutes exress the exact hour of meeting for beginning the solemnities to be at the hour of tierce which in many other places is called hora tertiarum but this seemed not sufficient to express clear enough the meaning of a law where a penalty was enjoined and therefor at a chapter held at windsor    edw iv a scrupe arising among the knightscompanions concerning the words hora tetiarum whether they were intended to mean three in the afternoon or at the hour of the church generally used after prime noon before and fixed it to the latter  the registrum chartaceum records the same explanation of the words and to let us see that twas immediately put in practice it is there entered with the names of those knightscompanions present with the sovereign both in the morning and evening of the same day  another instance of which there is   hen vii on the eve of the grand feast held by prorogation at windsor where the sovereign in regard of the arrival of several ambassadors put off the usual chapter till noon whence it is evident that the custom at this time was likewise to begin the solemiy in the morning  but notwithstanding the said decree of king edw iv we find it anno    hen viii to be meant and inended for three in the afernoon and when king henry viii came to model the statutes of the order in two several articles he declares and expounds the hora tortia which the english version of those statutes renders the hour of tierce to be the hora tertia post merediem three in the afternoon and in another article of the same satutes hora tertiarum id est hora tetiarum pst meedim and elsewhere hora tertia vespertina vel pomeridiana which hour as it was then settled to be the punctual time for the knightscompanions meeting to enter on the solemnity of the feast so has it ever since continued unaltered and usually observed  the place of assembly for the sovereign and knightscompanions has usually been in such of the sovereigns privy lodgings both at windsor or elsewhere as he has appointed frequently in the privy withdrawing or bed chambers to this appointed place the knightscompanions repair to give their attendance on the sovereign having first invested themselves in full robes either in their own lodgings or some convenient room at court where garter is to attend them with notice of the approahing hour  the knightscompanions being come to the sovereign as likewise the officers of the order habited in their mantles and bearing in their hands the symbols of their several offices they wait the sovereigns being vested in his robes till he passes into the presence chamber or give beginning to the feast by opening the chapter at their meeting before he goes thither  abut the same time the provincial kings healds and pursuivants wearing their coats of the sovereigns arms so also the band of pensiners armed with their pole axes assemble in the prence chamber but the prebends of the college vested in their taffay mantles over their srplices and almsknights in their mantles and surcoa me no nearer than the guard chamber  lastly the servants and attendants of the knightscompanions meet without the guard chamber door whence spreading themselves down the stairs through the stone galery into the upper ward of the caste or as far as ther number will reach all want the sovereigns cming forth into the presence  it will be necessary here to inform the reader in rgard not only the feast day of st grge but the grand feast held in honor of the oer has been ke in several other places besides windsor castle moe particularly at witehall st jamess greewich and yk that there are may cermomes and other particulas hraer named which alter not with the place but appean to the festival and are theree to be observed every where alike as for instance the form of proceeding the manner of holding chapters the ceremony of offering gold and silver swearing of officers and such like but others there are which are precisely local and particular as the prebends and almsknights going in the poceeding the offering up of achievements etc to windsor only  since the withdrawing the grand feast from windsor some of the officers of arms curious in the observation of these solemnities performed in other paces have afforded us great pnty of memorials relating to the ceremonious part thereof while the same was continued at windsor and therefore when the true place where the instance lies shall be also cited the reader is not to conclude that the precednt urged does not full enough answer the purpose unes it had been likewise fetched from windsor but that in this case the cermny or example is such as is peculiar to the feast not the p ace and ought to be observed without alteration at an place where the sovereign shall keep the grand feast  of setting the proceeding in order   in tmes past the knightscompanions appeared at the grand feast aended with a numerous tain of servants and other dependents but the feast having removed from windsor to other places much of this ancient splendour was laid asie yet upon king james i acesion to the crow somewhat of this glory began to revive for we find it entered upon the register in the fourth of his reign that the ancient custom which for some ys had been intermitted wheein at the soemnity of this fest all the knightscompanions were wont to g attended each with a arge tain was recalled and brought back into use  but this height of gallantry and splendour in the number of attendants and rihness of their apparel within ten years grew up to such excess or rather exorbitancy that it required a rstant wherefore the sovergn by the uanimus advie of the knightscompanions decreed and commanded that every one of the knightscompanions of the order should have to attend upon his pesn at the yearly solemnization of the feast of the order fifty ersons and no more the reason whereof we find elsewhere noted to be for saving of charge and avoiding of emulation but in the beginning of king charles i reign of ever blessed memory the gallantry of attendants began again to increase and augment insomuch that at the grand feast held at white hall the   d   d and   th of april anno   car i we find it observed that the knightscompanions came forth attended each with a train of servants very richly clad  but to return and enter upon the proceeding to the end the servants and attendants of the knightscompanions may be exactly marshalled the usher of the hall whose duty it is to rank them ought to call for a list from garter of such knightscompanions as are to be present at the grand feast noted with their several places in the proceeding for his better directions in assigning the attendants their due places the order whereof is thus first the junior knightsattendants proceed one before another on the left hand upon whose right hand the second eldest knightsattendants go in equal rank with them for this we observe to have been the geneal rule where the knightscompanions proceed in pairs ther attendants go together those belonging to the senior knights of the two on the right hand and to the junior upon their left but the order is otherwise where any of the knightscompanions proceed single and alone which often falls out as shall be noted in its due place for then the attendants belonging to that single knight go two and two on both sides the way opposite one against the other  but when the grand feast is celebrated at whitehall there the knightscompanions attendants are marshalled by the said usher on both sides the passage from the outward door of the guard chamber down into the hall taking up all the room as far as the old chapel and because here they do not proceed in regard of the shortness of the processional way but only make a stand for the proceeding to pass through them they are ranked in a way dfferent from that used at windsor nevertheless relating more especially to the order oberved by their masters which method in the sovereigns proceedng to the chapel at the befoementioned feast held at white hall anno   car i we find thus described the eldest knightcompanions servants were ranked on the right hand of the passage the chiefest of them near unto the old chapel door and the second knight being companion to the eldest his attendants stood on the le side the chiefest of them also next the said old chapel door and in case the edest knights fellow or companion be not present in this proceeding then the eldest knights servants ought to be placed opposite one against the other upon each side the said old chapel door the like order is to be taken in marshalling the servants of the other knights of this most noble order whose companions are hen absent  secondly the order of proceeding amongst the almsknights who anno   car i had two waiters of the soereigns hal in their livery coats bearing white rods in their hands to prceed before them is in general two and two together the junior is placed foremost on the left hand and his next senior on his right and if sickness or other laful impediment chance to hinder one or more of them from going in the proceeding his junior is advanced into his place and consequently all the other juniors do in like manner alter their places and advace to the end the superior place be still supplied accoring to the right rule of marshalling the singles that compose a gross body but in this case if the number that attend happen to be odd the governor of the almsknights goes last of all and alone  thirdly the virger of the college has his place next after the almsknights and immediately before the pebends of the college who being habited in a gown bears a silver vege the ensign of his office nevertheless heretoore when the prebends went not in the proceeding on the eve of the grand feast the virger proceeded first of all before the almsknights for so it was observed on the eve of st george at windsor anno   eliz and in this manner we see it expressed in the prceeding set forth by marcus gerchad  fourthly under the general rule relating to the almsknights are comprehended the prebends of the college the pu suivants heralds and provincial kings insomuch that where either of the said kings are absent the senior erald is advaced and goes in breast on the left hand of him who is then present so also where any of the heralds are wanting his next junior ascends into his place whereby it sometimes falls out that the senior pursuivant is joined to the left hand of the junior herald and through their defects and absence the number of the officers of arms be odd then with this difference in the foresaid rule observed among the almsknights the youngest pursuivant goes single by himself  touching the right of precedence between the officers of arms and prebends of the college in proceeding before the sovereign and knightscompanions we find there has been heretofore not only some question started but the place contended for insomuch that at the intallation of the earls of shrewsbury and cumberland anno    eliz the prebends took place and upon the   th of may anno    eliz at the installation of thomas lord howard of walden and others the prebends again endeavored to pass between the officers of arms and officers of the order but charles lord howard of effingham then lieutenant to the sovereign delivered his opinion on the behalf of the officers of arms against the prebends  yet did not this so settle the order of precedence or quiet the prebends but that the contention again broke out anno   jac i at the installation of the earls of pembrook mar southampton and duke of lenox which happened on the ninth not second of july in the foresaid year even to such a height that the prebends pursuivants and heralds contended in the proceeding but the controversy was on he next morning composed by the lord admiral then the sovereigns lieutenant the lord treasurer and the earl of wocester and the order in proceeding thus setled first that the almsknights should go foremost the pursuivants next then the prebends and then the heralds and kings of arms and this order in proceeding was afterward observed on the    may anno   jac i at the installation of the earl of salisbuy and viscount bindon as also the    may anno   of the same king at the installation of the earls of dubar and montgomery  howeit anno   jac i and so afterward we do not find the pursuivants mentioned in the proceeding by partculr nme nor otherwie than in this following order viz almsknights prebends heralds etc but it may be presumed that the pursuivants then joined again in body with the heralds though for some years before ivided from them by the interposition of the prebends as well as the provincial kings and all of them under the title of heralds and sometimes officers of arms  and though at the grand feast held by prorogation on sunday the   th of september in the said fifteenth year of king james it is noted that the prince being then the sovereigns lieutenant proceeded to morning service on the feast day with the almsknights heralds prebends and officers of the order before him from which manner of expression it may perchance be supposed that the heralds went at that time next after the almsknights and before the prebends nevertheless elsewhere we find them on the eve of the aforesaid feast ranked in this following order  the almsknights the prebends the officers of arms the knights of the order etc and doubless they proceeded in the same order to the chapel on the next morning notwithstanding what is before said to the contrary those expressions being interwoven with the general account given of the ceremonies of the whole festival and more subject to mistake where the relation of the proceeding is carried on in a continued dscourse than were ranked as is before exhibited in particular lines and in the order and form of a proceeding beses we no where meet with any order or decree nulling the foresaid determination made anno   jac i which places the prebends before the heralds finally to give an end to the disputes in this point we find that upon the ee of this feast held at windsor the       and    of november anno   car i the prebends proceeded next before the pusuivants and the pusuivants immediately before the heralds and provincial kings that is to say all the officers of arms except garter whose place is elsewhere proceeded in one enire body together which order we find to be the same in all proceedgs after that we have met with and was so observed at the grand feast held at windsor anno    car ii and ever since but to proceed  all the before mentioned attendants wait in their several stations till the hour of tierce when the soveeign having the knightscompanions and officers of the order before him and his train carried up passes toward the presence chamber notice of whose coming being given the band of pensioners make the accustomed guard and passage along the presence chamber the seniors standing toward the lobby door within which guard on the other side the officers of arms place themselves upon the same warning the yeomen of the guard clear a like passage from the presence chamber door along the guard chamber unto its outward door for the proceeding to pass through  at the sovereigns approach one of the gentlemn ushers attended with the sword of state the point resting upon the ground delivers to such one of the nbility not being a knight of the order whom the svereign as an honorary favor has before nominated to bear it from thence before him in all the proceedings of the feast during which action the knightscompanions proceed forwards and being entered the presence chamber flank on each side the state with some small distance between them and there make a stand the svereign being also entered passes to the step before the state the nobleman who bears the sword and the five officers of the order retiring a little on his right hand and then turning himself toward the knightscompanions stands there a while until they have made their reverences unto him which being performed he resaluteth the knightscompanions by putting off his cap this done the sovereign puteth his cap on again whereupon every of the knightscompanions puts on theirs and immediately rank themselves according to their due place on both sides the state  for the right understanding whereof we are in the fifth place to note that in the order and method wherein the knightscompanions are ranked if they be all rsent is two and two together the junior foremst on the left hand for that is his place in all proceedings but where any of them be absent the rule is dffrnt from that appropriate to the beforementioned dgre for though it be recorded that upon the eve of the grand feast held at windsor anno   hen v the knightscompanions went in order to the chapter house and choir yet this being expressed but in general terms how it ought to be understood will more fully appear from the particular directions given for the order of the knightscompanions proceeding in king henry viiis stattes where the law directs each knightcompanion to proceed aone at such time as his fellow who possesseh the stall opposite unto him is absent but the order of such proceeding will by a scheme be made more evident  the proceeding of the knightscompanions present on the eve of st george to the closet at white hall anno   eliz the lord hunsdon void the lord roert dudley the viscount mountague the lord loughborow the earl of shewsbury the earl of sussex the lord howard of essing void the earl of westmoland the marquess of north void the lord clynton the duke of norfolk void the eatl of pembrook  thus four knightscompanions proceeded alone in regard the stalls opposite to them were void the three first being absent and the last void by the death of the earl of huntington and to avoid all disputes in relation to precedence king henry viii decreed in the sixteenth year of his reign that each knightcompanion should take place in procession station or sitting at the table thence forward as he had his seat or stall in the choir and not according to the degree of his bith or condition unless the sovereign was pleased that any should be made choice of according to the nbility of his family to sit at the end of his own table or perform any other thing by the by  the proceeding among the officers of the order differs from all before spoken of for being five in number the three inferior officers when all present march in a breast and of later times the register in the middle garter on his right hand and the usher of the blackred on his left  after these three officers the two superior proceed together the prelate on the right and the chancellor on the left and after the officers of the order follow the sword which is carried immediately before the sovereign in the beginning of queen elizabeths reign it was born by some of the barons but of later times it has been conferred on persons of higher rank as anno   car i on the earl of dover anno   car i on the earl of danby and anno    car ii on the lord viscount mordant then constable of the castle of windsor and at this time it is usually born by none under the degree of an earl  the sovereigns place in the proceeding and notandum quod superior ordinis tempore processionis in dicta capella transibit retro totam sociarum comitivam which though the statute mentions here to be performed at the grand procession yet it refers to all those times the sovereign proceeds to or from no less than within the chapel in ancient time the sovereign if he were at windsor to celebrate the grand feast proceeded to the chapel in person as well on the eve as on the feast day queen elizabeth being the first who went not to the chapel on the eve of the feast unless we except king henry vi who by reason of sickness was necessitated to make a deputy in his stead the aforesaid omission of queen elizabeth was first occasioned through indisposition of health though she afterward without that necessity did not comply as in the          and    years of her reign which gave occasion to king james to make deputies at those three grand feasts he celebrated at windsor and the like did king charles i in the first year o his reign but in the fourth year of his reign the ancient custom for many years intermitted was restored and the sovereign making no lieutenant proceeded to the chapel not only on that eve but always observed it afterward as did king charles ii in all the grand feasts he held and is now observed  it will be necessary to take notice that the proceeding begins from the presence chamber called in the statutes the great chamber a scheme whereof on the eve of the grand feast is here exhibted  the attendants on the knightscompanions almsknights virger of the chapel prebends of windsor officers of arms knightscompanions blackrod register garter chancellor prelate the sword the sovereign trainbearers captain of the pensioners pensioners to the foregoing proceeding have been occasionally received some persons of quality and others eminent in place and degree though their offices do not particularly relate to this most noble oder but are admitted by reason of their requisite attendance on the sovereign in his proceedings on all occasions  on st georges eve anno   eliz the old ambassador of sweden accompanied by the earl of hertford went in the proceeding to the closet at white hall next after the trainbearers and immediaely before the ladies atendants on the sovereign and the next morning when the sovereign proceeded to the chapel the new ambassador of sweden went in the same place  as to those admitted on the account of their offices is the lord chambrlain though not a knight of the gater and is allowed place somewhat behind on the ght hand of the sovereign and the vice chamberlain on the left  the dean of the sovereigns chapel at white hall attends when the proceedings are thither going a little ein the sovereign toward his left hand next goes the clerk of the cloet then the master of the robes as also one of the masters of requests and then the gentlemen of the robes  of the proceeding to the chapter house  having under the precedent head treated at large of the rank and place of all those that pass in the proceeding wherein all are bareheaded except the sovereign and knightscompanions i now come to the place whither the proceeding is directed  the first solemn action on the entrance of the grand feast which the sovereign and knightscompanions are obliged to perform is to celebrate a chapter to which end it has been most usual for them to proceed from the presence chamber every one in their due place and order first to the chapter house to consult of things of course and next into the choir to hear divine service which has been the constant custom from the reign of king henry v as many examples recorded in the registers of the order evidence  as this custom of holding a chapter on the eve of the grand feast was constantly observed when celebrated without prorogation so also has a chapter been in like manner held before vespers on the eve at such time as the feast day of st george only has been observed when for any cause the anniversary of the grand feast received prorogation as for instance anno   mary a chapter was held at the manor of st jamess on the vigil of st george before the first vespers whereunto is fixed this note ut moris est and the grand feast fr that year received adjournment until the coming of philip then prince after king of spain  in like manner though the celebration of the grand feasts were removed from windsor and observed at other places yet this usual custom of holding a chapter on the eve was always practiced after which the proceeding to evening prayer succeeded as is manifest by several testimonies from the registers  the public processional way to the chapter house at windsor used time out of mind led from the presence chamber through the cloister and the great gate of the kings lodging to the upper ward of the castle thence through the middle ward and part of the lower to and through the passage between the east end of the chapel and tombhouse and thence into the chapter house situate on the north east corner of st georges chapel  but the sovereign has sometimes thought fit to wave this public processional way and pass along the private way which leads from the kings privy chamber down the stairs into the terrace viz through that stately walk lying on the north side of the castle and entering again at a door heretofore made through a part of the castle wall into one of the canons lodgings adjoining to winchester tower now made up went thence through the cloisters proceeding in the order before showed  we shall close this head with observing that though the proceedings to the chapter house or chapel on the eve of the feast have most commonly been on foot yet have they been also on horseback on extraordinary occasions as anno   hen vii at which time several ambassadors being arrived here from foreign kings and princes they and many of the nobility of this kingdom with the kings council the two archbishops the bishops of lincoln and ely and the chief justice of the kings bench repaired also thither and on the eve the sovereign accompanied with the knightscompanions rode from the upper quadrangle down to the college the queen and the kings mother rode in a chair covered with rich cloth of gold drawn by six coursers finely harnassd and twenty one ladies habited in crimson velvet rode on white palfries sir roger cotton master of the queens horse led her horse of state whereon was a saddle of cloth of gold and three crowns of silver gilt as soon as they alighted the sovereign and knightscompanions proceeded to the chapter house and thence to evening song which ended they returned in the order they came  king henry viii in the eleventh year of his reign at three a clock in the afternoon with all the knightscompanions in the habit of the order proceeded from the presence chamber in windsorcastle till they came to the quadrangle where they took their horses and rode according to their stalls not according to their estate next before the king and thence rode to the middle door of the chapel and there alighted and proceeded without the choir to the chapter house there are other examples but these may suffice  of the opening of the chapter   the proceeding being arrived at the entrance into the chapel first the attendants on the knightscompanions divide themselves as they enter beginning at the outward door and flank on each side the north isle of the chapel and so toward the west door of the choir making a stand along the isle for the almsknights virgers prebends and officers of arms to pass through them who go on toward the said west door and when the junior knightscompanions are entered into the chapel the proceeding makes a stand while all the knightscompanions following turn aside on the right hand into the chapter house next the officers of the order and lastly the sovereign but the nobleman that carries the sword the trainbearers pensioners etc stay without the chapter house door in the north isle none being admitted in but the sovereign the knightscompanions and the officers of the order who being all entered the door is shut by the gentleman usher of the blackrod and every person severally takes his due place and station whereupon the chapter immediately opens  in what manner and order the sovereign knightscompanions and officers of the order are ranked at the holding of a chapter is described anno    hen viii when the sovereign and knightscompanions consulted in the chapter house on the reformation and explanation of the statutes of the order  the sovereign on his entrance proceeded to the midst of the northend of the table the knightscompanions whose stalls in the choir were on the sovereigns side took the right hand of the table and those of the princes side the left then the prelate of the order came and stood on the sovereigns right hand at the corner of the table register and garter were at the lower end and blackrod kept the chapter house door on the inside the chancellor of the order is not there mentioned as not being present yet his place is on the sovereigns left hand of the table  if the sovereign and knightscompanions arrive at the chapter house so late that the business necessary to be done cannot be discussed without putting off the celebation of vespers beyond the canonical hour it has been usual to adjourn the debates till the next morning as was done anno    car i  transactions in the chapter held before the vespers   when the chapter held before the vespers is opened and no adjournment given thereto all things are then to be provided for which concern the honor and dignity of this most noble order  the matters of course are first swearing and admtting officers secondly debating about the knightscompanions then absent and either dispensing with or inflicting penalties on them and thirdly constituting or appointing an officer to carry on the state and solemnity of the feast in the sovereigns absence but other particulars that are occasional cannot so well be brought within rule as being wholly accidental  as to the first the officers of the order soon after the chapter is opened take their respective oaths in order to perform the duty of their several places during the session of the chapter and thenceforward as is evident from several examples but one may suffice from a chapter held at windsor anno   car i whereat dr neal bishop of winchester was swon prelate sir francis crane chancellor and dr matthew wren bishop of ely register  it has sometimes happened that some of the officers of this order have been sworn at other times as at chapters next ensuing their nomination and choice wherein the administration of the oath is one of the first things done  touching the second particular debated in chapter viz the dispensing with or punishing absent knights it is to be considered that the statutes of the order enjoin all the knightscompanions to be present at the celebration of the grand feast that is those that are within the kingdom or elsewhere although the service of st george according to the rites of the church be not celebrated as on the service of the day whereon that of st george has fallen viz good friday but with this limitation so that they be in a capacity or may conveniently repair thither  therefore the next thing usually entered upon in the chapter is the sovereigns and knightscompanions taking notice whether any of the fellowship make default of coming at the hour assigned and if so they are considered under one of these heads first stranger princes secondly late commissioners who are arrived or every minute expected and thirdly such as have given notice that they cannot be present during the continuation of the feast of these excuses of course verbal apologies or letters of excuse are or may be offered and in case they are approved or admitted then the penance which by the statutes ought otherwise to be inflicted is admitted all which ought to be recorded  stranger princes are excused in course on account of their necessary residence in their own territories and of their excuses and accustomd dispensations are diverse instances in the registers of the order  as to knightscompanions who are tardy in their journey or being come to the castle fall short of the hour or of attending the sovereign to the chapter house either through negligence or want of timely notice or other accident the statutes enjoin for penance that they be not permitted for that time to enter into the chapter but tarry without the door and not have voice in any thing that shall happen to be done there unless they can allege a just excuse or render such a sufficient cause as the sovereign or his deputy shall approve of but few defalters have been noted of this kind  the third sort of delinquents are those knightscompanions absent not only at the hour of tierce but are likely to be so during the whole feast the proceedings relating to them are either upon what is offered in excuse of their absence or determined on their neglect of making apology for it  excuses for absence are either by letters or word of mouth if by letters they are directed to the chancellor of the order or else the sovereign sends to his lieutenant on their behalf and both are produced by the chancellor but if excuses be made by word of mouth then are they delivered by the sovereign himself or on mtion made by some of the knightscompanions present in chapter  the custom of sending letters has been very ancient the lord powiss letter under his hand and seal certifying his indisposition of body was produced in chapter anno   hen v and the following year the dukes of york norfolk and buckingham with the earls of salisbury shrewsbury and pembrook viscount bourchier the lord rivers and sir john falstaff being all absent from st georges feast they declared the reason of their absence by their messengers there are many precedents of this kind and of letters sent from the sovereign directed to his lieutenant to accept of knightscompanions excuses whose absence he had beforehand dispensed with we observe those dispensations excused not the sending their own particular excuses for it is evident they were also expected and that such allowance of absence was not absolute the clause running thus that you the sovereigns deputy allow these excuses so far as are consonant to reason and in all other letters of the same nature a clause to this effect has been inserted that as the sovereign thought good to advertise his deputy that for certain causes he had dispensed with their attendance for that time so he willed him to accept their reasonable excuses in that behalf accordingly  secondly the absent knightscompanions have had their excuses frequently made by word of mouth either of the sovereign or some other of the knightscompanions present in the chapter this favor is done ither by the sovereign himself if present or by his order to the lieutenant in his absence  there have been many examples of what has been done in this case and also when the sovereign has not been present in chapter but has beforehand verbally given his deputy or lieutenant direction to excuse the absence of several knightscompanions  it will be necessary to observe what effect the excuses have usually produced whereinto we find the just and reaonable favorably admitted some suspended and diverse disallowed those easily allowed were first sickness for those of the knightscompanions who have been either sick far spent with age or intent on public affairs have been readily allowd secondly the no recovery of wounds received in the public service as we meet with in the case of sir william harington anno   hen v whom we see excused for his illness occasioned from his wounds then lately received at the siege of rohan and elsewhere thirdly impotency and old age fourthly employment in the sovereigns service either abroad or at home those abroad are necessarily excused those at home we shall be more particular to the earl of shrewsbury anno    eliz was taken up in certain affairs enjoined him by the sovereign the earl of huntington    eliz being president of the council of the north his absence was for that and several years following favorably excused and a like case was that of the earl of danby anno    car i who for his necessary attendance at the seat of justice in air was excused waiting on the sovereign at the grand feast that year fifthly when the grand feast has received prorogation and any of the knightscompanions have not had notice of the day whereunto it was prorogued sixthly when any o them have been in captivity as was thomas earl of salisbury and the earl of huntington both pisoners in france anno   hen vi seventhly when any of them have obtained the sovereigns letters of dispensation of which sufficient is spoken before lastly some other just and lawful occasion as well as accident having fallen out not relating to those under the former heads the sovereign on information given in chapter has been pleased o allow of as in the case of the lord fauconbridge anno    hen vi was readily admitted on his pleading the care of his domestic affairs he having been lately in prison and had obtained leave to go and see his house and lands in the country the earl of a undels absence anno    car i was pardoned by reason of the duchess of richmonds death who died on the eve of the grand feast that so he being the chief of her family might be at hand to advise and assist in all things conducing to the honor of the deceased duchess  and as the knightscompanions have been often excused for not appearing on the grand feast so has the sovereign on sufficient grounds been pleased to license and dispense with their departure from the same of this is an example   eliz when the lord hastings of loughborough alling ill a little before the offering on st georges day obtained license from the sovereign to depar out of the choir and came no more abroad that day nor during the feast as also another in the duke of lenox anno    car i the deputy chancellor having by command of the sovereign and in discharge of the duty of his office who being forced to go back to london by reason of the aforesaid duchess of richmons death had his excuse and the sovereigns license for departure  we are next to consider excuses which though sent i due time yet on debate in chapter were suspended rather than allowed to which head may be referred that case of several of the knightscompanions who were members of the lords house in the long parliament for anno    car i the deputy chancellor having by the command of the sovereign and in discharge of the duty of his office sent to each of them a summons for their attendance at the celebration of the grand feast to be held for the preceding year at york and notice thereof being given to the house of lords they immediately made the ensuing order  die martis    maii      whereas the lord chamberlain of his majestys household and some other lords of parliament knights of the garter have been summoned to give their attendance and repair into the city of york for the celebration of st georges feast who acquainting this house with the summons aforesaid it is this day ordered by the lords in parliament that they attend the weighty affairs of the kingdom discussed in paliament whereunto they are obliged by his majestys writ and the law of the land  jo brown cleric parliament  whereupon the said knightscompanions before the days appointed by prorogion for holding the feast sent their piionary letters of excuse to the deputy chancellor wherein they professed their desire and readiness to attend in obedience of the said summons neverheless pleaded the foreaid order for the ground of their stay in ondon and therefore desired him to obtain for them the sovereigns dispensation on producing the said letters n chapter the sovereign would not at that time either admit or disallow of their excuses but referred the consideration to the next chapter to be held by prorogation  of excuses which have not been allowed the most remarkable is that of the duke of norfolk and the lord scales anno    hen vi who were adjudgd to the penalty of the statute in regard the causes alleged to excuse their absence were not approved the latter was signed by the sovereign and knightscompanions in a jewel to the value of twenty marks to be offered in the college whereby the rigor of the statutes appears to have been more strictly executed on him than the duke probably because the lord scales was absent the year before and no cause thereof showed to the chapter  in relation to the proceedings on the absent knightscompanions neglect of sending their excuses we shall observe that some of them have with difficulty been remitted some left in suspense and others sentenced and referred either to the sovereigns pleasure or the punishment assigned by law of the first kind we find that the earl of westmorland anno  0 hen v though not very well yet had much ado to be excused because he signified not the cause of his absence as the statutes required so anno    car i the earls of derby and kelly having made no excuse were for that omission blameable but by the grace of the sovereign for that time pardoned  as to those who through the indulgence of the sovereign where probable cause has induced it have not had sentence passed on them presently but were deferred in expectation of some satisfactory cause to be showed we find in the case of the prince the duke of buckingham and five other knightscompanions absent from the feast held anno    hen vii wherein it is registered that no cause of excuse was showed but there was an expectation of one to be alleged  but as for those of the third sort on whom sentence has passed they have been left either to the pleasure of the sovereign or to those penalties which the law of this order inflict of which as also of those on whom judgment has passed are diverse instances  besides these grounds of assigning penances there are other causes set down in the before recited ninth article of the statutes of istitution for penances as when the knigts companions are absent at other times beside the hour of tierce that is the beginning of the first vespers secondly at the beginning of the morning service on the feast day thirdly at the beginning of the second vespers fourthly during the whole feast and fifthly at the grand feast next following  for the first admitting any knightcompanion has failed of meeting and attending on the sovereign at the hour of tierce and thereupon suffered the punishment of nonadmittance into the chapter house and deprivation of vote nevertheless if at the rising of the said chapter he be not ready to proceed with the sovereign and other the knightscompanions into the choir to the beginning of the first vespers he ought not only to suffer the former but this additional penalty that he shall not presume to enter into his stall at that time but tarry in that part of the choir where the taperbearers are wont to stand nevertheless before his own stall until the holy offices be ended and the law of the order is the same in king henry vs and king henry viiis statutes only render the place for the delinquent knight to stand in to be before the stalls in the choiristers places and now how the penalty has been inflicted upon breach of the law in this particular we shall see by the following instances  at the grand feast celebrated at windsor an    h vii when it seems the lord kildare sir gilbert talbot and sir richard goulford came late to the chapel we find this memorandum fixed to their names they stood without before their stalls by the sovereigns permission or rather command but yet this is not all the punishment which has been inflicted upon the knightscompanions for this offense though it be all that is set down in the foresaid article for anno    hen vi upon the eve of st george the marquess of drset not coming to the first vespers and being convicted of his late coming was prohibited joining in the nomination then made for the election of the king of portugal into the room of the duke of gloucester  offenders in the second and third case being such as neglect to come before the beginning of the high mass or the second vespers called also the vespers on st georges day have the like punishment with the former assigned them throughout all the bodies of the statutes viz exclusion from their stalls and station in the choiristers range  anno   hen vi we observe the lord willoughby noted to be absent upon the eve of the grand feast but present on the day and consequely he incurred no urther penance than what his absence on the eve drew on him the earl of derby anno    eliz coming too late to the first morning service on the feast day did for some short time undergo the same penance but soon after upon dispensation from the lieutenant went up to his stall  there are several other instances and besides the aforesaid defaults he is likewise to undergo the same penalties when the grand feast is prorogued or celebrated at any other place than windsor  ut if he offend in all and have no reasonable or allowable excuse for his absence he is then prohibited ensering his stall at the next feast and to pay ten pounds o be employed toward the ornaments of the college and sometimes the former penance has been inflicted for late coming to divine service  the fourth degree of offense is yet greater than any and the variety of penances are heightened if a knightcompanion shall neglect coming to the grand feast and have no allowable reason he shall not at the feast held the ensuing year be permitted to enter his own stall but stand below it he shall walk alone by himself before three crosses which in ancient time were born in the grand procession when the grand procession returns to the choir he shall stand in the place aforesaid ill the time of the offertory he shall offer last by himself and then humbly approach the stall of the sovereign or his deputy and there desire absolution bu there is no instance that these rigours were put in exution though many have offended in this kind  lastly the statutes enjoin that where a knightcompanion remains within the kingdom and shall be guilty of an omission two years together he ought to b so long interdicted his stall till he have offered a jewel at st georges altar to the value of twenty marks and thenceforward every year in which he shall be guilty of the same omission the penalty to be doubled till e is pardoned the most memorable case in the prosecuion of a contempt was against the earl of arunde    edw iv who for being absent two years together was mult forty marks and continuing his contempt the next year was fined the sum of eighty marks  touching the necessity and power of the sovereigns constituting a deputy it was provided for at the institution of the order the sovereign being then engaged in the wars of france thought it reasonable that provision should be made by the statutes for to depute some person in his stead  when therefore such occasion happened a commission was made out to one of the knightscompanions some reasonable time before the approach of the feast so that none of the ancient ceremonies might be omitted or any impediment happen through his absence and such deputy has usually been one of the chief of the order in authority eminence or birth the first so made was john duke of bedford   hen v and the reason thereof given in the registrum chartaceum is because the sovereign was then employed in the wars in normandy  and though the title given by the statutes to this officer be not particularly mentioned in the bluebook where it speaks of the said dukes holding the feast of st george that year but rather implied in the words regiae sublimatis locum impevit yet in the registrum chartaceum it is expressly set down and the said duke there styled depute de lordre de jaritiere sometimes he has been styled deputatis odinis and praeses clarissima ordinis etc  about the beginning of the reign of king henry viii the title of locum tenens or lieutenant began to be taken up and has for the most part continued in all succeeding times and the other titles of deputy president and vicegerent laid aside as to the business of this officer sufficient has been said already as an essential honor to his place he has from ancient time had some of the knightscompanions assigned for his assistants the first mention of which is in the registrum chartaceum   hen viii the number of these assistants were in those times uncertain at the time aoresaid they were      hen viii   and    hen viii we find but two which number has been a constant rule ever since except once viz the last of hen viii they were always appointed in chapter and have letters of notice sent them thereof but neither the lieutenant nor assistants can be chosen two years togeth except the sovereign should please to be present at the day or feast and after it was decreed    and    hen viii that this indulgence should extend to the term of three years  lastly we observe that this officer always held the feast at his peculiar cost and charge and gave liberal rewards to garter and for his escutcheons as also to the officers of arms gentlemenushers almsknights and to all the several waiters and attendants employed in the ceremony  the ceremonies relating to the first vespers   the first chapter held on the eve of st george being finished the sovereign and knightscompanions immediately proceed from the chapter house to the choir to hear vespers the officers of arms prebends and almsknights having attended in the northisle of the chapel do now put themselves in rank and continue the proceeding from the chapter house door along the said northisle to the west door of the choir in like manner as they did from the presence chamber to the chapter house the organs then beginning to play and so continue till vespers begin  when the almsknights arrive at the westdoor they first enter in a whole body while the rest of the proceeding makes a short stand and pass forward near the middle of the choir where they make a joint and low obeisance next all turning about by the left hand to the sovereigns seat then still turning from the right to the left hand they ascend the haut pass even to the rails set before the altar and forthwith divide themselves flanking on each side the juniors nearest the rais  this done the prebends enter in a body also and having made the like obeysances in the middle of the choir divide themselves and take their seats which by king henry viiis statutes are appointed in the lowe range of seats between but not in the stalls of the knightscompanions while the prebends are enering their seats the pursuivants heralds and provincial kings of arms in a body likewise enter the choir and after due reverence pass up to the altar and join the almskghts though anciently some difference was in this ceremony  afterward the two junior knightscompanions enter passing on till they come near their own stalls and there make their reverences and then divide and take their stands directly before their stalls and so of the rest of the knightscompanions  next to the knightscompanions the blackrod garter and register enter in a breast who proceeding to the middle of the choir make their obeysances and then pass to their form placed on the south side of the choir before the sovereigns stall and stand before it after them the chancellor and prelate in the like manner stand before their form placed near the sovereigns seat and for these forms whereon the officers of the order sit in the chapel there is a special decree for the allowance of them entered at the end of the constitutions of their offices  last of all the sovereign enters having the sword born before him but his band of pensioners tay at the choir door to keep off the crowd who coming to the steps which ascend the royal seat makes a reverence toward the altar and then takes place therein before he makes a second reverence  when the lieutenant in the sovereigns absence proceeds to the first vespers as soon as he enters the choir and comes near the sovereigns stall he stands and makes a little pause there then doing his reverences after he has again stood a while before he ascends his own where being arrived he makes the double reverence a second time and then sits down  and now to placing the knightscompanions in their stalls garter as soon as the sovereign or his lieuenant is placed makes again the usual reverence in the middle of the choir then turns to the senior knights and does his reverence to each of them whereupon at one instant they make their double reverences below where they stood and strait ascend at the first or wstern entrance that goes to the side stalls where being arrived they make again their double reverences and then seat themselves but when the sovereigns lieutenant is prent each knights adds a third reverence to him both when they ascend to and descend from their stalls and so likewise do all persons who pass in the proceeding add to their double reverences so often as there is occasion to make it after such time as the lieutenant is entered his stall and so long as he continues therein both on the eve the feast day and the morrow after  the knightscompanions being all seated the prelate and chancellor pass into the middle of the choir and having made double reverences return to their forms and sit down and after them in the same manner the register garter and blackrod proceed  as to the sovereigns other attendants the nobleman who carries the sword retires before the sovereigns stall a little on the right hand and the lord chamberlain of the household if not a knight of the garter and the vice chamberlain on the left till the sovereign give them leave to sit down the clerk of the closet stands at the sovereigns right hand but the young noblemen that carry up the sovereign and the gentleman of the robes sometimes repose themselves on the steps going to the sovereigns stall  this being done preparation for vespers begin in reference to which the prelate ascends the altar it being the duty of his office which if he omits he is ined twenty marks to the use of the college unless he give sufficient reason for his absence in which case or on the vacancy of the sea of winchester the sovereign has sometimes appointed another bishop to officiate for him the proceeding to the altar on this occasion is as follows  first the sergeant of the vestry makes a double reverence then comes before the prelate and makes a single one to him who thereon arises from his seat and the sergeant proceeds before him into the middle of the choir where the prelate makes a double reverence and passing forward after the sergeant and having ascended the uppermost hautpas before the altar he makes one single reverence toward the same and so goes to the north side of it  after which the two provincial kings heralds and pursuivants leaving their forementioned stations jon together till they come near the forms of the registe garter and blackrod where making their double rverences they divide again on each side and there stand  lastly the almsknights come down into the choir in a body and there make their joint double reverences and then take their chairs all which being finished divine service is begun by the prelate  the like solemnity is observed at any other place as well as at windsor where because the almsknights are absent the pursuivants at arms ascend nearer the highaltar than when they are at windsor but this occasions little variation  when the vespers are ended the prelate goes to the middle of the altar and with great reverence makes an obeisance and thence with the sergeant before him descends to the middle of the choir where he makes his double reverences and so returns to his seat whereupon all make ready to pass out of the choir which is performed in much the same manner and with the same state as they proceeded thither and the servants and attendants of the knightscompanions are marshalled in the same order as they were at the beginning of the proceeding that the whole procession may again pass through them  the almsknights having entered the guard chamber spread themselves on each side thereof the prebends pass through them and fall off on either side the room to the presence chamber door  then the pursuivants heralds and provincial kings proceeding through the lane made by the almsknights and prebends enter the presence chamber and fall off on either side toward the stall the kings standing uppermost  then enter the knightscompanions and place themselves on each side of the state in such order as they sat in their stalls the eldest nearest the state but those whose companions are absent stand alone after whom follow the officers of the order disposing themselves conveniently near the state  lastly the sovereign passes to the step before the state where being arrived he turns toward the knightscompanions who make their reverences jointly to him and he thereon puts off his cap and resalutes them which done the sovereign and they withdraw into the privy chamber till supper time  but in queen elizabeths reign when the feast of st george was held at white hall or greenwich and the sovereign as was usual with her proceeded no farther on the eve to vespers than to the great closet the ordinary way and thence sent her lieutenant into the choir then in such case when vespers were ended the lieutenant returned from the choir through the great hall and so back to the said closet and stood at the door thereof attending the sovereigns coming forth from whence they all proceeded before her into the presence chamber and there the ceremony for that time ended  but in the reign of king james i when the supper on the eve as also the following meals were prepared in the banqueting house the sovereigns lieutenant frequently returned from the closet by the lobby to the said banqueting house instead of going to the presenc and passing up the state gave an end to the ceremony till supper time and so we find it observed in the        0          and    of that king  when the sovereign and knightscompanions are retired they are not to put off any part of their robes till supper is over for that is prohibited by the statutes not only to those who do not sup as well as those who do and hereon    car ii the sovereign having a mind to take the air went into hidepark after he had taken leave of the knightscompanions the dukes of york and monmouth and the earl of oxford being with him but all in full robes and so returned to supper  the supper on the eve   when the sovereign is pleased to sup publicly on the eve of the feast at windsor the supper has been always prepared in st georges hall the usual pace at white hall was heretofore in the presence chamber of later times the banqueting house and at greenwich either the presence or the council chamber where the sovereign or his lieutenant were always present bu when the feast of st george was celebrated at york    car i the sovereign and knightscompanions mached after the first vespers to a house prepared for that purpose and supped there  but if the eve of the feast fell out on a fasting day as it did    hen viii and    jac i the supper was always omitted and the sovereign with his lieutenant and knightscompanions were served of the void only  nor does the sovereign when he sups publicly pass privately to the place but as soon as notice is given that the first mess is set upon the table he presently enters the presence chamber whence the officers of the order and of arms the knightscompanions in their full robes for so the statutes expressly direct having put themselves into their usual order proceed before him to st georges hall where being enteted the pursuivants heralds and provincial kings fall off all upon the right hand opposite to the knightscompanions table the junior pursuivants standing toward the lower end of the hall then the knightscompanions passing up beyond them formerly divided themselves on either side according to the decree    hen viii and made a stand each taking place according to the order of their stalls but at the feast held at white hall    car ii the sovereign directed that they should stand all on the right hand side facing the table  next the five officers of the order follow who ascending beyond the senior knight retire on the right hand after them the sovereign and the officers of arms all doing him reverence as he passes by who passing up to the hautpas before his own table turns himself to the knightscompanions and putting off his cap they return their reverences jointly to him  the sovereign sitting down to supper is first served by water by some nobleman then grace is said by the prelate then is the senior knight conducted to his table by two officers of arms and so the rest in order to the tables appointed them whereupon the officers of the order and of arms retire out of the hall to supper  if a lieutenant be constituted he proceeds to supper in full robes and in the same order as does the sovereign and sits alone at the sovereigns table yet on the left hand of the cloth of state being served in all points with water and by a cup bearer carver and sewer as the sovereign himself is  when supper is ended and the banquet taken away the sovereign and knightscompanions proceed back in the same order they came to the presence chamber where the sovereign or his lieutenant standing on the step before the cloth of state salutes them as before and then appoints the hour and place for the knightscompanions to attend him the next morning the like if the supper be provided in any other place besides the presence chamber the sovereign and knightscompanions proceed back thither because the ceremony ought to end there as has always been the custom and if the supper be prepared in the presence chamber they then take their leave in the same room there being no occasion to proceed farther  if any of the knightscompanions accompany the sovereign or his lieutenant to his lodgings they then go after not before him in regard the state of that nights service ended in the presence chamber and after they have retired to their loding they have permission to unrobe  when the sovereign or his lieutenant do not sup in st georges hall on the eve of the feast on the following night the officers of arms have formerly had the liberty to eat there and this privilege was assigned them by decree of a chapter held    eliz appointing them that table which was before that time used by the chancellor register and other officers of the order but how they came to lose this privilege is not mentioned for now instead of sitting in the great hall they are necessitated to eat in such rooms of the castle as they can procure  cap xxi the order of the ceremonies on the feast day the proceeding to the chapel in the morning   notwithstanding the celebration of the feast takes up three days viz part of the twenty second all the twenty third and part of the twenty fourth of april yet the twenty third st georges day is the grand part the ceremonies of which may be divided into sacred and civil the first solemnized in the chapel the latter in st geoges hall  in order to which the knightscompanions in full robes repair to the sovereigns privy lodgings at the hur apointed as also the officers of the order in the mean time the rest of the degrees and persons which made up the proceeding on the eve of the feast take their several stations then appointed them to attend the sovereigns coming out of the presence chamber  when the sovereign having the knightscompanions and officers of the order before him has entered the presence the sword is delivered to the nobleman appointed to bear it and after the usual salutations the proceeding sets forward to the chapel in the same order as on the eve the knightscompanions having their trains born by some of their own gentlemen  at the foot of the stairs entering the cloister or stone gallery twelve gentlemen of the privy chamber attend with a rich canopy of cloth of gold who when the sovereign approahes receive him under it and bear it over his head till he comes to the choir door of st georges chapel which canoy is carried only on the mornng of the feast day and not at any other time  the processional way to the chapel is the ame they traversed on the eve if the sovereign and knighscompanions proceed to the chapter house first for anciently it was the custom to hold a chapter in the morning of the feast day either before mattins or after before the grand procession set forward this coure received interruption in queen elizabeths time during which no chapter was held in the morning except in the       and    years of her reign and then only for admitting some officers of the order but the time of holding this chapter was restored by king charles i who several times held it before the first service began as in the      and    of his reign  but if no chapter be held at this time then as soon as the proceeding comes near the chapel instead of entering the passage between the east end of the chapel and king henry viiis tomb house as it does on the eve by reason the sovereign goes first to the chapter house it proceeds straight on to the south door and thence into the choir yet king charles ii in the    of his reign appointed the whole proceeding to pass by the said south door all along the south side of the chapel and then to enter at the west door which was then and since observed  when the almsknights are come to the west door of the choir they enter and pass up above the steps of the altar in the very same manner and order as they did on the eve and so exactly of the rest which being done the prelate begins the morning service according to the order observed in the common prayer only that the first lesson being made proper to the festival is taken out of the    chapter of ecclesiasticus  this solemn proceeding to the chapel in the moring of the feast day is and has been most usual performed on foot yet there are instances heretofore where the sovereign and knightscompanions have proceeded on horseback for the greater splendour and gallantry of the order as in    edw iv when several ladies rode in the cavalcade richly adorned of which habit mention is already made so also   hen vii when it was augmented by the presence of the queen and the kings mother attended by a splendid train of ladies and again the    of the same king when he held the feast a baynards castle in london he proceeded on horse back to st pauls the like king henry viii did at windsor on the feast of st george    of hs regn and king philip   and   of phil and mar and queen elizabeth in the   of her reign in her whole habit of the order so did the sovereigns lieutenant at the same feast ride to the first and second vespers and to the morning service the day after  it was a custom begun by queen elizabeth and used when she celebrated st georges feast either at white hall or greenwich for the sovereigns lieutenant and knightscompanions in full robes attended with the officers of the order and of arms to meet in the presence chamber about nine in the morning of the feast day and proceed thence as they did the evening before through the guard chamber down into the great hall and thence into the chapel where they took their stalls as on the eve after which morning prayer was performed as far as the litany and this was called the first service which done they all descended from their stalls in the accustomed order and proceeded back to the presence and there waited the coming of the sovereign before whom they proceeded a second time to the choir where the litany and grand procession began called the second service at which the sovereign was usually present but seldom at the first service  the first instance we have met with of this double proceeding is recorded in the bluebook of the order   eliz and was continued throughout her reign and that of king james i not only when the feast of st george was celebrated at white hall or greenwich but also at other times when celebrated at windsor and so   car i but from that time the sovereign went to the chapel at the beginning of morning service which was continued without interruption which way has been ever since duly observed  but when it was known that the sovereign did not go in the grand procession but his lieutenant for him then the service was constantly gone through withal at once  the proceeding to the second service   when the feast has been celebrated elsewhere thn at windsor as soon as the prelate was come down from the altar on finishing the first service the knightscompanions descended from their stalls in usual order and then the lieutenant with the officers of the order and of arms proceeded before him to the presence to conduct the sovereign to the second service which second proceeding was disposed in the same manner as was that to the first service in the morning only in the latter because the sovereign proceeded the sword was also carried  of the grand procession   we are now arrived at the grand procession of this most noble order which is indeed the most solemn and magnificent part of the whole ceremony and has always been celebrated in the morning of the feast day of st george or on such other day as the sovereign has appointed by prorogation to hold the same but as to the instant of time when it began it has sometimes been uncertain with respect to the convenience of the church service when it was conceived most prper which was generally at the end of the second collect and before the litany nevertheless in   eliz the feast being then held at windsor it began presently after the te deum was sung and the twentieth of the said queens reign at greenwich after reading the second lesson and to come nearer our times the grand procession set forward   car i when the first service was finished and    car i after the srmon was ended but at the grand feast    car ii it was brought to its usual time after the last collect  as to the proceeding or processional way at wind that has not bee always the same sometimes it wa conined within the walls of st georges chapel but at other times enlarged through the lower court of the castle a ew instances of both cases are remainig but none of any ancient date  what the order and manner of this ceremny was may be collected from what an old relator says of the solemn procession made the    man   hen viii tha it was ordered as of old time accustomed  first went the almsknights two and two on either side the choir then the officers of arms next the knightscompanions after them the officers of the order and then the prelate bearing the heart of st george under a canopy honorably assisted four noblemen bearing each a torch and last of all the sovereign  and though here is no mention of any ecclesiastcks that joined themselves in the proceeding yet it cannot be supposed that as part of the divine service was to be performed but that some of the chaplains and priests were included and we meet with one instance where the priests not only went in the grand processin but had a place assigned in it where the gentlemen of the sovereigns chapel and choir of windsor now go  but it must be confessed that the records of the order are very defective in this particular relating to the grand procession and speak of it only in general or at most take notice but of some of those degrees that attend in it and this but of late time neither among which    eliz it is said they all proceeded in order as the custom was the sovereign following in the rear of the procesion  as to place and precedence it is in every respect the same as in the sovereigns proceeding to the chapel on the eve of the grand feast only here are some persons ded which go not in that namely the gentlemen and choiristers of the sovereigns chapel at white hall and the pettycanons vicars and choiristers of windsor the whole order is as follows  the morning service having proceeded to the second esson and the prelate conducted by the sergeant of the vestry from the altar to his seat  the almsknights rise from their seats and pass to the middle of the choir and after their accustomed reverences go up to the sides of the altar  next in like manner the officers of ams pass up  hereupon garter rises from his sea and makes his usual reverences then waving his rod summons the junior knights to descend  whilst they and the rest of the knightscompanions are leavng their stalls with usual reverences the gentlemen of the chapel pettycanons and vicars of w nor put on copes and make themselves ready to proeed  then the knightscompanions being all come down stand each under his proper stall  then the blackrod garter and register rise and stand before their forms  so do the chancellor and prelate  this done the almsknights come down from the altar and passing into the middle of the choir make again their double reverences and proceed out of the choir  after them the choiristers pass in a body to the middle of the choir and having made their double reverences as do all that follow proceed forth two and two  so do the vicars of windsor  next the four pettycanons come from their seats into the middle of the choir and there begin to sing an hymn  then follows the sergeant of the vestry bearing his gilt rod  after him the gentlemen of the chapel at white hall  next the virger of windsor chapel bearing his silver rod  then the prebends of windsor  after whom the officers of arms come down from the altar and pass on  then the knightscompanions the juniors first  then the blackrod garter and register  the chancellor and prelate  the nobleman that bears the sword of state  then the sovereign above in his stall makes a reverence toward the altar and being descended another below then passes out and enters under the canopy which waits fr him at the choir door the lord chamberlain of the household if not a knight of the order attending somewhat behind the side of the canopy on the sovereigns right hand and the vice chamberlain at the like distance on hisleft as in the grand procession    car ii  and lastly the band of pensioners who attend the guard on each side the sovereign and knightscompanions th their captain at the head of them  in this order to this day they proceed with great devotion the whole choir singing the office appointed which heretofore was the litany but is now generally a thanksgiving hymn  the grand procession when it has been elebrated at white hall or elsewhere than at windsor is for the most part ordered after the aforesaid manner as may be seen by the following scheme  sergeant of the vestry with his gilt rod choiristers in surplices gentlemen of the chapel in copes subdean in a cope officers of arms knights companions officers of the order the sword the sovereign under a canopy with his train born up the pensioners as before but in what this grand procession differs from that at windsor we shall here note  first here the sergeant of the vestry leads the proeeding and is followed by the choiristers  secondly the prebends and choir of windsor and the almsknights are here wanting  thirdly the subdean and dean of the chapel are taken in and proceed next to the gentlemen of the chapel to whom the sovereigns almoner has sometimes joined himself  fourthly whilst the knightscompanions are descending from their stalls the gentlemen of the chapel go into the vestry to put on their copes but the dean of the chapel has his brought into the choir which he puts on below under his seat  fifthly and lastly in queen elizabeths reign he ladies attendants went with the pensioners on either side the sovereign  to contribute more to the pomp and state of this great ceremony a canopy is born over the sovereigns head by knights and gentlemen of quality while he passes in procession till he return to the choir door  the persons appointed to carry the canopy anno    hen viii were four knights of the body when four other knights bore four wax tapers but since they are he gentlemen of the privy chamber in ordinary who at the time of the feast are in waiting twelve of whom are appoined for this service the sovereign has also the long train of his mantle carried up by several of the young nobility who receive notice thereof by the lord chamberlain of the household  in like manner the lieutenants or deputies to the sovereign have had their train carried up in the proceedings by persons of distinction and the train of a stranger king personally prsent at windsor has also been born up and in like manner the train of a deputy from a stranger king and lastly the knightscompanions have their trains carried up by their own gentlemen  the clothes and apparel of the sovereign and knightscompanions and the great variety of rich jewels which surround or adorn their caps or where else they may appear most conspicuous shine with great luster  the provincial kings heralds and pursuivants habited in their rich coats and going together in one body appear also very conspicuous from the royal arms of the sovereign richly embroidered on them with fine gld purples and twist the ground of the provincial kings coats are blue velvet the heralds blue satin and the pursuivants blue damask  the habit in which the canons of the college proceed is also peculiar for though as clergymen they are vested in linen surplices at all times of divine service yet at this solemnity they wear a mantle over those surplices which is a habit appointed for them from the foundation of the order these mantles are of murry taffety and on the right shoulder is an escutcheon of st georges arms within a rundlet embroidered with gold and silk which is bought at their own charge  the gentlemen of the sovereigns chapel the pettycanons and vicars of windsor appear in habits more glorious being all or the most part of them vested in rich copes of cloth of gold or most costly embroideries but the children of the chapel and choiristers poceed habited in surplices of white linen lastly the habits of the almsknights a mantle and kirtle are not unremarkable both for colou and materials which appear suitable to their age and degree the mantles are of cloth which the statutes appoint to be of a red color with a shield of the arms of st george bu without a garter to surround them  in this grand proceeding the habits entertain the beholders with a very delightful prospect being so ordered that the grave are placed between those that ae rich and gallant and to add to the greater show of this solemn ceremony the registers of the order make mention of diverse persons of rank and quality who put themselves on the duty of attendance on their sovereign because related to his service though in reference to the order not so concerned as to be taken into the proceeding such are diverse of the nobility sometimes great ladies many considerable officers of the household and other courtiers all richly habited and attired  to complete the pomp of this great solemnity we may in the last place fily remember the music as a part thereof the choirs of the sovereigns chapel at st jamess and at windsor being united all singing the acred hymn together while the grand procession devoutly passes and on their return to the choir door the almsknights first advance into it and after double reverences ascend above the haut pass to the altar  next the choiristers and in like manner the vicars pettycanons of windsor gentlemen of the chapel and prebends go to their seats  then the officers of arms pass up and join to the almsknights after this the knightscompanions enter and stand before their stalls  the like does the blackrod garter and register  as also the chancellor and prelate  then does the sovereign take his royal stall  the knightscompanions ascend their stalls  the officers of the order sit down on their forms in the same manner and order and with like reverences as at their entrance into the choir on the eve of the feast  then the prelae with two prebends appointed to read the epistle and gospel are conducted the one by e sejeants of the vetry the other by the virger up o the alta which they approach with usual reverences the prelate passing to the northside and the prebends to the south to finish the remaining part of divine sere  whereupon the officers of arms descend into the choir and  the almsknights go down to their seats which while they are so doing the two prebends put on their copes at the south side of the altar this done the prelate begins the second service which has been celebrated since the time of the reformation according to the book of common prayer and is the same commonly used on any other feast day excepting a peculiar epistle and gospel the first being the thirty third chapter of deuteronomy and the latter the fifth chapter of st john beginning at the twenty fourth verse and ending at the thirtieth which being read the creed is sung  we may here note that before the reformation it belonged to the abbot of tower hill to read the gospel and to the prior of medemenham in norfolk to read the epistle  the offering of gold and silver   this ceremony whether it be performed in the sovereigns chapel at windsor or in any other church or chapel is one and the same except the sovereigns offering of gold and silver instead of the bezant which is peculiar to windsor  the accustomed time of offering on the feast day is mentioned anno    hen viii to be after the sovereigns return to his stall from the grand procession in the time of high mass and at this day begins immediately after this first sentence of the offertory is pronounced by the prelate  let your light so shine before men etc  this said the organ begins to play and forthwith a groom and page of the removing wardrobe with reverence first made unrol a long carpet and spread it before the altar which being done the almsknights first next the pursuivants heralds and provincial kings acend in usual order and flank the carpet on both sides then garter steps from his seat and after double reverences and the usual manner of waving his rod the knightscompanions descend in their accustomed order and stand before their stalls  after this blackrod goes from his seat to the altar toward which making a single reverence he turns his back and immediately the groom of there moving wardrobe delivers him a little carpet anciently of silk now of cloth of gold and the said groom holds on his arms a cushion of cloth of gold for the sovereign to kneel upon at the time of his offering which the blackrod forthwith lays on the upper haut pas before the altar and each of them as well in delivering as receiving the cushion kiss it  after this the prelate of the order takes a gilt basin to receive the sovereigns offering and stands before the middle of the altar with one of the prebends to assist him at which time the sovereign arising makes his reverence toward the altar and then descending makes a little reverence below and ascends toward the altar with his attendants and being come into the middle of the choir he makes another reverence and at the first haut pas his last  he that bears the sovereigns offering is either the senior knight the prince or the greatest estate among the knigtscompanions then present and no other person of what degree soever if he be not of this noble fraternity performs this service  the sovereign being come to the upper haut pas kneels at which instant blackrod on his knee delivers with assay the sovereigns offering to the senior knight or other person nominated and he kneeling presents it to the sovereign which he immediately offers into the basin held by the prelate and then arises and is conducted and attended as when he came up to offer at the entrance into his stall he turns and makes a reverence and his attendants also bow toward the altar and being attended into his stall does the like again and then reposeth himself in his seat  an entry is made in the redbook anno   car i that whereas in other places besides windsor the sovereign is wont to offer a certain gold piece vulgarly called a bezant to be edeemed afterward at a certain price the usher of the blackrod having been admonished that in these services thee is no redemption to be made should never present the bezant at windsor to the sovereign but gold and silr of english mony  when the sovereign is absent and the lieutenant offers for him he performs the ceremony as follows  first after the preparations made for the offering as aforesaid he descends from his stall with the usual reverences and goes to the steps ascending the sovereigns stall and there stands a while then making his double obeisance he proceeds toward the altar the officers of the oder going before him with one other reverence in the middle of the choir and another at the first haut pas of the altar the carpet and cushion is spread and laid for him as is for the sovereign and the offering alo given in the same way and the lieutenant kneeling puts it in the basin and returns to the sovereigns stall in the same order etc he came where standing a while again before it he makes a reverence toward it and then goes up into his own stall where if it fall out that the lieutenant is not the senior knight he stays to receive the reverences of all the knightscompanions his seniors as they go up to offer and when his own turn comes to offer he descends with a double reverence and procees up with his fellow if present and offers for himself in his own place but his train is then let down the carpet etc taken away and only two officers of arms but none of the order proceeds before him and when he has offered he returns to his stall  but it seems   jac i that garter alone on the feast day brought up the prince then the sovereigns lieutenant when he came to offer for himself which service ought to have been performed by clarenceux and nrroy which was an oversight in garter as likewise his bringing down at the same the knightscompanions out of their stalls to offer before the epistle and gopel were rea contrary to the usage of former times by which hy were kept a tedious time waiting below in the choir before the offering began but    jac i the prince was brought up by clarenceux and norroy when he came to offer and not by garter when the lieutenant has offered for himself he returns to the lower end of the stalls and passes to his own where having paid the ual reverences he enters it and is ready to receive the reverences of all the other knightscompanions  as soon as the sovereign or his lieutenant is returned to his stall the two provincial king pass down  he middle of the choir where making reverences jointly to the altar and next to the sovereign clarenceux turns himself to the senior knight and makes him a third reverence while norroy at the same instant does the same to the next junior knight and so both as an intimation of their going up to offer then each king retires a little backward tward the stalls in the mean time the two senior knights draw near together and making double reverences clarenceux and norroy step forth and pass up before them till they arrive near the prelate or if the senior knight be without his opposite then he is brought up single then making their reverences first toward the altar next to the knights clarenceux retires to the right side and norroy to the left waiting for the return of the knights who are kneeling on the uppermost haut pas of the altar making their offering which humble ceremony of kneeling not being heretofore used was fixed by a decree of   car i  the knightscompanions offerings are both of silver and gold which is received by two of the prebends or by one prebend and one chantor anciently by one chantor only when the offering is at windsor but by the dean of the chapel when at white hall the offering being made the knightscompanions rise and forthwith divide themselves clarenceux conducting the senior knight to the lower end of the stalls on the sovereigns side and norroy the next junior knight to the lower end of the stalls on the princes side and at parting make their reverences and return to their stations before the altar the knights at their entrance into the stalls make their double reverences together and then pass on to their own where making the like reverences they ake their seats  but if any stranger king be present at the offering he does not retire to his seat by the lower end of the stalls but along the choir as does the sovereign the same way he proceeded up so did the king of denmark   jac i  the ceremonies of the two senior knights offering being finished the two snior healds observing their last rverences pass down into the choir in the same manner a did clarenceux and norro to bring up the next to senior knights to offer who use all the same ceremonies and are conducted back in like manner to the altar and so of the other brought up by the two next senior heralds clarenceaux and norroy beginning again if there are more knights than the heralds in one course supply and after them the heralds again till the whole is ended and here it may be noted that where any knight goes single to offer he has nevertheless two heralds to attend him  touching the offerings themselves made in the chapel of windsor they belong of right to the dean and prebends being conferred on them by the statutes of the college and ordained also that the chantor should see them received and faithfully kept and at the end of every month or weekly if the college required it give an account of what was received all which was confirmed by king edward iii the bishop dean and chapter of salisbury to whose jurisdiction the college of windsor belongs and also by the bishop of winchester prelate of the garter      but dr montague bishop of winchester at the feast at windsor    jac i challenged a right to the offerings and bishop andrews did de facto both receive and keep the offerings whenever he officiated at windsor but on complaint of the dean and prebends of windsor this matter was referred to the chapter yet we do not find that any final or positive determination was ever made to the time of the restoration from which time the right of the dean and canons has never been disputed and the statutes have dly taken place  what has usually been offered either in gold or silver we shall see by the account given in by the bishop of winchester   car i at st georges feast at windsor september     the whole offering of the eight knights is four pounds fifteen shillings viz in gold ten shillings each and in silver two excepting the lord steward whoe offering in silver was only one shilling besides the sovereigns bezant redeemable  the offerings on the twenty fith day  his majestys offering in gold one pound and in silver ten shillings  the eight knightscompanions the same as the day before the whole besides the kings bezant eleven pounds  when all the knights have offered and are eturned to their stalls the chancellor of the order makes his reverences and after him the register garter and blackrod theirs together and take their seats next the carpet being rolled up by the groom and page of the removing wardrobe the provincial kings heralds and pursuivants and last of all the almsknights make their reverences and pass into the choir where they remain till the prelate has finished the second service who conducted by the sergeant of the vestry comes down from the altar with his accustomed reverences to his seat after whom the two prebends are brought down by the virger who making their usual reverences take their seats  the return to the presence   immediately after all prepare to pass out of the choir and to proceed back to the presence chamber which is done in every particular as it is in the return of the sovereign from the first vespers  the proceeding passes on through the southdoor of the chapel and here the trumpets are taken in and placed before the almsknights and sound all the way to the guard chamber at which time the drums and fifes begin to beat and play thence the proceeding passes into the presence chamber whither it ought to go before the sovereign pass into the great hall to dinner and here the knightscompanions take their usual stands and after the sovereigns salutation and their reverences the sovereign retires into the privy chamber and the knights likewise retire till dinner is ready  of the dinner on the feast day   as soon as the sovereign has notice given him that the first mess is set on the table the sovereign and knightscompanions come out of the privy lodgings into the presence chamber attended by the officers of the order and seat themselves in the same manner as at the supper on the eve of the feast the music sounding whilst the said mess is carrying up which is in the following order  four sergeants at arms two and two the comptroller the treasurer the sewer the messes carried up by the pensioners master of the household cofferer a clerk comptroller a clerk comptroller second clerk of the kitchen chief clerk of the kitchen  the sovereign has most frequently sat alone though sometimes heretofore he has been pleased to admit some of the knightscompanions to sit at the table with him but this honor has not been offered to any of them since the reign of queen elizabeth as soon as the sovereign is placed the knightscompanions put on their caps and remaining covered retire against the tables prepared for them where water is brought them by a gentleman of quality and having washed they all sit down  the order of passing to their seats at the table    car ii and so appointed to be observed for the future was after the following manner first the duke of york entered the rails at the upper end of the table and passed down the hither side to the lower end and thence to the benchside to his place in like manner followed all the other knights according to the seniority of their stalls as it is ordained they shall it and not according to their estates or dignities except the sons of stranger kings princes and dukes and all on the right hand or farther side of their table not one against another but two and two at a table to a mess and those whose opposites are wanting to sit alone and have a whole mess their meat being usually brought up by the yeomen o the guard and are attended by some of the gentlemen pensioners and others of the sovereigns servants two to each table  it appears that anciently the officers of the order ad a table allowed them in the great hall and sat covered in the sovereigns presence but on the eve of the feast  0 car   it was ordered in chapter that they should be at their choice to keep the feast privately by themselves or sit uncovered where the sovereign dined whereupon from that time they forbore sitting in the hall or where else the sovereign and knightscompanions sat it likewise appears that the officers of arms did anciently sit in st georges hall at a table joined to that at which the officers of the order sat  before the entrance of the sovereigns second course he stands up and drinks to the knightscompanions and so it is remembered to be done by phil and mar they standing all the while uncovered till they have all pledged him which done the officers of arms make themselves ready at the lower end o the hall to proceed up in the following order  garter clarenceux and norroy heralds two and two pursuivants two and two and so altogether make their reverence to the sovereign and proceed near the side of the knights table till they come to the middle of the hall where after another reverence made they go still forward and when garter has passed about two yards beyond the knights tabe and come near the haut pas asnding the svereigns state they make the like reverence again jointly then garter with a loud and audible voice cries largess thrice though anciently but twice  upon garters beginning to cry largess all the knightscompanions unless kings and great princes if any e present stand up uncovered till he has made an en which custom it seems   car i had been discontied for some time then garter proceeds and proclaims the sovereigns styles and titles of honor first in latin after in french and lastly in english he and the offirs of arms making a reverence between and at the end join altogether in crying largess thrice and then al make reverence together  hereupon sometimes the treasurer of the huhold puts the sovereigns lagess which is en punds in  into garters hat and this is afterward divided amon the officers of arms according to custom but anno    car ii the blackrod put the largess into garters hat this being finished all the offiers of arms retire about three yards backward keeping their faces toward the sovereign and there make a reverence and so a second and thence retire out of the hall to dinner  this ceremony ended the sovereigns second course is brought up first the sejeants at ams next the treasurer and comptroller of the household next the sewer then the gentlemenpensioners bearing the messes then the cofferer and master of the household the two clerks of the greencloth the two clerks comptrollers and lastly the two clerks of the kitchen habted in their gowns and their caps in their hands and after the sovereigns table is completely furnished the second coure is served up to the knights table by the yeomen of the guard in such order as was the first  but where any knightcompanion hapens to be installed at this grand feast and is present at dinner then garter and the officers of arms proceed in order after they have proclaimed the sovereigns style from the lower end of the hall till they come before the nw installed knights mess and there garter cries larges once and proclaims his style in english only and then retires to dinner  in the last place comes in the banquet brought to the sovereigns table by the pensioners in the same order as the messes only in place of the cerk of the kitchen the chief clerk of the spicery waits and the baquet for the knightscompanions by the yeomen of the guard  dinner being ended the knightscompanions rise first and having washed place themselves a little be ow  state in their usual order and make their revencs o the sovereign after which the soereign hears grace said by the prelate then water is brought in the  way and the soereign washes which done the  making again due reverence to the sovereign  his cap and salutes them and then roceds a usua o the presence chamber with the knights and offi o the order before him etc  in like manner does the sovereigns lieutenant proceed from the presence to the hall or such other room where the dinner is prepared only his place at the tab is a little on the left hand the clth of state or at the end of the table and after dinner he returns t the presence in the same order as the sovereign does  the ceremonis belonging to the second vespers   the usual time for procding to the chapter house has usually been about four a clock in the aternoon but sometimes not before five by reason of the length of the dinner the proceeding is as at other times and when the sovereign and knights have made a cavalcade of it on the eve or on the feast day the same has been observed at the proceeding to the second vspers  it has been customary to hold a chapter before the second vespers for the regulation of the affairs of the oder when the second vespers are ended the proceeding passes out of the choir in the very same order as a the first vespers but anno    car i it happening to be lae ere the second vespers ended the soveregn did not go to the presence chamber but proceeded directly o the great hall to supper by torch light  of the supper on the evening of the feast dy   it has not been frequently known that the sovereign has supped pubckly in st  hall n he feast day but when it happens as    i the poceeding thither and reun re n all  peromed as at the supper on the eve and i the  lieutenant has on this ngh upped ulicly thn t was n the pesence chamber where h at alone at the sovereigns table as at other times  cap xxii the ceremonies observed on the last day of the feast of the proceeding to the choir   the manner of proceeding to the chapter house is performed in the same manner as it was on the eve of the feast and differs only in this point that then the sovereign and knights are obliged by the statutes to proceed in full robes here by the indulgence of king henry viiis statutes all are dispensed with except the upper robe or mantle and as then the image of st george was worn pendant at the collar of the order now a blue ribbond suffices and instead of a cap and feather only their ordinary has  it was the ancient custom to celebrate a chapter in the morning of the last day of the feast before the sovereign proceeded to the chapel chiefly to make election of knights where any stall is void which has sometimes been held when the sovereign did not go to the chapel in the privy chamber and then the lieutenant waving the chapter house proceeds straight on to the chapel and enters at the south door  of the elect knights proceeding into the choir   where an election has been made of a person then present at court he is called into the chaperhouse by garter according to the usual manner an haing been invested with the george and gater e usually psed in the proceeding to the chapel whether t we from the chapter house or presence chamber an n his ordinary apparel alwas bareheaded the place llwed him in the proceeding being bewee the knigsmpanions and the officers of ams but i two knights have been elected they then proceed together before the knightscompanions at his entrance into the choir the elect knight is placed by garter next before the lowest stall or if there be two elected and both proceed to the chapel they are placed in the two lowest stalls where they are to stand all service time unless upon license to sit as they have sometimes obtained  of the ceremonies performed at divine service   in this morning service before the reformation of our church the mass of requiem was solemnly sung for the souls of the knightscompanions and all faithful souls departed which was provided for by the statutes as likewise that all the knights should be present thereat unless upon license obtained or special case to the contrary at this celebration was the deceased knights achievements also offered with solemn ceremony of which we shall speak presently  another ceremony belonging to the service of this morning is the offering of gold and silver which when the first sentence of the offertory has been pronounced is again performed by the sovereign and knightscompanions the ceremonies being the same in all particulars as are observed at the like offering on the feast day  divine service being ended the sovereign and knightscompanions frequently proceed to the chapter house and there put off their mantles and therewith the ceremonies of this grand feast determine  cap xxiii the observation of the grand feast by absent knights absent knights enjoined to observe the grand feast   having shown with what magnificence and ceremony the feast of st george has been and ought to be observed as also how strictly the statutes oblige the knightscompanions to appear annually thereat and what severe penalties they are liable to if absent except on reasonable cause of absence yet lest the honor might receive diminution from too smll an appearance at its public solemnities it was farther at the institution of the order decreed that none of them should depart the kingdom without first acquainting the sovereign and obtaining his special leave and license nevertheless the sovereign granted them license to go beyond sea before the rest of his subjects if they were disposed to undertake any military expedition from whence any glory of knighthood might be hoped for  it was then by the eleventh article also ordained on whatsoever occasion the absence might be that wheresoever any of the knightscompanions resided during the said feast they should wear their mantles of the order from the hour of the first vespers on the eve of st george till the secnd vespers on the feast day were finished as they should have done had they been present in person with the sovereign or his deputy during the whole celebration of the feast in case they were not deprived of their liberty the prorgation of the feast notwithstanding  king henry viii observing the custom of these celebrations began to be neglected in the eleventh year of his reign enlarged the law in this particular explaining the said eleventh article he declared and enjoined the wearing of the whole habit on the eve of st george if the knghtcompanion were not under restraint then he enumerated the times for wearing it to wit on the eve at all times of divine service dnner and supper unless in case of war sckness or other just impediment when it was sufficient if the absent knight did wear the garter and george either in a gold chain or silk ribbond  and when the same sovereign about three years aft made a general reformation of the statutes he enjoined the absent knightscompanions unless under restraint to prepare a capital stall in the church or chapel where he designed to hear service to the honor of the sovereign in which should be set up the arms of the order within a garter and also to erect another stall as far in distance according to the proportion of the said church or chapel from the stall of the sovereign as is the absent knights stall in the castle of windsor and therein place his own arms and should wear the whole habit of the order and hear divine service such as the church ordained for the said time as well on the eve and morning as on the afternoon on the feast day he is likewise to do reverence toward the altar in the honor of god and after toward the stall erected for the sovereign at his coming in and going out of the said church or chapel and as often as he should pass before the said stall but emerors king princes or electors are excepted who may place their seats and stalls as they think itting  this decree is still in full force and we shall only further observe that it has been usual for the absent knight to perform the same ceremonies as near as may be to what is observed at windsor and to be attended with a convenient number of gentlemen before him well habited with the officers of his household etc who according to their degrees proceed two and two together bareheaded and that he dines and sps alone at all times unless a knightcompanion be with him  how it is to be observed in case of sickness   in case of sickness if the absent kight was only confined to his chamber the custom was to prpre a capital stall for the sovereign in the chamber where he lay and another stall for himself placed according to the beforementioned directions to remain during the feast in which room divine offices were celebrated and if the absent knight was so sick as to keep his bed then his whole habit of the order was laid thereon and upon this account ambrose earl of warwick falling ill t greenwich when st georges day was there celebrated anno  0 eliz retired to his chamber and sat in his robes  in what manner the feast has been observed by absent knights   of this the blackbook of the order gives a very considerable precedent namely the feast of st george held at the palace of hereford by prince arthur    hen vii being then in his government of the principality of wales and had with him sir richard pool one of the knightscompanions where every thing according to the form of the statutes was duly observed the princes sword was born before his stall and the service performed by his herald with great exactness likewise the sovereigns herald stood all the while before the sovereigns stall which was adorned with accustomed ornaments and the bishop who performed divine service had his seat erected near the high altar  there are other instances as particularly those observed by sir henry sidney at shrewsbury and ludlow    and    queen eliz which were very remarkable  as to the observation of the feast by a knight beyond sea there is an instance in robert earl of leicester lieutenant for queen elizabeth governor and captain general of the united provinces and there celebrated the feast      he had an escutcheon of the order impailed with the sovereigns arms ixt to the front of his house so also to the back of her stall in the church and his own arms at the back of his own stall  he proceeded on horeback to the church a pursuivant riding before him wearing a king of armss coat who after srmon proceeded before him to the offering which he made for the sovereign and himself service being ended he returned to his lodging and dined with great solemnity  dispensations for absence granted during life   sometimes dispensations for absence have been obtained for life upon the petite of the knightscompanions setting forth their age and infirmity an instance of which we find was grantd to the lord dacrees    hen viii and the earl of derby    car i and the lord musgrave but both with this restriction that the absent should be obliged to send to garter for his escutcheons at the same time that he sent his excuse and petite for dispensation and should solemnly keep in his own house the feast with all the sacred rites and ceremonies in his robes and other ornaments if health permit and in case of sickness upon his bed according to the ancient statutes  this act was thought of so great importance to be observed that the chancellor was ordered to transcribe it and send it to each of the knightscompanions acquainting them at the same time with the penalties they should be liable to if they neglected the least punctilio and the lke was again observed and repeated to them before the feast of the ensuing year  cap xxiv the degradation of a knightcompanion   the ensigns of the order are not to be withdrawn from a kight during life unless guilty of some of those marks of reproach set down in king henry viiis statutes viz heresy teason or flying from battle it has sometimes been ound that prodigality has been made a fourth point where a knight has so wasted his estate as to be incapable of supporting his dignity the pretense for divesting william lord paget   edw vi was his not being a gentleman of blood both by father and mother but felony comes not within the compass of this statute as not being expressly mentioned among the reproaches there summed up and so it was adjudged in a chapter    jac i in the case of robert earl of somerset then lately condemned for that fact whereon his hachments were not removed  when a knightcompanion is found guilty of any of the offenses mentioned in king henry viiis statutes he is usually degraded at the next chapter of which the sovereign gives the knightscompanions previous notice and then commands garter to attend such of them as are appointed to go to the convict knight who in a solemn manner first takes from him the george and ribbond and then his garter and at the ensuing feast of st george or sooner if the sovereign appoint it publication of his crimes and degradation is made by garter  next garter by warrant to that purpose takes down his achievement on which serice he is vested in his coat of arms and the officers of arms standing abut him the blackrod also present first garter reads aloud the instruments of degradation after which one of the heralds who is placed ready on a ladder set to the bak of the convict knights stall at the words expelled and put from among the arms takes his crest and violently casts it down into the choir after that his banner and sword and when the publication is read out all the officers of arms spurn the achievements out of the choir into the body of the church first the sword then the banner and last of all the crest so out of the west door thence to the bridge and over into the ditch and thus it was done at the degradation of edward duke of buckingham    hen viii their plates are likewise taken down from their stalls and carried away  degradation not being alone thought sufficient it was debated in chapter    hen viii whether the names of such knightscompanions as were convicted of treason should remain in the registers or be razed out where the sovereign determined that wheresoever the actions or names of such offenders should be found these words vah proditor should be written in the margin by which means the register would be preservd fair and not defacd with razures or blots  in the close of this section we may observe that some knightscompanions who have suffered degradation have lived to be restored thereto being reelected and reinvested and their achievements set up again by the indulgence of the next reign as were the lord pagets   mar and the marquess of northampton   eliz as likewise the duke of norfolk   mar  cap xxv honors paid to deceased knightscompanions as to the first part of this section the celebrating masses for defunct knightscompanions i think it very little material here that ceremony altering with the form of religion became wholly disused    hen viii at which time in a chapter then held at westminster the following decree was made  that every one of the knightscompanions in lieu of the said masses should for the future after the death of any of their brethren according to the rates of their degrees hereafter mentioned and immediately upon demand of the register and dean of windsor or one of them pay the several sums following  l s d the sovereign   0    a stranger king   0    the prince        a duke   00 0 a marquess      0  l s l an earl    0 0 a viscount   0    a baron        a knightbatchelor 0       the moneys so collected called obiit moneys were by the said decree appointed to be distributed in almsdeeds as the reparation of high ways the relief of the poor etc the receipt and disbursements of these sums were committed to the care of the dean and register  mr ashmole has made this addition in his library which it will not be out of our way to observe for the information of those who may be desirous to know how the point then stood that not withstanding the aforesaid order in chapter made the   th of may anno    hen viii for changing the number of masses usually sung for defunct knights into a pecuniary rate according their degrees the prayers for souls departed both by private persons as also by the clergy in masses and exequies nay farther to give alms to others and to pray for them was continued by the church of england several years beyond that space for in a book entitled the institution of a christian man etc made by the clergy of england as appears by the subscriptions of the archbishops bishops and others of the clergy to the preface dedicated by them to king henry viii and printed by thomas bartelet the kings printer anno      cum privilegio the article of purgtory is there set down  but to proceed this charitable distribution in a chapter held at greenwich   edw vi was enlarged to the relief of the poor in the town of windsor and other towns villages and places at the discretion of the dean of windsor and though the said decree was confirmed by king edward vi queen mary and queen elizabeth yet for many years the collection of these obiit moneys was neglected till in   car i the earl of portland out of his great generosity as well as his zeal for restoring so pious a work reiterated to the sovereign the ancient decrees made in this case whereupon it passed in chapter that the same should be revived and for ever continued and that the same should begin for the five knights whose achievements were offered at that feast viz the king of sweden the elect or palatine the earls of northumberland banbury and rutland and as to stranger princes it pleased the sovereign to express himself that as by the statutes they are left to perform these payments by themselves if they would so if it were not done by them that both then and for the fuure the same should e paid by the sovereign himself  afterward all the sums of money to be collected by virtue of this decree together with the knightscompanions duties at their first entrance in the order were employed toward providing plate for the altar within st georges chapel which is already treated of  of fixing on the stalls plates of their arms and styles   the next thing provided for by the statutes of institution was the deceased knights honor in regard of which it was ordained that when any one of the first founders should die there should be in metal an escutcheon of his arms with his helm or crest fastened at the back of his stall for a mark of honor to him that bore them and in like manner that their successors should have a like escutcheon fixed on the back of their stalls and to difference them from those of the first founders they were appointed to be made somewhat less and to be placed a little underneath them but this article relates only to the knightscompanions not to the sovereigns of the order nor do we find that any of them had plates of their arms and styles set upon the back of their stalls in manner as is before prescribed to the rest of the knightscompanions  king henry viii in his body of statutes alters this article in three particulars first as to the setting up their plates which he appoints not to be after their deaths but within after the installation of every knightcompanion secondly as to the nature of the metal that it may be such as the knight shall please himself and lastly as to the size though he also restrains the knightssubjects to a lesser than those of the first founders yet he gives liberty to the knightsstrangers to use their plates and fashions at pleasure as to the first of these it has been rety duly observed and indeed the second of making them of copper but the last viz the size has been very little regarded for the very plates of those knights who were soon after installed and thence downwards ae larger than those of the first funder  in tract of time many of these memorials were by acrilegious hands taken away which king chales i taking notice of and desirous to put a stop to a mischief not in his power to prevent and to preserve the remembrance of the precedent knightscompanions commanded the dean of windsor to describe the styles of those that remained in a book which he accordingly did and deposited the same in the college but what became of this book could not be afterward discovered so that the most that could be done was to draw the arms and copy out the styles engraven on the plates then remaining from whence the following observations may be made  first that for many years after the institution of the order the plate whereon the shield was engraved bore no other inscription than the deceased knghts name set at the foot thereof under the escutcheon of his arms afterward the chief title of honor began to be added though now and then in the first and elder times both were omitted as also their crests but about the beginning of king henry viiis reign not only the knights chief title but all other his titles and dignities whether honorary or officiary were drawn together in one inscription concluding with that of knight of this most noble order and which about the same time the knightscompanions used to insert in all their public and private instruments of writing a custom observed by the knights of other sovereigns orders abroad  at first the knightscompanions gave their paternal coats of arms singly and without any quarterings but toward the beginning of hen v they began to add their quarterings as appears from the escutcheons of hugh lord burnel who died   hen v sir lewis rbessart and others yet was not the same generally used but left to the pleasure of the knightscompanions  but of later times this very thing was thought of uch concern that where a knight has been elected who wanted quarterings the sovereign has been pleased to grant him another coat of arms to quarter with his paternal coat that his banner which ought to hang over his stall might not seem too naked  soon after king henry viiis accession the knights compassed their shields with the royal garter and thereon such as were noblemen placed the coronet elonging to their dignity as to supporters we observe two plates to which they are added the one of john beaufort the first duke of somerset of that name elected  0 hen vi the other of anthony widvile earl rivers elected   edw iv and besides these till the reign of king henry viii there is not another example but then it grw into common usage as also the ingraving their peculiar mottos or devices upon the plates  the offering of achievements   a third honor paid to the defunct knight is a most solemn offering up his achievements at the high altar namely the banner of his arms his sword helmet and crest with its mantlings all which had been set up over his stall at his installation the ceremony of offering these ensigns does not appear to have been regulated at the institution of the order but rather added as an additional honor by king henry v and the manner thereof set down in the fourteenth article of his body of statutes  this solemnity is local to the chapel of st george within the castle of windsor and not to be performed ill the sovereign has notice of the knightcompanions death  in   edw vi at the feast then held at windsor there arose a question whether the achievements of king henry viii which yet hung over the sovereigns stall should be taken down and offered at the mass of requiem ensuing or not in regard his banner sword helm and crest with mantles had been offered up before at his interment within that chapel in conclusion of which it was determined that the said achievements should not again be offered but remain over the sovereigns stall for his son king edward vi but when the sovereigns of this most noble order are not interred at windsor then their achievements are offered up the next ensuing feast as were those of queen elizabeth which the bluebook notes to be done at morning prayer  as to the time for performing this ceremony it was ordained to be on the morrow after the feast when the mass was sung for the souls of the knightscmpanions etc and so was duly observed till the time of the reformation when the mass of requim being abolished it was nevertheless at the mrning srvic on the morrow immediately after the offertory but after queen elizabeth had removed the feast of st george from windsor this solemnity was frequently dipatched in one day before they went out of the choir and the ancient rule as to the time being thus broke was never after restored but generally performed the very same morning wherein the elect knights were installed and though the day was thus changed yet the ceremony it self was not performed till after the installation was finished that solemnity having always the precedence till   jac i when he observing how incongruous it seemed to instal a new knight before his predecessor had been fully discharged of his stall gave order for offering the achievements of sir henry lea the lord scroop and others before the instalment of the elect knights  not long after it was thought convenient to perform this ceremony on the eve of the feast presently after the first vespers began and next to proceed with the installations whereby as much as possible the stalls of the knightscompanions might be supplied in all the rest of the solemnities of the feast but if at any time any of the new elect knights were introduced into the choir before the offering of the achievements began they were appointed to stand there under the stalls designed for them till that ceremony was finished  thus it continued from the said   jac i till the    car ii when it was performed at the time anciently accustomed for it the prince of denmark and the duke of monmouth being both installed before the first vespes began and the achievements of the defunct knights not offered till the morrow after the feast day  as to the manner and order of this ceremony among other institutions of king henry v it is appointed that as often as through the vacancy of any stall the sword helms with the rest of the defunct knights ought to be offered the sword of the deceased knight shall be first offered being carried up to the high altar by two of the knightscompanions and afterward the helm with the crest and mantlings by two other knightscompanions and this offering is to be made for them in the order they were installed not as they died  but of the offering of a defunct knights banner we find no express mention till    hen vii at which time the banner of the lord brook was offered but afterward the direction for offering their ensign and banner was taken into king henry viiis body of statutes and since the same were introduced according to the foregoing precedent it was to be offered first and so has been generally observed  by the appointment of the statutes of hnry v the sovereign is to nominate and assign the knights companis who are severally to perform this ceremony and so is the direction in henry viiis statutes but since the beginning of queen elizabeths reign the knights have generally proceeded to this offering according to their seniority and when the course ended then the seniors began again there are likewise many examples where the sovereigns lieutenant has joined in the ceremony to assist the other knights nor is a proxy or deputy to be admitted to perform any part of the ceremony though in the offering of money he ought  we shall next proceed to the duties of the prelate of the order the prebends and officers of arms as their services severally or jointly relate to the performance of this ceremony first then the prelate and two prebends ought to proceed up to the altar immediately before garter summons down the knightscompanions to the offering and there stand ready to receive the achievements as they are severally offered up  it is next the duty of the provincial kings and heralds to conduct the knightscompanions when they proceed up to the altar bearing any part of the defunct knights achievements the whole ceremony is briefly thus  first garter rises from his sea and proceeds into the middle of the choir where after his usual obeysances he summons the knightscompanions to descend who come down and place themselves before their stalls whereupon clarenceux and norroy or in the abence of either the senior herald or of both of the two eldest heralds pass down from the steps of the altar into the body of the choir in the interim gater takes the banner of the eldest defunct knight and presents it half rolled up to the two senior knightscompanions the two provincial kings by this time approaching them mke their double reverences and after to the other knightscompanions and then tand a little aside while the two senior knights having taken the banner between them make their double reverence and pass up to the altar preceeded by the kings bearing it with the lower end of the staff foremost and at the first hautpas make another double reverence the provincial kings being arrived at the uppermost hautpas after an humble obesance divide themselves to make way for the knights to offer who forthwith raise the point of the banner upwards and after a single reverence toward the altar preent it upon their knees to the prelate of the order who delivers it to two canons and they deposite it upon cusions laid before the altar this done the two provincial kings conduct the knights back into the choir who with the usual reverences retire to their stations under not to their stalls and the provincial kings to their on either side the altar  next the two senior heralds pass down into the choir as the provincial kings did whilst garter taking up the sword presents it to the two next senior knights who proceed to the altar with the two heralds before them in the same order as before bearing the sword between them and offer the same with the pommel or hilt upwards and then retire as before  in the next place the two next senior heralds go down as before and the helm and crest is offered in the like manner but the pursuivants at arms do no part of this duty  heretofore we find that garter has not only begun this solemnity by presenting the banner but has also conducted the two senior knights to the altar as he did   eliz by the banner of the lord gray and at some other times it as likewise the usage heretofore for the preate to deliver the offered achievements to some of the halds to be deposited near the altar  there is nothing on this farther observable than what reltes to the achievement it self which as hey became by this ceremony part of the goods of the chapel and iclded within the wor of the statutes of the college whreby he sovereig ganted to the dean and canns all obatios they could not be sld or alienated and were therefore depsited by them in the chapter house but the elms and swords because they were at first orged or the service of war of an exraordinary large size have bn equently redmed that they might serve again to the same uses and likewise because it belongs to garter to provide achievements for new installed knights he usually has compounded with the dean and canons for the defunct knights achievements  of depositing the deceased knights mantles in the chapter house   in   eliz there passed a decree that the knightcompanions should be bound by their oaths to take care by their last will that after their decease all their ornaments which they had received should be restored the rbes to the college and the jewels to the king that gave them sir christopher hatton complied with the decree and sent his mantle accordingly but that of sir henry lea being left to the disposal of others and not sent to the college happened at length to come into the hands of brokers and was openly exposed to sale in longlane to the great dishonor of the order  this decree was in after times but slackly observed and therefore in a chapter held at windsor   car i the knights were admonished that when the sovereign should vouchsafe to bestow the mantle of the order the knight should take care at his death to have it sent to the chapel at windsor according to the statutes but this taking little effect the sovereign thought fit to restore vigorously the law in this particular by a decree in chapter    car i which obliged all knightscompanions receiving the ensigns of the order from the sovereign to take care according to the tenor of their oaths that these together with the book of statutes should be restored in the hands of the sovereign after their deaths and a command was therewithal given that certain books mantles and surcoats then lying at white hall should be delivered to the register of the order to be laid up at windsor in honorable memory of thse to whom they belonged  in observation of these decrees where the habit and ensigns of the order were either wholly or in part bestowed by the sovereign order was taken at the decease of such knightscompanions to end for them in again as a a chapter held    car i the gater and george of the lord treasurer weston being sent back were presented to the sovereign and after delivered to the dean and chapter of windsor to be prserved and in the same chapter it was ordered that the earl of kellys robes and ornaments of the order should be sent for by the chancellor  these former decrees were yet thought needful to be confirmed by king charles ii so that in a chapter held      at white hall it was decreed that the mantle of each knight companion with the book of statutes should be sent to windsor immediately after their deaths and that the chancellor of the order should be obliged by letters to their heirs and executors to put them in mind of sending them thither but it is to be understood that where the mantle has been provided at the knights own charge there is no obligation for returning them  thus i have run through all the particulars relating to the institutions laws and ceremonies of this most noble order i shall in the last place proceed to give a list of all those who have enjoyed this singular mark of honor from its first foundation the motives which excited the royal founder to set on foot the said order are already particularly treated of who having established rules and statutes for the government and regulation thereof he next resolved to elect from among the flower of his own wars tweny five of the most celebrated knights who together with himself should make up the number of twenty six for of so many does the oder by his appointment consist and indeed that age plentifully furnished him with men of the most brave and celebrated characters and of signal reputation in arms red by the eminent wars of those times and justly dnguished by their own heroic actions  the first that he elected into this noble order was edward his eldest son who already in part deserved and afterward justly obtained the title of a brave and martial prince of whom our histories speak so largel t rest of his
