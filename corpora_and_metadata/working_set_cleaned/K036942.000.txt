i scene i the court of a castle surrounded with woods enter lady randolph ye woods and wilds whose melancholy gloom accords with my souls sadness and draws forth the voice of sorrow from my bursting heart farewell a while i will not leave you long for in your shades i deem some spirit dwells who from the chiding stream or groaning oak still hears and answers to matildas moan o douglas douglas if departed ghosts are ever permitted to review this world within the circle of that wood thou art and with the passion of immortals hearst my lamentation hearst thy wretched wife weep for her husband slain her infant lost my brothers timeless death i seem to mourn who perished with thee on this fatal day to thee i lift my voice to thee address the plaint which mortal ear has never heard o disregard me not though i am called anothers now my heart is wholly thine incapable of change affection lies buried my douglas in thy bloody grave but randolph comes whom fate has made my lord to chide my anguish and defraud the dead enter lord randolph again these weeds of woe say do thou well to feed a passion which consumes thy life the living claim some duty vainly thou bestowst thy cares upon the silent dead lady randolph silent alas is he for whom i mourn childless without memorial of his name he only now in my remembrance lives  lord randolph time that wears out the trace of deepest anguish has past over thee in vain would thou were not composed of grief and tenderness alone sure thou art not the daughter of sir malcolm strong was his rage eternal his resentment for when thy brother fell he smiled to hear that douglas son in the same field was slain  lady randolph oh rake not up the ashes of my fathers implacable resentment was their crime and grievous has the expiation been contending with the douglas gallant lives of either house were lost my ancestors compelled at last to leave their ancient seat on tiviots pleasant banks and now of them no heir is left had they not been so stern i had not been the last of all my race  lord randolph thy grief wrests to its purposes my words i never asked of thee that ardent love which in the breasts of fancys children burns decent affection and complacent kindness were all i wished for but i wished in vain hence with the less regret my eyes behold the storm of war that gathers over this land if i should perish by the danish sword matilda would not shed one tear the more  lady randolph thou do not think so woeful as i am i love thy merit and esteem thy virtues but whither go thou now  lord randolph straight to the camp where every warrior on the tiptoe stands of expectation and impatient asks each who arrives if he is come to tell the danes are landed  lady randolph o may adverse winds far from the coast of scotland drive their fleet and every soldier of both hosts return in peace and safety to his pleasant home  lord randolph thou speak a womans hear a warriors wish right from their native land the stormy north may the wind blow till every keel is fixed immovable in caledonias strand then shall our foes repent their bold invasion and roving armies shun the fatal shore  lady randolph war i detest but war with foreign foes whose manners language and whose looks are strange is not so horrid nor to me so hateful as that which with our neighbors often we wage a river here there an ideal line by fancy drawn divides the sister kingdoms on each side dwells a people similar as twins are to each other valiant both both for their valor famous through the world yet will they not unite their kindred arms and if they must have war wage distant war but with each other fight in cruel conflict gallant in strife and noble in their ire the battle is their pastime they go forth gay in the morning as to summer sport when evening comes the glory of the morn the youthful warrior is a clod of clay thus fall the prime of either hapless land and such the fruit of scotch and english wars  lord randolph i will hear no more this melody would make a soldier drop his sword and doff his arms sit down and weep the conquests he has made yea like a monk sing rest and peace in heaven to souls of warriors in his battles slain lady farewell i leave thee not alone yonder comes one whose love makes duty light  enter anna anna forgive the rashness of your annas love urged by affection i have thus presumed to interrupt your solitary thoughts and warn you of the hours that you neglect and lose in sadness  lady randolph so to lose my hours is all the use i wish to make of time  anna to blame thee lady suits not with my state but sure i am since death first preyed on man never did sister thus a brother mourn what had your sorrows been if you had lost in early youth the husband of your heart  lady randolph oh  anna have i distressed you with officious love and illtimed mention of your brothers fate forgive me lady humble though i am the mind i bear partakes not of my fortune so fervently i love you that to dry these piteous tears i would throw my life away  lady randolph what power directed thy unconscious tongue to speak as thou have done to name   anna i know not but since my words have made my mistress tremble i will speak so no more but silent mix my tears with hers  lady randolph no thou shall not be silent i will trust thy faithful love and thou shall be henceforth the instructed partner of my woes but what avails it can thy feeble pity roll back the flood of neverebbing time compel the earth and ocean to give up their dead alive  anna what means my noble mistress  lady randolph did thou not ask what had my sorrows been  if i in early youth had lost a husband  in the cold bosom of the earth is lodged mangled with wounds the husband of my youth and in some cavern of the ocean lies my child and his   anna o lady most revered the tale wrapped up in your amazing words deign to unfold  lady randolph alas an ancient feud hereditary evil was the source of my misfortunes ruling fate decreed that my brave brother should in battle save the life of douglas son our houses foe the youthful warriors vowed eternal friendship to see the vaunted sister of his friend impatient douglas to balarmo came under a borrowed name  my heart he gained nor did i long refuse the hand he begged my brothers presence authorized our marriage three weeks three little weeks with wings of down had over us flown when my loved lord was called to fight his fathers battles and with him in spite of all my tears did malcolm go scarce were they gone when my stern sire was told that the false stranger was lord douglas son frantic with rage the baron drew his sword and questioned me alone forsaken faint kneeling beneath his sword faultring i took an oath equivocal that i never would wed one of douglas name sincerity thou first of virtues let no mortal leave thy onward path although the earth should gape and from the gulf of hell destruction cry to take dissimulations winding way  anna alas how few of womans fearful kind durst own a truth so hardy  lady randolph the first truth is easiest to avow this moral learn this precious moral from my tragic tale  in a few days the dreadful tidings came that douglas and my brother both were slain my lord my life my husband  mighty god what had i done to merit such affliction  anna my dearest lady many a tale of tears i have listened to but never did i hear a tale so sad as this  lady randolph in the first days of my distracting grief i found myself  as women wish to be who love their lords but who durst tell my father the good priest who joined our hands my brothers ancient tutour with his loved malcolm in the battle fell they two alone were privy to the marriage on silence and concealment i resolved till time should make my fathers fortune mine that very night on which my son was born my nurse the only confident i had set out with him to reach her sisters house but nurse nor infant have i ever seen or heard of anna since that fatal hour my murdered child  had thy fond mother feared the loss of thee she had loud fame defied despised her fathers rage her fathers grief and wandered with thee through the scorning world  anna not seen nor heard of then perhaps he lives  lady randolph no it was dark december wind and rain had beat all night across the carron lay the destined road and in it is swelling flood my faithful servant perished with my child o hapless son of a most hapless sire  but they are both at rest and i alone dwell in this world of woe condemned to walk like a guilttroubld ghost my painful rounds nor has despiteful fate permitted me the comfort of a solitary sorrow though dead to love i was compelled to wed randolph who snatched me from a villains arms and randolph now possesses the domains that by sir malcolms death on me devolved domains that should to douglas son have given a barons title and a barons power such were my foothing thoughts while i bewailed the slaughtered father of a son unborn and when that son came like a ray from heaven which shines and disappears alas my child how long did thy fond mother grasp the hope of having thee she knew not how restored year after year has worn her hope away but left still undiminishd her desire  anna the hand that spins the uneven thread of life may smooth the length that is yet to come of yours  lady randolph not in this world i have considered well its various evils and on whom they fall alas how often does goodness wound itself and sweet affection prove the spring of woe o had i died when my loved husband fell had some good angel opened to me the book of providence and let me read my life my heart had broke when i beheld the sum of ills which one by one i have endured  anna that god whose ministers good angels are has shut the book in mercy to mankind but we must leave this theme glenalvon comes i saw him bend on you his thoughtful eyes and hitherwards he slowly stalks his way  lady randolph i will avoid him an ungracious person is doubly irksome in an hour like this  anna why speaks my lady thus of randolphs heir  lady randolph because he is not the heir of randolphs virtues subtle and shrewd he offers to mankind an artificial image of himself and he with ease can vary to the taste of different men it is features selfdenied and master of his appetites he seems but his fierce nature like a fox chained up watches to seize unseen the wished for prey never were vice and virtue poised so ill as in glenalvons unrelenting mind yet is he brave and politic in war and stands aloft in these unruly times why i describe him thus i will tell hereafter stay and detain him till i reach the castle  exit lady randolph anna o happiness where art thou to be found i see thou dwell not with birth and beauty though graced with grandeur and in wealth arrayed nor do thou it would seem with virtue dwell else had this gentle lady missed thee not  enter glenalvon glenalvon what do thou muse on meditating maid like some entranced and visionary seer on earth thou standst thy thoughts ascend to heaven  anna would that i were even as thou say a seer to have my doubts by heavenly vision cleared  glenalvon what do thou doubt of what have thou to do with subjects intricate thy youth thy beauty cannot be questioned think of these good gifts and then thy contemplations will be pleasing  anna let women view yon monument of woe then boast of beauty who so fair as she but i must follow this revolving day awakes the memory of her ancient woes  exit anna glenalvon solus so  lady randolph shuns me by and by i will woo her as the lion wooes his brides the deeds a doing now that makes me lord of these rich valleys and a chief of power the season is most apt my sounding steps will not be heard amidst the din of arms randolph has lived too long his better fate had the ascendant once and kept me down when i had seized the dame by chance he came rescued and had the lady for his labor i scapd unknown a slender consolation heaven is my witness that i do not love to sow in peril and let others reap the jocund harvest yet i am not safe by love or something like it stung inflamed madly i blabbd my passion to his wife and she has threatened to acquaint him of it the way of womans will i do not know but well i know the barons wrath is deadly i will not live in fear the man i dread is as a dane to me ay and the man who stands betwixt me and my chief desire no bar but he she has no kinsman near no brother in his sisters quarrel bold and for the righteous cause a strangers cause i know no chief that will defy glenalvon  end of the first act act ii scene i a court etc enter servants and a stranger at one door and lady randolph and anna at another lady randolph what means this clamor stranger speak secure have thou been wronged have these rude men presumed to vex the weary traveller on his way  first servant by us no stranger ever suffered wrong this man with outcry wild has called us forth so sore afraid he cannot speak his fears  enter lord randolph and young man with their swords drawn and bloody lady randolph not vain the strangers fears how fares my lord  lord randolph that it fares well thanks to this gallant youth whose valor saved me from a wretched death as down the winding dale i walked alone at the cross way four armed men attacked me rovers i judge from the licentious camp who would have quickly laid lord randolph low had not this brave and generous stranger come like my good angel in the hour of fate and mocking danger made my foes his own they turned upon him but his active arm struck to the ground from whence they rose no more the fiercest two the others fled amain and left him master of the bloody field speak lady randolph upon beautys tongue dwell accents pleasing to the brave and bold speak noble dame and thank him for thy lord  lady randolph my lord i cannot speak what now i feel my heart overflows with gratitude to heaven and to this noble youth who all unknown to you and yours deliberated not nor paused at peril but humanely brave fought on your side against such fearful odds have you yet learned of him whom we should thank whom call the savior of lord randolphs life  lord randolph i asked that question and he answered not but i must know who my deliverer is to the stranger  stranger a low born man of parentage obscure who naught can boast but his desire to be a soldier and to gain a name in arms  lord randolph whoever thou art thy spirit is ennobled by the great king of kings thou art ordained and stamped a hero by the sovereign hand of nature blush not flower of modesty as well as valor to declare thy birth  stranger my name is norval on the grampian hills my father feeds his flocks a frugal swain whose constant cares were to increase his store and keep his only son myself at home for i had heard of battles and i longed to follow to the field some warlike lord and heaven soon granted what my sire denied this moon which rose last night round as my shield had not yet filled her horns when by her light a band of fierce barbarians from the hills rushed like a torrent down upon the vale sweeping our flocks and herds the shepherds fled for safety and for succor i alone with bended bow and quiver full of arrows hovered about the enemy and marked the road he took then hasted to my friends whom with a troop of fifty chosen men i met advancing the pursuit i led till we oertook the spoilencumberd foe we fought and conquered ere a sword was drawn an arrow from my bow had pierced their chief who wore that day the arms which now i wear returning home in triumph i disdained the shepherds slothful life and having heard that our good king had summoned his bold peers to lead their warriors to the carron side i left my fathers house and took with me a chosen servant to conduct my steps  yon trembling coward who forsook his master journeying with this intent i past these towers and heavendirected came this day to do the happy deed that gilds my humble name  lord randolph he is as wise as brave was ever tale with such a gallant modesty rehearsed my brave deliverer thou shall enter now a nobler list and in a monarchs sight contend with princes for the prize of fame i will present thee to our scottish king whose valiant spirit ever valor loved ha my matilda wherefore starts that tear  lady randolph i cannot say for various affections and strangely mingled in my bosom swell yet each of them may well command a tear i joy that thou art safe and admire him and his fortunes who has wrought thy safety obscure and friendless he the army sought bent upon peril in the range of death resolved to hunt for fame and with his sword to gain distinction which his birth denied in this attempt unknown he might have perished and gained with all his valor but oblivion now graced by thee his virtue serves no more beneath despair the soldier now of hope he stands conspicuous fame and great renown are brought within the compass of his sword on this my mind reflected whilst you spoke and blessed the wonderworking lord of heaven  lord randolph pious and grateful ever are thy thoughts my deeds shall follow where thou pointst the way next to myself and equal to glenalvon in honor and command shall norval be  norval i know not how to thank you rude i am in speech and manners never till this hour stood i in such a presence yet my lord there is something in my breast which makes me bold to say that norval never will shame thy favor  lady randolph i will be sworn thou will not thou shall be my knight and ever as thou did today with happy valor guard the life of randolph  lord randolph well have thou spoke let me forbid reply to norval we are thy debtors still thy high desert oertops our gratitude i must proceed as was at first intended to the camp some of my train i see are speeding hither impatient doubtless of their lords delay go with me norval and thine eyes shall see the chosen warriors of thy native land who languish for the fight and beat the air with brandished swords  norval let us begone my lord  lord randolph to lady randolph about the time that the declining sun shall his broad orbit over yon hills suspend expect us to return this night once more within these walls i rest my tent i pitch tomorrow in the field prepare the feast free is his heart who for his country fights he in the eve of battle may resign himself to social pleasure sweetest then when danger to a soldiers soul endears the human joy that never may return  exeunt randolph and norval scene ii lady randolph and anna lady randolph his parting words have struck a fatal truth o douglas douglas tender was the time when we two parted never to meet again how many years of anguish and despair has heaven annexed to those swift passing hours of love and fondness then my bosoms flame often as blown back by the rude breath of fear returned and with redoubled ardour blazed  anna may gracious heaven pour the sweet balm of peace into the wounds that fester in your breast for earthly consolation cannot cure them  lady randolph one only cure can heaven itself bestow  a grave  that bed in which the weary rest wretch that i am alas why am i so at every happy parent i repine how blessed the mother of yon gallant norval she for a living husband bore her pains and heard him bless her when a man was born she nursed her smiling infant on her breast tended the child and reared the pleasing boy she with affections triumph saw the youth in grace and comeliness surpass his peers whilst i to a dead husband bore a son and to the roaring waters gave my child  anna alas alas why will you thus resume your grief afresh i thought that gallant youth would for a while have won you from your woe on him intent you gazed with a look much more delighted than your pensive eye has deigned on other objects to bestow  lady randolph delighted say thou oh even there mine eye found fuel for my lifeconsuming sorrow i thought that had the son of douglas lived he might have been like this young gallant stranger and paired with him in features and in shape in all endowments as in years i deem my boy with blooming norval might have numbered whilst thus i mused a spark from fancy fell on my sad heart and kindled up a fondness for this young stranger wandering from his home and like an orphan cast upon my care i will protect thee said i to myself with all my power and grace with all my favor  anna sure heaven will bless so generous a resolve you must my noble dame exert your power you must awake devices will be framed and arrows pointed at the breast of norval  lady randolph glenalvons false and crafty head will work against a rival in his kinsmans love if i deter him not i only can bold as he is glenalvon will beware how he pulls down the fabric that i raise i will be the artist of young norvals fortune it is pleasing to admire most apt was i to this affection in my better days though now i seem to you shrunk up retired within the narrow compass of my woe have you not sometimes seen an early flower open it is bud and spread it is silken leaves to catch sweet airs and odours to bestow then by the keen blast nipt pull in it is leaves and though still living die to scent and beauty emblem of me affliction like a storm has killed the forward blossom of my heart  enter glenalvon glenalvon where is my dearest kinsman noble randolph  lady randolph have you not heard glenalvon of the base   glenalvon i have and that the villains may not escape with a strong band i have begirt the wood if they lurk there alive they shall be taken and torture force from them the important secret whether some foe of randolph hired their swords or if   lady randolph that care becomes a kinsmans love i have a counsel for glenalvons ear  exit anna  glenalvon to him your counsels always are commands  lady randolph i have not found so thou art known to me  glenalvon known  lady randolph and most certain is my cause of knowledge  glenalvon what do you know by the most blessed cross you much amaze me no created thing yourself except durst thus accost glenalvon  lady randolph is guilt so bold and do thou make a merit of thy pretended meekness this to me who with a gentleness which duty blames have hitherto concealed what if divulged would make thee nothing or what is worse than that an outcast beggar and unpitied too for mortals shudder at a crime like thine  glenalvon thy virtue awes me first of womankind permit me yet to say that the fond man whom love transports beyond strict virtues bounds if he is brought by love to misery in fortune ruined as in mind forlorn unpitied cannot be pitys the alms which on such beggars freely is bestowed for mortals know that love is still their lord and over their vain resolves advances still as fire when kindled by our shepherds moves through the dry heath before the fanning wind  lady randolph reserve these accents for some other ear to loves apology i listen not mark thou my words for it is meet thou should his brave deliverer randolph here retains perhaps his presence may not please thee well but at thy peril practice ought against him let not thy jealousy attempt to shake and loosen the good root he has in randolph whose favorites i know thou have supplanted thou look at me as if thou fain would pry into my heart it is open as my speech i give this early caution and put on the curb before thy temper breaks away the friendless stranger my protection claims his friend i am and be not thou his foe exit  scene iii manet glenalvon child that i was to start at my own shadow and be the shallow fool of coward conscience i am not what i have been what i should be the darts of destiny have almost pierced my marble heart had i one grain of faith in holy legends and religious tales i should conclude there was an arm above that fought against me and malignant turned to catch my self the subtle snare i set why rape and murder are not simple means the imperfect rape to randolph gave a spouse and the intended murder introduced a favorite to hide the sun from me and worst of all a rival burning hell this were thy center if i thought she loved him it is certain she contemns me nay commands me and waves the flag of her displeasure over me in his behalf and shall i thus be braved curbed as she calls it by dame chastity infernal fiends if any fiends there are more fierce than love ambition and revenge rise up and fill my bosom with your fires and policy remorseless chance may spoil a single aim but perseverance must prosper at last for chance and fate are words persistive wisdom is the fate of man darkly a project peers upon my mind like the red moon when rising in the east crossed and divided by strangecolourd clouds i will seek the slave who came with norval hither and for his cowardice was spurned from him i have known a followers rankled bosom breed venom most fatal to his heedless lord exit  end of the second act act iii scene i a court etc as before enter anna anna thy vassals grief great natures order break and change the noontide to the midnight hour whilst lady randolph sleeps i will walk forth and taste the air that breathes on yonder bank sweet may her slumbers be ye ministers of gracious heaven who love the human race angels and seraphs who delight in goodness forsake your skies and to her couch descend there from her fancy chase those dismal forms that haunt her waking her sad spirit charm with images celestial such as please the blessed above upon their golden beds  enter servant servant one of the vile assassins is secured we found the villain lurking in the wood with dreadful imprecations he denies all knowledge of the crime but this is not his first essay these jewels were concealed in the most

of intended murder as i hope for mercy at the judgment seat of god the tender lamb that never nipt the grass is not more innocent than i of murder  lady randolph of this mans guilt what proof can ye produce  first servant we found him lurking in the hollow glynn when viewed and called upon amazed he fled we overtook him and inquired from whence and what he was he said he came from far and was upon his journey to the camp not satisfied with this we searched his clothes and found these jewels whose rich value plead most powerfully against him hard he seems and old in villainy permit us try his stubborness against the tortures force  prisoner o gentle lady by your lords dear life which these weak hands i swear did never assail and by your childrens welfare spare my age let not the iron tear my ancient joints and my gray hairs bring to the grave with pain  lady randolph account for these thine own they cannot be for these i say be steadfast to the truth detected falsehood is most certain death  anna removes the servants and returns prisoner alas i am fore beset let never man for sake of lucre sin against his soul eternal justice is in this most just i guiltless now must former guilt reveal  lady randolph o anna hear  once more i charge thee speak the truth direct for these to me foretell and certify a part of thy narration with which if the remainder tallies not an instant and a dreadful death abides thee  prisoner then thus adjurd i will speak to you as just as if you were the minister of heaven sent down to search the secret sins of men some eighteen years ago i rented land of brave sir malcolm then balarmos lord but falling to decay his servants seized all that i had and then turned me and mine four helpless infants and their weeping mother out to the mercy of the winter winds a little hovel by the rivers side received us there hard labor and the skill in fishing which was formerly my sport supported life whilst thus we poorly lived one stormy night as i remember well the wind and rain beat hard upon our roof red came the river down and loud and often the angry spirit of the water shrickd at the dead hour of night was heard the cry of one in jeopardy i rose and ran to where the circling eddy of a pool beneath the ford used often to bring within my reach whatever floating thing the stream had caught the voice was ceased the person lost but looking sad and earnest on the waters by the moons light i saw whirled round and round a basket soon i drew it to the bank and nestled curious there an infant lay  lady randolph was he alive  prisoner he was  lady randolph inhuman that thou art how could thou kill what waves and tempests spared  prisoner i am not so inhuman  lady randolph did thou not  anna my noble mistress you are moved too much this man has not the aspect of stern murder let him go on and you i hope will hear good tidings of your kinsmans long lost child  prisoner the needy man who has known better days one whom distress has spited at the world is he whom tempting fiends would pitch upon to do such deeds as makes the prosperous men lift up their hands and wonder who could do them and such a man was i a man declined who saw no end of black adversity yet for the wealth of kingdoms i would not have touched that infant with a hand of harm  lady randolph ha do thou say so then perhaps he lives  prisoner not many days ago he was alive  lady randolph o god of heaven did he then die so lately  prisoner i did not say he died i hope he lives not many days ago these eyes beheld him flourishing in youth and health and beauty  lady randolph where is he now  prisoner alas i know not where  lady randolph oh fate i fear thee still thou riddler speak direct and clear else i will search thy soul  anna permit me ever honored keen impatience though hard to be restrained defeats itself  pursue thy story with a faithful tongue to the last hour that thou did keep the child  prisoner fear not my faith though i must speak my shame within the cradle where the infant lay was stowed a mighty store of gold and jewels tempted by which we did resolve to hide from all the world this wonderful event and like a peasant breed the noble child that none might mark the change of our estate we left the country traveled to the north bought flocks and herds and gradually brought forth our secret wealth but gods allseeing eye beheld our avarice and smote us sore for one by one all our own children died and he the stranger sole remained the heir of what indeed was his fain then would i who with a fathers fondness loved the boy have trusted him now in the dawn of youth with his own secret but my anxious wife foreboding evil never would consent mean while the stripling grew in years and beauty and as we often observed he bore himself not as the offspring of our cottage blood for nature will break out mild with the mild but with the froward he was fierce as fire and night and day he talked of war and arms i set myself against his warlike bent but all in vain for when a desperate band of robbers from the savage mountains came   lady randolph eternal providence what is thy name  prisoner my name is norval and my name he bears  lady randolph it is he it is he himself it is my son o sovereign mercy twas my child i saw no wonder anna that my bosom burned  anna just are your transports never was womans heart proved with such fierce extremes high fated dame but yet remember that you are beheld by servile eyes your gestures may be seen impassioned strange perhaps your words oerheard  lady randolph well do thou counsel anna heaven bestow on me that wisdom which my state requires  anna the moments of deliberation pass and soon you must resolve this useful man must be dismissed in safety ever my lord shall with his brave deliverer return  prisoner if i amidst astonishment and fear have of your words and gestures rightly judged thou art the daughter of my ancient master the child i rescued from the flood is thine  lady randolph with thee dissimulation now were vain i am indeed the daughter of sir malcolm the child thou rescudst from the flood is mine  prisoner blessed be the hour that made me a poor man my poverty has saved my masters house  lady randolph thy words surprise me sure thou do not feign the tear stands in thine eye such love from thee sir malcolms house deserved not if aright thou toldst the story of thy own distress  prisoner sir malcolm of our barons was the flower the fastest friend the best and kindest master but ah he knew not of my sad estate after that battle where his gallant son your own brave brother fell the good old lord grew desperate and reckless of the world and never as he erst was wont went forth to overlook the conduct of his servants by them i was thrust out and them i blame may heaven so judge me as i judged my master and god so love me as i love his race  lady randolph his race shall yet reward thee on thy faith depends the fate of thy loved masters house remembrest thou a little lonely hut that like a holy hermitage appears among the clifts of carron  prisoner i remember the cottage of the clifts  lady randolph it is that i mean there dwells a man of venerable age who in my fathers service spent his youth tell him i sent thee and with him remain till i shall call upon thee to declare before the king and nobles what thou now to me have told no more but this and thou shall live in honor all thy future days thy son so long shall call thee father still and all the land shall bless the man who saved the son of douglas and sir malcolms heir remember well my words if thou should meet him whom thou callst thy son still call him so and mention nothing of his nobler father  prisoner fear not that i shall mar so fair an harvest by putting in my sickle ere it is ripe why did i leave my home and ancient dame to find the youth to tell him all i knew and make him wear these jewels in his arms which might i thought be challenged and so bring to light the secret of his noble birth  lady randolph goes toward the servants lady randolph this man is not thassassin you suspected though chance combined some likelyhoods against him he is the faithful bearer of the jewels to their right owner whom in haste he seeks it is meet that you should put him on his way since your mistaken zeal has dragged him hither  exeunt stranger and servants

burning arms spurned the low dunghill where his fate had thrown him and towerd up to the region of his sire  anna how fondly did your eyes devour the boy mysterious nature with the unseen cord of powerful instinct drew you to your own  lady randolph the ready story of his birth believed suppressed my fancy quite nor did he owe to any likeness my so sudden favor but now i long to see his face again examine every feature and find out the lineaments of douglas or my own but most of all i long to let him know who his true parents are to clasp his neck and tell him all the story of his father  anna with wary caution you must bear yourself in public lest your tenderness break forth and in observers stir conjectures strange for if a cherub in the shape of woman should walk this world yet defamation would like a vile cur bark at the angels train  today the baron started at your tears  lady randolph he did so anna well thy mistress knows if the least circumstance mote of offense should touch the barons eye his sight would be with jealousy disordered but the more it does behove me instant to declare the birth of douglas and assert his rights this night i purpose with my son to meet reveal the secret and consult with him for wise he is or my fond judgment errs as he does now so looked his noble father arrayed in natures ease his mien his speech were sweetly simple and full often deceived those trivial mortals who seem always wise but when the matter matched his mighty mind uprose the hero on his piercing eye sat observation on each glance of thought decision followed as the thunderbolt pursues the flash  anna that demon haunts you still behold glenalvon  lady randolph now i shun him not this day i braved him in behalf of norval perhaps too far at least my nicer fears for douglas thus interpret  enter glenalvon glenalvon noble dame the hovering dane at last his men has landed no band of pirates but a mighty host that come to settle where their valor conquers to win a country or to lose themselves  lady randolph but whence comes this intelligence glenalvon  glenalvon a nimble courier sent from yonder camp to hasten up the chieftains of the north informed me as he past that the fierce dane had on the eastern coast of lothian landed near to that place where the searock immense amazing bass looks over a fertile land  lady randolph then must this western army march to join the warlike troops that guard edenas towers  glenalvon beyond all question if impairing time has not effaced the image of a place once perfect in my breast there is a wild which lies to westward of that mighty rock and seems by nature formed for the camp of waterwafted armies whose chief strength lies in firm foot unflankd with warlike horse if martial skill directs the danish lords there inaccessible their army lies to our swift scowring horse the bloody field must man to man and foot to foot be fought  lady randolph how many mothers shall bewail their sons how many widows weep their husbands slain ye dames of denmark even for you i feel who sadly sitting on the seabeat shore long look for lords that never shall return  glenalvon often has thunconquerd caledonian sword

vice abashed flies it is own colors and goes over to virtue i am your convert time will show how truly yet one immediate proof i mean to give that youth for whom your ardent zeal today somewhat too haughtily defied your slave amidst the shock of armies i will defend and turn death from him with a guardian arm sedate by use my bosom maddens not at the tumultuous uproar of the field  lady randolph

disgusts they little know mankind who doubt it is operation it is my key and opes the wicket of the human heart how far i have succeeded now i know not yet i incline to think her stormy virtue is lulled awhile it is her alone i fear whilst she and randolph live and live in faith and amity uncertain is my tenure fate over my head suspends disgrace and death by that weak hair a peevish females

discourse of war and in such terms as i oerheard to day war is no village science nor it is phrase a language taught amongst the shepherd swains  norval small is the skill my lord delights to praise in him he favors  hear from whence it came beneath a mountains brow the most remote and inaccessible by shepherds trod in a deep cave dug by no mortal hand a hermit lived a melancholy man who was the wonder of our wandering swains austere and lonely cruel to himself did they report him the cold earth his bed water his drink his food the shepherds alms i went to see him and my heart was touched with reverence and pity mild he spoke and entering on discourse such stories told as made me often revisit his sad cell for he had been a soldier in his youth and fought in famous battles when the peers of europe by the bold godfredo led against the usurping infidel displayed the cross of christ and won the holy land pleased with my admiration and the fire his speech struck from me the old man would shake his years away and act his young encounters then having showed his wounds he would sit him down and all the livelong day discourse of war to help my fancy in the smooth green turf he cut the figures of the marshalled hosts described the motions and explained the use of the deep column and the lengthened line the square the crescent and the phalanx firm for all that saracen or christian knew of wars vast art was to this hermit known  lord randolph why did this soldier in a desert hide those qualities that should have graced a camp  norval that too at last i learned unhappy man returning homewards by messinas port loaded with wealth and honors bravely won a rude and boisterous captain of the sea fastened a quarrel on him fierce they fought the stranger fell and with his dying breath declared his name and lineage mighty god the soldier cried my brother oh my brother  lady randolph his brother  norval yes of the same parents born his only brother they exchanged forgiveness and happy in my mind was he that died for many deaths has the survivor suffered in the wild desert on a rock he sits or on some nameless streams untrodden banks and ruminates all day his dreadful fate at times alas not in his perfect mind holds dialogues with his loved brothers ghost and often each night forsakes his sullen couch to make sad orisons for him he slew  lady randolph to what mysterious woes are mortals born in this dire tragedy were there no more unhappy persons did the parents live  norval no they were dead kind heaven had closed their eyes before their son had shed his brothers blood  lord randolph hard is his fate for he was not to blame there is a destiny in this strange world which often decrees an undeserved doom let schoolmen tell us why  from whence these

randolph arise my son in me thou do behold the poor remains of beauty once admired the autumn of my days is come already for sorrow made my summer haste away yet in my prime i equaled not thy father his eyes were like the eagles yet sometimes liker the doves and as he pleased he won all hearts with softness or with spirit awed  norval how did he fall sure twas a bloody field when douglas died o i have much to ask  lady randolph hereafter thou shall hear the lengthened tale of all thy fathers and thy mothers woes at present this thou art the rightful heir of yonder castle and the wide domains which now lord randolph as my husband holds but thou shall not be wronged i have the power to right thee still before the king i will kneel and call lord douglas to protect his blood  norval the blood

attended douglas too long have thou been deemed a peasants child the wanton heir of some inglorious chief perhaps has scorned thee in the youthful sports whilst thy indignant spirit swelled in vain such contumely thou no more shall bear but how i purpose to redress thy wrongs must be hereafter told prudence directs that we should part before yon chiefs return retire and from thy rustic followers hand receive a billet which thy mothers care anxious to see thee dictated before this casual opportunity arose of private conference it is purport mark for as i there appoint we meet again leave me my son and frame thy manners still to norvals not to noble douglas state  norval i will remember where is norval now that good old man  lady randolph at hand concealed he lies an useful witness but

randolph yet this distinguished dame invites a youth the acquaintance of a day alone to meet her at the midnight hour this assignation shows a letter the assassin freed her manifest affection for the youth might breed suspicion in a husbands brain whose gentle consort all for love had wedded much more in mine matilda never loved me let no man after me a woman wed whose heart he knows he has not though she brings a mine of gold a kingdom for her dowry for let her seem like the nights shadowy queen cold and contemplative  he cannot trust her she may she will bring shame and sorrow on him the worst of sorrow and the worst of shames  glenalvon yield not my lord to such afflicting thoughts but let the spirit of an husband sleep till your own senses make a sure conclusion this billet must to blooming norval go at the next turn awaits my trusty spy i will give it him refitted for his master in the close thicket take your secret stand the moon shines bright and your own eyes may judge of their behavior  lord randolph thou do counsel well  glenalvon permit me now to make one slight essay of all the trophies which vain mortals boast by wit by valor or by wisdom won the first and fairest in a young mans eye is womans captive heart successful love with glorious fumes intoxicates the mind and the proud conqueror in triumph moves airborn exalted above vulgar men  lord randolph and what avails this maxim  glenalvon much my lord withdraw a little i will accost young norval and with ironical derisive counsel explore his spirit if he is no more than humble norval by thy favor raised brave as he is he will shrink astonished from me but if he be the favorite of the fair loved by the first of caledonias dames he will turn upon me as the lion turns upon the hunters spear  lord randolph it is shrewdly thought  glenalvon when we grow loud draw near but let my lord his rising wrath restrain  exit randolph manet glenalvon it is strange by heaven that she should run full tilt her fond career to one so little known she too that seemed pure as the winter stream when ice embossed whitens it is course even i did think her chaste whose charity exceeds not precious sex whose deeds lascivious pass glenalvons thoughts norval appears his port i love he is in a proper mood to chide the thunder if at him it roared has norval seen the troops  norval the setting sun with yellow radiance lightened all the vale and as the warriors moved each polished helm corslet or spear glanced back his gilded beams the hill they climbed and halting at it is top of more than mortal size towering they seemed an host angelic clad in burning arms  glenalvon thou talk it well no leader of our host in sounds more lofty speaks of glorious war  norval if i shall ever acquire a leaders name my speech will be less ardent novelty now prompts my tongue and youthful admiration vents itself freely since no part is mine of praise pertaining to the great in arms  glenalvon you wrong yourself brave sir your martial deeds have ranked you with the great but mark me norval lord randolphs favor now exalts your youth above his veterans of famous service let me who know these soldiers counsel you give them all honor seem not to command else they will scarcely brook your late sprung power which nor alliance props nor birth adorns  norval sir i have been accustomed all my days to hear and speak the plain and simple truth and though i have been told that there are men who borrow friendships tongue to speak their scorn yet in such language i am little skilled therefore i thank glenalvon for his counsel although it sounded harshly why remind me of my birth obscure why slur my power with such contemptuous terms  glenalvon i did not mean to gall your pride which now i see is great  norval my pride  glenalvon suppress it as you wish to prosper your prides excessive yet for randolphs sake i will not leave you to it is rash direction if thus you swell and frown at highborn men will highborn men endure a shepherds scorn  norval a shepherds scorn  glenalvon yes if you presume to bend on soldiers these disdainful eyes as if you took the measure of their minds and said in secret youre no match for me what will become of you  norval if this were told  aside have thou no fears for thy presumptuous self  glenalvon ha do thou threaten me  norval did thou not hear  glenalvon unwillingly i did a nobler foe had not been questioned thus but such as thee   norval whom do thou think me  glenalvon norval  norval so i am  and who is norval in glenalvons eyes  glenalvon a peasants son a wandering beggarboy at best no more even if he speaks the truth  norval false as thou art do thou suspect my truth  glenalvon thy truth you are all a lie and false as hell is the vainglorious tale thou toldst to randolph  norval if i were chained unarmed and bedrid old perhaps i should revile but as i am i have no tongue to rail the humble norval is of a race who strive not but with deeds did i not fear to freeze thy shallow valor and make thee sink too soon beneath my sword i would tell thee  what thou art i know thee well  glenalvon do thou not know glenalvon born to

timely known had raised thee far above the villains snare oh i am punished now these are the hairs that should have strewn the ground and not the locks of douglas  tears his hair and throws himself upon the ground lord randolph i know thee now thy boldness i forgive my crest is fallen for thee i will appoint a place of rest if grief will let thee rest i will reward although i cannot punish cursed cursed glenalvon he escaped too well though slain and baffled by the hand he hated foaming with rage and fury to the last cursing his conqueror the felon died  enter anna anna my lord my lord  lord randolph speak i can hear of horror  anna horror indeed  lord randolph matilda  anna is no more she ran she flew like lightning up the hill nor halted till the precipice she gained beneath whose lowering top the river falls ingulphd in rifted rocks thither she came as fearless as the eagle lights upon it and headlong down   lord randolph twas i alas twas i that filled her breast with fury drove her down the precipice of death wretch that i am  anna o had you seen her last despairing look upon the brink she stood and cast her eyes down on the deep then lifting up her head and her white hands to heaven seeming to say why am i forced to this she plunged herself into the empty air  lord randolph i will not vent in vain complaints the passion of my soul peace in this world i never can enjoy these wounds the gratitude of randolph gave they speak aloud and with the voice of fate denounce my doom i am resolved i will go straight to the battle where the man that makes me turn aside must threaten worse than death thou faithful to thy mistress take this ring full warrant of my power let every rite with cost and pomp upon their funerals wait for randolph hopes he never shall return  finis epilogue spoken by mr barry an epilogue i asked but not one word our bard will write he vows it is most absurd with comic wit to contradict the strain of tragedy and make your sorrows vain sadly he says that pity is the best and noblest passion of the human breast for when its sacred streams the heart oerflow in gushes pleasure with the tide of woe and when its waves retire like those of nile they leave behind them such a golden soil that there the virtues without culture grow there the sweet blossoms of affection blow these were his words void of delusive art i felt them for he spoke them from his heart nor will i now attempt with witty folly to chase away celestial melancholy
