an elegy written on saint marks eve        hom iliad   london printed for m cooper in paternoterrow mdccliv  an elegy written on saint marks eve fraught with malicious storm a louring cloud disrobes the firmament that glowed with light while from yon rainbeat porch the raven loud ushers with hideous shriek the startled night the spider ticking from the fretted wall and humming beetle sing their drowsy knell the sightless batts a shrill assembly call and dire events in dismal sounds foretell to this lone waste this dark and dreary vale where mouldering sleeps the onceinspired clay if so i read aright the gossip tale each destined shade directs its gloomy way how some the churlish and rough whirlwind ride mingling lve learnt amid the village throng others like sailing meteors nimbly glide or stalk slowpaced the thickstrewd tombs among each as her mind presents the varied shape with greedy horror tells her heedful friend she over the blue and glimring lamp agape feels every magic hair to start an end warned by that dying flame at length to part each trembling guest slips to her several bed whilst i fond swain bewail a slighted heart and breathe my sorrows to the senseless dead but thou that hauntst the cloistercircled tower echo i ween do hear my wailing moan for sure as comes this sad and secret hour thy illtimed sympathy returns each groan thou too pale cypress whose forewarning leaf strews the dull mansions of the intombed dead say is it then in friendship to my grief thou pointst where soon shall rest this witless head yet for you are wont my humble brow to crown and eke my pipe thy wreathed bows sustain if chance my fate should reach some shepherd clown tell for you know the story of my pain nor may thy bark its many a wound abide the name which marreth us shall ruin thee nor shall the wise this simple talk deride can i find ought more stonydeaf than she though the proud trunk heavens full despite does brave nathless it yields to the subtle wind though the rock frown the patient prostrate wave by long assault does sure admittance find yet she unmoved my mournful sigh can hear and sterner than the knotted oak remain yet she remorseless sees my falling tear and less than lifeless flint regards my pain but strait the sluggish hemlock springing round wafts to my slumbering sense the loaded gale while night who now bad hush each ruder sound soft over my temples spreads her sable veil the balmy influence of longlacked sleep to sweet oblivion lulls my soothed breast the winds that erst did lash that vexed deep the storm of raging troubles sinks to rest o sleep how near to death art thou allied o death what art thou but a longer dream nor wot i of the ill that can betide when thou so still and so serene do seem strange sights oppress my fancys wakeful eye a ghastly troop of meager ghosts appear there one in pensive plight i do espy to close with uncouth gait the creeping rear oh then thou spirit forlorn instruct me soon why shrinks my soul at thy particlar sight say why thou visitst thus the paly moon doubling the native horrors of the night still in the most dejected front i see some struggling spark some faint upholding ray alas why comes not the same hope to thee thy mein is sadness and thy look dismay at this he waves his head and strikes his breast and thrice in piteous sort he does assay the eloquence of woe bespeaks the rest and stops the faultring accent on its way at length  i warn thee mark you cheerless train know ere this eve returns to each is given or to endure the fierce assault of pain or freely tread the starpavd courts of heaven see many a faded cheek and furrowed brow that witness dire dismay and lost estate what soul so confident but fears to know that righteous sentence which must seal its fate the mimic tyrant whose contemptuous mind never smiled in pity on the wretch beneath at the last hour in serious truth shall find no flattery in the chill embrace of death awhile he stood in lawless power unharmd what power shall screen him at that vengeful time when every eye shall wake each hand be armed to shame his folly and correct his crime what though the pageantry of labored woe should bid the marble rise to solemn pride such the false grandeur of its bootless show it gilds the glittering slave it meant to hide the ruddy swain who leaves his quiet sleep chiding with early song the lingering dawn whose sober care directs the trooping sheep or to the willowy brook or pasturd lawn to whom as mindful of his lowly birth nature an universal blank has given soon when he quits this dull unfriendly earth shall rest approved by the voice of heaven for his poor steps would never presume to tread those muchworn paths where nobler feet had been dared not to follow where they boldly led but left to greater souls the privilege to sin the charms of wit the joys of youth shall fade and beautys early bloom shall withered be a killing blast shall strike the unwary maid that heart will bleed though now it tortures thee the noise of sports the luxury of dress all giddy gay desires shall wear away each splendid vanity forget to bless and she all wan with wasting grief decay for neither titled fame nor hoarded wealth nor beautys early bloom has power to save nor sober industry nor ruddy health can hold one victim from the untimely grave but idly sure the needful time we spend while as more weighty words i should impart o let thy reasons dearest thought attend and read the awakning lesson to thine heart far be thy customd place where yonder steep high overarchd surveys the distant stream think what a giddy height it is to leap think and beware nor slight your warning dream to cleave the yielding unsubstantial air  to light transfixt upon the pointed rock  o think  yet if thy steady sense can dare to meet with welcome hail this mortal shock too soon thou will regret thine evil plight that spirit however resolved must needs be grieved when hells dread regions open to the sight regions which eye never saw nor heart conceived and well i ween the wretch whoever he be that swims that gulf shall never pass it more it is a merciless and thwarting sea that never will waft him to the onceleft shore then rue the hapless while thou foolish swain when thou wast trapped by those witching eyes it is the galled conscience gives the pain that fell insatiate worm that never dies to the gross mould from whence it did begin after short time the kindred clay returns while the more active light which shines within the unexhausted lamp for ever burns that quickening portion of the spirit divine shall surely last through endless time to come nor seek her airy motions to confine within the shallow limits of the tomb perchance some fury like this scornful fair may haunt thy walks and every step attend clothed in each frown the same she may appear save this a mortal that a deathless fiend yet worthless as i am i do not mean with curious and affrontive zeal to pry where heaven has drawn its curtain over the scene and shut the clouded prospect from mine eye this only and important truth i learn when the last trump shall wake the lazy dead no vain pretense no trifling fond concern shall rouse the shrouded sinner from his bed hence then and mingle in the mirthful train with them resume thy longneglected crook awake to sprightly stop the pipe again cheer thy sad heart and smooth thy loveworn look if so thine hallowed soul thou ever did love as heaven in gentle mercy leans to thee if there be damned below or saints above if thou art mocked of her or mourned of me if ought can move thee  fly the wily snare that may seduce thee to this fearful end when strait dissolving in the viewless air awake he cries bestir thee and amend finis
