persian eclogues written originally for the entertainment of the ladies of tauris and now first translated etc  quod si non hic tantas fructus ostenderetur and si ex his studiis delectatis sola peteretur tamen ut opinor hanc animi remissionein humanissimam ac liberalissimam judicaretis cic pro arch poeta london printed for j roberts in warwick lane      price sixpence  the preface it is with the writings of mankind in some measure as with their complexions or their dress each nation has a peculiarity in all these to distinguish it from the rest of the world  the gravity of the spaniard and the levity of the frenchman are as evident in all their productions as in their persons themselves and the style of my countrymen is as naturally strong and nervous as that of an arabian or persian is rich and figurative  there is an elegancy and wildness of thought which recommends all their compositions and our geniuss are as much too cold for the entertainment of such sentiments as our climate is for their fruits and spices if any of these beauties are to be found in the following eclogues i hope my reader will consider them as an argument of their being original i received them at the hands of a merchant who had made it his business to enrich himself with the learning as well as the silks and carpets of the persians the little information i could gather concerning their author was that his name was mahamed and that he was a native of tauris  it was in that city that he died of a distemper fatal in those parts whilst he was engaged in celebrating the victories of his favorite monarch the great abbas as to the eclogues themselves they give a very just view of the miseries and inconveniences as well as the felicities that attend one of the finest countries in the east  the time of the writing them was probably in the beginning of sha sultan hosseyns reign the successor of sefi or solomon the second  whatever defects as i doubt not there will be many fall under the readers observation i hope his candor will incline him to make the following reflections  that the works of orientals contain many peculiarities and that through defect of language few european translators can do them justice  eclogue the first selim or the shepherds moral scene a valley near bagdat time the morning ye persian maids attend your poets lays and hear how shepherds pass their golden days not all are blessed whom fortunes hand sustains with wealth in courts nor all that haunt the plains well may your hearts believe the truths i tell it is virtue makes the bliss wherever we dwell thus selim sung by sacred truth inspired no praise the youth but here is alone desired wise in himself his meaning songs conveyed informing morals to the shepherd maid or taught the swains that surest bliss to find what groves nor streams bestow a virtuous mind when sweet and odorous like an eastern bride the radiant morn resumed her orient pride when wanton gales along the valleys play breathe on each flower and bear their sweets away by tigris wanderer waves he sat and sung this useful lesson for the fair and young ye persian dames he said to ye belong well may they please the morals of my song no fairer maids i trust than ye are found graced with soft arts the peopled world around the morn that lights you to your loves supplies each gentler ray delicious to your eyes for ye those flowers her fragrant hands bestow and yours the love that kings delight to know yet think not these all beauteous as they are the best kind blessings heaven can grant the fair who trust alone in beautys feeble ray the gulf of that name famous for the pearlfishery balsoras pearls have more of worth than they drawn from the deep they sparkle to the sight and allunconscious shoot a lustrous light such are the maids and such the charms they boast by sense unaided or to virtue lost selfflattering sex your hearts believe in vain that love shall blind when once he fires the swain or hope a lover by your faults to win as spots on ermin beautify the skin who seeks secure to rule be first her care each softer virtue that adorns the fair each tender passion man delights to find the loved perfections of a female mind blessed were the days when wisdom held her reign and shepherds sought her on the silent plain with truth she wedded in the secret grove the faireyed truth and daughters blessed their love o haste fair maids ye virtues come away sweet peace and plenty lead you on your way the balmy shrub for ye shall love our shore by ind excelled or araby no more ost to our fields for so the fates ordain he dear deserters shall return again o come thou modesty as they decree the rose may then improve her blush by thee here make thy court amidst our rural scene and shepherdgirls shall own thee for their queen with thee be chastity of all afraid distrusting all a wise suspicious maid but man the most not more the mountain do holds the swift falcon for her deadly foe cold is her breast like flowers that drink the dew a silken veil conceals her from the view no wild desires amidst thy train be known but faith whose heart is fixed on one alone desponding meekness with her downcast eyes and friendly pity full of tender sighs and love the last by these your hearts approve these are the virtues that must lead to love thus sung the swain and eastern legends say the maids of bagdat verified the lay dear to the plains the virtues came along the shepherds loved and selim blessed his song the end of the first eclogue eclogue the second hassan or the cameldriver scene the desert time midday in silent horror over the desartwaste the driver hassan with his camels past one cruise of water on his back he bore and his light scrip contained a scanty store a fan of painted feathers in his hand to guard his shaded face from scorching sand the sultry sun had gained the middle sky and not a tree and not an herb was nigh the beasts with pain their dusty way pursue shrill roared the winds and dreary was the view with desperate sorrow wild the affrighted man thrice sighed thrice struck his breast and thus began sad was the hour and luckless was the day when first from schiraz walls i bent my way ah little thought i of the blasting wind the thirst or pinching hunger that i find bethink thee hassan where shall thirst assuage when fails this cruise his unrelenting rage soon shall this scrip its precious load resign then what but tears and hunger shall be thine ye mute companions of my toils that bear in all my griefs a more than equal share here where no springs in murmurs break away or mosscrownd fountains mitigate the day in vain ye hope the green delights to know which plains more blessed or verdant vales bestow here rocks alone and tasteless sands are found and faint and sickly winds for ever howl around sad was the hour etc cursed be the gold and silver which persuade weak men to follow farfatiguing trade the lillypeace outshines the silver store and life is dearer than the golden ore yet money tempts us over the desert brown to every distant mart and wealthy town full often we tempt the land and often the sea and are we only yet repaid by thee ah why was ruin so attractive made or why fond man so easily betrayed why heed we not whilst mad we haste along the gentle voice of peace or pleasures song or wherefore think the flowery mountains side the fountains murmurs and the valleys pride why think we these less pleasing to behold than dreary deserts if they lead to gold sad was the hour etc o cease my fears all frantic as i go when thought creates unnumberd scenes of woe what if the lion in his rage i meet often in the dust i view his printed feet and fearful often when days declining light yields her pale empire to the mourner night by hunger roused he scours the groaning plain gaunt wolves and sullen tigers in his train before them death with shrieks directs their way fills the wild yell and leads them to their prey sad was the hour etc at that dead hour the silent asp shall creep if ought of rest i find upon my sleep or some swollen serpent twist his scales around and wake to anguish with a burning wound thrice happy they the wise contented poor from lust of wealth and dread of death secure they tempt no deserts and no griefs they find peace rules the day where reason rules the mind sad was the hour etc o hapless youth for she thy love has won the tender zara will be most undone big swelled my heart and owned the powerful maid when fast she dropped her tears as thus she said  farewell the youth whom sighs could not detain  whom zaras breaking heart implored in vain  yet as thou go may every blast arise  weak and unfelt as these rejected sighs  safe over the wild no perils may thou see  no griefs endure nor weep false youth like me o let me safely to the fair return say with a kiss she must not shall not mourn go teach my heart to lose its painful fears recalled by wisdoms voice and zaras tears he said and called on heaven to bless the day when back to schiraz walls he bent his way the end of the second eclogue eclogue the third abra or the georgian sultana scene a forest time the evening in georgias land where tefflis towers are seen in distant view along the level green while evening dews enrich the glittering glade and the tall forests cast a longer shade amidst the maids of zagens peaceful grove emyra sung the pleasing cares of love of abra first began the tender strain who led her youth with flocks upon the plain at morn she came those willing flocks to lead where lillies rear them in the watery mead from early dawn the livelong hours she told till late at silent eve she penned the fold deep in the grove beneath the secret shade a various wreath of odorous flowers she made that these flowers are found in very great abundance in some of the provinces of persia see the modern history of the ingenious mr salmon gaymotleyd pinks and sweet junquils she chose the violetblue that on the mossbank grows allsweet to sense the flaunting rose was there the finished chaplet welladornd her hair great abbas chanced that fated morn to stray by love conducted from the chase away among the vocal vales he heard her song and sought the vales and echoing groves among at length he found and wooed the rural maid she knew the monarch and with fear obeyed be every youth like royal abbas moved and every georgian maid like abra loved the royal lover bore her from the plain yet still her crook and bleating flock remain often as she went she backward turned her view and bad that crook and bleating flock adieu fair happy maid to other scenes remove to richer scenes of golden power and love go leave the simple pipe and shepherds strain with love delight thee and with abbas reign be every youth etc yet midst the blaze of courts she fixed her love on the cool fountain or the shady grove still with the shepherds innocence her mind to the sweet vale and flowery mead inclined and often as spring renewed the plains with flowers breathed his soft gales and led the fragrant hours with sure return she sought the sylvan scene the breezy mountains and the forests green her maids around her moved a duteous band each bore a crook allrural in her hand some simple lay of flocks and herds they sung with joy the mountain and the forest rung be every youth etc and often the royal lover left the care and thorns of state attendant on the fair often to the shades and lowroofd cots retired or sought the vale where first his heart was fired a russet mantle like a swain he wore and thought of crowns and busy courts no more be every youth etc blessed was the life that royal abbas led sweet was his love and innocent his bed what if in wealth the noble maid excel the simple shepherd girl can love as well let those who rule on persias jewelld throne be famed for love and gentlest love alone or wreath like abbas full of fair renown the lovers myrtle with the warriors crown oh happy days the maids around her say oh haste profuse of blessings haste away be every youth like royal abbas moved and every georgian maid like abra loved the end of the third eclogue eclogue the fourth agib and secander or the fugitives scene a mountain in circassia time midnight in fair circassia where to love inclined each swain was blessed for every maid was kind at that still hour when awful midnight reigns and none but wretches haunt the twilight plains what time the moon had hung her lamp on high and past in radiance through the cloudless sky sad over the dews two brother shepherds fled where wildring fear and desperate sorrow led fast as they pressed their flight behind them lay wide ravaged plains and valleys stole away along the mountains bending sides they ran till faint and weak secander thus began secander o stay thee agib for my feet deny no longer friendly to my life to fly friend of my heart o turn thee and survey trace our sad flight through all its length of way and first review that longextended plain and yon wide groves already past with pain yon ragged cliff whose dangerous path we tried and last this lofty mountains weary side  agib weak as thou art yet hapless must thou know the toils of flight or some severer woe still as i haste the tartar shouts behind and shrieks and sorrows load the sadning wind in rage of heart with ruin in his hand he blasts our harvests and deforms our land yon citron grove whence first in fear we came droops its fair honors to the conquering flame far fly the swains like us in deep despair and leave to ruffian bands their fleecy care  secander unhappy land whose blessings tempt the sword in vain unheard thou callst thy persian lord in vain thou courtst him helpless to thine aid to shield the shepherd and protect the maid far off in thoughtless indolence resigned soft dreams of love and pleasure sooth his mind midst fair sultanas lost in idle joy no wars alarm him and no fears annoy  agib yet these green hills in summers sultry heat have lent the monarch often a cool retreat sweet to the sight is zabrans flowery plain and once by maids and shepherds loved in vain no more the virgins shall delight to rove by sargis banks or irwans shady grove on tarkies mountain catch the cooling gale or breathe the sweets of alys flowery vale fair scenes but ah no more with peace possessed with ease alluring and with plenty blessed no more the shepherds whitning seats appear nor the kind products of a bounteous year no more the dale with snowy blossoms crowned but ruin spreads her baleful fires around  secander in vain circassia boasts her spicy groves for ever famed for pure and happy loves in vain she boasts her fairest of the fair their eyes blue languish and their golden hair those eyes in tears their fruitless grief must send those hairs the tartars cruel hand shall rend  agib ye georgian swains that piteous learn from far circassias ruin and the waste of war some weightier arms than crooks and staves prepare to shield your harvests and defend your fair the turk and tartar like designs pursue fixed to destroy and steadfast to undo wild as his land in native deserts bred by lust incited or by malice led the villain arab as he prowls for prey often marks with blood and wasting flames the way yet none so cruel as the tartar foe to death inured and nursed in scenes of woe  he said when loud along the vale was heard a shriller shriek and nearer fires appeared the affrighted shepherds through the dews of night wide over the moonlight hills renewed their flight the end of the fourth and last eclogue
