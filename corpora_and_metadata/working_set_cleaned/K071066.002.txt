pleasures and your pains v like thee in lowly sylvan scenes on riverbanks and flowery greens my muse delighted plays nor through the desert of the air though swans or eagles triumph there with fond ambition strays vi nor where the boding raven chants nor near the owls unhallowed haunts will she her cares employ but flies from ruins and from tombs from superstitions horrid glooms to daylight and to joy vii nor will she tempt the barren waste nor deigns the lurking strength to taste of any noxious thing but leaves with scorn to envys use the insipid nightshades baneful juice the nettles sordid sting viii from all which nature fairest knows the vernal blooms the summer rose she draws her blameless wealth and when the generous task is done she consecrates a double boon to pleasure and to health ode ii on the winter solstice mdccxl i the radiant ruler of the year at length his wintry goal attains soon to reverse the long career and northward bend his steady reins now piercing half potosis height prone rush the siery floods of light ripening the mountains silver stores while in some caverns horrid shade the panting indian hides his head and often the approach of eve implores ii but lo on this deserted coast how pale the sun how thick the air mustring his storms a sordid host lo winter desolates the year the fields resign their latest bloom no more the breezes waft perfume no more the streams in music roll but snows fall dark or rains resound and while great nature mourns around her griefs infect the human soul iii hence the loud citys busy throngs urge the warm bowl and splendid sire harmonious dances festive songs against the spiteful heaven conspire meantime perhaps with tender fears some villagedame the curfew hears while round the hearth her children play at morn their father went abroad the moon is sunk and deep the road she sighs and wonders at his stay iv but thou my lyre awake arise and hail the suns returning force even now he climbs the northern skies and health and hope attend his course then louder howl the aerial waste be earth with keener cold embraced yet gentle hours advance their wing and fancy mocking winters might with flowers and dews and streaming light already decks the newborn spring v o fountain of the golden day could mortal vows promote thy speed how soon before thy vernal ray should each unkindly damp recede how soon each hovering tempest fly whose stores for mischief arm the sky prompt on our heads to burst amain to rend the forest from the steep or thundering over the baltic deep to whelm the merchants hopes of gain vi but let not mans unequal views presume over nature and her laws it is his with grateful joy to use the indulgence of the sovran cause secure that health and beauty springs through this majestic frame of things beyond what he can reach to know and that heavens allsubduing will with good the progeny of ill attempreth every state below vii how pleasing wears the wintry night spent with the old illustrious dead while by the tapers trembling light i seem those awful scenes to tread where chiefs or legislators lie whose triumphs move before my eye in arms and antic pomp arrayed while now i taste the ionian song now bend to platos godlike tongue resounding through the olive shade viii but should some cheerful equal friend bid leave the studious page a while let mirth on wisdom then attend and social ease on learned toil then while at loves uncareful shrine each dictates to the god of wine her name whom all his hopes obey what flattering dreams each bosom warm while absence heightning every charm invokes the slowreturning may ix may thou delight of heaven and earth when will thy genial star arise the auspicious morn which gives thee birth shall bring eudora to my eyes within her sylvan haunt behold as in the happy garden old she moves like that primeval fair thither ye silversounding lyres ye tender smiles ye chaste desires fond hope and mutual faith repair x and if believing love can read his better omens in her eye then shall my fears o charming maid and every pain of absence die then shall my jocund harp attund to thy true ear with sweeter sound pursue the free horatian song old tyne shall listen to my tale and echo down the bordring vale the liquid melody prolong ode ii for the winter solstice december       0 this ode was afterward entirely altered as may be seen p    the reader will not be displeased to see it as it was originally written  i now to the utmost southern goal the sun has traced his annual way and backward now prepares to roll and bless the north with earlier day prone on potosis lofty brow floods of sublimer splendor flow ripening the latent seeds of gold whilst panting in the lonely shade the afflicted indian hides his head nor dares the blaze of noon behold ii but lo on this deserted coast how faint the light how chill the air lo armed with whirlwind hail and frost fierce winter desolates the year the fields resign their cheerful bloom no more the breezes breathe perfume no more the warbling waters roll deserts of snow fatigue the eye successive tempests bloat the sky and gloomy damps oppress the soul iii but let my drooping genius rise and hail the suns remotest ray now now he climbs the northern skies tomorrow nearer than today then louder howl the stormy waste by sand and ocean worse defaced yet brighter hours are on the wing and fancy through the wintry gloom radiant with dews and flowers in bloom already hails the emerging spring iv o fountain of the golden day could mortal vows but urge thy speed how soon before the vernal ray should each unkindly damp recede how soon each tempest hovering fly that now fermenting loads the sky prompt on our heads to burst amain to rend the forest from the steep and thundering over the baltic deep to whelm the merchants hopes of gain v but let not mans imperfect views presume to tax wise natures laws it is his with silent joy to use the indulgence of the sovereign cause secure that from the whole of things beauty and good consummate springs beyond what he can reach to know and that the providence of heaven has some peculiar blessing given to each allotted state below vi even now how sweet the wintry night spent with the old illustrious dead while by the tapers trembling light i seem the awful course to tread where chiefs and legislators lie whose triumphs move before my eye with every laurel fresh displayed while charmed i rove in classick song or bend to freedoms fearless tongue or walk the academick shade ode iii to a friend unsuccessful in love i indeed my phaedria if to find that wealth can female wishes gain had ever disturbed your thoughtful mind or cost one serious moments pain i should have said that all the rules you learned of moralists and schools were very useless very vain ii yet i perhaps mistake the case  say though with this heroic air like one that holds a nobler chase yu try the tender loss to bear does not your heart renounce your tongue seems not my censure strangely wrong to count it such a slight affair iii when hesper gilds the shaded sky often as you seek the wellknown grove methinks i see you cast your eye back to the morning scenes of love each pleasing word you heard her say her gentle look her graceful way again your struggling fany move iv then tell me is your soul entire does wisdom calmly hold her throne then can you question each desire bid this remain and that be gone no tear half starting from your eye no kindling blush you know not why no stealing sigh nor stifled groan v away with this unmanly mood see where the hoary churl appears whose hand has seized the favorite good which you reserved for happier years while side by side the blushing maid shrinks from his visage half afraid spite of the sickly joy she wears vi ye guardian powers of love and fame this chaste harmonious pair behold and thus reward the generous flame of all who barter vows for gold o bloom of youth o tender charms well buried in a dotards arms o equal price of beauty sold vii cease then to gaze with looks of love bid her adieu the venal fair unworthy she your bless to prove then wherefore should she prove your care no lay your myrtle garland down and let a while the willows crown with luckier omens bind your hair viii o just ecaped the faithless main though driven unwilling on the land to guide your favored steps again behold your better genius stand where truth revolves her page divine where virtue leads to honors shrine behold he lifts his awful hand ix fix but on these your ruling aim and time the sire of manly care will fancys dazzling colors tame a sobrer dress will beauty wear then shall esteem by knowledge led inthrone within your heart and head some happier love some truer fair ode iv affected indifference to the same i yes you contemn the perjured maid who all your favorite hopes betrayed nor though her heart should home return her tuneful tongue its falsehood mourn her winning eyes your faith implore would you her hand receive again or once dissemble your disdain or listen to the sirens theme or stoop to love since now esteem and confidence and friendship is no more ii yet tell me phaedria tell me why when summoning your pride you try to meet her looks with cool neglect or cross her walk with slight respect for so is falsehood best repaid whence do your cheeks indignant glow why is your struggling tongue so slow what means that darkness on your brow as if with all her broken vow you meant the fair apostate to upbraid ode v against suspicion i on fly it is dire suspicions mien and meditating plagues unseen the sorcress hither bends behold her torch in gall imbrued behold  her garment drops with blood of lovers and of friends ii fly far already in your eyes i see a pale suffusion rise and soon through every vein soon will her secret venom spread and all your heart and all your head imbibe the potent stain iii then many a demon will she raise to vex your sleep to haunt your ways while gleams of lost delight raise the dark tempest of the brain as lightning shines across the main through whirlwinds and through night iv no more can faith or candor move but each ingenuous deed of love which reason would applaud now smiling over her dark distress fancy malignant strives to dress like injury and fraud v farewell to virtues peaceful times soon will you stoop to act the crimes which thus you stoop to fear guilt follows guilt and where the train begins with wrongs of such a stain what horrors form the rear vi it is thus to work her baleful power suspicion waits the sullen hour of fretfulness and strife when care the infirmer bosom wrings or eurus waves his murky wings to damp the seats of life vii but come forsake the scene unblest which first beheld your faithful breast to groundless fears a prey come where with my prevailing lyre the skies the streams the groves conspire to charm your doubts away viii throned in the suns descending car what power unseen diffuseth far this tenderness of mind what genius smiles on yonder flood what god in whispers from the wood bids every thought be kind ix o thou whatever thy awful name whose wisdom our untoward frame with social love restrains thou who by fair affections ties givst us to double all our joys and half disarm our pains x let universal candor still clear as yon heavnreflecting rill preserve my open mind nor this nor that mans crooked ways one sordid doubt within me raise to injure humankind ode vi hymn to cheerfulness how thick the shades of evening close how pale the sky with weight of snows haste light the tapers urge the fire and bid the joyless day retire  alas in vain i try within to brighten the dejected scene while roused by grief these fiery pains tear the frail texture of my veins while winters voice that storms around and yon deep deathbells groaning sound renew my minds oppressive gloom till starting horror shakes the room is there in nature no kind power to sooth afflictions lonely hour to blunt the edge of dire disease and teach these wintry shades to please come cheerfulness triumphant fair shine through the hovering cloud of care o sweet of language mild of mien o virtues friend and pleasures queen assuage the flames that burn my breast compose my jarring thoughts to rest and while thy gracious gifts i feel my song shall all thy praise reveal as once it was in astreas reign the vernal powers renewed their train it happened that immortal love was ranging through the spheres above and downward hither cast his eye the years returning pomp to spy he saw the radiant god of day waft in his car the rosy may the fragrant airs and genial hours were shedding round him dews and flowers before his wheels aurora past and hespers golden lamp was last but fairest of the blooming throng when health majestic moved along delighted to survey below the joys which from her presence flow while earth enlivened hears her voice and swains and flocks and fields rejoice then mighty love her charms confessed and soon his vows inclined her breast and known from that auspicious morn the pleasing cheerfulness was born thou cheerfulness by heaven designed to sway the movements of the mind whatever fretful passion springs whatever wayward fortune brings to disarrange the power within and strain the musical machine thou coddess thy attempring hand does each discordant string command refines the soft and swells the strong and joining natures general song through many a varying tone unfolds the harmony of human souls fair guardian of domestic life kind banisher of homebred strife nor sullen lip nor taunting eye deforms the scene where thou art by no sickening husband damns the hour which bound his joys to female power no pining mother weeps the cares which parents waste on thankless heirs the officious daughters pleased attend the brother adds the name of friend by thee with flowers their board is crowned with songs from thee their walks resound and morn with welcome luster shines and evening unperceived declines is there a youth whose anxious heart labors with loves unpitied smart though now he stray by rills and bowers and weeping waste the lonely hours or if the nymph her audience deign debase the story of his pain with slavish looks discolored eyes and accents faltring into sighs yet thou auspicious power with ease can yield him happier arts to please inform his mien with manlier charms instruct his tongue with nobler arms with more commanding passion move and teach the dignity of love friend to the muse and all her train for thee i court the muse again the muse for thee may well exert her pomp her charms her fondest art who owes to thee that pleasing sway which earth and peopled heaven obey let melancholys plaintive tongue repeat what later bards have sung but thine was homers ancient might and thine victorious pindars flight thy hand each lesbian wreath attired thy lips sicilian reeds inspired thy spirit lent the glad perfume whence yet the stowrs of teos bloom whence yet from tiburs sabine vale delicious blows the enlivening gale while horace calls thy sportive choir heroes and nymphs around his lyre but see where yonder pensive sage a prey perhaps to fortunes rage perhaps by tender griefs oppressed or glooms congenial to his breast retires in desert scenes to dwell and bids the joyless world farewell alone he treads the autumnal shade alone beneath the mountain laid he sees the nightly damps ascend and gathering storms aloft impend he hears the neighboring surges roll and raging thunders shake the pole then struck by every object round and stunned by every horrid sound he asks a clue for natures ways but evil haunts him through the maze he sees ten thousand demons rise to wield the empire of the skies and chance and fate assume the rod and malice blot the throne of god  o thou whose pleasing power i sing thy lenient influence hither bring compose the storm dispel the gloom till nature wear her wonted bloom till fields and shades their sweets exhale and music swell each opening gale then over his breast thy sostness pour and let him learn the timely hour to trace the worlds benignant laws and judge of that presiding cause who founds on discord beautys reign converts to pleasure every pain subdues each hostile form to rest and bids the universe be blessed o thou whose pleasing power i sing if right i touch the votive string if equal praise i yield thy name still govern thou thy poets flame still with the muse my bosom share and sooth to peace intruding care but most exert thy pleasing power on friendships consecrated hour and while my sophron points the road to godlike wisdoms calm abode or warm in freedoms ancient cause traceth the source of albions laws add thou over all the generous toil the light of thy unclouded smile but if by fortunes stubborn sway from him and friendship torn away i court the muses healing spell for griefs that still with absence dwell do thou conduct my fancys dreams to such indulgent placid themes as just the struggling breast may cheer and just suspend the starting tear yet leave that sacred sense of woe which none but friends and lovers know ode vii on the use of poetry i not for themselves did humankind contrive the parts by heaven assigned on lifes wide scene to play not scipios force nor caesars skill can conquer glorys arduous hill if fortune close the way ii yet still the selfdepending soul though last and least in fortunes roll his proper sphere commands and knows what natures seal bestowed and sees before the throne of god the rank in which he stands iii who trained by laws the future age who rescued nations from the rage of partial factious power my heart with distant homage views content if thou celestial muse did rule my natal hour iv not far beneath the heros feet nor from the legislators seat stands far remote the bard though not with public terrors crowned yet wider shall his rule be found more lasting his award v lycurgus fashioned spartas fame and pompey to the roman name gave universal sway where are they  homers reverend page holds empire to the thirtieth age and tongues and climes obey vi and thus when williams acts divine no longer shall from bourbons line draw one vindictive vow when sidney shall with cato rest and russel move the patriots breast no more than brutus now vii yet then shall shakespeares powerful art over every passion every heart confirm his awful throne tyrants shall bow before his laws and freedoms glorys virtues cause their dread assertor own ode viii on leaving holland i   farewell to leydens lonely bound the belgian muses sober seat where dealing frugal gifts around to all the favorites at her feet she trains the bodys bulky frame for passive persevering toils and lest from any prouder aim the daring mind should scorn her homely spoils she breathes maternal fogs to damp its restless flame i   farewell the grave pacifick air where never mountain zephir blew the marshy levels lank and bare which pan which ceres never knew the naiads with obscene attire urging in vain their urns to flow while round them chant the croking choir and happily sooth some lovers prudent woe or prompt some restive bard and modulate his lyre i   farewell ye nymphs whom sober care of gain snatched in your cradles from the god of love she rendered all his boasted arrows vain and all his gifts did he in spite remove ye too the sloweyd fathers of the land with whom dominion steals from hand to hand unownd undignifyd by public choice i go where liberty to all is known and tells a monarch on his throne he reigns not but by her preserving voice ii   o my loved england when with thee shall i sit down to part no more far from this pale discolored sea that sleeps upon the reedy shore when shall i plough thy azure tide when on thy hills the flocks admire like mountain snows till down their side i trace the village and the sacred spire while bowers and copses green the golden slope divide ii   ye nymphs who guard the pathless grove ye blueeyd sisters of the streams with whom i wont at morn to rove with whom at noon i talked in dreams o take me to your haunts again the rocky spring the greenwood glade to guide my lonely footsteps deign to prompt my slumbers in the murmuring shade and sooth my vacant ear with many an airy strain ii   and thou my faithful harp no longer mourn thy drooping masters inauspicious hand now brighter skies and fresher gales return now fairer maids thy melody demand daughters of albion listen to my lyre o phoebus guardian of thaonian choir why sounds not mine harmonious as thy own when all the virgin deities above with venus and with juno move in concert round the olympian fathers throne iii   thee too protectress of my lays elate with whose majestic call above degenerate latiums praise above the slavish boast of gaul i dare from impious thrones reclaim and wanton sloths ignoble charms the honors of a poets name to somers counsels or to hamdens arms thee freedom i rejoin and bless thy genuine flame iii   great citizen of albion thee heroic valor still attends and useful science pleased to see how art her studious toil extends while truth diffusing from on high a luster unconfined as day fills and commands the public eye till pierced and sinking by her powerful ray tame faith and monkish awe like nightly demons fly iii   hence the whole land the patriots ardour shares hence dread religion dwells with social joy and holy passions and unsullied cares in youth in age domestic life employ o fair britannia hail  with partial love the tribes of men their native seats approve unjust and hostile to each foreign fame but when for generous minds and manly laws a nation holds her prime applause there public zeal shall all reproof disclaim ode ix to curio see the epistle to curio in this volume  mdccxliv i thrice has the spring beheld thy faded fame since i exulting grasped the tuneful shell eager through endless years to sound thy name proud that my memory with thine should dwell how have thou stained the splendor of my choice those godlike forms which hovered round thy voice laws freedom glory whither are they flown what can i now of thee to time report save thy fond country made thy impious sport her fortune and her hope the victims of thy own ii there are with eyes unmoved and reckless heart who saw thee from thy summit fall thus low who deemed thy arm extended but to dart the public vengeance on thy private foe but spite of every gloss of envious minds the owleyd race whom virtues luster blinds who sagely prove that each man has his price i still believed thy aim from blemish free i yet even yet believe it spite of thee and all thy painted pleas to greatness and to vice iii thou did not dream of liberty decayed nor wish to make her guardian laws more strong but the rash many first by thee misled bore thee at length unwillingly along rise from your sad abodes ye cursed of old for faith deserted or for cities sold own here one untried unexampled deed one mystery of shame from curio learn to beg the infamy he did not earn and scape in guilts disguise from virtues offered meed iv for saw we not that dangerous power avowed whom freedom often has found her mortal bane whom public wisdom ever strove to exclude and but with blushes suffreth in her train corruption vaunted her bewitching spoils over court over senate spread in pomp her toils and called herself the states directing soul till curio like a good magician tried with eloquence and reason at his side by strength of holier spells the enchantress to control v soon with thy countrys hope thy fame extends the rescued merchant often thy words resounds thee and thy cause the rural hearth defends his bowl to thee the grateful sailor crowns the learned recluse with awful zeal who read of grecian heroes roman patriots dead now with like awe does living merit scan while he whom virtue in his blessed retreat bad social ease and public passions meet ascends the civil scene and knows to be a man vi at length in view the glorious end appeared we saw thy spirit through the senate reign and freedoms friends thy instant omen heard of laws for which their fathers bled in vain waked in the strise the public genius rose more keen more ardent from his long repose deep through her bounds the city felt his call each crowded haunt was stirred beneath his power and murmuring challenged the deciding hour of that too vast event the hope and dread of all vii o ye good powers who look on humankind instruct the mighty moments as they roll and watch the fleeting shapes in curios mind and steer his passions steady to the goal o alfred father of the english name o valiant edward first in civil fame o william height of public virtue pure bend from your radiant seats a joyful eye behold the sum of all your labors nigh your plans of law complete your ends of rule secure viii twas then  o shame o soul from faith estranged o albion often to flattering vows a prey twas then  thy thought what sudden frenzy changed what rushing palsy took thy strength away is this the man in freedoms cause approved the man so great so honored so beloved whom the dead envied and the living blessed this patient slave by tinsel bonds allured this wretched suitor for a boon abjured whom those that feared him scorn that trusted him detest ix o lost alike to action and repose with all that habit of familiar fame sold to the mockry of relentless foes and doomed to exhaust the dregs of life in shame to act with burning brow and throbbing heart a poor deserters dull exploded part to slight the favor thou can hope no more renounce the giddy crowd the vulgar wind charge thy own lightness on thy countrys mind and from her voice appeal to each tame foreign shore x but englands sons to purchase thence applause shall never the loyalty of slaves pretend by courtly passions try the public cause nor to the forms of rule betray the end o race erect by manliest passions moved the labors which to virtue stand approved prompt with a lovers fondness to survey yet where injustice works her wilful claim fierce as the flight of joves destroying flame impatient to confront and dreadful to repay xi these thy heart owns no longer in their room see the grave queen of pageants honor dwell couched in thy bosoms deep tempestuous gloom like some grim idol in a sorcrers cell before her rites thy sickening reason flew divine persuasion from thy tongue withdrew while laughter mocked or pity stole a sigh can wit her tender movements rightly frame where the prime function of the foul is lame can fancys feeble springs the force of truth supply xii but come it is time strong destiny impends to shut thee from the joys thou have betrayed with princes filled the solemn fane ascends by infamy the mindful demon swayed there vengeful vows for guardian

for man ode x to the muse i queen of my songs harmonious maid ah why have thou withdrawn thy aid ah why forsaken thus my breast with inauspicious damps oppressed where is the dread prophetic heat with which my bosom wont to beat where all the bright mysterious dreams of haunted groves and tuneful streams that wooed my genius to divinest themes ii say goddess can the festal board or young olympias form adored say can the pomp of promised fame relume thy faint thy dying flame or have melodious airs the power to give one free poetic hour or from amid the elysian train the soul of milton shall i gain to win thee back with some celestial strain iii o powerful strain o sacred soul his numbers every sense control and now again my bosom burns the muse the muse herself returns such on the banks of tyne confessed i hailed the fair immortal guest when first she sealed me for her own made all her blissful treasures known and bad me swear to follow her alone ode xi on love to a friend i no foolish youth  to virtuous fame if now thy early hopes be vowed if true ambitions nobler flame command thy footsteps from the crowd lean not to loves enchanting snare his songs his words his looks beware nor join his votaries the young and fair ii by thought by dangers and by toils the wreath of just renown is worn nor will ambitions awful spoils the flowery pomp of ease adorn but love unbends the force of thought by love unmanly fears are taught and loves reward with gaudy sloth is bought iii yet thou have read in tuneful lays and heard from many a zealous breast the pleasing tale of beautys praise in wisdoms lofty language dressed of beauty powerful to impart each finer sense each comelier art and sooth and polish mans ungentle heart iv if then from loves deceit secure thus far alone thy wishes

harmonious tongue each bosom each desire commands apollos lute by hermes strung and touched by chaste minervas hands attend i feel a force divine o delia win my thoughts to thine that half the color of thy life is mine vi yet conscious of the dangerous charm soon would i turn my steps away nor often provoke the lovely harm nor lull my reasons watchful sway but thou my friend  i hear thy sighs alas i read thy downcast eyes and thy tongue salters and thy color flies vii so soon again to meet the fair so pensive all this absent hour  o yet unlucky youth beware while yet to think is in thy power in vain with friendships flattering name thy passion veils its inward shame friendship the treacherous fuel of thy flame viii once i remember new to love and dreading his tyrannick chain i sought a gentle maid to prove what peaceful joys in friendship reign whence we forsooth might safely stand and pitying view the lovesick band and mock the winged boys malicious hand ix thus frequent past the cloudless day to smiles and sweet discourse resigned while i exulted to survey one generous womans real mind till friendship soon my languid breast each night with unknown cares possessed

when the day which made us free shall next return that sacred feast thou better may observe with me with me the sulfurous treason old a far inferior part shall hold in that glad days triumphal strain and generous william be revered nor one untimely accent heard of james or his ignoble reign v then while the gascons fragrant wine with modest cups our joy supplies we ll truly thank the power divine

such was the chian fathers strain to many a kind domestic train whose pious hearth and genial bowl had cheered the reverend pilgrims soul when every hospitable rite with equal bounty to requite he struck his magic strings and poured spontaneous numbers forth and seized their ears with tales of ancient worth and filled their musing hearts with vast heroic things ii   stanza ii   lycurgus the lacedaemonian lawgiver brought into greece from asia minor the first complete copy of homers works  at plataea was fought the decifive battle between the persian army and the united militia of greece under pausanias and aristides  cimon the athenian erected a trophy in cyprus for two great victories gained on the same day over the persians by sea and land diodorus siculus has preserved the inscription which the athenians affixed to the consecrated spoils after this great success in which it is very remarkable that the greatness of the occasion has raised the manner of expression above the usual simplicity and modesty of all other ancient inscriptions it is this         the following translation is almost literal since first the sea from asias hostile coast divided europe and the god of war assailed imperious cities never yet at once among the waves and on the shore has such a labor been achievd by men who earth inhabit they whose arms the mes in cyprus felt pernicious they the same have won from skilful tire an hundred ships crowded with warriors asia groans in both her hands  smitten by the might of war   now often where happy spirits dwell where yet he tunes his charming shell often near him with applauding hands the genius of his country stands to listening gods he makes him known that man divine by whom were sown the seeds of grecian fame who first the race with freedom fired from whom lycurgus spartas sons inspired from whom placaean palms and cyprian trophies came ii   stanza ii   pindar was contemporary with aristides and cimon in whom the glory of ancient greece was at its height when xerxes invaded greece pindar was true to the common interest of his country though his fellowcitizens the thebans had sold themselves to the persian king in one of his odes he expresses the great distress and anxiety of his mind occasioned by the vast preparations of xerxes against greece  isthm viii in another he celebrates the victories of salamis plataea and himera  pyth i it will be necessary to add two or three other particulars of his life real or fabulous in order to explain what follows in the text concerning him first then he was thought to be so great a favorite of apollo that the priests of that deity allotted him a constant share of their offerings it was said of him as of some other illustrious men that at his birth a swarm of bees lighted on his lips and fed him with their honey it was also a tradition concerning him that pan was heard to recite his poetry and seen dancing to one of his hymns on the mountains near thebes but a real historical fact in his life is that the thebans imposed a large fine upon him on account of the veneration which he expressed in his poems for that heroic spirit shown by the people of athens in defense of the common liberty which his own fellowcitizens had shamefully betrayed and as the argument of this ode implies that great poetical talents and high sentiments of liberty do reciprocaily produce and assist each other so pindar is perhaps the most exemplary proof of this connection which occurs in history the thebans were remarkable in general for a slavish disposition through all the fortunes of their commonwealth at the time of its ruin by philip and even in its best state under the administration of pelopidas and epaminondas and every one knows they were no less remarkable for great dullness and want of all genius that pindar should have equally distinguished himself from the rest of his fellowcitizens in both these respects seems somewhat extraordinary and is scarce to be accounted for but by the preceding observation  o noblest happiest age when aristides ruled and cimon sought when all the generous fruits of homers page exulting pindar saw to full perfection brought o pindar ost shall thou be hailed of me not that apollo fed thee from his shrine not that thy lips drank sweetness from the be nor yet that studious of thy notes divine pan danced their measure with the sylvan throng but that thy song was proud to unfold what thy base rulers trembled to behold amid corrupted thebes was proud to tell the deeds of athens and the persian shame hence on thy head their impious vengeance fell but thou o faithful to thy fame the muses law did rightly know that who would animate his lays and other minds to virtue raise must feel his own with all her spirit glow iii   are there approved of later times whose verse adorned a tyrants octavianus caesar crimes who saw majestic rome betrayed and lent the imperial ruffian aid alas not one polluted bard no not the strains that mincius heard or tiburs hills replied dare to the muses ear aspire save that instructed by the grecian lyre with freedoms ancient notes their shameful task they hide iii   mark how the dread pantheon stands amid the domes of modern hands amid the toys of idle state how simply how severely great then turn and while each western clime presents her tuneful sons to time so mark thou

of england against salmasius see particularly the manner in which he himself speaks of that undertaking in the introduction to his reply to us  yet hence barbarick zeal his memory with unholy rage pursues while from these arduous cares of public weal she bids each bard begone and rest him with his muse o fool to think the man whose ample mind must grasp at all that yonder stars survey must join the noblest forms of every kind the worlds most perfect image to display can er his countrys majesty behold unmoved or cold o fool to deem that he whose thought must visit every theme whose heart must every strong emotion know inspired by nature or by fortune taught that he if happily some presumptuous foe with false ignoble science fraught shall spurn at freedoms faithful band that he their dear desence will shun or hide their glories from the sun or deal their vengeance with a womans hand iv   i care not that in arnos plain or on the sportive banks of seine from public themes the muses quire content with polished ease retire where priests studious head command where tyrants bow the warlike hand to vile ambitions aim say what can public themes assord save venal honors to an hateful lord reserved for angry heaven and scorned of honest fame iv   but here where freedoms equal throne to all her valiant sons is known where all are conscious of her carcs and each the power that rules him shares here let the bard whose dastard tongue leaves public arguments unsung bid public praise farewell let him to fitter climes remove far from the heros and the patriots love and lull mysterious monks to slumber in their cell iv   stanza iv   edward iii from whom descended henry hastings third earl of huntingdon by the daughter of the duke of clarence brother to edward iv  o hastings not to all can ruling heaven the same endowments lend yet still does nature to her offspring call that to one general weal their different powers they bend unenvious thus alone though strains divine inform the bosom of the muses son though with new honors the patricians line advance from age to age yet thus alone they win the suffrage of impartial fame the poets name he best shall prove whose lays the soul with noblest passions move but thee o progeny of heroes old thee to severer toils thy fate requires the fate which formed thee in a chosen mould the grateful country of thy sires thee to sublimer paths demand sublimer than thy sires could trace or thy own edward teach his race though gauls proud genius sank beneath his hand v   from rich domains and subject farms they led the rustic youth to arms and kings their stern achievements feared while private strife their banners reared but loftier scenes to thee are shown where empires wide established throne no private master fills where long foretold the people reigns where each a vassals humble heart disdains and judges what he sees and as he judges wills v   here be it thine to calm and guide the swelling democratick tide to watch the states uncertain frame and baffle factions partial aim but chiefly with determined zeal to quell that servile band who kneel to freedoms banished soes that monster which is daily found expert and bold thy countrys peace to wound yet dreads to handle arms nor manly counsel knows v   stanza v   at whittington a village on the edge of scarsdale in derbyshire the earls of devonshire and danby with the lord delamere privately concerted the plan of the revolution the house in which they met is at present a farmhouse and the country people distinguish the room where they sat by the name of the plotting parlour  it is highest heavens command that guilty aims should sordid paths pursue that what ensnares the heart should maim the hand and virtues worthless foes be false to glory too but look on freedom see through every age what labors perils griefs has she disdained what arms what regal pride what priestly rage have her dread offspring conquered or sustained for albion well have conquered let the strains of happy swains which now resound where scarsdales cliffs the swelling pastures bound bear witness there often let the farmer hail the sacred orchard which imbowrs his gate and show to strangers passing down the vale where cavndish booth and osborne sat when bursting from their countrys chain even in the midst of deadly harms of papal snares and lawless arms they planned for freedom this her noblest reign vi   this reign these laws this public care which nassau gave us all to share had never adorned the english name could fear have silenced freedoms claim but fear in vain attempts to bind those lofty efforts of the mind which social good inspires where men for this assault a throne each adds the common welfare to his own and each unconquered heart the strength of all acquires vi   say was it thus when late we viewed our fields in civil blood imbrued when fortune crowned the barbarous host and half the astonished isle was lost did one of all that vaunting train who dare affront a peaceful reign durst one in arms appear durst one in counsels pledge his life stake his luxurious fortunes in the strife or lend his boasted name his vagrant friends to cheer vi   yet hastings these are they who challenge to themselves thy countrys love the true the constant who alone can weigh what glory should demand or liberty approve but let their works declare them thy

from my brow the laurel wreath you claim to crown the rivals of your countrys fame what though the footsteps of my devious muse the measured walks of grecian art refuse or though the frankness of my

noblest part what age what clime could ever an ampler field for lofty thought for daring fancy yield i saw this england break the shameful bands forged for the souls of men by sacred hands i saw each

license of a railers tongue is what but seldom men obtain by sense or wit by prose or song a task for more herculean powers nor suited to the sacred hours of leisure in the muses bowers ii in bowers where laurel weds with palm the muse the blameless queen resides fair fame attends and wisdom calm her eloquence harmonious guides while shut for ever from her gate often trying still repining wait

above and what with one accord they said of wit in drooping age misled and warburtons officious aid v stanza v during mr popes war with theobald concanen and the rest of their tribe mr warburton the present lord bishop of gloucester did with great zeal cultivate their friendship having been introduced forsooth at the meetings of that respectable confederacy a favor which he afterward spoke of in very high terms of complacency and thankfulness at the same time in his intercourse with them he treated mr pope in a most contemptuous manner and as a writer without genius of the truth of these assertions his lordship can have no doubt if he recollects his own correspondence with concanen a part of which is still in being and will probably be remembered as long as any of this prelates writings  how virgil mourned the sordid fate to that melodious lyre assigned beneath a tutor who so late with midas and his rout combined by spiteful clamor to confound that very lyres enchanting sound though listening realms admired around vi how horace owned he thought the fire of his friend popes satirick line did farther fuel scarce require from such a militant divine how milton scorned the sophist vain who durst approach his hallowed strain with unwashd hands and lips profane vii then shakespeare debonnair and mild brought that strange comment forth to view conceits more deep he said and smiled than his own fools or madmen knew but thanked a generous friend above who did with free adventurous love such pageants from his tomb remove viii and if to pope in equal need the same kind office thou would pay then edwards all the band decreed that future bards with frequent lay should call on thy auspicious name from each absurd intruders claim to keep inviolate their fame ode viii to the author of memoirs of the house of brandenburgh      in the year      appeared a very splendid edition in  to of memoires pour servir a lhistoire de la maison de brandebourg a berlin et la

heaven with this command the world soon felt it and on high to williams ear with welcome joy did lock among the blessed unfold the rising hope of hoadleys name godolphin then confirmed the fame and summers when from earth he came and generous stanhope the fair sequel told ii   then drew the lawgivers around sires of the grecian name renowned and listening asked and wondering knew what private force could thus subdue the vulgar and the great combined could war with sacred folly wage could a whole nation disengage from the dread bonds of many an age and to new habits mould the public mind ii   for not a conquerors sword nor the strong powers to civil founders known were his but truth by faithful search explored and social sense like seed in genial plenty sown wherever it took root the

are thy fair fields athwart thy guardian prow no bold invaders foot shall tempt the strand  yet say my country will the waves and wind obey thee have thou all thy hopes resigned to the skys fickle faith the pilots wavering hand vi for oh may neither fear nor stronger love love by thy virtuous princes nobly won thee last of many wretched nations move with mighty armies stationd round the throne to trust thy safety then farewell the claims of freedom her proud records to the flames then bear an offering at ambitions shrine whatever thy ancient patriots dared demand from furious johns or

country      i thy verdant scenes o goulders hill once more i seek a languid guest with throbbing temples and with burdened breast once more i climb thy steep aerial way o faithful cure of oftreturning ill now call thy sprightly breezes round dissolve this rigid cough profound and bid the springs of life with gentler movement play ii how gladly mid the dews of dawn my weary lungs thy healing gale the balmy west or the fresh north inhale how gladly while my musing footsteps rove round the cool orchard or the sunny lawn awaked i stop and look to find what shrub perfumes the pleasant

gracious form appeared anew then first o heavenly muse unseen for many a day v in that soft pomp the tuneful maid shone like the golden star of love i saw her hand in careless measures move i heard sweet preludes dancing on her lyre while my whole frame the sacred sound obeyed new sunshine over my fancy springs new colors clothe external things and the last glooms of pain and sickly plaint retire vi o goulders hill by thee restored once more to this enlivened hand my harp which late resounded over the land the voice of glory solemn and severe my dorian harp shall now with mild accord to thee her joyful tribute pay and send a less ambitious lay of friendship and of love to greet thy masters ear vii for when within thy shady seat first from the sultry town he chose and the tired senates cares his wished repose then wast thou mine to me a happier home for social leisure where my welcome feet estranged from all the intangling ways in which the restless vulgar strays through natures simple paths with ancient faith might roam viii and while around his sylvan scene my dyson led the white winged hours often from the athenian academick bowers their sages came often heard our lingering walk the mantuan music warbling over the green and often did tullys reverend shade though much for liberty afraid with us of lettered ease or virtuous glory talk ix but other guests were on their way and reached ere long this favored grove even the celestial progeny of jove bright venus with her allsubduing son whose golden shaft most willingly obey the best and wisest as they came glad

albions daughters once the favorite fame o beautys only friend who givst her pleasing reverence to inspire who selfish bold desire do to esteem and dear affection turn alas of thee forlorn what joy what praise what hope can life pretend ii behold our youths in vain concerning nuptial happiness inquire our maids no more aspire the arts of bashful hymen to attain but with triumphant eyes and cheeks impassive as they move along ask homage of the throng the lover swears that in a harlots arms are found the selfsame charms and worthless and deserted lives and dies iii behold unblessed at home the father of the cheerless household mourns the night in vain returns for love and glad content at distance roam while she in whom his mind seeks refuge from the days dull task of cares to meet him she prepares through noise and spleen and all the gamesters art a listless harrassd heart where not one tender thought can welcome find iv twas thus along the shore of thames britannias guardian

her silver shield and thus her wrath revealed i watched her awful words and made them mine           end of book second miscellanies an epistle to curio curio was a young roman senator of distinguished rank and parts being profusely extravagant he soon dissipated a splendid fortune to supply the want of which he entered into the designs of caesar against the liberties of his country although he had formerly been a professed enemy to him cicero to whose care he had been committed upon his first entrance into the forum exerted himself to prevent his ruin but without effect and he became one of the first victims in the civil war this epistle was first published in the      when a celebrated patriot was supposed to have deserted the cause of his country the author afterward transformed it into the ode to curio a performance disgraceful only to its author says a celebrated writer the epistle which is too curious to be omitted we here give in its original form the ode is printed p    of this volume  thrice has the spring beheld thy faded fame and the fourth winter rises on thy shame since i exulting grasped the votive shell in sounds of triumph all thy praise to tell blessed could my skill through ages make thee shine and proud to mix my memory with thine but now the cause that waked my song before with praise with triumph crowns the toil no more if to the glorious man whose faithful cares nor quelled by malice nor relaxed by years had awed ambitions wild audacious hate and dragged at length corruption to her fate if every tongue its large applauses owed and wellearnd laurels every muse bestowed if public justice urged the high reward and freedom smiled on the devoted bard say then to him whose levity or lust laid all a peoples generous hopes in dust who taught ambition firmer heights of power and saved corruption at her hopeless hour does not each tongue its execrations owe shall not each muse a wreath of shame bestow and public justice fanctify the award and freedoms hand protect the impartial bard yet long reluctant i forbore thy name long watched thy virtue like a dying flame hung over each glimmering spark with anxious eyes and wished and hoped the light again would rise put since thy guilt still more entire appears since no art hides no supposition clears since vengeful slander now too sinks her blast and the first rage of partyhate is past calm as the judge of truth at length i come to weigh thy merits and pronounce thy doom so may my trust from all reproach be free and earth and time confirm the fair decree there are who say they viewed without amaze thy sad reverse of all thy former praise that through the pageants of a patriots name they pierced the foulness of thy secret aim or deemed thy arm exalted but to throw the public thunder on a private foe but i whose soul consented to thy cause who felt thy genius stamp its own applause who saw the spirits of each glorious age move in thy bosom and direct thy rage i scorned the ungenrous gloss of slavish minds the owleyd race whom virtues luster blinds spite of the learned in the ways of vice and all who prove that each man has his price i still believed thy end was just and free and yet even yet believe it  spite of thee even though thy mouth impure has dared disclaim urged by the wretched impotence of shame whatever filial cares thy zeal had paid to laws infirm and liberty decayed has begged ambition to forgive the show has told corruption thou were never her foe has boasted in thy countrys awful ear her gross delusion when she held thee dear how tame she followed thy tempestuous call and heard thy pompous tales and trusted all  rise from your sad abodes ye cursed of old for laws subverted and for cities sold paint all the noblest trophies of your guilt the oaths you perjured and the blood you spilt yet must you one untempted vileness own one dreadful palm reserved for him alone with studied arts his countrys praise to spurn to beg the infamy he did not earn to challenge hate when honor was his due and plead his crimes where all his virtue knew do robes of state the guarded heart enclose from each fair feeling human nature knows can pompous titles stun the enchanted ear to all that reason all that sense would hear else could thou ever desert thy sacred post in such unthankful baseness to be lost else could thou wed the emptiness of vice and yield thy glories at an idiots price when they who loud for liberty and laws in doubtful times had fought their countrys cause when now of conquest and dominion sure they ought alone to hold their fruits secure when taught by these oppression hid the face to leave corruption stronger in her place by silent spells to work the public fate and taint the vitals of the passive state till healing wisdom should avail no more and freedom loath to tread the poisoned shore then like some guardian god that slies to save the weary pilgrim from an instant grave whom sleeping and secure the guileful snake steals near and nearer through the peaceful brake then curio rose toward the public woe to wake the heedless and incite the slow against corruption liberty to arm and quell the enchantress by a mightier charm swift over the land the fair contagion lew and with thy countrys hopes thy honors grew thee patriot the patrician roof confessed thy powerful voice the rescued merchant blessed of thee with awe the rural hearth resounds the bowl to thee the grateful sailor crowns touched in the sighing shade with manlier sires to trace thy steps the lovesick youth aspires the learned recluse who often amazed had read of grecian heroes roman patriots dead with new amazement hears a living name pretend to share in such forgotten fame and he who scorning courts and courtly ways left the tame track of these dejected days the life of nobler ages to renew in virtues sacred from a monarchs view roused by thy labors from the blessed retreat where social ease and public passions meet again ascending treads the civil scene to act and be a man as thou had been thus by degrees thy cause superior grew and the great end appeared at last in view we heard the people in thy hopes rejoice we saw the senate bending to thy voice the friends of freedom hailed the approaching reign of laws for which our fathers bled in vain while venal faction struck with new dismay shrunk at their frown and selfabandond lay waked in the shock the public genius rose abashed and keener from his long repose sublime in ancient pride he raised the spear which slaves and tyrants long were wont to fear the city felt his call from man to man from street to street the glorious horror ran each crowded haunt was stirred beneath his power and murmuring challenged the deciding hour lo the deciding hour at

reason stole what spells unsinewd thy determined soul  is this the man in freedoms cause approved the man so great so honored so beloved this patient slave by tinsel chains allured this wretched suitor for a boon abjured this curio hated and despised by all who fell himself to work his countrys fall o lost alike to action and repose unknown unpitied in the worst of woes with all that conscious undissembled pride sold to the insults of a foe defied with all that habit of familiar same doomed to exhaust the dregs of life in shame the sole sad refuge of thy baffled art to act a

forgive me romans that i bear to smile when shameless mouths your majesty defile paint you a thoughless frantic headlong crew and cast their own impieties on you for witness freedom to whose sacred power my soul was vowed from reasons earliest hour how have i stood exulting to survey my countrys virtues opening in thy ray how with the sons of every foreign shore the more i matched them honored here is the more o race erect whose native strength of soul which kings nor priests nor sordid laws control bursts the tame round of animal affairs and seeks a nobler center for its cares intent the

mortal through a crowns disguise thence prompt alike with witty scorn to view fastidious grandeur lift his solemn brow or all awake at pitys soft command bend the mild ear and stretch the gracious hand thence large of heart from envy far removed when public toils to virtue stand approved not the young lover fonder to admire nor more indulgent the delighted sire yet high and jealous of their freeborn name fierce as the flight of joves destroying flame wherever oppression works her wanton sway proud to confront and dreadful to repay but if to purchase curios sage applause my country must with him renounce her cause quit with a slave the path a patriot trod bow the meek knee and kiss the regal rod then still ye powers instruct his tongue to rail nor let his zeal nor let his subject fail else ere he change the style bear me away to where the gracchi where the bruti the two brothers tiberius and caius gracchus lost their lives in attempting to introduce the only regulation that could give stability and good order to the roman republic  junius brutus founded the commonwealth and died in its defense stay o long revered and late resigned to shame if this uncourtly page thy notice claim when the loud cares of business are withdrawn nor welldrest beggars round thy footsteps fawn in that still thoughtful solitary hour when truth exerts her unresisted power breaks the false optics tinged with fortunes glare unlocks the breast and lays the passions bare then turn thy eyes on that important scene and ask thyself  if all be well within where is the heartfelt worth and weight of soul which labor could not stop nor fear control where the known dignity the stamp of awe which halfabashd the proud and venal saw where the calm triumphs of an honest cause where the delightful taste of just applause where the strong reason the commanding tongue on which the senate fired or trembling hung all vanished all are sold  and in their room couched in thy bosoms deep distracted gloom see the pale form of barbarous grandeur dwell like some grim idol in a sorcrers cell to her in chains thy dignity was led at her polluted shrine thy honor bled with blasted weeds thy awful brow she crowned thy powerful tongue with poisoned philters bound that baffled reason straight indignant flew and fair persuasion from her seat withdrew for now no longer truth supports thy cause no longer glory prompts thee to applause no longer virtue breathing in thy breast with all her conscious majesty confessed still bright and brighter wakes the almighty flame to rouse the feeble and the wilful tame and where she sees the catching glimpses roll spreads the strong blaze and all involves the soul but cold restraints thy conscious fancy chill and formal passions mock thy struggling will or if thy genius ever forget his chain and reach impatient at a nobler strain soon the sad bodings of contemptuous mirth shoot through thy breast and stab the generous birth till blind with smart from truth to frenzy tossed and all the tenor of thy reason lost perhaps thy anguish drains a real tear while some with pity some with laughter hear  can art alas or genius guide the head where truth and freedom from the heart are fled can lesser wheels repeat their native stroke when the prime function of the soul is broke but come unhappy man thy sates impend come quit thy friends if yet thou have a friend turn from the poor rewards of guilt like thine renounce thy titles and thy robes resign for see the hand of destiny displayed to shut thee from the joys thou have betrayed see the dire fane of infamy arise dark as the grave and spacious as the skies where from the first of time thy kindred train the chiefs and princes of the unjust remain eternal barriers guard the pathless road to warn the wanderer of the cursed abode but prone as whirlwinds scour the passive sky the heights surmounted down the steep they fly there black with frowns relentless time awaits and goads their footsteps to the guilty gates and still he asks them of their unknown aims evolves their secrets and their guilt proclaims and still his hands despoil them on the road of each vain wreath by

which they bear to the natural and to the moral world their origin is deduced from the first allegorical deities or powers of nature according to the doctrine of the old mythological poets concerning the generation of the gods and the rise of things they are then successively considered as giving motion to the air and exciting summer breezes as nourishing and beautifying the vegetable creation as contributing to the fullness of navigable rivers and consequently to the maintenance of commerce and by that means to the maritime part of military per next is represented their favorable influence upon health when assisted by rural exercise which introduces their connection with the art of physic and the happy effects of mineral medicinal springs lastly they are celebrated for the friendship which the muses  them and for the true inspiration which temperance only can receive in opposition to the enthusiasm of the more licentious poets  over yonder eastern hill the twilight pale walks forth from darkness and the god of day with bright astraea seated by his side waits yet to leave the ocean tarry nymphs ye nymphs ye blueeyd progeny of thames who now the mazes of this rugged heath

my lyre too far into the splendid hours of morn engage your audience my observant hand shall close the strain ere any sultry beam approach you to your subterranean haunts ye then may timely steal to pace with care the humid sands to loosen from the soil the bubbling sources to direct the rills to meet in wider channels or beneath some grottos dripping arch at height of noon to slumber sheltered from the burning heaven where shall my song begin ye nymphs or end wide is your praise and copious  first of things first of the lonely powers ere time arose were love and chaos love the fire of fate     love  elder than chaos hesiod in his theogony gives a different account and makes chaos the eldest of beings though he assigns to love neither father nor superior which circumstance is particularly mentioned by phaedrus in platos banquet as being observable not only in hesiod but in all other writers both of verse and prose and on the same occasion he cites a line from parmenides in which love is expressly styled the eldest of all the gods yet aristophanes in the birds affirms that chaos and night and erebus and tartarus were first and that love was produced from an egg which the sablewinged night deposited in the immense bosom of erebus but it must be observed that the love designed by this comic poet was always distinguished from the other from that original and selfexistent being the to on or agathon of plato and meant only the dioypgos or second person of the old grecian trinity to whom is inscribed an hymn among those which pass under the name of orpheus where he is called protogonos or the firstbegotten is said to have been born of an egg and is represented as the principal or origin of all these external appearances of nature in the fragments of orpheus collected by henry stephens he is named phanes the discoverer or discloser who unfolded the ideas of the supreme intelligence and exposed them to the perception of inferior beings in this visible frame of the world as mocrobius and proclus and athenagoras all agree to interpret the several passages of orpheus which they have preserved  but the love designed in our text is the one selfexistent and infinite mind whom if the generality of ancient mythologists have not introduced or truly described in accounting for the production of the world and its appearances yet to a modern poet it can be no objection that he has ventured to differ from them in this particular though in other respects he professes to imitate their manner and conform to their opinions for in these great points of natural theology they differ no less remarkably among themselves and are perpetually confounding the philosophical relations of things with the traditionary circumstances of mythick history upon which very account callimachus in his hymn to jupiter declares his dissent from them concerning even an article of the national creed adding that the ancient bards were by no means to be depended on and yet in the exordium of the old argonautick poem ascribed to orpheus it is said that love whom mortals in later times call phanes was the father of the eternally begotten night who is generally represented by these mythological poets as being herself the parent of all things and who in the indigitamenta or orphick hymns is said to be the same with cypris or love itself moreover in the body of this argonautick poem where the personated orpheus introduces himself singing to his lyre in reply to chiron he celebrateth the obscure memory of chaos and the natures which it contained within itself in a state of perpetual vicissitude how the heaven had its boundary determined the generation of the earth the depth of the ocean and also the sapient love the most ancient the selfsufficient with all the beings which he produced when he separated one thing from another which noble passage is more directly to aristotles purpose in the first book of his metaphysics than any of those which he has there quoted to show that the ancient poets and mythologists agreed with empedocles anaxagoras and the other more sober philosophers in that natural anticipation and common notion of mankind concerning the necessity of mind and reason to account for the connection motion and good order of the world for though neither this poem nor the hymns which pass under the same name are it should seem the work of the real orpheus yet beyond all question they are very ancient the hymns more particularly are allowed to be older than the invasion of greece by xerxes and were probably a set of public and solemn forms of devotion as appears by a passage in one of them which demosthenes has almost literally cited in his first oration against aristogiton as the saying of orpheus the founder of their most holy mysteries on this account they are of higher authority than any other mythological work now extant the theogony of hesiod himself not excepted the poetry of them is often extremely noble and the mysterious air which prevails in them together with its delightful impression upon the mind cannot be better expressed than in that remarkable description with which they inspired the german editor eschenbach when he accidentally met with them at leipsick thesaurum me reperisse credidi says he et prosecto thesaurum reperi incredibile dictu quo me sacro horrore afflaverint indigitamenta ista deorum nam et tempus ad illorum lectionem eligere cogebar quod vel solum horrorem incutere animo potest nocturnum cum enim totam diem consumserim in contemplando urbis splendore et in adeundis quibus

dicitur causa aeterna rerum to the same purpose is the doctrine of hierocles in that excellent fragment concerning providence and destiny as to the three fates or destinies of the poets they represented that part of the general system of natural causes which relate to man and to other mortal beings for so we are told in the hymn addressed to them among the orphick indigitamenta where they are called the daughters of night or love and contrary to the vulgar notion are distinguished by the epithets of gentle and tenderhearted according to hesiod theog ver  0  they were the daughters of jupiter and themis but in the orphick hymn to venus or love that goddess is directly styled the mother of necessity and is represented immediately after as governing the three destinies and conducting the whole system of natural causes  elder than chaos born of fate was time    born of fate was time cronos saturn or time was according to apollodorus the son of coelum and tellus but the author of the hymns gives it quite undisguised by mythological language and calls him plainly the offspring of the earth and the starry heaven that is of fate as explained in the preceding note  who many sons and many comely births devoured relentless father till the child    who many sons devoured the known fable of saturn devouring his children was certainly meant to imply the dissolution of natural bodies which are produced and destroyed by time     the child  of rhea jupiter so called by pindar  of rhea drove him from the upper sky    drove him from the upper sky that jupiter dethroned his father saturn is recorded by all the mythologists phurnutus or cornutus the author of a little greek treatise on the nature of the gods informs us that by jupiter was meant the vegetable soul of the world which restrained and prevented those uncertain alterations which saturn or time used formerly to cause in the mundane system  and quelled his deadly might then social reigned  0 then social

afterward welldisposed and at peace among themselves tethys was the wife of the ocean ops or rhea the earth vesta the eldest daughter of saturn fire and the cloudcompeller or  the air though he also

virgil in the eighth book of the aeneid speaks as if the nymphs or naiads were the parents of the rivers but in this he contradicts the testimony of hesiod and evidently departs from the orthodox system which represents several nymphs as retaining to every single river on the other hand callimachus who was very learned in all the school divinity of those times in his hymn to delos makes peneus the great thessalian rivergodthe father of his nymphs and ovid in the fourteenth book of his metamorphoses mentions the naiads of latium as the immediate daughters of the neighboring rivergods

character by thymoetes grandson to laomedon and contemporary with orpheus thymoetes had traveled over libya to the country which borders on the western ocean there he saw the island of nysa and learned from the inhabitants that ammon king of libya was married in former ages to rhea sister of saturn and the titans that he afterward fell in love with a beautiful virgin whose name was amalthea had by her a son and gave her possession of a neighboring track of land wonderfully fertile which in shape nearly resembling the horn of an ox was thence called the hesperian horn and afterward the horn of amalthea that fearing the jealousy of rhea he concealed the young bacchus with his mother in the island of nysa the beauty of which diodorus describes with great dignity and pomp of style this fable is one of the noblest in all the ancient mythology and seems to have made a particular impression on the imagination of milton the only modern poet unless perhaps it be necessary to except spenser who in these mysterious traditions of the poetic story had a heart to feel and words to express the simple and solitary genius of antiquity to raise the idea of his paradise he prefers it even

attempt somewhat in the same manner solely by way of exercise the manner itself being now almost entirely abandoned in poetry and as the mere genealogy or the personal adventures of heathen gods could have been but little interesting to a modern reader it was therefore thought proper to select some convenient part of the history of nature and to employ these ancient divinities as it is probable they were first employed to wit in personifying natural causes and in representing the mutual agreement or opposition of the corporeal and moral powers of the world which has been accounted the very
