have already experienced so much indulgence from the public that in sending them thus collected into the world i should feel perhaps more of confidence than apprehension were i not perfectly convinced that temporary favor is no decisive proof of real desert  whatever the future fate of these performances may be i am aware that it must depend upon themselves alone and i shall not trouble my reader with any vain attempt to enhance their merits or palliate their defects  yet concerning one class of poems in the collection it may be proper to say a few words as some critics have expected to find in them much more than their author intended  i mean the essays on different arts in these it was by no means my design to assume the office of a legislator not only from a just diffidence in my own power of framing such laws but from a persuasion that in poetry they seldom prove either pleasing or useful  it may be said i believe of all didactic poems that the parts of them which do not pretend to teach are the most productive of pleasure and perhaps of utility  paradoxical as this may appear i am convinced that in compositions relating to the fine arts it is strictly true a collection of precepts though expressed in the most elegant verse can never make either a painter or a poet whose productions to use the words of a great historian would excite less admiration if they could be created by the lessons of a preceptor  rules of art are in general so trite or fallacious that they rather tend to tire and mislead than to animate and direct  let us consider for instance the art of poetry by boileau which is justly said to be superior to its rivals  if we examine the mere precepts contained in this admirable poem some of them are such as a poet would certainly be neglected for observing and others only such as must occur to every writer of a sound understanding  they are indeed embellished with all the graces of forcible and highlypolished expression yet surely the most engaging and useful parts of this celebrated work are its lively images and characters which by animating the composition inspire an enthusiastic esteem for the art and its professors  concerning the real use of rules opinions have been very different  some have even imputed the decline of art to the accumulation of precepts while others have thought so highly of their power as to imagine that no one can produce a good poem without being acquainted with the poetics of aristotle which is in truth like imagining that no one can become a parent without perusing a treatise of anatomy  though i confess myself inclined to doubt the efficacy of precepts toward forming a great artist of any kind i am far from intending to condemn the poems that have appeared on a preceptive plan  many of these are written in a manner so sprightly and with such an elegant felicity of expression that if they do not afford to young students that new and solid instruction which they profess to deliver they are at least highly pleasing and certainly very serviceable to that more numerous class of readers the critics and connoisseurs  it was however my wish to render my own poems on different arts more historical than preceptive  my principal design was to present a general view of the art in question with a just and animating character of its most eminent professors there is i believe a season of life in which poems of this nature may be read with the happiest effect  the first and perhaps the most important step toward forming a great artist in any line is to inspire a youth of quick feelings with an enthusiastic passion for some particular art and with an ingenuous delight in the glory of its heroes  such was the end that i proposed to myself in these essays for as delicate or inconstant health and the love of literary retirement have prevented me from serving the community in scenes of active life i have considered it as particularly incumbent on me to endeavor at least in my poetical pursuits to promote the interest of society  i am aware that such an idea is open to much raillery as vain and romantic but poetry is an art which conduces so little to the private emolument and advantage of those who devote even a life to it that they ought i think to be indulged in such prospects however chimerical as arise only from a benevolent vanity  in closing this preface it may be proper to say that the collection contains nothing which has not appeared before except an ode to that elegant and instructive female author the countess of genlis with a few short and occasional compositions inserted at the end of the first volume  erratum vol i p    l   from the bottom for      read       an essay on painting in two epistles to mr romney    philostratus patet omnibus ars

latter  an essay on painting epistle i blessed be the hour when favoring gales restore the traveled artist to his native shore his mind enlightened and his fancy fraught with finest forms by ancient genius wrought whose magic beauty charmed with spell sublime the scythe of ruin from the hand of time and moved the mighty leveller to spare models of grace so exquisitely fair while you whom painting thus inspired to roam bring these rich stores of ripened judgment home while now attending my accomplished friend science and taste his softened colors blend let the fond muse though with a transient view the progress of her sister art pursue eager in tracing from remotest time the steps of painting through each favored clime to praise her dearest sons whose daring aim gained their bright stations on the heights of fame and mark the paths by which her partial hand conducts her romney to this radiant band painting sweet nymph now leaves in lifeless trance exhausted italy and tinfel france and sees in britain with exulting eyes her votries prosper and her glories rise yet though my friend thy art is thus carest and with the homage of the public blessed and flourishes with growing beauty fair the child of majestys adoptive care the youthful artist still is doomed to feel obstructions chilling hand that damps his zeal the imperious voice of vanity and pride bids him from fancys region turn aside and quit the magic of her scene to trace the vacant lines of some unmeaning face even in this work his wishes still are crossed and all the efforts of his art are lost for when the canvas with the mirrors truth reflects the perfect form of age or youth the fond affections of the partial mind the eye of judgment with delusion blind each mother bids him brighter tints employ and give new spirit to her booby boy nor can the painter with his utmost art express the image in the lovers heart unconscious of the change the seasons bring autumnal beauty asks the rose of spring and vain selflove in every age the same will fondly urge some visionary claim the luckless painter destined to submit mourns the lost likeness which he once had hit and doomed to groundless censure bears alone the grievous load of errors not his own nor is it pride or follys vain command that only fetters his creative hand at fashions nod he copies as they pass each quaint reflection from her crowded glass the formal coat with intersecting line mars the free graces of his fair design the towering cap he marks with like distress and all the motley mass of female dress the hoop extended with enormous size the corks that like a promontory rise the stays of deadly steel in whose embrace the tyrant fashion tortures injured grace but art despairing over shapes like these to cast an air of elegance and ease invokes kind fancys aid  she comes to spread her magic spells  the gothic forms are fled and see to crown the painters just desire her free positions and her light attire the ambitious artist wishes to pursue this brilliant plan with more extensive view and with adopted character to give a lasting charm to make the portrait live all points of art by one nice effort gain delight the learned and content the vain make history to life new value lend ver    see note    and in the comprehensive picture blend the ancient hero with the living friend most fair device but ah what foes to sense what broods of motley monsters rise from hence the strange pretensions of each age and sex these plans of fancy and of taste perplex for male and female to themselves unknown demand a character unlike their own till often the painter to this quaint distress prefers the awkward shapes of common dress sweet girls of mild and pensive softness choose the sportive emblems of the comic muse and sprightly damsels are inclined to borrow the garb of penitence and tears of sorrow while awkward pride though safe from wars alarms round his plump body buckles ancient arms and from an honest justice of the peace starts up at once a demigod of greece too firm of heart by ridicule to fall the finished hero crowns his country hall ordained to fill if fire his glory spare the lumbergarret of his wiser heir

fancy still to nature just copied her line and formed the mimic bust thus from thy power inspiring love we trace the modeled image and the pencild face we pity genius when by interest led his toils

can find of that enthusiastic passion for the fine arts which animated the ancients notwithstanding her praeeminence in beauty it seems somewhat singular that the painter should have chosen such a

happened to be the kings secretary in the character of the executioner the secretary complained to his master and petitioned that his features might be effaced but his majesty defended the painter and ordered the figure to remain  in praising this singular genius i have ventured to borrow something like a conceit from the famous spanish poet lope de vega who has celebrated his talents in the following verses del mudo pintor famosissimo  no quiso el cielo que hablasse porque con mi entendimiento diesse mayor sentimiento a las cosas que pintasse y tanta vida les di con el pincel singular que como no pude hablar hize que hablassen por mi   the poet also honored this favorite artist who died in      with an epitaph which turns on the same idea and which the curious reader may find in the work from whence i have taken this short account of him vidas de los pittores espanoles por palamino velasco octavo london       note xxiv verse   0 and thou velasquez share the honor due don diego velasquez de silva the most accomplished of the spanish painters was born at seville      and closed his honorable and splendid life at madrid in    0  his master was pacheco a spaniard who united the sister arts of painting and poetry  velasquez was patronized by the famous olivarez and had the honor of painting our charles the first during his visit at madrid perhaps he contributed not a little to form the taste and passion for art by which that prince was so eminently distinguished the spanish painter rose to great honors in his own country and had like rubens the singular fortune to unite the character of an ambassador with that of an artist being sent on an extraordinary commission in      to pope innocent x  one of his most striking historical pictures was the expulsion of the moors from spain a noble national subject which he painted for philip the third in competition with three artists of reputation and obtained the preference  but he is particularly celebrated for the spirit and energy of his portraits concerning which there are two singular ancedotes related by his spanish biographer and the following may possibly amuse the reader  in      he executed a portrait of don adrian pulido pareja commander in chief of an armament appointed to new spain and pleased himself so well in the execution that he affixed his name to the picture a circumstance not usual with him he had painted with pencils of uncommon length for the sake of working at a greater distance and with peculiar force so that the picture says my spanish author when near is not to be distinguished and at a distance is a miracle as velasquez after this portrait was finished was at work in the palace the king as usual went privately to his apartment to see him paint when observing the figure of pareja and taking it for the real person he exclaimed with surprise what are you still here have you not your dispatches and why are you not gone but soon perceiving his mistake he turned to velasquez who modestly doubted the reality of the deception and said i protest to you it deceived me  for this story such as it is i am indebted to the author whom i have quoted in the

don bartolome estevan murillo was born in the neighborhood of seville in      his first master was juan de castillo but he soon settled in madrid under the protection of velasquez who contributed to his improvement in the most generous manner the spaniards boast that murillo became a great painter without ever traveling out of spain he is said to have refused the offer of an establishment in england from charles the second and to have pleaded his age as an excuse for not quitting his own country where he died and was buried with great marks of honor in       those who wish for more information on the artists of spain may be amply gratified by the amusing work which mr cumberland has lately published on the painters of that country  they will find in it a very spirited account of the famous mengs who died in the service of the spanish court at the age of fiftyone in       if we could trust to the praises bestowed on this celebrated artist by his friend and biographer azara we might revere him as the restorer of perfect art but the elegant writer of our country who has surveyed his capital productions with an impartial eye gives us to understand that they all betray a great poverty of genius indeed the personal history of mengs may tend to confirm this idea he was originally made a painter and a drudge by the tyranny of a cruel father and though he applied himself intensely through life to the practice and theory of his art he seems never to have attained that felicity of performance which can perhaps belong only to those who devote themselves to a favorite art in the happy ardour of unconstrained affection the professional writings of mengs will amuse if not instruct every lover of art  but readers of our country must feel some indignation at his insolent and injurious censure on a great artist whose reputation is justly dear to every liberal englishman  note xxvi verse     no mean historian to record their praise george vasari to whom we are indebted

painters of holland those who are enchanted by the sublime conceptions of the roman school are too apt precipitately to condemn every effort of the dutch pencil as a contemptible performance while those who are satisfied with minute and faithful delineations of nature find absolute perfection in the very pictures which are treated by others with the most supercilious neglect  but sound and impartial judgment seems equally to disclaim this hasty censure and this inordinate praise  and ranking the most eminent dutch artists below the great italian masters yet allows them considerable and

possessed the infinitude of works which he produced the reputation and esteem the various honors and ample fortune which he so justly acquired present to the mind an animating idea of what may be expected from a happy cultivation of talents in a course of constant and spirited application though he visited the court of charles the first in the public character of an ambassador it does not appear how long he resided here  mr walpole conjectures about a year  his pictures in the ceiling at whitehall were not painted in england which perhaps is the reason he has been at the pains of finishing them so neatly that they will bear the nearest inspection for he must have well known how greatly the reputation of any work depends on its first happy impression on the public and concluded

derives from the first invention of printing and painting in oil it has been said was known in italy before the time of john van eyck or john of bruges as he is commonly called to whom that discovery is generally ascribed about the year    0  but vasari in his life of antonello da messina relates very particularly the circumstances of van eycks invention and the subsequent introduction of the secret into italy a most learned antiquarian and entertaining writer of our own time has supposed that van eyck might possibly learn the secret of using oil in england and take the honor of the invention to himself as we were then a country little known to the world of arts nor at leisure from the confusion of the times to claim the discovery of such a secret  walpoles anecdotes of painting vol i p     the conjecture is not without some little foundation  but the conjectural claims which either italy or england can produce to this excellent invention are by no means sufficiently strong to annihilate the glory of the happy and ingenious fleming  since the preceding part of this note was written the reputation both of van eyck and his encomiast vasari has been very forcibly attacked in an essay on oilpainting by mr raspe an essay which discovers such a zealous attachment to the arts and such an active pursuit of knowledge as do great credit to its ingenious author but though i have perused it with the attention it deserves it does not lead me to retract what i had said because after all his researches on this subject it appears that although oilpainting was not absolutely the invention of van eyck it was yet indebted to him for those improvements which made it of real value to his profession  the ingenious fleming seems theresore to be still entitled to those honors that have been lavished on his name as improvement in such cases is often more useful and more meritorious than invention itself which is frequently the effect of chance while the former arises from

sublime imagination his talents as a painter are universally celebrated but his social virtues though perhaps not inferior are far from being so generally known in the raccolta di lettere sulla pittura there are many of his letters to his intimate friend ricciardi an italian poet and professor of moral philosophy at pisa which perfectly display the warmth of his friendship and the generosity of his heart  they contain also some amusing anecdotes relating to his profession and the great delight which he took in discovering historical subjects of a peculiar cast untouched by other painters and appearing to an ignorant eye almost beyond the limits of his art he seems to describe himself with justice as well as energy in the following words of a letter to ricciardi tutto bile tutto spirito tutto fuoco  though he must have been wonderfully pleasant as a companion and valuable as a friend yet he laments that his satires had made him many enemies and heartily wishes he had never produced them in that which relates to painting he exposes indeed the vices of his brethren with great freedom and severity  it is remarkable that his poetry abounds more with learned allusions than with high flights of imagination yet in the satire i have mentioned there is much whimsical fancy an ape is introduced applying to a painter and begging to learn his profession as nature he says has given him a genius for the mimetic arts  the painter complies  but his disciple after an apprenticeship of ten years bids his master adieu with many humorous execrations against the art of painting

the poet arose from the most cruel necessity that of the painter from avarice the bane of excellence in every profession  if sir godfrey had any talents for history which is surely very doubtful we have as mr walpole well observes no reason to regret that he was confined to portraits as his pencil has faithfully transmitted to us  so many ornaments of an illustrious age  though i have partly subscribed to the general idea that william in whose reign this painter principally flourished contributed nothing to the advancement of arts yet i must observe that his employing kneller to paint the

gallery for artists completely filled with a small but wellchosen collection of casts from the antique and engaged two eminent artists to superintend and direct the students  this noble encouragement of art though superseded by a royal establishment is still entitled to remembrance and honor it not only served as a prelude to more extensive institutions but contributed much toward forming some capital artists of the present time the name of mortimer is alone sufficient to reflect a considerable luster on this early school  note xlvii verse     teach but thy transient tints no more to fly although the superior excellencies of this admirable artist make us peculiarly regret the want of durability in his exquisite productions yet he is far from being the only artist whose pictures soon discover an appearance of precipitate decay fugitive coloring seems indeed to be the chief defect among our present painters in oil and it must be the most ardent wish of every lover of art that so great an evil may be effectually remedied as the royal academy is a society of enlightened artists established for the improvement of every branch of painting it may be hoped that they will pay attention to this mechanical point as well as to the nobler acquirements of art and employ some person who has patience and abilities for such an office to discover by a course of experiments to what cause this important evil is owing if it be found to arise from the adulteration of colors oils and varnishes might it not be eligible for the academy to follow the example of another profession who where health and life are concerned obviate the difficulty of getting their articles genuine from the individual trader by opening a shop at the expense of the society to prepare and sell the various ingredients free from those adulterations which private interest might otherwise produce  but there may be no just ground of complaint against the integrity of the colourman and this failure may perhaps arise from the artists mixing his colors and their vehicles in improper proportions to each other that is instead of painting with oil properly thickened with color using oil only fully stained with it to which a proper consistence or body as the painters call it is given by strong gum varnishes in short using more vehicle than color by which although most brilliant and transparent effects may be produced yet the particles of color are too much attenuated and divided from each other and consequently less able to withstand the destructive action of light if the deficiency complained of originates from this source the academy by a careful course of experiments may be able clearly to ascertain what preparations of the more delicate colors are most durable what oils and varnishes will best preserve the original brilliancy of the paint what are the best proportions for this purpose in which they can be used and how far glazing that almost irresistible temptation to oilpainters may or may not be depended on all these points are at present so far from being known with certainty that perhaps there are not two painters who think perfectly alike on any one of them the author hopes that the gentlemen of the pencil will pardon his presuming to offer a hint on this delicate subject with which he does not pretend to be intimately acquainted the ideas which he has thus ventured to address to them arise only from the most ardent wish that future ages may have a just and adequate sense of the flourishing state of painting in england in the reign of george the third and that our present excellent artists may not be reduced to depend on the uncertain hand of the engraver for the esteem of posterity  a very liberal critic vide the gentlemans magazine for november      p      in his flattering remarks on the poem seems in speaking of this note to mistake a little the meaning of its author who alluded only to that defect in coloring where the finer tints are so managed for the sake of an immediate and shortlived brilliancy that they sink very soon into no color at all he did not mean to touch on those changes in painting where the colors all grow darker the lights become brown and the shadows one mass of black this is likewise a great evil and calls aloud for redress perhaps the critic above mentioned has pointed out the true cause of this defect viz the indiscriminate blending of the colors and the not using pure simple uncompounded tints  note xlviii verse     the leading principles of liberal art i embrace with pleasure the opportunity of paying this tribute to the great artist here mentioned who is not only at the head of his own profession but may justly be ranked among the first writers of the age his discourses not merely calculated for the improvement of the young artists to whom they are addressed contain all the principles of true and universal taste embellished with great brilliancy of imagination and with equal force of expression  note xlix verse     thy ugolino etc as the subject of this admirable picture is taken from a poet so little known to the english reader as dante it may not perhaps be impertinent to say that in richardsons discourse on the science of a connoisseur there is a translation of the story in english blank verse a young and noble author now living has obliged the world with a translation of it in rhyme  as to the picture no artist could express more happily the wild and sublime spirit of the poet from whom he drew we may justly apply to him the compliment which a lively italian addressed to a great man of his own country but of far inferior expression fabro gentil ben sai ch ancor tragico caso e caro oggetto e che spesso l horror va col diletto marino  note l verse     now art exults with annual triumphs gay while we are delighted with the increasing splendour of these annual entertainments it is but just to remember that we are indebted to the society of arts and sciences for our first public exhibition of paintings the different societies of artists soon followed so excellent an example and our rapid and various improvements in this lovely art reflect the highest honor on this happy institution our exhibitions at once afford both the best nursery for the protection of infant genius and the noblest field for the display of accomplished merit nor do they only administer to the benefit of the artist and the pleasure of the public they have still a more exalted tendency and when national subjects are painted with dignity and force our exhibitions may justly be regarded as schools of public virtue perhaps the young soldier can never be more warmly animated to the service of his country than by gazing with the delighted public on a sublime picture of the expiring hero who died with glory in her defense but not to dwell on their power of inspiring martial enthusiasm our exhibitions may be said to have a happy influence on the manners and morals of those who fill the different departments of more tranquil life in support of this sentiment i beg leave to transcribe the following judicious remark from an author who has lately obliged the public with two little volumes of elegant and spirited essays they whose natural feelings have been properly improved by culture nor have yet become callous by attrition with the world know from experience how the heart is mollified the manners polished and the temper sweetened by a welldirected study of the arts of imitation the same sensibility of artificial excellence extends

the elegant author i have mentioned in considering sir philip sidney as an astonishing object of temporary admiration i am surprised that so judicious an author should ever question so fair a title to universal regard the learning and munificence the courage and courtesy of sidney endeared him to every rank and he justly challenges the lasting affection of his country from the closing scene of his life in which heroism and humanity are so beautifully blended i never can think this accomplished character any ways degraded by his having written a tedious romance in which however there are many touches of exquisite beauty and spirit to amuse a most amiable sister whom he tenderly loved or by his having threatened an unworthy servant of his fathers with death in a hasty billet merely to

age when the graces of the mind were regarded as an essential article in female education but the beauty and force of her filial piety reflects a still superior luster on this accomplished woman

purer bliss song i stay o stay thou lovely shade brought by sleep to sorrows aid ah the sweet illusion ends light and reason cruel friends bid me not with frantic care vainly worship fleeting air ii night return on rapid wing round my head thy poppies fling hateful day thy reign be brief darkness is the friend of grief could thou sleep my dream restore i should wish to wake no more song i enjoy my child the balmy sleep which over thy form new beauty throws and long thy tranquil spirit keep a stranger to thy mothers woes though in distress i feel it less while gazing on thy sweet repose ii condemned to pangs like inward fire that through my injured bosom roll how would my heart in death desire relief from fortunes hard control did not thy arms and infant charms to earth enchain my anxious soul iii flow fast my tears  by you relieved i vent my anguish thus unknown but cease ever ye can be perceived by this dear child to pity prone whose tender heart would seize a part in grief that should be all my own iv our cup of woe which angels fill perchance it is my lot to drain while that of joy unmixed with ill may thus my child for thee remain if thou art free so heaven decree i bless my doom of double pain ode to richard vernon sadleir esquire      i business be gone thou vulture care no more the quivering sinews tear of sadleirs mortal frame full well his firm and active mind has paid the duties that mankind from sense and virtue claim ii alas too well  for mental toil our fine machinery will spoil as nature has decreed she formed the powers that raise the soul like wheels that kindle as they roll and perish by their speed iii let health and vigor on the stage support the scene while milder age resigns the bustling part if flowers the busy path adorn ingratitude there plants her thorn which pierces to the heart iv often have thou seen her poisoned shoot where hope expected fairest fruit yet still thy bounty flows like constant dew that falls on earth although it wakens into birth the nightshade with the rose v thy warmth of heart o still retain nor of ingratitude complain however her wounds may burn bliss from benevolence must flow angels are blessed while they bestow unconscious of return vi and happiness we only find in those exertions of the mind that form the ardent friend in these it dwells with these it flies as all the comets splendour dies whenever its motions end vii o let the luster of thy soul no more eccentrically roll through labors long career o haste it is dangerous course confine and let it permanently shine in pleasures milder sphere viii in friendships name thy voice invites our willing hearts to social rites where laughter is thy guest but o these eyes with anguish burn and fear their weakened orbs to turn from natures verdant vest ix thy invitation then forbear though at thy board in union rare kind plenty reigns with wit thy roof is joyous but i doubt that we should find the brilliant rout for burning eyes unfit x thy noisy town and dusty street do thou exchange for this retreat whose charms thy songs commend on learnings page forbid to look we yet can read that dearer book  the visage of a friend a card of invitation to mr gibbon at brighthelmstone      an english sparrow pert and free who chirps beneath his native tree hearing the roman eagles near and feeling more respect than fear thus with united love and awe invites him to his shed of straw though he is but a twittering sparrow the field he hops in rather narrow when nobler plumes attract his view he ever pays them homage due and looks with reverential wonder on him whose talons bear the thunder nor could the jackdaws ever inveigle his voice to vilify the eagle though issuing from those holy towers in which they build their warmest bowers their sovereigns haunt they slily search in hopes to find him on his perch for pindar says beside his god the thunderbearing bird will nod then peeping round his still retreat they pick from underneath his feet some molted feather he lets fall and swear he cannot fly at all  lord of the sky whose pounce can tear these croakers that infest the air trust him the sparrow loves to sing the praise of thy imperial wing he thinks thou wilt deem him on his word an honest though familiar bird and hopes thou soon wilt condescend to look upon thy little friend that he may boast around his grove a visit from the bird of jove to mr mason on his sending the author his translation of dufresnoy with notes by sir joshua reynolds      i dear brother of the tuneful art to whom i justly bend i prize with a fraternal heart the pleasing gift you send ii with pride by envy undebasd my english spirit views how far your elegance of taste improves a gallic muse iii i thought that muse but meanly dressed when her stiff gown was latin but you have turned her grogram vest into fine folds of satin iv mild reynolds looks with liberal favor on your adopted girl and to the graceful robe you gave her adds rich festoons of pearl impromptu to mr meyer on his sending the author from the continent two prints representing the coronation of voltaire and rousseaus arrival in elysium      i the song that shakes the festive roof when mirth and musics liveliest notes ascend is not more pleasing than the proof of kind remembrance from an absent friend ii then guess the pleasure that we share and thus dear meyer accept the thanks we owe while we behold the crowned voltaire and see elysium hail our loved rousseau iii may all the honor all the joy known by each genius in thy gift portrayd be thine without the dull alloy that tinged their golden days with dusky shade iv as lively as the gay voltaire with his keen pen may thy fine pencil strive may thou as long delight the fair and triumph like the bard at eightyfive v as tender as the warm rousseau like him thy happier thoughts on nature fix but midst thy prospering children know a true elysium  on this side the styx a receipt to make a

in the papers your delicate treat to miss seward on her being at eartham in the variable weather august      i whence are these storms  an angry poet cried who saw his shady summer haunts defaced saw over his shattered grove black whirlwinds ride and loud lamented this untimely waste ii he spoke and aeolus upreard his head half his huge form round which dark clouds were driven rising from oceans broad and billowy bed filled up the vast expanse from earth to heaven iii as his fierce eye surveyed the rough profound from the stern god the voice of anger broke air earth and sea reverberate the sound and shrinking nature shudderd as he spoke iv know thou vain bard within thy mansion dwells the wondrous source of all this wild uproar thence round my cave the din of discord swells and i my rebel offspring rule no more v to own my laws my madning sons refuse all all are deaf to my paternal power struggling alike to kiss that vagrant muse who deigns to visit thy sequestered bower vi rough boreas used in these still months to fleep starts from his cell in passions wild alarms while dripping auster rushes from the deep to snatch the fairone from his brothers arms vii each others fond ambition to destroy alike they struggle merciless as death see my young zephyr natures tender joy encounters eurus with contentious breath viii cease my rash sons this cruel war to wage though tempting beauty gave your conflict birth lest famine wakened by your frantic rage stalk in fell triumph over the blasted earth ix see shivering mortals mourn the inverted year while ceres weeps her golden pride deprest if ye no longer natures law revere yet mildly listen to your sires request  x let each in order taste the tempting bliss for which these mutual wounds ye vainly bear each unmolested take one precious kiss and freely clasp this phrenzykindling fair xi he paused  black boreas eldest of his race whose stormy passion the chill maiden shocks binds her reluctant in his strong embrace and sports licentious in her auburn locks xii eurus succeeds of less disgusting mien yet mad the trembling fairone to assail beneath his pressure more intensely keen the wounded ruby of her lip grows pale xiii next with mild charms and less tumultuous love by melting auster see the nymph carest he with the softness of the murmuring dove waves his moist pinions over her softer breast xiv now lively zephyr the sweet muse is thine o long embrace her in our laughing skies and round her bid this joyous landscape shine rich as her verse and radiant as her eyes content written at the request of a lady for the vase at batheaston      how idle are mortals said wisdom to youth they slight the clear dictates of reason and truth they worship ambition to pleasure they bend yet blindly oerlook a more excellent friend and hence their vain hopes are eternally crossed their life in a tempest of wishes is lost still destined to toil and of toil to repent for neglect of just vows to the goddess content that goddess from whom all felicity flows who unites every good in the gift she bestows so free of her bounty to all who confess it to solicit her smile is almost to possess it when i heard this fine speech my fond passion was raised and i set forth in quest of the being so praised at the mansion of grandeur my search i begin and ask if the goddess content is within but pride who as sentinel guarded the door said bluntly he never heard her title before he told me i wanted a poor rustic slut and bade me go look in some little thatched hut i marched to the villagers lowly abode twas a snug pretty cottage and stood near the road and here a good woman possessing though humble a face that could frown and a tongue that would grumble said  the person i asked for had lodged in her cot but alas such good luck was no longer her lot for she quitted her roof where she often had reposed when yon great house was built and the common enclosed i conceived as i now bade the village farewell with the mild sons of science this goddess must dwell but those where i sought some obliging instructor were squabbling about an electric conductor some cried up the point some commended the ball the soft breath of science was turned to a squall the sages no mental conductor could find to draw off the flame that now flashed on their mind in haste i exclaimed to the learned adieu for even science offends when she talks like a shrew having wandered so wide of the object i sought i was now led to think and rejoiced at the thought this goddess herself for her charms so renowned with the daughters of beauty must surely be found with this hope i approached unperceived by them all three lovely young girls just arrayed for the ball in each whose bright eyes on a mirror were bent i thought i discovered a spark of content but watching them more in their beautiful faces of the goddess i sought i no more saw the traces for as they surveyed with a critical glance the elegant montagu move in the dance in her exquisite figure such graces were shown that viewing her charms they distrusted their own thou gentlest of nymphs while thy triumphs increase unconscious of beauty so fatal to peace though the sparks of content in one sex thou may smother bright ecstasys flame thou will raise in the other if in bosom parental content could reside the heart of thy parent this treasure must hide but alas it is a truth which all parents lament their tender anxiety stifles content o tell me while vainly to find thee i pant dear latent divinity where is thy haunt away to batheaston goodnature replies behold she there weaves the poetical prize with thy myrtle kind miller o let me be crowned then my search is repaid and the goddess is found nay if to another your wreath you assign and give it to verse far superior to mine my searchs dear object i still must attain and the proof of this wonders exceedingly plain it rests on this maxim by horace invented the bard who writes worst is the bard most contented my claim to this blessing thus made very clear if i have nothing to hope i have nothing to fear for miller can please while the mind she amuses both when she bestows and even when she refuses in truth i suspect from her singular aim the goddess i seek is concealed by her name she herself is content and her house is the fane where spleen and ill nature no favors obtain some mortals in vain for admission must pray but all who once enter go smiling away end of the first volume
