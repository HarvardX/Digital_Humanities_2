remarks on the composition use and effects of the extract of lead of mr goulard and of his vegetomineral water  by g arnaud doctor in physic and master in surgery the only person authorized to sell this extract composed by mr goulard himself  plumbi cum corpore humano sympathia  borelli london printed for the author in churchstreet st anns soho and sold by p elmsly successor to mr vaillant bookseller in the strand  mdcclxx  on the extract of lead it is not my intention here to descant on the praises of mr goulards remedy see mr goulards work sold by p elmsly successor to mr vaillant bookseller in the strand that is already too well known throughout europe to want any assistance from my pen my views coincide entirely with those of the author in endeavoring to bring it to still greater perfection by considering it with more preciseness both as to it is composition and use to be ignorant of these would be a fault willingly to conceal it is superior virtues would be an injury to society and a mans of proceeding very different from the authors who has published all his knowledge on the subject without reserve  this medicament justly looked upon by those of the faculty who are free from prejudice as the best and most universal topic in surgery may very properly be substituted in the place of all others generally prescribed it will frequently prove efficacious when the rest have failed and will repair the disorders they have brought upon the constitution  i dont pretend to mention this medicine as a new discovered one on the contrary we have received it from antiquity known by the name of acetum litargiri but by its having been ill made malapropos applied and prescribed in improper quantities it was for some time out of repute and without the assistance and the vigilance of mr goulards speculative turn who has had resolution enough to stem the torrent of opposition this remedy like many others by having been improperly made and as improperly administered would have fallen into the possession only of the quacks for want of proper vinegar the basis of this medicine it frequently deceived the practitioners who from not knowing its properties and the real method of composing it entirely laid it aside but it has of late been too minutely considered to be any longer neglected and is now looked upon by the impartial part of mankind to be one of the greatest ornaments of the dispensatories as well as the most efficacious remedy in surgery it is then to mr goulard a skilful surgeon of montpellier we owe its revival which could never have been effected but by a man of his eminence and like him exempt from vulgar prejudice which has hitherto laid to the charge of this salutary remedy faults from which the experiments of many famous in their profession are now endeavoring to clear it in favor of mankind  when this extract is made with natural vinegar and the strongest which can be procured in the south of france where nature in favorable years and in particular cantons furnishes this vegetable liquor with more virtues than any art of the vinegarmakers can possibly endow it with it possesses all the dispersing cooling and resolving qualities proper for dividing the glutinous stagnated matter in the obstructed vessels it relaxes them when too much contracted and restores to the solids and fluids the proportion of circulation necessary for preserving the animal economy in a state of health the common vinegars owing their strength to sal ammoniac to pepper and the dung of the feathered kind which cannot fail of robbing this extract of the qualities necessary for its perfection as do likewise other factitious vegetable acids such for example as are brewed in england and in the northern countries under the appearance of vinegar the latter it is true though not capable of injuring the constitution act as stimulators to the stomach but this property is not sufficient to perfectly dissolve the lead or to impregnate these metallic particles with the particular qualities they acquire by the addition of tartar natural to those vinegars which are made with the strongest wines such as are well versed in the art of chemistry know that natural vinegar contains an essential oil which entirely dissolves lead while its acid only divides it is parts mr goulard has discovered that it is the property of some particular vinegars only of the province he lives in to perfectly dissolve this metal as they contain more essential oil than the rest consequently natural vinegars when adulterated or factitious one which receive their power of action from the acrid ingredients only mixed with them are not only rendered incapable of perfectly dissolving the lead but likewise communicate an inflammatory quality to the extract very different from the cooling and calming one natural to it when made with the best vinegar the healing quality of lead is evident from its happy effects when applied in its natural state even to ulcerated cancers how much more efficaciously must it then act when its saline particles are so far divided as to be capable of being introduced into the smallest vessels and there circulate with the juices these they attenuate and divide so as to return into their proper channel it is very necessary then that the vinegar made use of for the dissolution of the lead should be natural well chosen and by no means factitious a chemical analysis will easily discover the defects of vinegar but as every one is not in a situation of making these experiments it is merits may be ascertained by the taste only good vinegar when touched with the tongue has a pleasing acid taste and leaves a freshness in the mouth but when factitious rather appears to inflame the mouth and throat which sensation continues for some time i shall not here enter upon the bad qualities which may be conveyed to lead by the ingredients made use of in the composition of factitious vinegars which are brewed according to every ones particular recipe the best argument in favor of the extract of saturn made in particular parts of the south of france and against any other extract made with common vinegars is that the tartar of languedoc has the preference in chemical processes some of which are in vain attempted without it another argument still more corroborative is that at montpellier alone good verdigrease can be procured on account of the singular property of its vinegar and for some other concurrent and unknown reasons which help to dissolve the copper the basis of the above drug for the same reason we may be induced to think that the tartarous particles of the wine of that country being refined by its change into vinegar may contribute more efficaciously to dissolve the lead which experience daily proves common vinegars help only to divide it in parts some of languedoc properly elected dissolve it so thoroughly that without any sediment it preserves its weight a certain proof that it incorporates itself more with this species of vinegar which no doubt must render it is effects more efficacious it is certainly owing to this that the medicine we speak of possesses cooling dispersing resolving qualities and by no means a repelling one as has been hinted by certain people this requires an explanation which will be easily understood by the meanest capacity as i shall endeavor to express myself in the plainest terms  when the lead is divided only it is parts are too gross and ponderous to remain suspended in the vegetable liquid its vehicle this causes it to subside on shaking the bottle they again incorporate with the liquid without suffering a diminution of their volume this volume by preventing them from penetrating to the vessels though the pores of the skin causes them to remain in the tissue of those parts and by stopping up the passages of perspiration gives rise to what is generally termed repulsion but when the metal is so far dissolved as always to remain suspended in the vegetable liquid its parts are so fine and so far attenuated as not to be discernable through the most perfect microscope they then easily penetrate the pores of the skin follow the course of the perspiratory vessels and put in motion the inspissated and stagnated fluids which they again return to the road of circulation when the metallic particles act thus the aquatic vehicles with which they are combined loosen the skin which was before in a state of too great tension whilst the spiritous ones restore to the vessels that elasticity of which they had been deprived thus a resolution of the humors is effected by means of transpiration and circulation but a wise and cautious practitioner must always attend to the progress of the complaint when either putrefaction or a degree of malignity is apprehended and care should be always taken to mix this with digestives for critical discharges as by abating their heat it will prevent the neighboring parts from being affected and secure the patient against a too copious discharge which frequently attends these cases  the comparison made between the extract of saturn and its salt commonly called the sugar of lead will be found unjust when we consider that the latter is made with vinegars of all sorts of wines and that those of switzerland which produce the greatest quantity of this sugar are made of wines very little impregnated with tartar and that too of an inferior quality but after all this very sugar of lead which is quoted as a proof of the repelling quality to be found in our medicine is it not made use of by the ablest practitioners both as an internal and external medicine if so with how much more confidence may we make use of mr goulards extract properly made in the above circumstances a practice of fifty years has sufficiently convinced me of its superiority over the sugar of lead which i have known fail when the other has always answered my intentions  such as are thus disposed to criticize the most approved remedies will not give themselves time to reflect that an accidental failure of success might be owing to this extract not having been properly made in its commencement or succeeding processes to its having been given in too great a quantity or applied cold as indeed the author sometimes recommends with a view only to the temperate climate he writes in thus have these people been induced without having any regard for themselves to confirm the opinion of the vulgar who generally attribute the death of the patient to the last remedy and thus shamefully take advantage of this fallacious argument to cry down the good effects of the extract of saturn and to extol remedies at best uncertain often fallacious and which custom alone the tyrant of the mind authorizes the use of both against reason and experience many examples might be brought to refute what persons otherwise respectable have thought proper to advance to the prejudice of this remedy but i will refer the reader to many observations given by the author in his treatise already mentioned in the note p    and to take into consideration here the first paragraph of the third formula page  0  on the inefficacy of the poultices generally prescribed  the proofs i have given of the necessity of procuring the best vinegar and the rules i shall lay down in the sequel for the better making and using this extract having been approved of by men of knowledge and rank in this country ever intent on means to assist the poorer part of mankind have induced me to procure a quantity of it from the fountain head itself i have applied to mr goulard for this purpose to whom i have likewise communicated my thoughts on the farther improvement and use of this remedy which i have the satisfaction to know entirely coincide with his this concurrence of ideas which originally sprung from a fifty years acquaintance having been fellowstudents together has induced me to imitate him on other occasions see pages   and  0  of my treatise of disorders of the urethra and bladder sold by p elmsly bookseller in the strand in   mo the third edition and has been the means of his allowing me to be the sole vender in this country of the extract he himself made see the end of these remarks   this topic which properly speaking is an universal chirurgical medicine and easily procured has this triple advantage over others first it costs but little secondly it is prepared in an instant and thirdly it may easily be conveyed from place to place  whoever is provided with it may prevent the bad consequences of bruises occasioned either by a fall or blow it prevents an echymosis or extravasation of blood the general attendant of fractures and dislocations till proper assistance can be procured to dress the patient secundum artem in these circumstances it should be made use of in the beginning as it is a known remedy against inflammations and mortifications the general attendants of these complaints i shall not enter into a detail of the other disorders it will relieve but shall refer the reader to mr goulards treatise i shall only lay down here some few rules for its use drawn from experience which have met with mr goulards approbation both as to that and its composition  i every one is sufficiently acquainted with the powerful effects of vegetable acids and particularly those of vinegar in regard to brass to deter him from making this extract in vessels of that metal no precaution is sufficient to prevent the vinegar from imbibing some of the copper it is therefore much more advisable to make use of vessels made either of glass earth or pewter i should have been much more uneasy about a gentlemans servant who had swallowed by chance the  th of december last a certain quantity of the vegetomineral water had not i been very sure that the extract had not been made in a brass kettle i assured the master in answer to his letter that no bad consequences would ensue but that it would be advisable to order the patient to drink some warm water  copy of mr  letter sir one of my servants has swallowed by accident some of the vegetomineral water are there any bad consequences to be apprehended and what is best to be done it happened about half an hour ago i am etc   th december       the day after i received the following  sir i have the pleasure to inform you that my servant is perfectly well to day he felt last night some pains in his stomach which the warm water removed but no stitches no cholicks i am etc   th december       ii the external qualities which characterize the true original extract of saturn consist in its color its smell its weight its consistence and its taste its color is that of orange its consistence a little sirupy its smell empyreumatical or of burnt sugar its weight a third part more than that of the vinegar so that a phial which holds three ounces of vinegar ought to weigh at least four ounces when filled with the extract the thickness of this medicine may be as great a defect as its lightness for if it weighs more or less than it ought it cannot but deceive in regard to the proportions made use of and not answer to the directions given see p    iii when bad vinegar has imbibed as much lead as it can possibly dissolve the superfluous metallic particles are observed to sink to the bottom of the bottle such extract improperly called so is but an imperfect division of the lead which must be rejected for the reasons mentioned in page    iv from this mixture of lead and vinegar is produced a water called by the author vegetomineral and this water is endowed with excellent virtues when made use of in lotions fomentations injections and baths and in the different formulae described by mr goulard in his cerate poultices pomatums liniments plasters etc but the water of which the vegetomineral is composed ought to be particularly considered in its own natural state before it is made use of to form this medicated water every species of water is not proper for this use rain water when purged and filtered and that of rivers whose bottoms consist of either sand or gravel free from mud are to have the preference especially after having been purified either by standing some time or filtering through proper paper spring and pump water being impregnated with gypsous or selenitous particles give rise to a new change of the metallic ones of the lead and thus a white precipitate is formed which will by no means incorporate with the water these effects says a clebrated chemist beaume  are owing to a separation of the vitriolic acid of the selenites from the earth to which it was joined which now mixes with the lead of the extract of saturn and thus forms a vitriol of lead in that instant the vinegar mixes with the earth of the selenites and they form together an acetosecalcarious salt so that at the same time a new dissolution and a new combination are effected thus the medicine is by no means that of the vegetomineral water but a mixture of vitriol of lead acetose salt and brandy on this occasion the vitriol of lead seems to descend in form of a white powder though it is in reality a saline matter dissoluble in water the reason is that it cannot be dissolved without difficulty and that there is not a sufficiency of water to dissolve the whole quantity collected the remainder of the water contains in dissolution a small quantity of this vitriol of lead in fine if you add to the precipitate a large quantity of boiling water the dissolution is perfect which proves that this precipitate is a saline substance from this argument founded on natural philosophy and confirmed by the experiments of all who make use of water not properly purified may we not conclude that we have no reason to be surprised that this remedy has sometimes baffled our endeavors is it not on the contrary a subject of astonishment that notwithstanding this accidental defect in its composition it has so frequently been crowned with the greatest success in fine the water which dissolves soap the most effectually is to be preferred though it will be proper first to purify it well when the extract is thrown into improper water it whitens it only for a time and then falls to the bottom without being able to mix perfectly with it afresh this water becomes curdled and like sour milk and in this state it is by no means to be made use of as not at all likely to answer our expectations to this we may ascribe the want of success which serves to prejudice many against the remedy and to please others who are by no means its friends for want of being better acquainted with it when proper water cannot be procured care must be taken to distill others if opportunity serves this may be easily done with the common alembic taking care to throw away some pints of the first distilled as it is frequently liable to be foul by the uncleaness of the head of the still you must likewise take care to leave about a quarter of it in the still before you have finished your process to prevent the rising of any of its heterogeneous particles but in case of necessity where proper water is not to be had any kind of water may be used taking care to boil and filter it through paper which is not stiffened till some of the best water can be procured it is advisable that all those who make use of water in common as their drink would carefully abstain from all that are hard earthy and selenitous which are apt to disorder the stomach and give rise to strong concretions in the kidneys and other urinary passages especially if they meet with any slimy matter the only means of preventing this is by distillation which will separate even from the purest water some heterogeneous substances but this must be effected in balno mariae with alembics either of earth or glass taking care always to throw away the two or three first pints that pass into the receiver to avoid certain heterogeneous and volatile substances which rise by distillation with the first portions of water you must likewise finish your operation as soon as two thirds of your water is distilled because what remains in the still must be impregnated more or less with noxious particles which the water might imbibe was you to continue your process any longer the water thus distilled must be put into bottles well washed and rinsed with the above distilled water these bottles must be stopped with a glass stopple if the water has been well distilled it will preserve its limpidity after you have poured into it some drops of the solution of mercury by spirit of nitre this experiment must be made upon a small quantity of the distilled water   v nothing is of greater consequence in prescriptions than the ascertaining the just proportion remedies of this kind bear to each other i think the author has rather neglected in regard to his looking upon it himself as a topical one only he has been little anxious about the quantities used in lotions poultices etc for common cases nor is it indeed very material but when particular cases occur such as inflammations of the eyes ears throat and of other parts endued with no less a degree of sensibility the author seems to have mistaken the quantity of extract proper for the occasion see page  0  where he says for example speaking of the eyes put at first ten or twelve drops of it extract of saturn to a common glass of water and increase them gradually as the inflammation is seen to disperse  and after against the defluxions of the tympanum of the ear and occasional deafness taking care in these cases to add to the drops of the extract double the number of drops of camphorated brandy though common brandy may be used as for opthalmies  the indefinite measure of a glass of water gives here an equivocal sense it is always improper to prescribe a remedy by measure when it is to be used with circumspection nothing can be ascertained by a glass of water a coffee spoonful or drops these measures contain more or less according to the different places they are used in and drops may vary according to the consistence of the extract as all measures then vary and ever english and french weights compared paris weight grain    scrupule      dragme          once   0           marc                   livre

single figures in those of avoirdupois drachms i have made use of decimals  in the same country care must be taken where it is possible to make use of weights and to reduce foreign ones to those of the country we live in the author himself has followed the weights and measures of the country he does inhabit i will follow the english one called troy called in french poids de marc or silver smiths weight the same is used in paris as it has more affinity to the montpellier weight being divided like that into ounces drachms scruples and grains the troy pound indeed contains only twelve ounces and the montpellier sixteen but in the ounce there is only a difference of seven grains and an half the troy ounce being so much heavier than the montpellier in the dram the difference is less than a grain in the scruple not a third of one the grain differs more in proportion as the montpellier scruple is divided into twenty four grains and the troy scruple into only twenty but for the satisfaction of those who may be curious to know the exact difference between the english and montpellier weights i have added a table in which is expressed the value of the montpellier pound half pound ounce dram and grains both in troy and avoirdupois weight as likewise the several values of these sorts of weights compared with the montpellier and with each other and this i imagine will be the more welcome as most of the authors who treat of the comparison of english and french weights are more likely to mislead than to inform their readers i cannot help remarking here that the origin of different weights arose from the ancient custom of regulating them by that of a barley corn which served as a standard for all the rest by multiplying them into carats scruples drachms ounces pounds etc but as it necessarily happened that the barley corns made use of in different countries weighed more or less on account of their size moisture or dryness it gave rise to the difference of weights and made it difficult to ascertain precisely those of different countries it is much to be wished that the different powers of europe would come to a general regulation of weights it would be a change of much greater importance to trade than that of the old style which all nations have not adopted though there are none who would not find their account in having a general or universal standard for measure and weight this which was always looked on as an impossibility would be the most easy to be executed without any expense to governments and with the easiest one for every individual  but let us now return to the method of prescribing the extract of saturn and again resume our subject from which this episode has somewhat hurried me i shall then make use of the weight generally known by the name of troyweight the proper and generally prescribed quantity of extract to a bottle of pure water this ought to weigh    or  0 ounces is two drachms five penny weight if the extract is well made which quantity will make about a hundred and ten drops now if we suppose the bottle ought to weigh twentynine troy ounces and a glass of water to weigh about three ounces the quantity of extract according to the proportion given by mr goulard would exceed or at least be equal to that of the vegetomineral water prescribed by him for common uses when on the contrary the quantity ought to be diminished considerably so that i would recommend in inflammations of the eyes to put only two drops of the extract to every ounce of water and the same proportion to be observed in all cases where the sensibility of the part is equally delicate especially since mr goulard has brought his extract to so great a degree of perfection  the method of counting the drops is to have a cork bored from end to end through which pass a tube about the size of a small quill commonly called a pinion this quill must be cut off at both ends like the obtuse end of a toothpick and of the two extremities of the tube thus cut one enters into the bottle and the other remains on the outside of the cork by inclining the bottle downwards and putting the end of the forefinger upon the aperture of the tube you may let the drops fall at pleasure one after the other  mr goulard does not recommend his pomatum in opthalmies and i think with great reason greasy and oleagenous substances are always dangerous in inflammations of the eyes and erisipelatous complaints though they are equally advisable for those of the ears he ought to have recommended the frequent washing the eyes externally with the vegetomineral water and keeping a bolster constantly on them well wetted with that water this i have constantly practiced with success but you must be careful always to add some brandy and even that which is camphorated this omission on the part of the author in his first prescription gives an air of obscurity to the last part of his second paragraph by putting you in mind there of the necessity of making use of brandy in the second prescription as well as in the first a circumstance he has entirely omitted let it be remarked that camphorated brandy on all occasions is to be preferred to the noncamphorated as i shall endeavor to prove in the following article  vi it is my opinion that in the cases in which the author recommends the use of camphire one of the most antiphlogistic and antispasmodic medicines in physic or surgery he does not prescribe it in large quantities enough camphire is one of those medicines we use too sparingly not being sufficiently conversant in its effects which are always wonderful whether made use of externally or internally i would recommend a work of mr pouteau entitled melanges de chirurgie which would convince any one of the good qualities of this drug i know an english gentleman who not only preserves himself from but cures himself of many complaints by the use of camphire of which he takes inwardly a large quantity and always carries about him a box of it when i make use of this with the extract of saturn it is in large quantities and with some precautions different from those of mr goulard if it is given in small quantities it has no effect when mixed with pomatums cerates liniments it is obliged to undergo the heat of fire by which means the volatile parts of it are evaporated what remains of them insensibly passes away so that in a few days none is left whenever the vegetomineral water is made use of i would recommend the same quantity of camphorated brandy as the author prescribes of that which is not camphorated this camphorated brandy should be kept in a bottle well corked you must be careful likewise to fill it up now and then and see that the camphire you make use of for this purpose is not too airy but that it is fresh oily and of a strong perfume  vii mr goulard recommends the vegetomineral water to be warmed only during the winter and to make use of it in summer in its natural state this distinction may be a very just one at montpellier and in other warm climates but in england and other cold countries it is absolutely necessary always to warm it otherwise the metallic particles are not so thoroughly divided and by the waters being impregnated with the vegetable parts only the repelling property with which it is reproached only remains the same may be said of all cold waters they act as repellents by causing too great a tension in the fibers they ought to relax and the colder they are the greater is their repelling power but when warmed they are of a moistening relaxing softening and resolving quality but particular care must be taken not to exceed the dose above prescribed in inflammatory cases mr cosmond a celebrated surgeon has well observed that the leaden particles when introduced into the vessels in too large a quantity irritate and force them so considerably as frequently to add to the complaint instead of relieving it this is a fault that many who are ignorant of the effects of this remedy frequently fall into and often blame the medicine when themselves are only in fault  in cases where the lymph only is affected the same precaution is not necessary as a dram or two of extract more may be safely added to each bottle of water  viii such as are little versed in the knowledge of the medicinal virtues of metals are very apt to make cosmetic pomatums with the vegetomineral water these have followed the errors handed down to us by our ancestors who have made use of lead under various forms others did use such as magisteries of pewter and bismuth etc which have rather served to destroy the beauty of the skin than to preserve it the reason is evident these metals by infinuating themselves into the pores there depose some of their particles the most divided and by first opening and then filling up these pores spoil the finest features  these metallic particles become of a black dye and plainly show a leaden color which can be concealed only from the eye by the application of a white wash composed of the same drug which by plaistering over the surface of the skin add to its deformity the author of these remarks begs leave to caution the fair sex from trusting to these pomatums the composition of which is a secret the better to conceal the known poison they are fraught with which for a short time appears to answer their intentions only to give the deeper wound afterward time only can reestablish nature and the use of the pomatums described by the author in his treatise on ruptures p     by leaving out the gold and the saffron the first making the skin black the other yellow this pomatum without altering the skin softens and nourishes it preserves its transparency destroys tetters and redness fills up wrinkles and repairs all damages done to it either by the use of other pomatums or paint this pomatum is infinitely superior to that of saturn or the cerate for removing the piles for the scalding of the skin and to remove the spots which remain after the small pox if applied to it some time after the eruption  ix i must here add that the pure liquid extract of saturn it is the liquid extract only which is mentioned it this treatise mixed with double the quantity of oil of turpentine is the most sovereign remedy known against a sprain in a horse by rubbing him with this liniment as soon as the accident happens taking care to keep the part well covered till you have got him home to the stable if he should still continue lame or appear in pain you must rub him again before he grows cold and repeat this every four hours keep him well clothed and allow him but half his usual quantity of food and give him warm water with some bran in it to promote perspiration it seldom happens if these rules are attended to but that the cure is completed in fourandtwenty hours  copy of the power granted to the author of these remarks to provide the public with the original
