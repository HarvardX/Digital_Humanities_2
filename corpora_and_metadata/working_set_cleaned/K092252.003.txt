peculiar usefulness i hope the candid reader now and then calls to mind how much more nimbly he travels over these pages than the writer of them did when our dullness is complained of it would be but charity in him to reflect how much pains that same dullness has cost us more he may be assured than our brighter intervals where we sprung nimbly forward with an easy weight instead of toiling like a carriers horse whose slow and heavy pace argues the load he draws and the labor he endures alas for us poor novelists if there was no mercy for dull authors and our countrymen like the barbarous libethrians of old should take it into their minds to banish music and the muses out of the land and murder every orpheus that did not fiddle to their taste they should consider that the man who makes a book makes a very pretty piece of furniture and if they will but consign us to a quiet station on a shelf and give us wherewithal to cover us in a decent trim the worst amongst us will serve to fill up the file and stop a gap in the ranks  it is hard indeed to toil as we sometimes do to our own loss and disappointment to sweat in the field of fame merely to reap a harvest of chaff and pile up reams of paper for the worm to dine upon it is a cruel thing to rack our brains for nothing run our jaded fancies to a standstill and then lie down at the conclusion of our race a carcass for the critics and what is our crime all the while a mere mistake between our readers and ourselves occasioned by a small miscalculation of our capacities and their candor all which would be avoided if happily for us they had not the wit to find out our blunders or happily for them had all that good nature for us that we generously exercise toward ourselves if once they could bring their tempers to this charming complacency they might depend upon having books in plenty authors would multiply like polypusses and the press would be the happiest mother in the kingdom  how many worthy gentlemen are there in this blessed island of ours who have so much time upon their hands that they do not know what to do with it i am aware how large and respectable a portion of this enlightened nation center their delights in the chase and draw an elegant resource from the sagacity of the hound and the vigor of the horse but they cannot always be on the saddle the elements they cannot command and frost and snow will lock them up within their castle walls there it is possible that solitude may surprise them and dismiss them for a time to the solace of their own lucubrations now with all possible respect for these resources i should think it may sometimes be worth their while to make experiment of other peoples lucubrations when they have worn out their own for those must be but sorry thoughts which are not better than not thinking at all and the least they can gain by an author is a nap  the ingenuity of man has invented a thousand contrivances for innocently disposing of idle time let us therefore who write books have only the idlers on our side in gratitude for the amusement we give them and let the rest of the world be as splenetic as they will we may set their spleen at naught the majority will be with us  if a querulous infant is stilled by a rattle the maker of the rattle has saved somebodys ears from pain and persecution grant therefore that a novel is nothing better than a toy for children of a larger growth and more unruly age society has some cause to thank the writer of it it may have put an aching head to rest it may have cheered the debtor in his prison or the country squire in a hard frost traders will cry up the commodity they deal in therefore i do not greatly insist on the praises which some that write books have bestowed on bookwriting but i do observe that great respect is paid to an author by those who cannot read him wherefore i conclude those who can read and do not praise him are only silent because they want words to express their admiration and gratitude whilst those sanguine flatterers who in the excess of their respect for our persons cry down our performances give evident proof how much higher they had pitched their expectations of what our talents would produce than our productions could make good but though in their zeal for our reputations they tell us how ill we write they seldom neglect at the same time to show us how we might have written still worse  some overwise people have pretended to discover that this altercation between author and critic is nothing more than a mere plot and contrivance to play into each others hands like mountebank and zany but this is overacted sagacity and an affectation of finding more mysteries in the art of authorship than really belong to it for my part i believe it is a business of a more simple nature than most which can be taken up and that authors in general require nothing more than pen ink and paper to set up with in ancient times the trade was in few hands and the work seems then to have been composed with much pains and forethought materials were collected with great care and put together with consummate accuracy and attention every part was fitted to its place polished to the height and finished to perfection there were inspectors on the part of the public men of sound judgment and fully competent to the office who brought the work to a standard of rule and measure and insisted upon it that every whole should have a beginning a middle and an end under these strict regulations the ancients wrote but now that practice has made us perfect and the trade is got into so many hands these regulations are done away and so far from requiring of us a beginning middle and end it is enough if we can show a head and a tail and it is not always that even these can be made out with any tolerable precision as our authors write with less labor our critics review with less care and for every one fault that they mark in our productions there probably might be found one hundred that they overlook it is an idle notion however to suppose that therefore they are in league and concert with the authors they revise for where could that poor fraternity find a fund to compensate them for suffering a vocation once so reputable to fall into such utter disgrace under their management as to be no longer the employ of a gentleman as for our readers on whom we never fail to bestow the terms of candid gentle courteous and others of the like soothing cast they certainly deserve all the fair words we can give them for it is not to be denied but that we make occasionally very great demands upon their candor gentleness and courtesy exercising them frequently and fully with such trials as require those several endowments in no small proportion the farther i advance therefore in this work the civiller i will be and to those readers who shall follow me into this third volume i may with justice apply the epithets of patient persevering faithful and so on with a crescendo in my strain till the piece is concluded  but are there not also fastidious angry querulential readers readers with full stomachs who complain of being surfeited and overloaded with the storytelling trash of our circulating libraries it cannot be altogether denied but still they are readers if the load is so heavy upon them as they pretend it is i will put them in the way of getting rid of it by reviving the law of the ancient cecertaeans who obliged their artists to hawk about their several wares carrying them on their backs till they found purchasers to ease them of the burden was this law put in force against authors few of us i doubt would be found able to stand under the weight of our own unpurchased works  but whilst the public is contented with things as they are where is the wonder if the reform is never made by us till they begin it in themselves let their taste lead the fashion and our productions must accord to it whilst the cookeries of hannah glass outcirculate the commentaries of blackstone authors will be found who prefer the compilation of receipts to that of records as the easier and more profitable task of the two if puerilities are pleasing men will write ut pueris placeant  when demosthenes was engaged in the defense of a certain citizen of athens who was brought to trial upon a charge of a capital nature neither the importance of the cause nor the eloquence of the pleader could fix the attention of the judges who were sitting on the trial the orator observing their levity on a sudden stopped short in the midst of his harangue and addressing himself to the court  listen to me he cried ye venerable judges for a few moments and i will tell you a merry tale  a certain young man having occasion to take a journey from this city of ours to megara hired an ass for the job but being extremely incommoded on the way by a scorching sun which smote him with intolerable heat at noon he dismounted from his beast and made free to take post under the shade of his carcass upon this the assowner who accompanied him remonstrated with great vehemence contending that his ass was let for the journey simply and precisely and that the service now required of him was extraconditional and illegal the traveller with equal vehemence maintained that he was warranted in the use he made of him and that having hired the ass in substance he was entitled to the benefit of his shadow into the bargain the question was open to controversy and the parties went to trial on the case  here demosthenes ceased and taking up his brief prepared to leave the court the judges seeing this called out to him to return and go on with his pleading  for shame ye men of athens cried the indignant orator ye can lend your ears to the story of an ass but will not bestow your attention upon a trial that involves the life or death of a fellowcitizen  chapter ii our hero undergoes a strict examination by a certain judge called conscience as soon as our hero had brought blachford to consent to his disinterested proposal he took immediate measures for securing the success of it to bring the infant and its mother to an interview with the dying penitent was his first object the woman who had the child at nurse did not live above two miles off so that a messenger would soon fetch her over susan indeed was at a greater distance but the day yet served for bringing her from manstock and henry immediately sat down and wrote the following note  dear susan a business in which you are greatly interested requires your presence in this place mr blachfords life is so precarious that not an hour is to be lost i recommend it to you therefore to state this to your amiable lady and with her permission come away directly in the chaise that will attend for that purpose  yours sincerely henry   whilst henry was writing this note young tom weevil who had got notice of his arrival opportunely called upon him and no sooner understood that he wanted a messenger to manstock house than he zealously tendered his services for that errand and by henry was instructed to ride to the next market town which luckily was in the road and there put himself into a post chaise for the purpose of conveying susan in the most speedy and commodious manner  this business being thus adjusted and another messenger dispatched for the nurse and child our hero returned to the cottage and throwing himself into ezekiels wicker chair enjoyed for some minutes in silent reflection that heartfelt satisfaction that only can result from selfapproving conscience as he meditated on the sacrifice he was now about to make he felt a momentary gleam of virtuous exultation which tempted him to cry out  o ratcliffe dear departed friend thou woudst have praised me for this deed and if thy sainted spirit holds communication with me still i know thou will regard it as a pledge of my obedience to thy fatherly instructions but what is this i boast of nothing compared to the severer trial that awaits me and demands an effort strong indeed a sacrifice from which my heart shrinks back with terror and dismay oh be my guardian still let thy protecting spirit strengthen my feeble nature and inspire me with the resolution to fulfill the fatal promise i have made and pay the forfeit of my folly  married to fanny claypole  all hopes of happiness for ever blasted to repair her reputation wantonly exposed  hard terms indeed and heavy penalty i have exacted from myself in an unguarded moment but the word is passed and i must honorably make it good and fit i should if that is the atonement she requires for what but chance prevented the completion of my guilt the meditation therefore in my instance is the act itself and i am virtually her debtor to no less amount than for the loss of all that can be valuable to a modest woman i know the plea that some would make her forwardness her fondness her allurements if this were good in any case it would be so in mine but the excuse is mean and villainous that and that only can be my acquittal which acquits me to myself this cannot serve the turn my conscience never will be quieted by evasions it is true the act was frustrated what then i was not quite so abandoned as to sin in presence of a warning angel and can i ever lose the memory of that rebuke which the offended purity of that angel justly bestowed oh isabella how that frown made my heart sink within me never again shall i have confidence to look upon that lovely face which till that moment ever greeted me with smiles no more shall that sweet voice salute my ears like music as it was will not to do in the still hour of evening when we walked together those happy hours are never to return again  zachary cawdle now made his appearance having returned from his visit to lady crowbery  i bring you news said he of our excellent lady that will please you her disorder seems abated and i flatter myself she will gain strength and spirits to carry her through her journey both by land and sea she sets out tomorrow in the forenoon for manstockhouse where she will repose herself for that night i have her express commands to desire you will not fail to meet her there  i know not how that can be said henry she is very anxious it should be i can assure you rejoined the doctor and i believe she has very interesting matters to confer with you upon for she said she must positively see you as she could not express all she had to say by letter neither indeed do i hold it fit she should exhaust herself in writing for any length of time if it is your business with mr blachford that stands in the way i hope that may be dismissed before it will be necessary for you to set out tomorrow from this place  henry asked if her ladyship had said any thing on that subject not much zachary replied she had noticed it but slightly seeming to intimate a doubt whether it was matter of congratulation or not which i confess he added rather puzzled me to account for as her ladyship cannot fail to know that our neighbor will in the vulgar phrase die fat and let your expectations be what they may surely a good fortune in hand is a good thing at all events  most people are of that opinion said henry but her ladyship perhaps may think otherwise  whatever she thinks replied zachary i dare say she will keep it to herself till she meets you and converses with you at manstock  to this our hero made no further answer but turned the discourse by enquiring after mrs cawdle  her health said the doctor is no better her temper much worse and her enthusiasm more extravagant than ever blachfords situation seems to trouble her much she has lived with him as a sinner and would now fain part from him like a saint but he has refused all her tenders and has given his conscience into ezekiels keeping this mortifies her in a double sense for she not only meant to send him out of the world in the true faith but had an eye also to the good things he has to leave behind him of which she had no objection to come in for a share but thanks to the fates all that is otherwise disposed of as to the state of her constitution that is in a rapid decline from bad to worse being only held together like a sinking vessel by the very elements that sap and undermine it when i take my leave of her as i shall do tomorrow great chance if ours is not an everlasting farewell  this said zachary took his leave having many preparations to make for his approaching departure  henry was not sorry to be left to his reflections for his mind was greatly embarrassed by the message he had received from lady crowbery to present himself once more at manstockhouse was painful in the extreme to disobey the commands of a mother on so interesting a summons was an alternative not to be thought of how to avoid the one without transgressing the other was a point of difficulty that now engrossed his thoughts and as for zacharys concluding account of jemimas melancholy condition from that it is more than probable he had carried off very little if any information  the great evil of all that sunk deepest into his mind was his engagement to miss claypole a lady very little to his taste and the consequent loss of all hope that had respect to isabella a lady whom at his heart he most ardently admired and loved the disgrace he had incurred with himself as well as with her in that fatal moment of his weakness was a cutting recollection till then he had stood high in the good opinion of that excellent young lady every hour that he passed in manstockhouse whilst she was present made this more and more manifest even his natural humility of character could not overlook it he saw the advances he made in her good graces and only trembled for her danger lest they were too rapid every look every action that that was directed toward him had an expression not to be mistaken susans reports confirmed the interest that he had established in the approving heart of her lovely mistress and the satisfaction which she took in her evening walks with him with the innocent contrivances she had to prolong and to repeat them were flattering indications of an attachment forming fast if not already formed the greater therefore was his fall from hopes so elevated and what could he now expect from purity like here is but absolute dismission and contempt  as for the measures he was now to take toward his new discovered mother they seemed to offer nothing to his view but a maze of difficulties to lay open to her his embarassments and make a full confession of his faults and misfortunes was a task his resolution was not equal to neither did it seem a fit subject to discourse with her upon in her present state of health and spirits but how to keep it from her was the question how to stop so many channels through which the disgraceful story might find its way to her was a point not easily to be determined how far miss manstock might have spread her discovery was matter of uncertainty her delicacy would hardly be brought to continue the same intimacy with fanny claypole as before and every thing was to be dreaded from that young ladys flippant style of talking who would naturally make public the engagement she had entered into with him as an apology essential to her own defense these and many other apprehensions that pressed upon his thoughts were rendered doubly alarming when he took into his consideration the character of mr claypole from him he had every thing to expect that a jealous deepprojecting spirit could devise he saw to what extent his influence over sir roger manstock might be carried and he had no cause to doubt him well disposed to put it to the stretch for any object that he had at heart beset on all sides with such difficulties and in a straight from which he spied no honorable escape it is not to be wondered at if his thoughts wavered without any fixed resolve embarrassed and distressed  one small alleviation fortune granted him by the occupation of ezekiel at this time with with his penitent at next door he was not present to interpose and aggravate with fruitless declamations against the incontinence of susan may or the enormous crime of duelling which henrys affair with captain crowbery was sure to draw upon him when behold the whole matter brought to issue at once by the arrival of mr claypole himself now at the door of the cottage and at this very moment in the act of dismounting from his palfrey  chapter iii our hero undergoes a second examination by a certain judge with whom conscience has no concern though the reverend gentleman who now visited our hero in his humble cottage was left by us when last we attended upon him in the mind to defer this visit to the next morning yet second thoughts had made him change that resolve upon the prudent recollection of the many interventions a procrastinated measure is exposed to especially when it hangs upon the single security of a verbal promise extorted as it were by surprise and not deliberately given upon judgment and inclination he therefore thought it best to steal a march upon disappointment and without communicating his intentions to his niece making only a slight apology to sir roger mounted his horse and proceeded upon a round trot to the village of crowbery pondering by the way upon the measures he was to take and the language he was to hold for securing the important purposes of his secret expedition  there was an air of studied composure in his first approaches with a degree of obsequious ceremony that did not escape the penetrating observation of our hero henry who immediately assimilated his style of address to that of his visitor and kept himself on the reserve after the usual salutations had passed and repassed between them claypole began to open his commission in the following manner  i wait upon you sir on the behalf of an orphan niece for whose happiness and reputation i have all that tender interest which as a father i could entertain for an only child miss claypole give me leave to say is a young lady on whose character not the slightest imputation hitherto has been known to rest judge therefore with what exquisite sensibility she feels the consequences of last nights event and with what poignant inquietude she is now waiting the confirmation of that promise which alone can heal those feelings and relieve her anxious mind from its suspense she is by nature endowed with the warmest affections those affections you have gained your fine person engaging attentions and amiable character have made a conquest of her heart and love which in colder bosoms ripens by degrees in here is sprung up at once to full maturity and gave you unequivocal proofs how much you was beloved and trusted i will not give the name of prudence to a passion of this cast i must as a divine and moralist condemn excess in every shape even our most virtuous propensities must have bounds set to their exertions and errors though arising from motives the most generous merit some reproof yet i will confess to you that if in any instance i could find excuse for an unbounded confidence it would be in yours relying as i do with so much justice on your honor and integrity of principle but sir the virgin fame of an untainted character is delicate in the extreme it is a blossom shrinking at the blast withering and drooping with the touch those fond unguarded moments which the sensualist calls golden opportunities the man of honor should account as sacred and hold the heart which love commits into his hands as an inviolable trust now it has so happened whether casually or providentially we will not enquire that those very proofs of confidence and affection which must have endeared her to you have exposed her to reproach and shame and obliged her to fly from the society she was in to my solitary parsonage where she is now hiding herself in retirement and exclusion from all visitors but yourself anxiously awaiting the completion of your promise to restore her to her reputation her happiness and friends it is not therefore that i harbor any doubt of your good faith it is not that i can suppose you lost to honor or insensible to the beauty fortune and good qualities of my niece that i now require a confirmation of your word of honor from your own lips but simply that i may be authorized not only to put her inquietude to rest but also to assure sir roger manstock whose delicacy suffers great alarm by what has passed beneath his roof that there is no call for his remonstrances nor any insult meditated to a lady under his protection and for whose redress he holds himself responsible  here claypole ceased and henry replied as follows  a very few words sir will suffice to answer all you have been pleased to say i perfectly well remember what i have promised to miss claypole and i want neither menaces nor persuasions to induce me to perform it  give me leave then cried claypole interposing to felicitate you on the possession of a lady whom i have the vanity to say the best gentleman in the kingdom might be proud to call his wife i boast not of her fortune sir that is but a secondary consideration where so many admirable qualities conspire to make the union happy and fortune perhaps though with many the first object may have lost much of its weight if any it ever had in your esteem since this great accession has so luckily devolved upon you  truly sir said henry in reply miss claypoles fortune never weighed with me and as for this extraordinary bequest of mr blachfords which was totally unthought of it is evident from the recency of the event that it could never be in contemplation of that lady at the moment of our engagement it was as you observe a lucky cast of chance and therefore i conceive whether i may or may not be benefited by it it does not regularly come into question between you and me  not as a principal perhaps but collaterally it does it gives you means which you was unprovided with before and therefore as a friend soon to be connected with you in a near degree you cannot wonder if i feel a lively interest in an event so calculated to promote your happiness  right sir resumed henry it will promote my happiness as all things must that please me on reflection and enable me to say within myself i have fulfilled the golden rule of doing as i would be done by  that is indeed said claypole gravely the great rule of christian equity but i must own i do not at this time exactly see your application of it for i should suppose the point of conscience rather lies with blachford than with you  i rather think it lies with both an act of conscience which we share between us  i comprehend you now less than i did before quoth the baffled interrogator will you be pleased to explain to me  in one single word mr blachford has a son  claypole started threw himself back in his chair and striking his hands together after the fashion of his patron sir roger exclaimed  well sir a son what then some bastard well suppose  and if we do suppose it such what then said henry retorting his words rather acrimoniously and pretty nearly in the same key and cadence  claypole paused he recollected probably the point his question bore ad hominem and cooly answered that the law did not acknowledge persons of that description  but you and i are neither of us lawyers replied our hero softening his manner you are a divine a moralist professed and as for me poor although i am and probably in the very same predicament with this son of nature yet i would fain aspire to copy that great rule of christian equity approved by you and show that i am not wanting in a sense of honor toward others no less than toward miss claypole  still i am puzzled rejoined claypole to comprehend your meaning you tell me blachford has a son you have not told me that he means to leave him his estate  permit me first to ask what you would counsel him to do had you his conscience in your care  that is a question for myself not him i understood that you was made his heir by will  and so i am said henry but my will must be consenting to the execution of the deed  and what should hinder it it is an atonement for a murderous attempt he bestows upon you his fortune he sought to take away your life  he gave life to this innocent  some beggars brat perhaps blachford was very low in his amors a small provision may suffice for such an one  but i said henry am no son of blachfords i covet not his gold i can forgive my enemy without a bribe but i cannot strip the child of its inheritance to purchase the worlds wealth i cannot do it and i think you do not wish to see me rich on such conditions  to this the reverend visitor replied i should have thought young gentleman that you had felt the smart of poverty sufficiently to warn you from encountering it afresh an unconnected being in the world may be romantic at his own expense but you are not this being you have claims upon you nearer i should suppose and dearer to you than this brat of blachford which possibly some hussy fathers on him falsely and i am unwilling to believe you seriously intend to throw good fortune from you when you so happily might share it with a wellbeloved wife  had that lady ever had a share in it replied henry or had that fortune ever been but hinted at as a contingency within the scope of speculation i should have something to account for but you must be conscious how very recently this thing has dropped upon me and that it is an unlookt for opportunity of being just at my own cost no other person has a part in what i sacrifice and what is that mans honesty which does not reach beyond his interest if we do well and suffer for it that service is acceptable this being a christian principle i cannot doubt but it is yours  at these words the reverend personage assumed a look of more than ordinary gravity in which it is possible some mixture of wrath might be discernible and thus made answer  it is not now a question what my principles may be but what yours are and i suspect that under a romantic idea of justice to others you forget the justice due to yourself and those connected with you if you can lavish blachfords whole estate away at a stroke what security have i that you would not serve miss claypoles in the like manner was it in your power such principles as these are dangerous to the peace and prosperity of families and you cannot wonder if in point of prudence i am somewhat staggered he that enriches beggars may make rich folks poor what will my lady crowbery say to this proceeding  i have not asked her  but it will much import you so to do this fortune would have made you independent you have now nothing to look to but her favor and how is it certain when this business shall be known she may not think fit to withdraw it it is right at least that her intentions should be understood before we venture further you have also been engaged in a duel with a relation of lord crowberys these are altogether such proceedings as may cause a change of sentiment in your patroness and what then becomes of my poor niece i must be certified from that noble personage herself in what light she regards this most extraordinary measure  to this henry replied  if you act solely for yourself in this affair mr claypole you will act solely from your own judgment if for your niece you will probably consult her wishes before you take a step so totally subversive of the whole transaction as your reference to lady crowbery would be  i dont understand you sir did you propose to marry without her consent  i certainly had not pledged her consent in my promise and did not therefore engage more than myself to the performance of it if miss claypole accepts that promise my honor is attached to it and i hold it sacred if it is referred to lady crowbery my responsibility is taken off and i shall act by her decision i hold it as a point of honor to miss claypole thus to state it to you the alternative is before you  mr claypole paused for reflection and then demanded how would you advise us to proceed when it appears that you have nothing to depend upon but the eventual bounty and protection of the lady crowbery but there is yet another thing added he to be explained you informed my friend sir roger manstock by a letter which i saw that you was going out to sea with captain carry i trust you have no thoughts of that  pardon me sir such is my full intention  is that consistent cried claypole with your promise to my niece  perfectly so she will have no cause to complain of it  but will sir roger manstock think you not oppose his nephews taking you on board his ship under such circumstances  i should much fear he will replied henry if you exert your influence to dispose him so to do in that case i must take some other means  then you are resolved at all events to go  i am  and what to do permit me to inquire  i hope said henry you will not press me on that question seeing we do not treat entirely upon confidence had we so done i should hold nothing back the affair is now entirely with miss claypole in her hands i deposit my honor and my destiny if she accepts them unconditionally as they were pledged she has then a right to be informed of my intentions if not the secret dwells with me  claypole foresaw that here the conference must end that secret he replied may easily be guessed at  then added in conclusion  i shall make true report of what you tell me to my niece  chapter iv the decree of the judge without conscience is reversed mr claypole had risen from his seat and was upon the point of departing when ezekiel bolted into the room with unaccustomed alacrity and running up to our young hero threw his arms about his neck curiosity or some deeper motive fixed the reverend visitor to the spot and the animated enthusiast who probably did not know there was a third person present proceeded to cry out in an ecstatic tone  henry my son my child my glorious generous boy may heaven shower down its blessings on your head come to my heart for it runs over with affection for you no no i cannot part from you i never will i will work for you pray for you nay by the lord i will fight for you  having whilst he uttered these last words quitted his embrace to put himself in a martial attitude correspondent with the sentiment he cast his eyes upon the person of the lookeron  under favor reverend sir he said i protest i did not advert to your person being present mr claypole or i am mistaken  the same cried claypole at your service  not so worthy sir rejoined ezekiel you serve no human master and i hail the happy chance that brings you hither to partake of that delight that christian joy and exultation which your heart must feel as preacher of the word of truth and charity to see this youth a stripling in the race that is set before us outstep all competitors and seize the glorious goal of victory over mammon and all his sordid lucreloving filthy worshippers at an age green in experience gray thank heaven in virtue charity and every christian grace yes reverend sir you must surely rejoice and be glad inasmuch as our friend henry now appertains to your flock and report speaks loudly of you as of a faithful pastor in christ and i your poor fellow servant and follower at due distance venerate you therefore how then must your pious bosom glow to see that this our friend has sacrificed a noble fortune to his love of justice rejected treasures poured into his lap treasures that might have tempted hermits from their cells to save the sinners soul and clear his conscience for the great account there is that makes himself rich yet has nothing there is that makes himself poor yet has great riches faith the wise man behold this good deed has our young man done and verily he shall have great riches in the true sense of the proverb he has not taken away the inheritance of the poor destitute he has not robbed the childrens children of their bread therefore he shall have an inheritance amongst the children of light i have this instant left the couch of the dying man i pronounce him a true penitent the thorns that lurked within his pillow thy hand my henry has drawn his death will be easy his spirit will expire in blessings his child is now his heir the will is closed and he longs to clasp him in his arms the poor deluded wench whom his base arts seduced the widows only child will now be comforted and when i have set before her eyes the loathsomeness of sin in proper colors i have good hope she will tread the paths of purity hereafter at least she shall not want for exhortations on my part the daughter of our friendly widow may shall not be lost for lack of spiritual assistance and advice  how is this exclaimed claypole turning himself toward henry is susan may the mother of a son by blachford and has the daughter of my friend sir roger manstock been harboring a strumpet in her service  a strumpet do you call her cried ezekiel reverend sir i pray you be advised more truly i do pronounce susan may to be no strumpet albeit the mother of this babe for virtue undermined by artifice or violated by force is virtue not the less and charity will give it its true name with pity and compassion superadded your master reverend sir and mine condemned not her that was taken even in adultery itself shall we forgetting his divine benevolence condemn this damsel sacrificed by treachery divested of reason by the operation of seducing and intoxicating potions and then thrown insensible and unresisting on the impure couch of the defiler forbid it charity that you or i or any one of christian training should call that guiltless sufferer a strumpet  claypole had heard enough confounded vexed indignant he now started from his seat and snatching up his hat whispered a few words to henry and then darting an angry look at honest daw hastily departed  chapter v our hero is admitted to an unexpected conference whilst this was passing in the cottage captain crowbery after his rencontre with henry had returned to the castle and in a conversation with his cousin the viscount had done justice to the spirited behavior of his antagonist relating the grounds of their quarrel the words that had passed at their meeting and all the particulars consequential of it now it so happened that the peer was conscious of being as deep in the plot of the pressgang as his kinsman but he was not conscious of the same courage to face the resentment of our hero the story therefore caused certain perturbations in his lordships mind not altogether agreeable and he became extremely anxious to be assured that the affair was made up so completely that no afterreckonings could be started which he himself might be called upon to account for nothing humbles some peoples pride so much as fear the pride of lord crowbery hardly stooped to any other corrector on the present occasion it was thoroughly brought down by more fears than one for the captain had brought the news of henrys being heir to blachford which not only cut up his lordships interested expectations from that quarter but brought to his recollection certain papers and correspondences in the possession of the said testator which would naturally fall into the hands of his executor and disclose matters very inconvenient to his lordship to have revealed how to get these out of henrys reach was now the question he had called frequently at the sick mans door for that purpose but had never been admitted and to these documents if they were yet in existence not only his reputation but what was dearer to him still his personal safety was committed  it was now that he regretted his former haughty treatment of our hero he felt himself the dupe of blachford and perceived that he had practiced upon his jealousy with no other view but to serve his own revengeful purposes and engage him as a party in his plots against an innocent man nay it is to be presumed he was not quite proof against the many instances of henrys honorable conduct and the impression captain crowbery had now received of our heros behavior was such as had made a total change in his sentiments and that gentleman was now become as zealous an advocate and admirer as before he was an enemy and a persecutor of henry lord crowbery who had motives not quite so honorable but not less cogent for making his peace with our hero lent a willing ear to the commendations that his cousin bestowed upon him and declared himself so fully convinced that he had been betrayed by blachford into groundless jealousies and suspicions that he proposed inviting him to his house and indulging him with a visit to his benefactress upon the eve of her departure as a token of his entire reconciliation and to do away by this mark of his confidence all those reports that had been circulated against the reputation of his lady  this proposal being heartily seconded by the captain lord crowbery immediately repaired to the chamber of his lady and approaching her with a mild and gracious look he began by assuring her that he had entirely and for ever dismissed every relic of unkindness and suspicion from his mind that he was sensible he had been led into error and alarmed without reason as to her partiality for henry that he saw it now not only in the most innocent but most amiable light and he wished her to persist in the protection of one so well deserving lest she should doubt the sincerity of his conversion to an opinion so directly opposite to what he had lately held he repeated in short the substance of the conversation he had just had with his kinsman and concluded by saying that as he was persuaded she must wish to see henry and to take leave of him before her departure he proposed with her consent to send for him to his house where she herself should be a witness of the reception he would give him  lady crowbery heard this proposal with a sensation of pleasure not entirely clear from suspicion of its sincerity yet as she could readily comprehend some reasons that her lord might have for altering his tone at least if not his temper she was not backward to embrace it with as good a grace as she was capable of assuming few favors could be less expected than that of her being permitted to visit manstock house this was an indulgence far beyond all hope or conjecture yet as she owed the first to the influence of mr l  she might also be indebted to him jointly with captain crowbery for this further instance of a revolution either real or affected in the conduct and opinions of her lord and now the captain with much alacrity undertook to be the bearer of a very civil invitation to our hero on the part of the viscount requesting him forthwith to repair to the castle where lady crowbery was expecting his arrival  he obeyed the summons and being prepared for a kind reception by the captain who accompanied him from the cottage he was ushered without delay to the chamber of his mother where my lord was waiting and with as much address as he was master of welcomed him to his house saying that he hoped all former misunderstandings would be forgotten and that they might be good friends and neighbors in all future time to this henry made a proper reply in the same style of civility and approached toward lady crowbery to pay her his respects silently and cautiously with a tender look of pity and attention her languid but still lovely countenance cut him to the heart the change her frame and features had undergone since last he saw her was too visible turning from a spectacle so affecting he said  it is very kind in you my lord to allow me to pay this melancholy duty to my benefactress it is generous to have this consideration for one who with all the purest sentiments of gratitude to the only friend he has in life is now at length permitted to approach her i humbly thank you for this great indulgence  his voice could execute no more  not a word was attempted by the mother  i will leave you to yourselves said lord crowbery and give orders that you shall not be disturbed your time and privacy shall be your own  the door was shut his step was heard upon the stairs nature was freed from all restraint henry dropped on his knee and bathed his mothers hand with tears  my son my son was all that she could utter to attempt the recapitulation of this tender dialogue would be in vain for words can ill describe a scene like this and he must be an actor rather than author that can give life to representatives of son and mother in such touching situations the matter not the manner lies within my powers henry imparted to her his plan of meeting her at lisbon by the favor of captain carry now upon the point of sailing  did she approve of his so doing  she most highly approved of it and warmly recommended it for reasons interesting to him no less than to herself she had received a verbal intimation through a confidential channel from his father mr delapoer avowing himself the person who had sent her the ring as a token of his affectionate remembrance of her and faithful adherence to his first vows through many years of absence and a long course of various adventures that he still considered himself as her husband in heart and hearing with the deepest concern that her case was such as made it necessary for her to resort to lisbon he had determined to hasten thither himself in the hope that he might be permitted there to devote his honorable attentions to her service and approve himself still gratefully impressed with that pure but ardent attachment which no absence had been able to abate and which to the last hour of life he should unalterably retain  this intelligence was in all respects most satisfactory to henry who had now a certainty of his father being living and a fair prospect of retrieving his late disappointment by a speedy meeting we shall not be minute in detailing all that was said by the respective parties upon this interesting topic nor shall we be more particular in stating what passed between them on the subject of blachfords will it may suffice to say that henrys disinterested renunciation of the bequest in favor of a natural heir met with full approbation and applause from his generous mother who concluded her remarks upon the transaction by declaring that from the first moment she had heard of it she had never cordially reconciled herself to the circumstance of her sons being made heir to a fortune so amassed and so devised which not only robbed him of the credit of forgiving a repentant enemy freely and unconditionally but which would probably involve him in trouble and perplexity and set him forth to the world under a suspicion of foul dealing which she could not bear to have his character exposed to and be made a topic for detraction for the mere worldly advantages of stepping into a mans fortune who bore no other relation or alliance to him than as one who having been his enemy and intentional assassin had by a deathbed repentance been converted to a friend and unexpected benefactor it was therefore with the most heartfelt satisfaction she saw him endowed with spirit to judge and act so consonantly to her feelings without any advice on her part or any knowledge on his of the extent of her intentions toward him which she would now inform him were no less than to bequeath him the whole and entire estate of her father which by will she was invested with a property so ample that the superfluous bequest of mr blachford was no longer worth a thought  this led her to speak of sir roger in whose hands she had lodged her will and after enquiring of her son how he had passed his time at manstock house with a view to discover what the state of his heart was toward the fair isabella turning to him with a look of maternal affection she said  ah my beloved henry would you know the first and warmest wish of your fond mothers heart it is that you may gain an interest with that lovely girl so formed to make you happy i know her to be so devoted to her father as to have professed certain resolutions which i hold to be romantic and i can well believe it must be a lover of no common qualities that can induce her to forego them but as you cannot in your present unacknowledgd character hope to engage the consent of my uncle nor honorably make known your real pretensions to isabella herself i have that perfect trust in her honor that i am ready to confide to her alone the secret of your being my son if you can give me hope there is that disposition in her which upon this discovery might be improved to your advantage tell me therefore with sincerity how you stand in her good graces and tomorrow when she and i are alone at manstock i will be your advocate and throw myself upon her candor for your sake  heaven bless you for your goodness cried henry how can i ever thank you as i ought what can i say or do or undertake for your sake that may but in the least degree demonstrate to you my gratitude for all your bounties let me attempt some act of duty which no son has ever yet aspired to let me forbear to think of love and isabella whilst your life so dear to me above all earthly blessings hangs in this dangerous suspense i will not suffer any other thought to lodge within my heart oh my beloved honored mother let me devote myself to you alone  here he again cast himself at her feet whilst she threw her arms about his neck and pressed him to her bosom  my son my soul she cried this transport of affection is a cordial to your sick mother that gives her a new life your love revives me my dear child and seems to animate my languid frame with health and strength is it not fit that i should live for him that gives me life and now my son without more questioning i have found you out your heart is in my sight i see the lovely isabella has possession of it how should it be otherwise how should such beauty modesty good sense and sweetness fail to gain the affections of a soul congenial to her own you love her henry and as it is not in your nature to prevaricate it is not in your nature to deny it  at this moment zachary cawdle entered the apartment bearing in his hand a phial which although its contents were of a restorative quality we doubt if his patient was not more annoyed by his interruption than profited by his cordial  chapter vi the conference is interrupted resumed and concluded though zachary was informed that henry was with his patient and knew without being informed that the minutes of their privacy were extremely precious yet as he was fixed in the opinion that all things ought to give way to medicine and method he did not permit any scruples to stop him as soon as ever the clock gave notice that the four hours draught was in turn to be repeated in this instance however the feelings of the son did not entirely correspond with those of the mother and the interruption that gave pain to her was to him a sensible relief for in this interval of time he had so far recollected himself as to be prepared against the dilemma to which he was now driven with respect to isabella the first caution that occurred to his thoughts was to divert lady crowbery from her proposal of divulging the secret of his birth to miss manstock or taking any measures with that young lady for interesting her in his favor esteeming it unfair that any attempt should be made on her affections on his behalf circumstanced as he was with respect to fanny claypole the next thing that struck him was the propriety of holding back from his mother the vexatious embarrassment he was involved in with the lady last mentioned at least till the result of her uncles report and her resolutions thereupon were made known to him from the language lately held by mr claypole he still nourished a faint hope that it was possible he might be set loose from his unfortunate engagement an emancipation that he would have thought cheaply purchased by the sacrifice of blachfords legacy and in this interim why was he to be the first to publish an affair not over delicate in the recital and certainly not very reputable to the lady in question if he was dismissed the least he could do was to keep his own secret if not it became his interest to uphold her reputation by all the means in his power he therefore prudently determined not to open himself on this painful and afflicting subject  no sooner had the punctual man of medicine left them at liberty to resume their conversation than henry taking up the subject where lady crowbery had left it addressed himself to her as follows  i should be ashamed of prevarication in your presence more especially as you declare that my heart is in your sight which that it may deserve to be both now and for ever it behooves me to keep it clear from dissimulation and hypocrisy i am flattered therefore when you say that you discern in it affection and esteem for the loveliest and most amiable of her sex as i must own you would have reason to turn away your eyes with loathing and aversion had you found it unempassiond by her charms or insensible to her perfections blessed indeed must be the man who could boast of the possession of a heart like here is and whose pretensions might be sanctiond by her fathers free consent but as i hold myself excluded from all chance of such a blessing and am persuaded that my destiny is otherwise directed i do most earnestly implore my kind and generous mother not only not to let the secret of my birth and the too liberal disposition of her fortune pass her lips but also to refrain from moving the soft heart of isabella in my favor let that sweet nature be at peace nor stir her any farther to a thought of me than as of one who knows himself unworthy her regards and hopelessly admires and honors her if i had ever any place in her affections let it wear out by absence let me like her devote myself to filial duty and then although our objects are alike our destinations will be widely apart lisbon and manstock house will make a chasm between us over which i hope no sigh of here is will ever pass that you believe me worthy such a blessing is an honor above all merit that you would risque your secret and engage yourself to plead for me to isabella is a mark of your benevolence for which i am ever bound to you but i most solemnly implore you for the present to withold it  well my dear henry the tender mother replied i will not go counter to your wishes but give you credit for the principle on which you act though i confess you puzzle and surprise me reasons i must suppose you have more than you think it needful to display and as i have firm reliance on your rectitude of thought and conduct i will not embarrass you with any questions on this point are we to meet at manstock house  with your permission no i look to join the ship tomorrow  i hope you have no farther differences to adjust with captain crowbery  none replied henry absolutely none upon my honor i am in perfect reconciliation with that gentleman and hold myself for ever bound to testify to his most honorable and manly behavior in an affair where i was much too warm  have you any thing in commission for me to say to my uncle  nothing but my most grateful thanks for all his goodness  and what to isabella  oh my dear madam exclaimed henry why that question let me conceive in silence but not vent those wishes even in a whisper ask me not what to isabella my whole soul is here is yet would my tongue be the veriest traitor to the cause of honor and humanity were it to tell her how i dote upon her by the love you bear me i conjure you do not let her know the insolent confession which your sudden question has drawn from me twill ruin me for ever in her thoughts if she should hear that i presume so much as but to name her though it were in my prayers  what is this you tell me she cried now henry now i own you rouse my curiosity to know what thought so dreadful harbors in your heart what have you done to ruin yourself with isabella confess for the alarm is terrible surely my son surely your passion has not mastered your respect  just heaven renounce me if in thought i could offend against such purity no madam he cried no your son is not a savage and if i were her virtue would restrain and awe the wildest and the worst of natures  what then said she reduces you to hold this language it is not mere respect that dictates to you words like those you uttered the most humble supplicant nay henry the most abject selfconvicted offender would not so address himself to any human being  what have i said resumed he oh that i could recall my words but you will not release them what can i say must i confess to you i have offended isabella past redemption shocked her chaste eyes revolted her pure nature not indeed in her own person that were to sin as it were against heaven but in the person of another far far different alas from her there let me stop press me no farther i conjure you let her divulge the rest and if she does defend me not dear mother but tell her i am consciencesmitten selfcondemned and punished more than ever wretch was punished in the loss of her esteem  if i did not persuade myself she replied that you are incapable of any thing that is grossly wrong i should be truly wretched but as i am firm in that persuasion and satisfied by your assurance that the offense does not personally affect my co isabella i will not believe that you need  to despair of pardon i guess it is some dy boyish scrape which you have fallen into and i can also guess with whom but lovers use strong language when they speak of their quarrels and i can allow a great deal for your extraordinary sensibility a frown a pout a pettish word can make strange havoc with a heart feeling and fond as yours but isabella will forgive you take my word for it henry i shall find a soft moment to make your peace and send you a full pardon upon proper submission and atonement  henry had by this time collected his thoughts sufficiently to see the danger into which he had been surprised and how far he had outstept discretion in this unguarded declaration of his passion he was therefore eager to avail himself of the opening which his mothers temperate answer gave him for drawing back in time to save himself without committing fanny claypole and though it was pretty clear that lady crowberys suspicion pointed at susan may yet as she was not directly named and time would quickly serve for him to clear her character he acquiesced in the deception and was silent  it was now time to put an end to their conference but before this took place he was fain to compound for a release from all further enquiries by promising to remain where he was during the whole of the next day when he was to hold himself amenable to any summons that his mother after her arrival at manstock house might think fit to send him this compromise being acceded to on his part and sealed with a maternal embrace on that of lady crowbery they tenderly took leave of each other and parted  chapter vii the penitent on his deathbed atones to justice when henry arrived at the cottage he found the nurse with susan mays child waiting his return in a few minutes after the chaise with the mother herself drove to the door ezekiel daw was at this time in attendance upon his penitent henry put the nurse and child into the inner chamber and no third person being present at his meeting with susan he proceeded without interruption to explain to her the purposes for which he had called her from manstock house and in speaking of her connection with blachford treated her feelings with such delicacy assuring her that by the confession of her seducer she would stand acquitted to all that heard the story that his consideration for her character no less than the very extraordinary sacrifice he had made to her interest so affected her as to leave her no other powers of expressing her gratitude except what her tears which flowed in plenty could supply  wonder not he cried at what i have done as if it was a case uncommon for a man to be just and honest what have i to do with blachford and his money if he had bequeathed it to me and died before i had made this discovery of the claim you have upon him i should have held myself obliged in conscience to make over what he left me to your son and you new i do not wish to make a parade of my disinterestedness and should hold it rather as an affront to be complimented for an act of justice regarding it as a hint that they suspected me to be a knave i therefore think myself very happy to have found your secret out in time to make that an act of atonement on his part which had it devolved upon me would have put me to the trouble of a conveyance and annoyed me very probably with a great deal of that popularity and applause which some people are flattered with but which i have no taste for  when henry by this and other representations like this perceived that he had in some degree quieted the agitation of susans spirits he put her in mind to make ready for an interview with the father of her child and having stepped into the inner room he presented to her sight the child itself giving it into her arms and declaring it to be his ward and the infant heir of blachford the beauty of the child the ecstacy of the mother the astonishment of the nurse and the benevolence depicted in the features of our blooming hero composed a group of characters not totally unworthy the historic pencil of the painter of the passions  the generous heart of henry in the contemplation of this scene enjoyed a more luxurious banquet than the wealth of blachford could have purchased true gratitude like deepfelt woe is not to be discharged by words susan was mute and once if henry had not stopped her she was falling at his feet  what are you about to do he cried remember you once tendered me your all i am only paying you with what is not my own  and now bidding her take heart and follow him he proceeded with her the infant and the nurse to the sick mans house they were admitted without delay blachford was impatiently expecting them and ezekiel daw was in the chamber with him henry took the child in his arms and advancing to the couch presented it to its father  i have brought he cried two comforters to visit you the one in the person of this smiling cherub seems the very emblem of peace the other pointing to susan as he spoke by your justice reinstated in her innocence and indemnified for her injuries will heal those inward pains that agonize us more than all our fleshly wounds accept them cherish them embrace them they will brighten every moment of your life and the last moment more than all in this life they will be the witnesses and recorders of your penitence in the life to come your advocates and intercessors at the throne of mercy  blachford took the child in his arms and listing up his eyes exclaimed  the lord of mercy grant their intercessions may avail  amen echoed the pious ezekiel from a corner of the room to which he had retreated and where dropping on his knees he silently put up a fervent and let us hope not ineffectual prayer  blachford whose mind was now prepared for death and felt the awful coming on was instant in his wishes to complete the last remaining task he had to do on earth whilst yet his senses were entire the lawyer was in waiting and zachary with his subsurgeon kinloch coming in most opportunely at the instant all things seemed to favor the important work and nothing now was wanting but the concluding forms to make it perfect blachford was raised upon his couch to sign and seal the materials were set before him the witnesses stood round him when turning his eyes on zachary first and next on kinloch he said  i call upon you gentlemen to attest upon the faith of honest men and able judges of my situation that i am now in mental faculties sound and competent to execute this deed declaring it my will and testament by which i make this infant born of susan may here present and my son of her begotten out of wedlock sole heir of all my property save what is herein given and bequeathed to her the mother by annuity charged on the estate also one small acknowledgment of five hundred pounds to this my executor and guardian of my son henry fitzhenry so called at whose solicitation voluntarily and generously made i have revoked the former disposition of my affairs in his behalf a most disinterested and conscientious act it was and i do pray him to accept this small bequest in token of my love and his forgiveness conscious as i am of his unequalled worth and deeply penitent for all that i have said or done or meditated in his wrong and further i enjoin and strictly charge the mother of my child to be observant of his counsel and advice and firmly to impress upon the mind of this her infant as he grows to years of reason and reflection what he owes to this his benefactor by whose special bounty he is now endowed with affluence that else it never could have been his fortune to enjoy  having said this and the appeal he had made to zachary and his attendant being answered with assurances of their entire conviction of his being in perfect possession of his senses a point indeed which no one of his hearers could be deceived in he signed and sealed his will and after it was witnessed delivered it to henry exhausted by these efforts he began so evidently to droop that doctor cawdle in virtue of his medical authority dismissed the whole company the mother child and nurse were by blachfords desire accommodated with beds in his house henry contented himself with his quarters at the cottage but having hitherto abstained from asking any questions about a matter that was nearest to his heart and the business to which he had devoted his first attention being so happily concluded he became impatient for a few minutes in private with his friend susan of this wishedfor opportunity he was soon put in possession for ezekiel on whose mind these events had made a powerful impression had walked home in deep meditation without saying a word to any body whereupon susan having given her boy in charge to the nurse retired with henry into blachfords parlour it was the very room where the one party had been arraigned for his life and the other despoiled of her innocence what mighty revolutions can a few short days effect the offender at the point of death the sufferers restored to their character and the property of the guilty including the very scene of his criminality actually made over as an atonement to the guiltless  henry to prevent interruption made fast the door and taking susan by the hand led her to a chair she was still trembling with agitation tremors of another sort would have possessed her had henry so done a while ago she now looked up to him with aweful admiration love tempered with respect gave that chaste expression to her eyes which on some past occasions had exhibited affections not so pure passions as irresistible as that which now had command of her more than once had impelled her to embrace him wantonly in her arms pure gratitude unmixed with any grosser impulse now threw her bathed in tears upon his neck he pressed her tenderly to his bosom spoke of the kindnesses she had so often shown him and asserted obligations received on his part prior and superior to these conferred on her when having soothed her in this generous manner for some minutes  now tell me i conjure you he cried and tell me truly am i totally undone in the opinion of your lovely mistress  alas she replied what can i tell you my dear friend and benefactor certain it is that gentle heart is wounded through and through but whether more by displeasure than by sorrow i am yet to learn she is very silent on the subject and it is not from her lips that the story has escaped it is miss claypole herself and her politic uncle pardon me if i cannot speak of them with the respect that becomes me who have made public what my young ladys delicacy never would have spoken of and what theirs one should have thought would have been interested to conceal but when miss thought fit to blazon her own shame by bouncing out of the house and betaking herself to the parsonage as if she had been flying from her persecutors the whole family were up in arms as i may say and every mouth was opened to cry shame upon her it is not to be told with what a confidence she has carried it off venting herself against my meek young lady in a manner that i am sure you would detest her for ah my beloved friend where were your eyes your heart your understanding during that fatal galleryadventure i can no otherwise account for it than by supposing you was not in your senses at the moment knowing how temperate you are and unaccustomed to excess i must impute it to the effects of the wine you drank upon the election meeting and so i told my lady  you told her true said henry but what then one bestiality cannot excuse another  pardon me rejoined susan her candor found a motive for excusing it but no candor can justify the sacrifice you are making of your happiness if the report be true which that young madam circulates that you are pledged to her for marriage heaven forbid that i should see that day surely surely you have not madly made that promise why it is ruin misery disgrace inevitable stop me if i proceed too far i should be sorry to offend you but indeed my dear sir every body knows and every body says without scruple what miss claypole is  what is she i am not offended  speak  what is she a coquette a flirt a wanton one that will go great lengths if not all but that perhaps you can best tell be that however as it may you are not the only favored lover others and not a few have been as kindly treated as yourself her uncle knows that well enough and is indeed a generous man to part with what he is tired of and knows to be a property that hangs upon his hands and keeps him in alarm for every day that passes till he is rid of her believe me my dear sir that uncle is a deep one not a servant in the family but laments the influence he has over their good master and though miss manstock is too delicate to speak out i can discover to a certainty that she is not mistaken in his character no nor my lady crowbery neither though it is given out in the house that he is to succeed to your mr ratcliffes living  indeed cried henry is that said it is time for me to counteract him in those hopes claypole succeed my friend my honored friend impossible that shall never take place  observing susan look at him with surprise he recollected himself and in an humble tone added  at least if i have any interest with the lady patroness  susan resumed her discourse  and now said she miss claypole gives it out that she was frighted by the thunderstorm and fainted in your arms if it were so what then i hope you are not bound to marry the first lady that faints in your arms but who believes that she was frighted nobody she is not of the sort to be so easily frighted you must have known if you had been yourself that it was all put on to win you to her ways the servants all declare that she was fit to eat you up as they describe it every one saw that and knew what she was driving at she dogged you to the gallery and there the lucky storm helped forward her determined scheme to take you in the very cue for mischief heated with wine half tipsey and less than half yourself oh henry henry suffer me this once to address you thus familiarly can i not speak in proof of your forbearance of your selfcommand have i not a right to say though saying it i ought to blush at the recollection that i have found you master of yourself when i have lost all government of reason in the excess of my love to you how often and how impetuously has passion hurried me into your arms although no lucky storm was there commodiously to favor my fond wishes yet you have withstood all trials but perhaps nature has given her charms and powers to tempt which i am not possessed of but this is true as truth itself can witness that no concessions on my part no promise on yours should have prevailed with me even when your fortune was at the lowest ebb to have trepand you into marriage conscious as i was that i had not that maiden purity to give which you had so much right to expect you know full well you know dearest and best of friends there was a time when in our sports and frolics by the way as we returned from making our purchases that when you glanced at marriage i drew back at once and oftentimes i have been upon the point of telling you this tale of my seduction had you not always seized those dangerous moments to cut short our conversation and preserve my virtue and your own and now what mighty obligation can you have to this seducing wanton though well suppose you have gone beyond that limit where discretion should have stopped grant that you have whose virtue suffered most by the surprise yours or the ladys because she throws away her reputation must you marry her  before i answer to that question replied henry let me clear up one error if miss claypole was inviolate before our meeting in that odious gallery i promise you she left it as she entered it for me her favors did not go the length you hint at the vision of an angel scared me from her embrace the frown of purity itself subdued my guilty passions and i fled from her allurements but as i hold it due from every man of honor to make atonement for even the slightest stain he casts upon the fame of a woman of character i tendered her the only reparation in my power my hand if that could heal the injury she took my hand alas and broke my heart  thank heaven cried susan you have taken one weight from my mind the main point was not carried she has felt one disappointment and i will engage it was a cutting one now i can understand the reason for her shifting to the vicarage it is all a trap to catch you and make sure of you she thinks your honor then would seal the bargain and surrender you for life the dupe of her contrivances but go not near her i conjure you let not that uncle who is her setter draw you in to visit her alone you are ruined if you do as for a word dropped in an unguarded moment when you was not in clear possession of your reason that i persuade myself you will not think yourself obliged to abide by nor sacrifice the happiness of your whole life for a romantic punctilio  henry shook his head she proceeded  now i begin to have more than a dawn of hope oh let me once come to the ear of my dear young lady and i will pledge myself that all will be set straight she loves you at her heart i know she does nay she has owned it to me in so many words vexed as she was and mortified to the very soul at your proceeding still when she surprised me reading your kind note on the morning of your leaving us and saw the generous gift that it enclosed understanding it was a farewell token to my mother before you left us and went out to sea the color fled her cheeks her eyes quiverd in their lids and she dropped sweet afflicted soul like a blossom from the stalk lifeless into my arms if this is not the very test of love what is it ah my dear dear friend do but once shake off this flirting damsel and miss manstock is your own  and what can be so cutting as that thought said henry what can afflict me deeper than to reflect i had a chance of happiness and threw it wantonly away  who says that it is thrown away replied susan i have conviction to the contrary  here she drew a letter from her pocket does this appear like anger she demanded  here is a note penned with her own fair hand it is entrusted to me on this condition only to be delivered to you if you are disengaged from fanny claypole  stop then cried henry on these terms i must not take it blessed as i should be  what am i to infer from this said she  that i will not permit you to break through conditions which miss manstock has imposed  but what if i am privy to the contents  let them be sacred he rejoined breathe not a syllable however delightful to my ears i am not disengaged from miss claypole and therefore must not violate the seal nor secretly purloin the purport of that letter entrusted to you under those restrictions remember susan the same principle which led me to decline the bequest of mr blachford now obliges me to deny myself the transport which the perusal of that angels favor would bestow  what do i hear cried susan  are you then   undone said henry and departed  chapter viii an incident of the tragic cast if there is not a secret joy in being strictly faithful to the rigid laws of honor our hero must have been at this moment of all men most miserable for he might well presume that isabellas letter was a kind one and what had this world to give him comparable to a testimony of her kindness nothing but the consciousness of acting right educated in the most correct adherence to truth and rectitude he had no sophistry to palliate the slightest deviation from them and shuddered at deceit however qualified stung to the quick by his remorse for having been a party in the cause if not the cause itself of fanny claypoles misbehaviour he took her shame upon himself and vexed at the recollection of his own weak facility in falling in with her advances he determined to meet the consequences he had drawn upon himself unless rescued either by her voluntary release or some such unequivocal proofs of her misconduct as might justify him in renouncing the connection upon his return to the cottage he found ezekiel in the act of consoling himself with his afternoons pipe whilst his bible laid open on the table before him the pious creature was in profound meditation upon the book of proverbs on which he was founding an admonitory discourse for the edification of susan may whom though he had exculpated in the face of her reverend accuser yet it must be owned to have been a slight stretch upon the truth of his opinion extorted from him in his zeal for saying the best of a friend and for opposing any sentiment of claypole who was just then in no high favor with him or more properly speaking in sovereign contempt occupied in this manner he took so little notice of henry on his coming into the room that it might be doubted if he saw him and henry on his part had his thoughts too much employed to solicit his attention  a messenger now rode up to the door and being accosted by henry put a letter into his hands the contents of which were as follows   my uncle who sees most things in a false light thinks you have done very unwisely in declining blachfords fortune but money is his god and love is mine i build my happiness upon better things than riches and admire your spirit though i must own it would not have been amiss had you taken the fellows dirty pelf rather than it should fall into the hands of those low creatures who are in the way now to profit by it i should like to live at crowbery and have particular reasons for wishing you to reserve that place at least to yourself whatever becomes of the rest of the property i have quitted the old mansion and its formal inhabitants and am now entirely alone in my uncles house if you have any pity for a solitary damsel you will come to me without delay here are no spirits to haunt us nor any galleries in which they walk by night my house my heart my arms are open to receive you what can my teazing uncle mean by telling me you are going out of england without seeing me that i am sure is impossible that i will not believe the man of my choice will never treat me so he has too much honor too much love too much pity for a fond doting heart which such neglect would break i shall look for you this night this happy night if not with the first dawn of day at farthest longer than till then i cannot live without you think what i am suffering till i see you lost to all the world but you i have nothing to regret so you are faithful and delay not to bless  your fond expecting frances claypole   this was a puzzling dilemma henry had promised his mother to obey her summons if she called him to her at manstockhouse he could not therefore tell miss claypole he was going to his ship the next day neither could he with any face come to manstock without visiting her if therefore he was ever to see her better he should go before lady crowbery arrived at her uncles and whatever was to be the result of his meeting better he should bring it to a definitive conclusion before he put himself in the way of isabella whose attentions to him whilst his fate was in suspense would embarrass him beyond measure as not knowing how far he might be warranted in honor to receive them  it was now about seven oclock in an autumnal evening the distance twelve miles and the messenger was well mounted he was a country fellow and no domestic of claypoles henry asked him if he would lend him his horse and take money for hiring another at the post town two miles off this proposal backed with a piece of gold was perfectly acceptable to the messenger and henry stepped into the cottage to apprize his friend ezekiel of his motions and to equip himself for the saddle a very short apology satisfied ezekiel whose thoughts were farther from home than henry would be at the end of his stage as soon therefore as he had drawn on his boots and signified his intentions of sleeping at dame mays he set off at a smart rate and within the hour arrived safely at the vicarage gate  great was the transport of fanny claypole when the object of her anxious expectation presented himself to her sight she flung the book she was reading from her and ran with open arms in an ecstacy to embrace him wild with surprise and joy she scarce knew what she did with her hair loose and flowing she seemed a perfect sybil in her phrenzy her dress if dress it might be called that totally obscured no charms which nature had endowed her with was so invitingly disposed as showed the effects of study and design rather than of chance or negligence for little was concealed that could allure yet not so much exposed as to leave nothing for imagination to supply and a fairer field for excursions of that sort could hardly be found than in the form of fanny  when her flutter had in part subsided she threw herself on the couch in a careless attitude and observing that henry kept himself aloof and did not take her hint for seating himself by her she demanded what was the matter with him had not he recovered his alarm in the gallery or was he waiting for another thunder storm before he could find in his heart any pity for a poor disconsolate damsel who had no soul in the house to protect her but one old woman who had neither eyes ears nor understanding here we are said she without one soul that will come near us for the livelong night and what will become of me heaven only knows in this desolate mansion unless you will manfully undertake to guard me and turn into the vicars bed for the night  henry smiled and shook his head  positively resumed she i cannot part from you i would as soon sleep amongst the tombs as in this dreary solitude with no other sentinel than the snoring old dame in the garret now i know as well as can be by your looks what is passing in your mind my uncle has been preaching to you in his canting strain but i take no account of what he thinks or what he says i am independent of him and the whole world and if you suppose my peace of mind can be disturbed by their talk you are mistaken where i have bestowed my heart i am not afraid to entrust my reputation surely if i ask protection of you you will not refuse it to me  certainly i will not said henry but as no danger can accrue to your person though i should leave you and much to your reputation if i should remain with you can there be a doubt what i ought to do  ridiculous resumed she this overcare of what the world may say if you persist in it will make me doubt if i have formed a right opinion of your character when you rejected the temptations that fortune threw before you it was a gallant resolution but it is no proof of spirit to decline the favors of a lady what care i if the whole world knew that you slept in this house the thing speaks for itself i am mistress of my choice and you the man i have chosen let the world comment upon that as it likes i have quitted society and put myself into solitude for your sake to whom then but to you am i to resort for protection for consolement nay for justification where else shall i go to my uncle never i have done with him i renounce him i am yours and only yours we have interchangd our hearts what witnesses do we need of that not all the parsons in the kingdom can do more and without this their ceremonies are but mockeries therefore let us hear no more of this affected tenderness for reputation this hypocrisy of sentiment which would refine away the noblest passions of the soul let our love be without canting our confidence without restraint and to convince you of my sincerity in both respects i am free to confess that it is not to any real terrors i experienced in the storm that you are indebted for the endearments i bestowed on you last night they were the free effusions of my heart and you may tell your conscience to be quiet on that score for it was love my henry not the elements that threw me in your power and the same love now courts you to the same endearments secret and secure from all disturbers of our hours so precious come then throw off that cold reserve those distant looks that have no sympathy with mine my eyes are honest and sincere they speak a plain intelligible language what ails yours that they cannot or will not understand it without compelling me against the practice of my sex to help you to a comment  it is because i do understand their language and feel their power replied henry that i avoid them either you think yourself less dangerous than you are or me more firm than i pretend to be when you beckon me to that couch  he was proceeding when she stopped him crying out  come come there is enough of this trifling more than enough of this ridiculous this unmanly affectation beware how you provoke me i shall become desperate if i am insulted regardless of these menaces henry kept his post and advanced not a step toward her she kept her eyes fixed upon him and exclaimed  by all the loves and graces henry you have the form of an apollo would to heaven you had his fire well keep your pedestal cold lifeless image and let me gaze upon you till my admiration warms into idolatry twill gratify your pride perhaps to see me kneeling at your feet and worshipping you mark how naturally i will act pygmalions part and make love to a statue  this said she started from the couch and was advancing toward him when preventing her as she was in the act of dropping on her knees he cried pray do not laugh at me i cannot stand your ridicule  vittoria she cried i have made the statue move and speak now since your marble majesty can bend be pleased to sit beside me oh all ye gods it smiles it animates it yields it softens with the touch happy change it lives if the mere pressure of the hand does this my arms perhaps may warm it into love i will clasp it to my heart i will breathe my life into its lips and share my soul between us  stop siren henry exclaimed i am not responsible for consequences thus urged upon me nor am i bound in honor to repair them whilst i believed your terrors in the storm had thrown you from your natural guard and subjected you to weaknesses which in a more collected moment your virtue would have spurned at i felt myself a party in the treason and tendered you the only reparation in my power it was all i had to offer my unworthy self but when you openly declare those fears were feigned and freely take the blame upon yourself you quit me of the atonement and now again when you return to the attack and with such exquisite allurements tempt a man who visits you with none but honorable purposes and combats against nature to preserve you in that purity of character which is your sexs ornament i think it fair to warn you that my sentiments respecting favors in anticipation differ so essentially from yours that she who has been mistress to me with her own consent shall never be my wife beauty and wit and fortune you possess more than my hopes aspire to but permit me to observe that flattered as i am by your attachment chastity is a virtue indispensible in the female character and without that i should consider marriage as a certain sacrifice of happiness  marriage i laugh at it marriage was never made for souls like mine my love can never wait upon the lazy forms of plodding mercenary law i scorn them all nor are you fit for the dull drudgery of that slavish state too young too inexperiencd and too choice to be made daily use of your beauty like a precious garment should be reserved for feasts and holidays twas never made for the coarse wearandtear of wedlock if you had thought of marriage you would never have refused the fortune blachford had bequeathed you i see it hangs upon you like a debt of honor therefore i set you free i will not exact it of you marry ten years hence and marry whom you will of this and every other obligation honor can impose i perfectly acquit you only for this i stipulate i will not be treated with contempt of all engagements i acquit you but not of gratitude oh henry have a care how you insult a woman who has broke through all reserve and laid her heart before you after this night you are free i resign you  even to isabella  how quick and sudden are the shifts of passion a word sometimes will call up a new train of thoughts and change our resolutions in an instant it was not virtues self but virtues substitute that saved our hero sunk into the arms of the seducer and resigned to the temptation the name of isabella roused him like a spell he started sprung with horror from the couch and cried you have redeemed yourself and me i leave you to your better recollection  stop she exclaimed unless you are resolved to be my murderer then snatching up a sharppointed knife with which she had been cutting open the leaves of her book by the eternal truth she cried i will plunge this weapon in my heart if you desert me here she put herself into a menacing attitude with a look of so much desperation that henry on the instant sprung forward and seized her uplifted hand to wrench the knife from her grasp furious with rage she struggled to keep hold of it and in the struggle whether purposely or accidentally we pretend not to say lodged the point of it in his left arm below the elbow in the same moment he got possession of the knife and secured it in his pocket she probably perceived what she had done for she stood torpid with astonishment and terror he rang the bell with violence an elderly woman came running to the call i charge you be attentive to your lady he cried for she is suddenly taken ill then finding that the blood was flowing apace from the wound and would soon discover itself if he staid any longer he hastened out of doors and stuffing his handkerchief up his sleeve ran as quick as he could to the house of goody may which luckily was near at hand  chapter ix surgeons work it was well for our hero that he had not many paces to measure before he found an house to take shelter in for though he held his hand close pressed upon the wound the sluice kept running apace and his waste of blood would not have suited a much longer march the widow was at home and her hospitable door stood open come mother cried henry as he entered i have another case for you more work for the good samaritan this said he began to strip off his coat which had no sooner displayed to her sight an arm covered with blood than she gave a loud shriek started back with horror and fell atrembling from head to foot courage my good friend cried the undaunted youth with a cheering smile a good surgeon does not shrink at the sight of a wound  would to heaven i was a good surgeon for your sake replied she or any way more able to assist you than i am  take heart he cried give me a chair to rest my arm upon in an horizontal posture and fetch some lint to staunch the blood then i warrant all will be well in a few minutes cheered with these words the good dame bestirred herself and presently returned from her repository with a large pledget of lint steeped in friars balsam which she laid over the wound and bound it up with a swathe of linen in several folds here is a piece of work she cried oh that mr l  was here to dress you but let me send post haste for doctor cawdle as for myself god help me it pities me to the heart to see your fair flesh hacked and hewed in such a barbarous manner oh the villain that has done this i would i had him safe in fetters of iron some murderous wretch has stabbed you in the dark as sure as can be it is that bloody captain you fought with in the morning he has waylaid you on the road at night but well raise the neighbors and have a hueandcry after him please god is there to be no end to the malice of these accursed crowberys  there are no crowberys in the case replied henry nor any malice so put yourself at peace and say no more about it it is an accident and nothing more a mere casualty owing to my own aukwardness  but how did it happen she still demanded i am positive it has been the stab of a sword or a dagger or a knife or some wicked weapon or other for it has gone in the lord knows how far in this manner she persisted in pressing him with enquiries till he found no escape but by taking a little more liberty with the truth than was his custom to do and making up as plausible a story as he could invent to account for the accident however she still remained incredulous crying out you are too forgiving indeed my dear young sir you are much too forgiving in all conscience and though to be sure humanity is very amiable yet after all it is an act of justice to bring the guilty to punishment and you may depend upon it they will be the death of you some time or other though i hope with gods blessing they have missed their aim for this turn  if you will go on in a mistake my good friend said henry you must so there let us leave it i have news to tell you of your daughter whom you seem to have forgotten he then related to her briefly what had been passing at blachfords and how he had diverted that dying mans great bequest from himself to those whom he considered as having a better claim to it  when this was disclosed to her with the circumstance of her daughters being a mother of which strange as it may seem she had hitherto been kept in ignorance the variety of sensations which the discovery of facts so affecting at once excited seemed to deprive her of speech and recollection henry saw the conflict of her thoughts and perceiving that in speaking of her grandchild he had opened an affair which till then he had no notion she could be uninformed of instantly began to explain to her in the most consoling manner the whole plot which blachford and his accomplice had put in practice to obtain their wicked purposes and entrap their innocent victim  here the good mothers passion broke in upon his narrative monster villain she exclaimed oh that i had known his goingson that i might have brought him to the gallows as he deserved what could possess my child to screen so vile a wretch  be content replied henry he has met his doom at last and you have now the comfort to reflect that by escaping the punishment of the law he has lived to repent and as far as human circumstances will admit to atone for the crime he has perpetrated the son which that dark transaction brought into the world now survives to inherit the fortune of the father and the injured mother is enabled to live easy and independent for the rest of her days and who shall arraign her character he then concluded with what he knew would be the most healing reflection he could suggest to her assuring her that even ezekiel daw with all his purity and preciseness absolutely and entirely acquitted susan may and had asserted her innocence in the strongest terms to the rev mr claypole in a conversation on the subject  as he was thus discoursing the cloud that had gathered upon her countenance cleared away and the shower it had been collecting began to vent itself at her eyes words were no longer wanting but like a spring repressed burst out with increased volubility they were the unpremeditated effusions of a heart overcharged with its own feelings gratitude astonishment joy transported her by turns from one to the other yet she found expressions for them all in broken sentences after her manner so that it was some length of time whilst henry was fain to give patient hearing to her rhapsodies before he could perceive her spirits to subside into any tolerable degree of calmness and perhaps it was more owing to her being exhausted than to any efforts on his part when at last she became quiet and composed  this interval however was but short for soon the recollection of his wound seized her afresh and she began to moan and lament over him more piteously than at first her imagination painted him expiring under the stab of an assassin all his noble generous acts rose in review accumulated obligations pressed upon her memory with such overwhelming weight that her grateful soul sunk under it and she cast herself prostrate at his feet embracing them and crying out in broken accents the lord of mercy save you the widows prayers protect and draw a blessing on you in return for all your bounteous goodness and for this your unspeakable tenderness in softening to my poor heart an event that would else have broken it had any other tongue but yours revealed this dreadful secret to me  here she was called off by a messenger sent in great haste from the vicarage to claim her instant assistance to miss claypole who had been in strong hysterics since henry had left her and so terrified the old woman her only attendant that after rousing the cottagers at next door she had dispatched one of them to dame may as a person of skill in such cases and stocked with medicines to relieve them the dame had great scruples about leaving her wounded friend but henry insisting upon it she obeyed the summons and departed taking with her a competent provision of such nostrums as she judged proper for the occasion  in less than an hour she returned having left her patient in a convalescent state but in this period the hysteric lady had in her ramblings been so communicative that the good dame who had at least as much curiosity as came to the share of any one individual had perfectly informed herself of every particular that could elucidate the mystery of our heros pretended accident fraught with this information she soon gave him to understand that she was no longer imposed upon though he still persisted in taking it upon himself as a chance blow in the struggle and that he was positive the lady had no serious intention of doing any injury either to him or herself as the dame however was strenuous in unbelief and he found himself rather faint and exhausted by loss of blood he cut short the argument by desiring her to prepare ezekiels bed for his repose but as he well knew her passion for telling news was not a whit inferior to her pleasure in hearing it he was very earnest with her to keep secret what she had heard from fanny claypole or rather what she herself suggested from the ramblings of a disordered imagination stating to her how extremely dishonorable it would be in her who acted in a medical capacity to disclose the secrets of a patient which he observed would be a heinous sin against the inviolable freemasonry of the faculty  henry retired to his repose with the pleasing reflection that he had compounded a very heavy penalty with a slight fine for such he now considered his wound to be and indeed the pure habit of his body would have accommodated itself to a demand of a more serious nature than this was likely to prove for the knife had only pierced the fleshy part of his arm without any material injury neither was he the less happy in his present quarters for the testimony which every thing about him bore to the taste and benignity of the beloved person who had provided them every object he now looked upon every comfort he enjoyed was of isabellas bestowing and whilst he fed on that delightful recollection no wonder if the grateful approaches of sleep so sweetly recommended stole upon his senses with peculiar softness till by the magic of his dream the airdrawn image of his beauteous isabella rose to view graced with ten thousand charms and pictured to the height of fancys warmest coloring kind happy greeting him with smiles of love consenting melting into soft desires and selfsurrendered to his fond embrace  chapter x our wounded hero bleeds afresh the next morning henry rose with recruited strength the air was so fresh and the sun so gay that if we had any ambition to emulate our brother novelists in description here is the very moment for it but we decline the opportunity  dame may examined his wound and perceiving that dame nature was in the humor to take the cure out of her hands humbly resigned the task into her care and contented herself with the simple application of a fresh pledget of dry lint and swathed it as before she now set out her teatable in its holiday trim and administered the ceremonies of breakfast in her very best style when this service was dispatched she left her guest in possession of her parlour and addressed herself to her own domestic affairs in another quarter  she had not left him many minutes when her lovely patroness stepped into the house unseen by henry  it occurs to me said isabella to the dame that something may be wanting in your friend mr daws apartment and therefore i should be glad to look it over before he arrives  without stopping for an answer she nimbly ascended the stairs the good dames thoughts were rather from home at that moment and not present to the recollection that henrys bedchamber was not exactly in a state fit to receive the visit of a young lady instead therefore of stopping her on the stairs she hobbled after her into the room  heyday cried isabella upon looking about her what is this somebody has slept here i perceive  lackaday exclaimed the dame i humbly ask your pardon for not stopping you in time dear good young lady be not offended with me but indeed you was so nimble and took me as i may say at such a nonplus that i never thought to tell you that the chamber was not fit for you to come into sure enough though it was my sweet dear young friend mr henry himself who reposed himself in that bed last night heaven bless him and i have not had leisure yet to set the room to rights  did he sleep here said the lovely intruder as she was quitting the chamber and just then recollecting that she was leaving the survey unfinished which she came to make stopped and cast her eyes deliberately round the room observing that she wished it was more worthy of her guest but i hope at least added she with an encouraging smile you took care to air it well for your friend and benefactor  heaven forbid cried goody may that i should bring his precious life into danger there are wretches enough in this world too ready to do that the more shame theirs but i say nothing the lord he knows their hearts and mine also how it bleeds for him at this moment and that is the reason i was so absent in my duty to you well to be sure the wickedness of some folks is surprising i am sure it will be more gods mercy than my skill if my dear mr henry escapes out of their murderous hands alive  bless me cried isabella i protest you startle me is mr henry now in the house goody may answering in the affirmative isabella came silently down the stairs and understanding he was in the parlour turned into the common room which was opposite to it making a sign to her follower to do the same here she immediately began a course of questions which soon betrayed the communicative dame into so complete a recital of every circumstance respecting henrys wound that nothing she had collected from miss claypole in her fit and which henry had conjured her to keep secret was untold there is reason to believe this poor woman would have gone to death for henrys sake whilst she was thus running counter to his injunctions but to deny herself the pleasure of broaching a piece of news particularly one so honorable to henry and so interesting to the hearer was a virtue which her nature could not reach a sacrifice her resolution was not equal to  henry in the meanwhile unconscious of what was passing so near him sat in the little parlour with his eyes fixed upon the print of isabellas father that hung opposite to him pondering in his mind the lovely vision of the preceding night his imagination fascinated with the contemplation of her matchless beauty her engaging manners and attractive graces when behold the sound of the lock drew his eyes to the door which gently opening disclosed to his sight the very object of his meditations in her existing and substantial form more exquisitely beautiful than any shade that fancy ever pictured in the poets brain surprised enraptured he started from his chair and in the momentary transport that deprived him of reflection ran and caught her in his arms instantly undeceived and convinced it was no shadow he embraced terrified at what he had done he dropped upon his knee and begged for pardon  i was deceived he cried my mind had left me and was strayed beyond realities i saw you in my meditations and like a man delirious seized what in my better senses i would not offend for worlds and know myself unworthy to approach  what passed in isabellas mind whilst henry was thus pleading for pardon at her feet words will not describe for she made use of none it was not anger for her looks were melting soft it could not but be modesty for blushes spread all over her fair face no doubt but sensibility had a share in it for tears bedewed her cheeks  he was preparing to proceed with his apology when a shriek from isabella stopped his speech and instantly he perceived the blood streaming from his wound  behold he cried how justly i am brought to recollection of my offense isabella in the mean time frightened past the power of motion kept calling out for goody may it was obvious that her sudden appearance had surprised him into an exertion that had opened his wound afresh when he inconsiderately threw his arms about her waste the poor woman terrified with what she heard and saw in her confusion scarce knew what to do first but recollecting after a few moments the process she had before observed begged isabella to assist in opening his coat sleeve whilst she hastened to her repository for means to stop the blood isabella pale and trembling as she was summoned spirits to assist in supporting his arm as well as in the operation of untying the tapes goody may had sewed upon his sleeve which she had ripped open over the wounded part the business most immediately necessary was soon effected by the application of fresh lint and the former styptic but isabellas horrors at the glimpse she had of his wound were not so soon dismissed henrys attention was so totally absorbed in his care for his fair assistant that he seemed to have no sense of what was doing to himself and he would fain have dismissed the operatrix for hartshorn and water before she had secured the bandage but when he felt the gentle touch of isabella engaged in the work jointly with the old woman  who would not gladly shed his blood he cried for such an honor and now a certain tender glance from isabellas eyes made answer in so flattering a language that the heart of our hero so far from sinking under its loss seemed to beat with double energy and spirit  the hartshorn and water was now brought isabella recovered and her alarm having subsided the prudent dame thought her presence was no longer necessary and retired  we looked for you last night said isabella my father charged susan with a message to that purpose and to prevent mistakes i wrote you a short note but i understand from susan that you did not receive it  i hope replied he fixing his eyes upon the floor she told you at the same time upon what motive i denied myself that happiness  she did rejoined isabella the letter i received from her this morning does credit to her heart and justice to your honor not only in the trifling matter of my note but in a circumstance of real selfdenial in which permit me to say you have given the noblest proof of an exalted generosity  if i merit your praise said henry in either instance it is in that which you term the more trifling instance of the two it is no hard task for a man not mercenary to act as i did in the affair of blachford for it is a victory over a mean and abject passion but there is some struggle to obey the dictates of honor when it calls upon us to oppose the strongest impulse and affection that the heart can feel but your commands to susan may were positive and i obeyed them  they were calculated she rejoined for your accommodation you had another engagement and solicitation is in that case an embarrassment to a wellbred man  there said he you lead me to look back upon a transaction that covers me with confusion and selfreproach yet if it were a plea your purity might listen to i have enough to say that would acquit my conscience toward the engagement you allude to though nothing can totally exculpate me from folly and infirmity a fortunate explanation with miss claypole yesterday evening has set me free from all conditions of atonement and i am happy it is in my power to assert with truth that the promise i held myself bound to make was not a composition for the loss of innocence on her part but simply for the risque of reputation  whatever you seriously assert isabella replied i implicitly believe but when you call your explanation with that lady a fortunate one i should suspect you are once more guilty of forgetting you have a wound that demands more care and attention than you seem disposed to afford it if you are to shed your blood with such repeated profusion in every ladys company you chance upon and one is to give another to renew your wounds i think you are in a likely way to become a victim to the sex  i see said henry smiling that my old prattling dame has broke faith with me and let out all she knows with more perhaps than her information warrants but in your heavenly nature i well know there will be found a principle of candor that can look with pity on the extravagances of an uncorrected temper and consign them to oblivion if the tongue of this gossip can be stopped in time we may yet suppress a story that would do no credit to miss claypole and in this i flatter myself your good nature will assist me for my own part i propose to wait here no longer than till lady crowbery arrives who must pass this door in her way and whom i am bound to see once more before i leave england  what are you talking of said isabella fixing her expressive eyes despondingly upon him  can you think of leaving us at this moment and trusting yourself in this condition on board a ship can there be any such cruel necessity to make so rash a sacrifice of yourself can my gentle lady crowbery require it of you will her humanity permit it nay when you consider how disconsolate she will leave us will your own  oh thou angelic sweetness he exclaimed gently taking her hand in his my gratitude my duty my destiny demand this effort for which if i might now expose to you all the motives you would confess them such as i must be a monster if i shrunk from how severe soever the separation they compel me to and can i look upon those eyes and see them beaming with such soft compassion on me yet forbear to tell you what i suffer by this painful effort no loveliest of your sex whom present absent my poor heart devotedly adores it is in vain to counterfeit you see you know the violence i commit against my nature when i suppress its feelings you perceive i love you what shall i say how shall i palliate my presumption yet reflect with pity on my case remember i have lived by sufferance in your sight could i see and not admire you have by your condescension been indulged beyond my humble merit with some moments of your privacy could i converse with you and not be charmed in short i have contemplated perfection in your mind and person and fixed your image on my heart so deep and so indelible that if to love you be a crime i am unpardonably guilty  you are not guilty said isabella looking down and blushing as she spoke to me at least not guilty  i know resumed henry who it is that print which faces me reflects  your excellent father i know your love your piety to that best of parents and can well believe the patience you now hear me with springs from pity on that therefore i build no false presumptuous hopes for i know the difficulties of my present situation the distance to which it throws me and i would scorn to take advantage of your private moments for saying any thing in a whisper which i dared not openly to repeat in the presence of sir roger manstock himself if then at this instant the fatherly eye within that frame had sight though i might shrink from it a while mysterious as i am compelled to be yet in my conscience i should stand acquitted because i know myself  a start of surprise from isabella and a look betokening curiosity at this moment directed toward him checked him from proceeding after a pause he repeated  yes loveliest isabella i know myself and hope i shall in time be known  here henry stopped it seemed as if the most important secret of his life was upon the verge of discovery isabella too was silent she was debating in her thoughts whether she should urge him to explain or repress her curiosity the latter seemed most honorable and she decided for it at last turning toward him with a look of inexpressible sweetness she thus addressed him  henry so let me call you till i know by what addition else to accost you i would not wish to have the keeping of a secret that might cause regret to you for having parted with it neither is there any information wanting to convince me you are nobly born i am certified of that by my own observation and have long been so honor and worth and genius may emerge from low originals but elegance and delicacy of manners are rarely natives of a coarse and rustic soil a strange idea haunts me shall i confide it to you i have really thought at times or fancy may have feigned it that you have a marked resemblance in your air and features to my beloved lady crowbery as i remember her some few years ago this may be mere imagination but i have humored myself in it the rather because it helps me naturally to account for certain situations i have seen her in with you which else might seem at variance with her strict reserve and delicacy of conduct i can almost persuade myself you are after some manner related to her at least these have been my idle reveries but never did one syllable to that effect escape my lips till now i am not quite so fond of tatling as our good dame and now moreover i recollect amongst the motives you enumerated for leaving us you mentioned duty be it so we must conform ourselves to duty but let me hope that we shall meet again  and do you wish it said he looking tenderly upon her  do i wish it she repeated  oh henry henry if that is a question with you where is your intelligence  here the tears stopped her and she leant her forehead on his shoulder covering her face with her handkerchief  heaven guard your life she cried may no female demon ever more attempt it horrid creature shameless abandoned being what phrenzy could possess her come not in her way oh henry i conjure you never look upon her more i could not bear the sight of her i blush to think that i have ever conversed with such a woman but you thank heaven had virtue to resist her and virtue sure without a blush may give the hand to virtue  this said she took his hand the manner of the action stamped it with the seal of modesty and modestly it was received though love was the inspirer it was the silent contract of their hearts pledged with the tender interchange of sighs and looks that bade farewell and vowed unalterable constancy again she pressed his hand  and are you now convinced she asked how anxiously i shall wish for your return yes henry i am free to own my hopes my happiness my heart goes with you  oh ecstacies how pure moments how precious it is now o love that virtues self may welcome thee without reserve or coyness composed of these chaste qualities honor may lodge thee in his hearts best core yea in his heart of heart the moral hand may paint the modest eye peruse thee in this attitude come ever thus thou best and worst of deities or dwell not with us long upon the scene this will not raise a blush heaven warrants these endearments and nature in this instance borrows no excuse from sophistry to palliate her propensities  and now the tender conference closed a servant of lady crowbery galloped past the window to announce her approach isabella saw the signal and slowly rose from her seat she paused awhile and it seemed as if something was in her mind to say which she could wish to give utterance to but it died away in a sigh henry pressed her hand to his lips in silence and they parted  end of the seventh book book the eighth chapter i an old mans prattle in a wintry night as the state of society becomes more refined eccentricity of character wears away a writer therefore of the present age who aims to give amusing pictures of the humors of the times finds nature less favorable to him in that respect than she was to those who resorted to her for the like purposes a century or two ago this cannot be denied but nature still is inexhaustible and there is no need to emigrate from her domain in search of novelty and entertainment  originality of humor or as it is more commonly called a new character in play or novel is the writers first aim as it is sure to be the first in request by every spectator and critic and the chief test by which his genius will be tried but when we use the term originality as applied to the human character we cannot be understood to mean a new creature a being formed by fancy and not to be found in nature but simply a close copy a happy likeness of some striking character whose peculiarities have a strong effect either in the moral or the humor of our composition the old drama abounds with personages of this sort and as the moulds in which they were cast are now destroyed by time we gaze upon them with surprise and delight regarding them as nondescripts or creatures of a separate species though at the time of their production they were doubtless sketched from nature and it is possible that the authors of that era were not more applauded for their originality than we of the present time are by our contemporaries when the critics therefore cry against the stage as fallen off in its spirit from the old masters and seem to think we ought to exhibit as much novelty and produce as much surprise by living characters as they do by raising the dead who are out of memory and forgotten they require of us a power which though the witch of endor had no modern poet now can boast hence it follows that some amongst us who are indignant of reproach however unreasonable being hurried upon rash attempts either spend their talents in copying after copies whilst they aim to paint the manners as they were in times past or endeavoring to create the same surprise by modern novelties find themselves carried out of nature and probability into the visions of extravagance and romance this in its consequence brings disgrace upon the stage by reducing comedy into farce and farce into puppetshew and pantomime the novelist in the mean time breaking loose from society runs wild into forests and deserts in search of caves and uninhabited castles where forgetting every law of nature and even every feature of the human countenance he paints men and women such as never were in existence and then amidst the shades of night and horror rattles his chains and conjures up his ghosts till having frightened his readers out of their senses he vainly supposes he has charmed them into applauses  but the evil does not stop here for as a man who runs mad about the streets will be followed by a mob in like manner the rhodomontade of the novel is copied by the nonsense of the opera and whilst ghosts glide over the stage thunders roll and towers tumble to the amusement of the galleries the carpenter plays off his machinery to the roar of applauding crowds and the author if he has any feeling for the dignity of his profession blushes at his triumphs when he reflects that they are founded on the disgrace of the theater  let the author then beware how he is piqued into absurdities by his own vanity or the false taste of the public if the genius that god has given him and the matter that nature supplies him with will not serve the purpose let him drop the undertaking if his imagination can frame incidents combine them well and weave them naturally into a pleasing fable he has gained his point but an overanxiety to produce some striking novelty will most likely end in producing some striking absurdity all ranks of life are open to his choice and he has a right to select the strongest humors he can find but if he does not find what suits his purpose in nature he has no excuse for going out of it whilst he professes to be a delineator of the living manners fancy may ramble as she likes if she avowedly beats about for imaginary beings but if she produces her own creations and calls them men and women or paints characters out of date and passes them upon us for contemporaries she does more than she has fair warrant and authority to do  what i have here said of character is applicable to incident the writers of fiction are generally actuated by so strong a passion for the mavelous that they seem to throw every thing off the hinges merely to alarm us with the din and clatter they make of all wretched expedients which barren genius can resort to the abrupt introduction of casualties is one of the meanest in the novels of the present day we encounter them at every turn yet they never impose upon credulity for when the sick heroine at deaths door threatens us with an exit we are convinced she does not mean to favor us with the performance of it surely there is no occasion for all this neither is the impression very pleasing which it conveys  if that originality of character which we have been speaking of is now become hardly attainable discrimination is yet within reach and by a happy contrast of leading characters although they shall not be really new yet all the best effects of novelty may be obtained by an alternate play on each others humors by the means of which very comic and amusing situations may be struck out amongst our countrymen the great masters of contrast in our own day are fielding and stern square and thwackum western and his sister the father and the uncle of tristram shandy are admirable instances shakspeare had it from nature jonson caught it from aristophanes socrates and the clown strepsiades in the comedy of the clouds is perhaps the most brilliant contrast of comic humor in the nowexisting records of the stage ancient or modern  let me suppose i am now speaking to a young author sitting down for the first time to his maiden work the first thing necessary is to understand himself the next to know the age in which he writes when his nerves are fortified with a proper confidence in his own powers let that confidence be tempered with all the respect which is due to people of an enlightened understanding who are to be his examiners and judges it is a very sacred correspondence that takes place between the mind of the author and the mind of the reader it is not like the slight and casual intercourse we hold with our familiars and acquaintance where any prattle serves to fill up a few social minutes and set the table in a roar what we commit to our readers has no apology from hurry and inattention it is the result of thought well digested of sentiments by which we must stand or fall in reputation of principles for which we must be responsible to our contemporaries and to posterity  in the degree of entertainment our productions may have the fortune to afford our expectations may be pardonably mistaken but in what offends good morals or sins against the truth of nature we err without excuse selflove cannot blind us in these respects because it is not a matter of talents but of rectitude and common sense we talk of critics as of men set apart on purpose to annoy and censure us whereas every reader is a critic and publishes his opinion of us wherever he goes we ourselves are critics in our turn and what we complain of in our own persons we do to others and though few think it worth their while to publish their criticisms let it be remembered that some mens voices circulate further than other mens publications  let us therefore who write weigh well the duty of the task we engage in and let the puerile practice of invoking the mercy of our readers be no more thought of for generally speaking we are entitled to no more mercy than liberalminded men will give us without our begging for it i am aware of some exceptions and am i hope as sensitive toward such cases as i ought to be but i am now speaking generally of authors who write for same and not for bread if these had all the diffidence they affect to have how came it not to stand in their way when they resorted to the press and why this terror of the critics an author cannot be harmed by a bad critic and why should he be afraid of being benefitted by a good one  chapter ii the best friends must part we closed our last book with the parting of henry and isabella in one of those situations which we would rather refer to the readers imagination than aim to describe happily for him his friendly hostess gave no interruption to his meditations nor did they wander from their beloved object till the sound of lady crowberys wheels called him out to meet her the chaise was stopped at the gate of the cottagegarden and her attendant got out by her ladys order and stepped aside whilst zachary and the nurse who occupied a hackney carriage halted in the rear when henrys conversation with his mother was over and they had parted he engaged the driver of zacharys chaise to take him back to crowbery on his return which was accordingly done and he once more found himself in the hospitable cottage with his friend ezekiel  to him he purposed to dedicate the remainder of that day and the next morning to join the ship according to the notice he had received from captain carry upon his arrival he found that blachford had breathed his last and susan may with her infant had taken possession of his quarters at the cottage he therefore determined upon going on that evening to the port and to wait no longer than till a chaise could be brought from the neighboring post town when he had past some time with susan and honest daw in discoursing on their affairs and had contrived to satisfy their anxiety about his wound with as little violence to truth as the suppression of miss claypoles name would admit of a tap at the door announced a visitor when young tom weevil presented himself clad in his best apparel carrying a wallet or knapsack at the end of a crooked stick upon his shoulder with a cutlass slung in a buff belt round his waste  the preacher seeing an armed man enter his house started from his seat and marching up to him with an intrepid air cried out what ailest thou thomas weevil that thou have armed thyself in this fashion speak is it peace jehu  with your leave doctor daw replied the young miller my business is with the gentleman there and not with you  render up your purpose to my ears thomas weevil repeated ezekiel for thou shall not pass me to approach my guest until thou have answered to my question is it peace  i know not what you mean by your question quoth tom for be it peace or be it war all is one to me seeing that i am come to tender my services to mr henry who i understand is going over sea to foreign countries and as i bear do you see in grateful mind that he has saved my life i think it but just and right to risque it in his service and so i am here ready to follow him to the worlds end that is all master zekiel i have to say  and thou have said well friend thomas quoth ezekiel therefore pass in peace and make thyself welcome with a cup of my best ale which i will forthwith administer unto thee so saying the good man went out on hospitable thoughts intent  at the same time old weevil made his appearance and repeated to henry the same tender in nearly the same terms adding that he had given his free consent to toms departure for god be thanked he had sons enough left to keep the mill going the whilst tom said he has played a little loose to be sure but he has seen his error and that is every thing he is a good lad in the main and has a grateful heart here ezekiel came to them bearing in his hand a lusty pitcher and saluting the miller with a friendly nod set it down on the tresselboard invitingly full and frothing  henry now having given his hand to the father first and afterward to the son expressed himself very sensibly affected by the offer they had made him he was going out he told them with a gallant captain in a ship of war who might possibly fall in with an enemy before he found his port  and who can tell said he where an unlucky shot may glance i should be sorry therefore to expose my friend tom to broken bones though i know him to be a brave fellow to this tom replied that he despised danger in his service that he was ready to share his fortune by sea and by land that he had got his fathers leave and had a longing desire to see the world in short that it would break his heart if henry would not permit him to go with him this was again seconded by old weevil when ezekiel rising up and putting himself into his accustomed posture took up his parable as follows  thy zeal young man to share the fortune of him who under providence was the preserver of thy life indicates a grateful mind and i commend thee therefore and thou son henry must no longer oppose the laudable desire which this youth has expressed of devoting himself to thy service seeing it is no less a part of generosity in some cases to receive an obligation than to bestow one it suffices that thou have ingenuously forewarned thomas weevil of the dangers he may chance to incur in the course of thy peregrination and verily i am myself at this moment in no small strait having fully purposed not to suffer thee to depart alone but to bear thee company in thy travels in pure affection of heart knowing thee to be of a bold adventurous spirit which pusheth thee into dangers these if by counsel and experience i could not avert i might at least have shared being resolute to go with thee if need required even unto death but now behold the corpse of mr blachford lies yet unburied and having been the happy means of turning him from the error of his ways can i fail to attend his body to the grave and not be present to put up a prayer for the repose of his soul and lo here is the damsel also who has suffered violence by him and whose heart now fails her through fear of slander needs one to console her and support who then but myself the friend of her mother the widow and witness to the confession of her seducer who was once a son of belial excusing her and accusing himself is so fitted to that labor of love these not to mention the care of her worldly affairs which lies on me are amongst the calls by which the trouble of my heart is enlarged when i reflect that i must suffer thee son henry to depart alone yet not alone if so be this friendly youth whose grateful tender of himself i do exhort thee to accept shall be thy companion by the way and now seeing the hour of thy departure approaches and the evening draws on i must be brief as is my manner of speech saying only those things which it were a shame to omit and praying the lord of all mercy to preserve thee in all thy goings beseeching him to dispose thy heart to continue steadfast in his fear and love amidst all the temptations of this sinful world and in his good time to return thee and this thy companion safe and unhurt to your rejoicing friends  the good man having concluded his harangue lifted the pitcher to his lips and drank a farewell to his parting guests for henrys chaise had now come up to the door tom weevil whose offer was accepted joyfully bestirred himself in stowing henrys baggage and his own upon the carriage and now the moment came when our hero taking ezekiels hands in his tenderly addressed him in these words  farewell my worthy friend wherever providence disposes of me and whatever may befall me whilst i retain life and memory your kindness benevolence charities and virtues will be registered in my heart  then turning to susan who stood ute with sorrow at seeing him prepare to depart heir cheeks bathed with tears he took her in his arms and after a tender embrace recommended her to the protection of ezekiel saying  i leave you to the care of this good man who will also stand in my place as guardian of your infant till i return to you again he knows the purport of mr blachfords will and will take the measures on my part as executor which a prudent care of your interest will prescribe i need not caution you to observe a proper attention to the amiable young lady in whose service you will now no longer remain to this your best of benefactors you owe the duty of a daughter and you will not fail to pay it for to his pious exhortations it is owing that the father of your child was brought to a sense of the injuries he had done you and induced to atone for them at the same time take notice that this excellent creature suffered not one shilling of the deceased to adhere to his fingers notwithstanding every offer which to my knowledge was repeatedly pressed upon him by that penitent on his death bed  this said he addressing himself to old weevil who was standing by is a noble instance of disinterestedness and merits the applause of every honest man  then giving his hand to weevil he bade him farewell promising him to take care of his son and hastening out of doors stepped into his chaise followed by tom and was off as fast as four nimble horses and two dashing drivers could transport him  in the mean time silence reigned in the cottage ezekiel committed himself to his wickerchair and remained in pensive meditation susan seated herself by his side and as he rested his hand upon the arm of his chair pressed her lips upon it and bathed it in her tears old weevil felt an aching in his throat and applied himself to the pitcher without uttering a word ezekiel seeing this roused himself in his seat and cried though in a faultering voice courage neighbor we have only parted from our friends we have not lost them  no no cried the miller as he took the pitcher from his lips to be sure as you say we have not to mourn over the loss of them but somehow or other it makes one feel a little queer for as nobody can be sure of life for an hour to come parting methinks is as i may say like taking leave for ever  heaven in its mercy forbid that cried susan and burst aloud into an agony of grief  child child said ezekiel moderate thy wailing it becomes not us to give way to inordinate grief what have thou lost which i have not lost and do thou see me give way to this unseemly weakness why do thou not take example by me thou see damsel that i am firm and unshaken here his voice began to quiver and he seemed fighting against something that rose in his throat and would not suffer him to proceed i know cried susan we should not anticipate affliction but when a dreadful image is presented to my imagination how can i forbear to feel a horror at the thoughts of losing such a friend for ever think only what he has been to me think what he is how kind how gentle how benevolent call to mind his virtues his sufferings his humility  ezekiel groaned  what poverty what persecution he has endured  ezekiel marked his assent with a motion of his head muttering to himself with a sigh that it was true you i am sure said susan turning to weevil have cause to bless him you can witness to his good deeds and you can also tell how he was rewarded for them but let the dead sleep in peace there are some still living whose malice never sleeps there is no end to their attempts against his life wicked wretches it is to some of them he owes that wound which he would make us believe is accident because he is all forgiveness but i believe some villain has beset him heavens what must that mans heart be made of  millstones said ezekiel  i wish i had them between mine quoth weevil by the lord harry i would squeeze them  i know whereabouts they are rejoined susan and what their spite springs from and now my dear mr daw can you wonder i am afflicted when such is their diabolical malice that perhaps even now they have a plot upon his life and are lying in wait to destroy him  these words seizing the brain of ezekiel he sprung upon his legs and with an asseveration not far short of an oath declared he would that instant go forth and defend him susan who saw the phrensy cried out to weevil to stop him are you beside yourself friend daw said the miller to think of overtaking four posthorses with one pair of legs what the plague is not my son tom there to guard him and didnt they set off helter skelter as if the devil drove them why by this time they are half way to the seaside and who should stop them our friend susan does but speak as all women do when they are in a fright and i thought you was too much a man to be startled by what they say  i believe replied daw resuming his dignity i am as much of a man as my neighbors and not less of a friend to my fellow creatures than i ought to be i am not apt to be idle when the wicked are afoot and innocence is in danger however i do recollect that they went off with speed and that there is little likelihood i can with all my exertions overtake them though i hold myself no mean pedestrian and yield to no one in the race on foot howbeit i decline the contest against such odds but no sooner shall tomorrows sun rise than i will rise with him and step over to the port to see if all be well and if aught be wanting to stand forth in their service and defense  will thou cried weevil then i am with thee and will whip thee over in my jockeycart in a trice you will go as easy as if you was in your own wickerchair i will be here at thy door by the first peep of day what say thou is it agreed  agreed cried ezekiel but hold what day in the week will tomorrow be  thursday said the miller  i protest that is lucky replied the preacher for had it been the lords day i could not have gone with thee  then give me hold of your hand quoth weevil for damn me if thou art not as good a heart as lives and if ever i have slipped out any thing in the way of joke to offend thee i am heartily sorry for it and i ask thy pardon  enough quoth daw and more than enough friend thomas for i could have credited thy good will without an oath however drink and let us empty the pitcher  chapter iii our hero goes out to sea punctual to his appointment miller weevil presented himself by break of day at the door of ezekiels castle where having seated the apostle by his side directly over the axletree of a vehicle which if it had been constructed professedly as an instrument of torture might have done credit to the ingenious cruelty of its inventor he set forward on a round trot jolting him over ruts and rocks with a merciless indifference the straitest way to his point till they came in view of the sea with the frigate riding at anchor ezekiel who now saw a period to the persecution he had endured for two long hours took courage and being just then in a sandy pass availed himself of the first moment he could venture to put his tongue to any use having wisely kept it still whilst his teeth were in motion the scene was magnificent the sun which was flaming in their rear threw a gleam of splendor over the shore the ship and the expanse of waters that terminated the prospect objects like these could not fail to carry up ezekiels thoughts to the creator of all things in his soul devotion eaglewinged sat ever ready to catch the signal for soaring in its flight toward heaven accordingly he began in a lofty cadence to rehearse that portion of the  0 th psalm which begins  they that go down to the sea in ships his charioteer in the mean while struck with the awful strain respectfully slackened his pace and listened in silence pondering the fate of his son then floating on the surface of that tremendous ocean in the mercy of him  at whose word the stormy wind arises  when ezekiel ceased his recitation weevil observed that the words were very fine though he was pretty sure he had heard them before i believe thou have quoth ezekiel if thou did ever hear the psalms  if so said he i wish you would double down the leaf for son thomas for i think every man who goes to sea should have the fear of god before his eyes  and whither should any man go without it said ezekiel and immediately struck into that enraptured passage of the same sublime minstrel  whither shall i go then from thy spirit etc  this again drew the profoundest attention from weevil who at the conclusion expressed himself very highly delighted with what he had heard observing that he firmly believed it all and that no man could commit a bad action safely for that gods eyes were every where and i make no doubt added he but that villain bowsey though he has got out of our reach will fall into the hands of justice sooner or later and pay sauce for his wickedness in the end and as i hold him to be a murderer all one as if tom had died under his hand i dont despair of seeing him brought to the gallows in gods good time  neighbor weevil replied ezekiel it is not in the death but in the conversion of a sinner that our god delights and thou taking pattern from his mercy should abstain from vengeance seeing it belongs not to thee but to him alone forbear therefore to wish for the punishment of that runnagate wish rather for his repentance do all things my friend in love and charity to all men give thy heart to him that deserves it thy help to all that stand in need of it remember that the law tries our actions but god judges our thoughts there is a rule short easy equitable  do as you would be done by and you cannot do wrong  why that is exactly the rule i follow said the miller if a man does me a good turn i requite him with one as good if he does me an ill one i pay him in his own coin and if he robs and plunders me like that villain bowsey i wish to see him hanged that is my way and i believe it is very natural  weevil was not famous for drawing right conclusions and ezekiel would hardly have failed to convince him of it had not he just then turned into his innyard under the sign of the ship where he was instantly accosted by his son thomas who had just come off from the ship to procure some things that henry had occasion for one of the frigates boats was waiting for him and his job would be dispatched in half an hour when he would go with them on board where henry was this interval weevil proposed to fill up with a good breakfast for whatever his companion might think of the matter he at least recollected that he had come away from home fasting  there was a fellow in the kitchen belonging to the boat who called himself the captains cockswain who made himself known to our travelers upon hearing them say they were going on board he had been taking leave of a nymph of the shore who went by the dubious title of his wife and indeed it may well be questioned if that honorable and happy title was more than nominal she was however in tears and jack was comforting her and himself with a glass of brandy whilst he repeated to her in a lamentable tone his parting vows interlarding them with a continual repetition of only be true to me poll and clenching his promises of reciprocal fidelity with oaths of so peculiar a sort as made ezekiel stare with astonishment though he hardly knew what interpretation to put upon them at last when the fellow had pretty well disposed of every particle about himself to some devil or other to hold in pledge for his constancy to his beloved mate ezekiel though in close action at that moment with the salted buttock of an ox laid down his knife and fork and began to take the swearer to task friend said ezekiel thou have talked in so loud a tone that thou have made us hearers of thy conversation whether we would or not i perceive with regret that in the midst of thy affliction at parting from thy spouse thou have exhorted her to constancy frequently and in such a manner as argues a suspicion of her fidelity to thee in thine absence what cause thou have to hold in doubt the virtue of the wife of thy bosom i cannot tell as thou have stated no actual charge against her but i should hope the young woman has not entered into the holy state of wedlock without weighing and perpending the duties of a wife and also what a heinous sin it is to violate the nuptial bed if she knows this what need is there for thy so frequent repetitions on a case so clear if she knows it not i am here ready to instruct her in her matrimonial offices to the best of my abilities  are you so you be damned cried the sailor eyeing him from head to foot with the most sovereign contempt i will tell you what brother twill be the worst job you ever took in hand in your life you indeed you with those lantern jaws pretend to talk to my poll you with that lank carcass for all the world like the pursers shirt upon a handspike and now the lady no less irritated than her spokesman joined her treble to the base overwhelming poor ezekiel with a torrent of words not the most courtly in a key not the most harmonious whilst he stood staring with astonishment on them both yielding however no one inch of ground from the post he had taken nor from the upright attitude in which he stood conscious of having given no offense save that his zeal had innocently intruded a kind offer where it was not called for but soon the din became general for weevil the miller had now turned out on the part of his friend whilst the landlady who exerted her voice for peace and silence roared louder and with more fury than the parties themselves who were vociferous enough in the controversy without her help when this confusion was at the height and the sailor now roused like the lion with his own roar was become ferocious thundering out his oaths by whole broadsides at a volley a stripling youth or rather boy in the uniform of a midshipman stepping up to him and catching hold of a button of his jacket cried out in a shrill emasculate voice  what is here to do with you rascal hold your jaw and jump aboard you lubber or i will make you change your doxy for the gunners daughter  silence instantly ensued  aye aye sir cried the sailor gave a shrug pulled up his trowsers and was off like a shot  the youngster asked the landlady if the fellow had left any thing unpaid and being told there was nothing on the score but a shilling for the brandy he and the lady had been drinking he immediately discharged it intimating to the aforesaid lady that no more women would be admitted on board as the frigate would weigh with the next tide  ezekiel contemplated this instance of discipline with surprise and admiration the boyish age and person of the officer carried so little authority in appearance that he could scarce account for the immediate effect it took upon the boisterous spirit of the sailor and the obedience it produced  truly young gentleman he said there must be admirable order on board your ship when an unruly nature can be so readily controlled by a gentle one  i believe sir said the boy we are as well off in that respect as our neighbors captain carry supports his officers and i fancy that is the surest way to keep the men in order  ezekiel then enquired after his friend on board said that he had come for the purpose of paying him a short visit before he sailed and civilly requested permission to be passed to the ship in his boat  most readily said this young commander i am only waiting for a man who is on shore on that gentlemans business and i shall be off directly at that instant tom weevil entered the kitchen and the miller having paid the reckoning ezekiel with the father and son under conduct of their warlike leader proceeded to the beach where the boat was manned and waiting there was a heavy swell set in by the opposition of wind and tide and further out a bar on which the sea broke in a manner not a little formidable to a landsmans eyes the frigate was at anchor about two miles without this bar ezekiel and old weevil were placed in the sternsheets tom took his post at the bow and the noisy fellow now in office as cockswain took his seat in the steerage as perfectly under command of his beardless officer as if the admiral of the fleet had been on board the boat if ezekiel was struck with surprise at the authority of the youngster on shore he was still more so with his address and skill in maneuvering the boat through a sea which he conceived was every instant about to whelm them in the waves the miller who was as much a novice in navigation as the preacher exhibited strong symptoms of alarm jumping up once or twice in the boat for which he was very properly reprimanded by the youngster who ridiculed his fears telling him if he was afraid of being swampd he went the very way to bring it about ezekiel on the contrary sat still and kept a steady countenance not that he did not think he was at the last crisis of his fate but because he possessed a mind tranquillized by religion and perfectly resigned to that alldirecting being to whom his mental ejaculations were then silently addressed when they had struggled for some time on the bar with lusty sinews and hearts of controversy the young officer giving his orders with perfect firmness and precision and all voices were hushed but the shrill small pipe of a child he cried to the cockswain  mind your helm and be damned to you steer steady now lads give way all and we are clear  the energy was instantaneous what cannot british sailors do the boat was driven through the waves the bar was passed and they found themselves at once in deep water and a smoother sea the little midshipman now bade them step the mast and hoist the sail they shot before the wind and quickly were alongside of the frigate the humanity of this youngster gave orders for taking care of ezekiel and old weevil as they awkwardly scrambled up the side a lieutenant stood upon the gunwhale giving orders about some fresh beef and other stores they had brought off in the cutter and ezekiel had another call upon his wonder and surprise when he heard this lieutenant say to the young officer of the boat  you have had a good tuzzle on the bar lord frederick  so so replied lord frederick and immediately taking off his hat whilst he addressed his superior officer informed him that these two gentlemen wished to speak to mr fitzhenry the answer was that he was then in the cabin under the surgeons hands but if the gentlemens business was urgent he would direct them to be shown the way to him ezekiel expressing a desire to be instantly admitted to his friend was put under the guidance of a marine whilst old weevil went aside with tom to his quarters  when ezekiel entered the cabin he found henry with his arm stripped and the surgeon cleaning his wound a kind salutation was all these friends could interchange in their present circumstances  this gentleman said henry who is the surgeon of the ship is so kind to take in hand this paltry scratch and i assure you he gives a very handsome testimony to our good dames performances  a scratch do you call it cried ezekiel knitting his brow it is a perilous stab i protest i did not think by your account it had been any thing like this  then addressing himself to the surgeon he added  i pray you learned sir what is your opinion of this ugly gash  my opinion is cried the surgeon that had it not been in the direction where fortunately it is it might have been an ugly gash indeed but as it is i think it will be well in a few more dressings  this he said without looking at ezekiel being then employed in applying a compress to the wound before he bound it up having done this he looked round for the speaker whom he no sooner set eyes on than he said is it you mr daw i am very glad to see you  ezekiel stared upon him for a moment then marching up to him and taking him cordially by the hand exclaimed  as i live it is my old friend and favorite billy williams never trust me but i rejoice to see thee in the land of the living mr williams heartily i rejoice at thy welldoing for i have much bewailed thy sudden disappearance from amongst us esteeming thee very truly for thy towardly disposition and good qualities no less than for thy talents if i mistake not it is now going on to two years since you quitted neighbor cawdle and we knew not whither you went  this satisfied henrys curiosity so far and as they proceeded in their conversation williams filled up the interval with an account of himself in various ships to the present time when having done his business with henry and answered all ezekiels enquiries he respectfully took his leave and retired and now our hero and his friend being left to themselves had a conference of at least half an hour without interruption when captain carry entered the cabin who very kindly welcomed ezekiel upon henrys introduction of him he lamented he could not ask him to dinner as they were then weighing anchor and should be out to sea we must think therefore said he how to get you on shore and the first lieutenant then entering the cabin he desired him to hail the tender alongside of them and ask the loan of their boat to set ezekiel and his friend weevil on shore they now adjourned to the quarter deck whilst ezekiels attention was deeply engaged with the exertions of the men at the capstan where for the time they are at work they enjoy a kind of temporary saturnalia venting their sea jokes without restraint in a most ridiculous style all was new to ezekiel but the heavy moment of parting from henry hung upon his heart and now the tenders boat was hauled along side the frigate swung with the tide the sails were hoisting the boatswain plied his whistle the men swarmed upon the yards the officers roared through their trumpets weevil was already in the boat ezekiel cast a parting look at henry threw his arms about his neck sighed out a farewell recommended him to providence and committed himself to the boat  chapter iv a certain interested gentleman meets with a rebuff the tenders boatmen hawled off from the ship a few lengths and then laid on their oars and cheered the frigate who now began to feel her sails and make way through the water this roused ezekiel from his torpor and instantly his ears were assailed by three repeated cheers in a much louder key from the whole crew of the tender who had manned ship in compliment to captain carry the frigates crew returned the inspiring compliment and then presenting her stern to the tearfull eyes of ezekiel she glided majestically over the waves scarce deigning them a curtsey as they sunk beneath her keel conscious as it should seem that she was worthy to assert the empire of the flag which she displayed  hurrah my hearts cried the man in the steerage the boat cut through the water  there she goes looking at the frigate said one of the fellows at his oar  damn me but i wish i was in her repeated a second  have you then a friend said ezekiel on board that ship whom you regret to part from and is your heart agonizd with grief like mine  grief indeed cried the fellow in a surly tone grief never came near my heart since i had one i wish myself in her because i think she has a fighting captain on board and therell be something to be got to make merry with on shore but belike you are tenderhearted and take on because your friend is gone to sea if that be the case do you mind me do as i do when i part from my wife swab the spray out of your glims and think no more about it  i cannot be sure that i clearly understand thee friend replied ezekiel but i presume it makes to the benefit of thy country that thou art void of feeling  as this did not reach the understanding of the tar it produced no answer and whatever want of feeling in ezekiels sense of it there might be in those he had embarked with there was such strength and alacrity that our passengers soon found themselves safely landed on their native soil a can of grog to the crew and a slight refreshment for weevil and ezekiel to revive languid nature filled up the time whilst the millers cart was getting ready which at length safely landed our travelers at ezekiels door and not without many of those jars and jumbles emblematic of the troubles inseparably attendant on our passage through life  whilst henry was now wafted into the ocean and whilst the land he had left was sinking in the horizon of his prospect the tender heart of his beloved isabella had directed many a sigh to attend him over the watery waste lady crowbery had arrived at manstock house less exhausted with her first stage than could reasonably be expected sir roger isabella zachary cawdle every soul male and female in the family were in motion to attend upon her nor did the reverend mr claypole fail to be amongst the forwardest to exhibit his devoirs fanny meanwhile remained in sullen solitude at the vicarage her mind experiencing the various torments slighted passion is exposed to her secret was entombed in isabellas breast in that of goody may it had a more precarious tenure yet for the present she adhered to the injunctions she had received and held her tongue lady crowbery had remarked the condition of henrys arm but had taken up with the slight account he had given of it the rather because she perceived he had a ready use of it little however was said upon the subject whilst the family were about her and isabella did not think it necessary to speak of the interview she had had at the dames  when dinner was over and lady crowberys spirits seemed recruited by her repast and the company of her friends an opportunity was taken by sir roger to introduce a subject which he knew his friend mr claypole to have much at heart and which he opened by enquiring if she had filled up mr ratcliffes vacancy upon her replying that it was yet open sir roger expressed his wishes in favor of his friend then present for claypoles delicacy had not prevailed with him to retire from the hearing of his own success at first hand of which he very naturally entertained the most sanguine expectation  are you a party in these wishes of your worthy friend said the lady addressing herself to claypole  i confess to your ladyship i am replied he and should hold myself infinitely bound to you for putting me in possession of those wishes  mr ratcliffe was a constant resident resumed she and perhaps you are not aware that i should stipulate with his successor to tread as nearly as possible in his steps  i hope madam replied the divine somewhat piqued at the expression i should not fall short of my predecessor in any part of his practice  in some of his doctrines i believe you differ mr claypole if i have been rightly informed  as how madam i beseech you reiterated the reverend gentleman with eagerness in what one doctrine fitting for mr ratcliffe to hold have i been found to differ from him or fall short i never had my orthodoxy questioned  sir roger looked at his niece with marks of surprise but being a man of few words waited silently for a further explanation of this mystery  in this respect said the lady i conceive you differ mr ratcliffe put a value on a just and generous act that would have led him to despise the man who gave him sordid counsel or condemned him for a sacrifice of interest to conscience this i dare say is your doctrine in the pulpit mr claypole for i dont doubt your orthodoxy but allow me to say it was his also in the closet this he inculcated to henry whom he fathered and who has nobly practiced what he taught by giving up the whole of blachfords fortune to the son of blachford this you condemned but this my departed friend would have so decidedly approved of that i take upon me to say you differ in your doctrine and being employed in seeking out some successor who shall as i before said tread as nearly as possible in the steps of that excellent and everlamented friend i can only tell you that i have not yet discovered the person that answers to my search  here the lady ceased from speaking the persons present were sir roger manstock isabella and the gentleman himself to whom the words were addressed of these not one seemed disposed at that time to renew the subject various motives kept them silent when claypole who had probably better dispositions for taking up the conversation but less matter to support it with than any present sullenly retired and lest the uncle niece and isabella to comment upon it as they saw fit  sir roger who was not yet informed of the transaction alluded to by lady crowbery and to his great surprise had heard his application answered in so different a manner from what he looked for saw claypole leave the room without offering a word either in support of his suit or which might lead to an explanation of what he did not yet comprehend isabella alone knew the real motives of the absent gentleman for the proceeding which lady crowbery resented in this manner and at the same time foresaw the farther disappointment that was in reserve for him when he should next have a meeting with his niece sir roger in the mean time after some pause requested to be informed by lady crowbery how it was mr claypole had been so unfortunate as to loose her good opinion this drew from her an account of henrys generous behavior in the matter of blachfords will and of the sentiments mr claypole had expressed upon that transaction when he called upon henry at crowbery every circumstance of this was new to the worthy baronet who without hesitation concurred in passing the highest encomiums on our hero and concluded by saying that he always suspected his friend claypole to have a little more attention to the main chance than was strictly consistent with his own way of thinking  witness said he his readiness to give up me and my parish for an exchange which upon calculation could not have benefitted him in more than a hundred a year at most so that i confess to you it put me upon computing the price at which he valued the society of an old friend whose house and heart were ever open to him after all perhaps it may be too much to require of any man that he should love me better than his money and as for his advice to our friend henry which appears to you so reprehensible recollecting as i do how much it was the wish of his heart to marry him to his niece fanny i can account for his regret at seeing such a fortune as mr blachfords slip out of his fingers  heavens exclaimed lady crowbery forgetting herself in the moment of surprise had he the assurance to suppose that my henry would throw himself away upon that flippant flirting thing fanny claypole i will venture to pronounce his heart was never that way disposed no no he has better notions better taste and better pretensions  the baronet though too much a man of honor to expose what had been passing in his house was yet unwilling to hear his intelligence so totally decried and turning to his daughter said he fancied she could testify there was some truth in what he said this appeal came rather unseasonably upon isabella who had taken to herself the application of some words which lady crowbery had concluded with and she simply replied that miss claypole she believed would not have been adverse to such a proposal but she added incautiously enough that she was sure no such thing could ever take place  indeed cried her father are you sure of that upon what grounds i beg to know do you speak so confidently about henrys resolutions  because replied isabella and here she faultered but truth was too familiar with her lips to be held back  because he told me so himself  chapter v let innocence beware springguns and mantraps are laid in these premises when isabella gave this honest answer to her fathers question a light struck upon his mind which some of our readers may think might have reached him before accustomed ever to behold her open brow without a cloud and to hear her speak to him without faultering the embarrassment that now he could not fail to discover opened a new train of thoughts and he instantly pressed fresh questions upon isabella which she had too much candor to evade she told him how she had accidentally dropped in at dame mays that very morning where she found henry  and how came he there sir roger demanded  he had hurt his arm and the good woman was dressing it  and did he tell you of mr claypoles proposal for his niece and of his own rejection of her  i understood replied isabella he had an interview with miss claypole which had been conclusive against any further correspondence or connection  and how was you interested demanded he to be informed of that  i should hope replied isabella that my father does not want to search into my thoughts as suspecting they conceal what ought not to be there  this apostrophe and perhaps the presence of lady crowbery checked for a time the curiosity of sir roger zachary also helped to turn the subject by coming in with a medicine he had been preparing for his patient  the reverend mr claypole who had left the room upon his rebuff from the lady patroness of ratcliffes living had gone straight to the vicarage in quest of his niece here he was greeted not with the sight of fanny but of fannys letter put into his hands by the old woman of the house who informed him that the young lady had taken her departure early in the morning this letter briefly told him that she had for ever taken leave of a place that was rendered odious to her by the treatment she had met in it that she made no doubt stories would be circulated disreputable to her character but they could be nothing but the basest forgeries which she conjured him to treat with the contempt they merited that she had discovered the young man he thought so well of to be half knave half fool and for her part she had done with him she added that he had frightened her into fits by his awkwardness in letting a knife which she had used for cutting open the leaves of a book run into his arm and wound him in conclusion she apologized for the early hour of her departure which prevented her from taking leave of him but he should hear from her when she arrived in london  claypoles breast now boiled with indignation against henry he had disgraced his niece and which was worse disappointed him of a valuable living for he was too well informed not to know that ratcliffe had left it in a state that would bear a deal of stretching in this temper of mind he sauntered slowly toward sir rogers deeply meditating by the way the baronet was no less eager for the meeting than he was and having stepped out of the room when zachary entered in encountered him in the hall claypole was full charged with venom he had brooded upon by the way i thank you dear and worthy sir said he with counterfeited humility for your kind though ineffectual intercession in my favor having heard a character of myself so contrary to what i expected or deserved i hope you will not think me petulant if i beg leave to retire to my chamber for this evening rather than meet the eyes of a lady which had not used to look so unfavourably upon me and for whom i entertain too high a reverence and esteem to be indifferent to her contempt of me perhaps sir you may have thought as lady crowbery does that this young mans conduct in blachfords business is an act of high honor and that i was a very shabby fellow to advise him otherwise  i dont quite say that replied sir roger gravely because i believe you thought of him as likely to be a part of the family but i confess to you the transaction as represented to me appears a very honorable one on his part  his motives must determine that said claypole it is a cheap way of doing a seemingly disinterested action when he gains the favor of lady crowbery and the good opinion of miss manstock sir roger started i own continued he that i did zealously press forward a marriage in which i did not altogether wish to make so total a sacrifice of my niece as to marry her to absolute beggary but recommended him to reserve some portion of mr blachfords property as a maintenance this is the mercenary advice for which i am condemned but with humble submission to lady crowbery i am of opinion i was sufficiently disinterested when i promoted a marriage even upon these terms and which i should not have listened to for a moment upon any had i not been persuaded that by taking the danger of an obscure unpromising connection on myself i was fulfilling the duties of gratitude and friendship by consulting the interests of my patron and benefactor in the most essential object of his life here sir roger again made a motion expressive of agitation and surprise and now sir added he if i who have been so long honored with your friendship and so much profited by your hospitality have appeared to you as a man insensible to your bounty and my own happiness and one who upon mercenary motives was reaching after a better benefice in a distant place i hope you will now discern my motives and acquit me of such folly and such ingratitude as would stamp my conduct upon any other principles than the real ones for in the first place what could i profit by the exchange granting that mr ratcliffes living were somewhat better than my own a fact which i have not been curious to enquire into but be the advantage what in may surely it would not balance the difference between living upon my own establishment and appertaining to yours but when i foresaw with grief of heart that whether this young nameless fellow married or married not my fanny claypole my station in this family had no lasting tenure consistently with your repose or my own can you wonder that i caught at any hope that offered me an opportunity of retreating in good time without disturbing your peace at my departure content that you should even condemn me for the measure rather than be driven as i now am to open your eyes upon the real motives for it  mr claypole said sir roger no longer able to refrain himself you do indeed open my eyes which have been in darkness but i must desire you will also enable them to see clearly all the danger that is before them else permit me to observe that your friendship only goes the length of alarming me but stops short where it should inform me  sir roger manstock replied claypole in a tone of much solemnity after the proof i have given how far my attachment has already carried me i should hope you will not suppose it likely to stop short or shrink from any duties friendship can require of me if this young adventurer had carried off my niece i should have held myself justified in serving you so far and should have seceded from your family in silence for where would have been the kindness or use in opening your eyes upon dangers after you had escaped them you would then perhaps have set me down in your thoughts for a capricious fickle minded man but my conscience would have witnessed better things but now that this mr henry fitzhenry or whatever name he chooses to be called by has thought fit to reject miss claypole with fifteen thousand pounds to her fortune and my honest attempt is defeated with the sacrifice of my nieces peace and reputation whilst he is extolled to the skies for his rejection both of her generous offer and blachfords liberal bequest what am i to think but that he has friends in those who so highly praise him who are too well disposed to reward him for sacrificing my connection and to ruin me in your esteem of which design i think you have already had some proof for my attempt to take upon myself your danger and defeat their wishes and now sir roger let me make one serious condition with you in this place consent to drop this matter for the present lady crowbery is your guest for this night separate not yourself any longer from her i beseech you change not if possible your countenance nor abate of your good humor to either of those amiable ladies who will wonder at your absence if you do not suffer me to retire immediately if any question is asked why i do not attend at supper be pleased to let my apology be a slight indisposition the plea will not offend against the truth for i am far from well this said he took sir rogers hand tenderly pressed it in his and hastened away  when he found himself in his chamber he again took out his nieces letter and then for the first time discovered that there was a postscript over leaf which he had overlooked in his first reading there being no reference to it the purport was as follows   the gentleman took up his abode last night with mother may a good commodious body as you will confess if you find upon enquiry that the immaculate isabella shall have given him the meeting there if she did let sir roger look about him i can take upon me to assure you she is fond of him and it is my opinion that in spite of all her sanctified airs she is up to any act of desperation love can drive her to once more i repeat  let sir roger look about him this postscript so happily coinciding with his own operations already commenced determined claypole to set out immediately upon discoveries his first wish was to sift goody may but of this he soon saw the impolicy at least of undertaking it in his own person he therefore bent his steps to his own house supposing he might get something from the old woman in his service and with whom his curiosity was not likely to subject him to the same suspicion of her he learnt no more than that henry had been a pretty considerable time alone with miss fanny during which she never entered the room but that just as he was going he rung the bell with great vehemence and upon her coming to it told her that her young lady was taken suddenly ill and charged her to be careful of her and not leave her that she did not then discover he was wounded but was told it by miss fanny who raved and rambled and took on at a piteous rate being in strong hysterics as for what she talked about in her fit  said the old woman tell me what she said in her fit quoth claypole it is very material to me to know what she said and it is your duty not to conceal it from me the woman then repeated as well as she could such of her incoherent sallies as she could call to mind they were made up of various passions breaking out in confused exclamations sometimes of violent love at other times of hatred and contempt as violent some expressions she recollected full of terror for his life and as if she had accused herself of having murdered him at one time added the old woman i was sorely afraid the poor young lady had been betrayed and dealt dishonestly by for she said again and again that he had made a fool of her and was a base deceiver upon that i straightly asked her if he had taken advantage of her in an unlucky moment and had his wicked will of her to this she answered no no with great vehemence he had deceived her in another way  well well cried claypole stopping her say no more upon that subject i am satisfied no real injury has been done to her virtue  none be assured echoed the old dame i will stake my life upon that and mrs may will certify the same  how exclaimed he mrs may will certify what knows she of the affair  lackaday answered she i was fain to call in help for young madam was quite obstreperous and so as i knew neighbor may was knowing in those cases i sent away for her and well it was she came for she quickly fetched her out of her fit and quieted her  well resumed claypole and what became of the gentleman  oh cried the old woman he took up his lodgings at mrs mays and did not go off next morning till he had seen my lady crowbery who stopped at the door and took him into the chaise with her where they sat together as some of the neighbors tell me for i know not how long whilst my ladys gentlewoman got out to make room for him nay and there is more than all that only belike you will be angry with me for talking to you about matters  not i quoth claypole i desire you will tell of all matters that you believe or know to be true did miss manstock come to goody mays while the gentleman was there  aye did she as sure as you are in that place alive said the hag and was all alone with him ever so long in the parlour that madam has decked out so finely for a newcomer amongst us when as all the neighbors say she might have found some of her own poor parishioners to bestow it upon instead of a stranger  what is that to the purpose said claypole peevishly go on with your story about henry and miss manstock are you sure they were in private together  certain sure replied she for just then i called upon mrs may to return her some bottles of stuff which had not been used and as i was turning into the parlour to the closet where she keeps her drugs she laid hold of me in a great hurry telling me i must not go into that room for my life i seeing her in such a combustion strait thought within myself how that something was going on more than common and taking no further notice at the time determined upon peeping in at the window when i went away and she was out of sight i did so god forgive me if i did wrong and there i saw young madam and her spark sitting lovingly together not that i would go to say there was any harm in what they were about but if ever i saw any thing clearly with these eyes in my life i saw madam isabella with her head upon the gentlemans shoulder and his arm round her waist oho said i to myself well may our poor young lady weep and wail at such a rate if these be your false hearted doings  well satisfied with the substance of this intelligence and quick in discerning the advantages of it claypole departed  chapter vi cunning can hold off detection for a while a nature like sir roger manstocks was not easily wrought upon by the poison of suspicion toward a character like isabellas confidence long rooted in strong affection was not speedily to be shaken yet his happiness was disturbed and his spirits depressed when henry was spoken of which he frequently was by lady crowbery he was either silent on the subject or contrived to pass it off his looks at the same time were watchfully directed toward his daughter and the effect of them was very painfully felt when lady crowbery retired for the night he attended her himself to her chamber and contrived to take isabella away with him the night passed heavily with her and the next morning afforded no opportunity of being private with her cousin the sad hour of departure drew near and though there was not more than time for such friends to take a farewell which was probably to be their last nobody dared to speak the word all parties sat silent zachary cawdle had the consideration to keep out of the way at last lady crowbery spoke as follows   i had reserved many things to say to you my dear uncle but i perceive too late the fallacy of postponing those things to a time when the pain of parting occupies the mind to the exclusion of all other thoughts i shall therefore refer you for them to my letters if my health enables me to write if not you will find a paper enclosed with my will to be read by you after my death in which my heart and all its sorrows is laid open to your view be as tender to my memory when i am no more as you have been kind and generous to me whilst living and may heaven reward you for it if i have offended you in the matter of your application for mr claypole or in the manner of my treating it in the presence of that gentleman i am sorry for it but i cannot revoke my opinion of him though i suspect it may appear to you as a very harsh one but this is not the moment for me to prevaricate impressed as i am with the persuasion that it is amongst the last i have to pass with you  heaven forbid cried the venerable baronet and tenderly embraced her isabella weeping next presented herself to take her melancholy adieu lady crowbery whispered a few words to her as she was in her arms and then with assistance rose from her chair and was supported to the carriage that waited at the door where all the domestics of manstock house were assembled to offer up their good wishes for her recovery alas how fruitless  sir roger retired to his library isabella to her apartment claypole had kept close and did not present himself at lady crowberys departure this was not unnoticed by sir roger who did not expect to meet so strong a mark of his resentment the solemn declaration made by that lady under the impression that they were the last words she should address to him in person sunk deep into his mind  i cannot revoke my opinion of him  he was not of a nature prone to suspicion nor had he that gift of intuition which can discover the real character of a man by tracing it through the windings and involutions of artifice and cunning claypole by superior acuteness of intellect had gained a complete ascendancy over him and preserved it long yet he had not a little surprised sir roger by his solicitation for ratcliffes living it struck him in the light of a dereliction of his friendship upon motives merely mercenary but the artful interpretation afterward given to those motives had put a very favorable gloss upon it as to claypoles conduct but it fatally instilled into his mind a doubt as to the dearest object of his affections and for the first time shook his confidence in his beloved isabella this was now the painful subject of his meditations and after opposing thought to thought and weighing them calmly and impartially to the best of his judgment and understanding he began to sum up the result of his reflections in the following manner   lady crowbery says she cannot revoke her opinion of mr claypole neither can i without better proof than i am yet provided with  if a small augmentation of his income could have tempted him to turn his back upon me i should have doubted the sincerity of his friendship for he does not want money  but this exchange was not the way to gain it therefore i am the more disposed to believe the reasons he assigns for seeking it  he says he would have given his niece to henry for my sake for my repose  and what can that imply but that he apprehends me to be in danger and how in danger but that he suspects my isabella to be attached to the young man whom he would have married to miss claypole  this is indeed alarming suspicion is always so but i must not give way to suspicion without proofs hitherto he has given me none isabella confesses that she met him accidentally at the cottage what then her very confession of it should disarm suspicion and my child has ever been ingenuous and sincere claypole would have me think he took a dangerous connection on himself for my sake if so he has had an escape why then this resentment against henry for refusing to endanger him but he was eager enough for the connection when i first conversed with him about it he sought the young man unknown to me conferred with him at crowbery and strove to persuade him to avail himself of blachfords legacy that could not be for my sake there is something here that does not seem to accord i am puzzled how to judge  at this moment claypole announced himself with a gentle tap at the library dour and was desired to enter sir roger had well nigh entangled himself in his medications and probably was not sorry thus to cut the knot which he could not untie well my good friend said he with a sigh my niece is gone perhaps for ever i think you was not present to take leave of her  my presence i am afraid replied claypole could not have been agreeable to her nor my respects acceptable  to me at least they would if not to her said sir roger  to you they never can be wanting resumed he of which this tender of them is my witness when i am fitter for my bed than to be about  i am very sorry you are indisposed resumed the baronet for i confess to you there was part of your conversation last night which has left my thoughts in a state of great inquietude  if that be so replied claypole i am quite at leisure to satisfy you upon any points you may wish to have explained clear in conscience and cordial in my zeal for your interest and content i can never be taken unprovided with a strait answer to any questions you may choose to ask  i cannot doubt you quoth the baronet and shall accordingly avail myself of your indulgence i think you stated the proposed connection with young henry and miss claypole as a dangerous one but which nevertheless you was resolute to encounter upon reasons that had respect to my repose the nature of which i can well understand  i did so  did you see it in that light of danger when you first started it in our conversation together in the hall  i do not perfectly call to mind how i saw it or how i started it upon that occasion it was a night of bustle and confusion we had sat long and indulged freely at table  we had so rejoined sir roger yet i remember you embraced it with so much seeming warmth and good liking that if you was then projecting to make a sacrifice of your own interests to mine you really masked your motives so effectually that i was not aware of the concern i had in them  that they were my motives said claypole i can truly assert that you did not discover them might very naturally happen as i did not study the display of a disinterested action and cautiously avoided alarming you with danger which i was in hopes to divert from you for ever but added to this might it not happen that i thought better of the young man at that time than i have done since i am free to say notwithstanding lady crowberys decision against me for my opinion in that case i did not approve of his romantic heroism in beggaring himself for susan mays bastard he held a very haughty language to me upon that occasion and i do not think it became him either to talk or to act as he did in that affair  to this sir roger replied a haughty language did not become him and a disrespectful one toward a person of your age and character was greatly reprehensible but as for the act itself i cannot but regard it as a very honorable one  sir said claypole these are highflown fancies the fellow is a beggar with a fair face and a proud stomach he lives upon charity  and that charity will enable him to live said sir roger calmly  scantily i should guess replied claypole some small provision lady crowbery may have made for him in her will but i should hope her ladyship will not heap any great matters upon such an one as him to the detriment of your family  there sir returned the baronet you are much more zealous for my family than i am myself my estate is more than sufficient for all my occasions sure it will suffice to portion one daughter  permit me then replied claypole to say to you sir without offense that i sincerely hope that daughter will never have any other interest in lady crowberys property but what that lady herself may bequeath to her as miss manstock  i clearly comprehend you said sir roger and as you mean it so i receive it and now i call upon you as my friend to tell me without reserve upon what proofs you ground your apprehensions of my daughters attachment to this young man suspicion is a serious thing i am persuaded you would not frivolously alarm it be so good to tell me what you have discovered in miss manstocks conduct  pardon me replied claypole i pretend to take no other part than that of a warning friend i do not covet the character of an informing spy let the woman of the cottage be interrogated  not so said sir roger calmly let my child with your leave be fairly heard before i call witnesses to the charge against her let me at least make trial of her sincerity she has never yet deceived me to my knowledge and i should be loath to take a secret course with her and now as you have with so much friendly zeal made my repose and the honor of my family your own concern let me request you wilt be present whilst i ask a few questions of my daughter as from myfelf claypole instantly started from his seat and resolutely protested against such a proposal saying that he had no desire to be made a party in family disputes either by being set up as an umpire between father and daughter or called to the indelicate office of deposing against a young lady he had spoken his fears in the way of caution if they were investigated he did not doubt but they would be found not to have been lightly taken up but he confessed he had not sufficient firmness to assert them to the face of so fair a lady this said he left the room  chapter vii let the man who suspects resort speedily to explanation can this be pure friendship said sir roger within himself as claypole parted from him i am willing to hope it is but i can hardly think it has all the characteristics of it he now went up stairs to his daughters dressing room where he found her alone she had been weeping and was sitting in a pensive posture without any employment he approached her gently for sorrow claims respect and in a tender tone he said you have been in tears my child but i cannot wonder at it it is an affecting trial to take leave of so dear a friend with so little hope of ever meeting again i feel it deeply too i believe my affliction is as heavy as your own  i hope not replied isabella because i am afraid i have more losses than one to aggravate my affliction  of what loss do you complain besides this of lady crowbery said he in the accent of alarm  of the loss of your confidence sir returned she looking up in his face with conscious innocence the appeal was irresistible the most hardened tyrant would have felt it how could it fail to touch the tender heart of so affectionate a father not so my child said he you have not lost my confidence you will not lose it you will merit an increase of it your candor will confirm and fix it beyond the reach of doubt for ever after  in truth she replied my heart is exactly as nature and you have made it it is conscious of no guilt and i have taught it no disguise prove it therefore and examine it tell me all that you suspect all that has been reported to you all that your own fears suggest and leave no particle unfifted for never can i be happy whilst any doubt remains to cloud that countenance which hitherto has smiled upon me so serenely  it is spoken like yourself said the father his countenance brightening as he said it and now my dear i should be glad to know provided you can tell me with honor to lady crowbery what it was she said to you in a whisper when you took leave of each other  readily answered isabella and the rather because it was advice that does her credit though in justice to myself i must add i did not then stand in need of it she had observed you was startled at my meeting henry at the cottage she suspected mr claypole had been alarming you on the subject and she advised me to be sincere in relating to you every thing that passed between us this was the purport of what she whispered to me and this i am now most perfectly ready to fulfill  here it may be proper to inform our readers that isabella in this statement reported truly as far as she went but candor it is hoped will acquit her if she did not betray what was further divulged to her in strict secrecy for in that parting moment lady crowbery impressed with a sad presentiment that she should never see her more had imparted to her the mystery of henrys birth avowing him to be her son by captain delapoer and informing her that she had made him her heir  in return for this candid tender sir roger observed that it was not merely the circumstance of her meeting henry and conversing with him without a third person present that gave him alarm that must have often happened whilst he was a visitor in his house but in this business there was a seeming secrecy and mysteriousness in their meeting that gave it the air of a concerted assignation that his sudden departure without a word said or written to him by way of farewell favored that appearance and he added that he could not well account for his declining a connection every way so flattering and so advantageous to a person in his circumstance as that with miss claypole any otherwise than as having an attachment elsewhere  in answer to this isabella assured him that her meeting with henry at the cottage was purely accidental he had a wound which broke out afresh whilst she was there and bled profusely she staid with him whilst it was dressed it was a deep stab in the arm she remained some time after it was stanched and they were left to themselves he then told her that his treaty with miss claypole was broken off the reasons for it he did not tell but he certainly did not speak of it with any regret nor did she believe he had ever considered it either as an advantageous or agreeable connection as to her fathers observation that he had not communicated with him in any manner she said she could only ascribe that to his fear of being questioned about his wound of which she found him very unwilling to give any other account than in general terms as an accident and even this she observed was unpleasant to him to speak of did he come wounded from his interview with fanny claypole  she believed he did  then he got it there  she understood so  sir roger pondered upon this for some time in silence he then renewed the conversation in the following manner this is a dark business isabella fanny claypole is a girl of a violent temper as for henry i should be unjust if i did not bear testimony to his good principles as far as i have had experience of them his person manners and behavior are highly impressive the situation in which i sound him the unjust treatment he had suffered and his deportment under it prejudiced me strongly in his favor my niece crowberys protection in the first instance was natural as considering him the eleve of ratcliffe and undeservedly distressed i warmly coincided with it it afterward grew more ardent i was alarmed at it it now is become mysterious and i cannot understand it when i invited him into my house i did not forget that i possessed a beautiful daughter the heiress of my fortune and the darling of my soul but such was the distance of your conditions from each other such my confidence in your discretion and my opinion of his proper understanding of himself that i own to you i foresaw no danger and let me hope i have incurred none but if my confidence has led me into error or he mistaking your pity for encouragement has been rash enough to attempt your affections it is now high time that i endeavor to repair that error by calling you to a recollection of yourself and me  and what she demanded would my father prescribe to me for his future assurance and content  i would have you keep in mind he replied that i exact no other rights than nature has endowed me with when i require you if ever you entertained a thought of this young man to call to mind now in good time my solemn declaration that i never will admit of your connection with a man so circumstancd i never wish to force your inclinations have no unreasonable ambition to ally you to great rank or overgrown estate but to absolute obscurity to mystery to an unknown creature parentless and nameless i cannot will not sacrifice my child  how just and reasonable said she is that denunciation i seal it with my promise faithfully to adhere to it  take notice added the father that blachfords whole possessions could have made no change in my resolves nor been of any avail to him as he is  i understand it perfectly she said he must be known his history must be developd and his parentage clearly ascertained should time bring that to light and set him forth to view as unexceptionable in birth and condition as he is amiable in character and manners may i not presume my father would relax  stop there he cried nor cherish such delusions which will only prove you have him more at heart than i could wish alas alas my child i fear your eyes have led your understanding astray i doubt isabella you are captivated by what the worst as well as the best the meanest as well as the most noble may present to you a handsome person  surely my dear sir said isabella blushing you just now spoke with approbation of his principles  i did so he replied and i will not unsay it he has done generous actions noble ones that would extort applause even from his enemy which i am not  but he has enemies she rejoined at least there are some minds so hostile to merit or so perverted by malice as to allow him no applause  i grant you replied sir roger but claypole is angry with him for refusing his niece  ah sir returned the lovely isabella then henry i fear will soon experience the effects of his anger  that would be hard sir roger observed as he suspected he had received one wound from the family already  but there are deeper and more fatal wounds than he has yet felt said isabella that he has still to apprehend i have reason to believe that a stab in your opinion would afflict him more than any thing his flesh can suffer  come come said the worthy baronet with a parental smile henry may have enemies but i perceive he has one steady friend and that friend has great power for she is very near my heart  with these words he rose from his seat approached her with a gentle aspect and having impressed a kiss upon her forehead departed  chapter viii she who confesses less than the whole may save a blush but will incur a danger isabella found the anguish of her mind allayed by the preceding conversation with her father it had not totally extinguished it there were still some tender incidents belonging to her interview with henry which remained untold yet upon reflection she could hardly be persuaded to attach any degree of self reproach to the omission of such incidents in her narrative as it was next to impossible to convey by any form of words the delicacy of those circumstances which introduced and the purity of those sensations which admitted these chaste and innocent endearments how could she find expressions that would describe what was passing in the mind of henry when starting from his reverie on her sudden appearance in his room he wildly ran and caught her in his arms unmindful of his wound that burst instantly open in the like degree language would have failed her to impress him with a just conception of those soft but guiltless emotions occasioned by the sight of the blood flowing from his wound by the tenderness of his looks his language and the mixed assemblage of enervating ideas at the touching crisis of departure which had caused her to sink under a momentary oppression of spirits whilst he supported her in his arms this she despaired to paint in terms that could exemplify a scene which nothing but the manner of it could strictly justify and none but a spectator could completely understand  therefore it was that her ingenuous nature found a plea in its own want of powers for letting these small incidents remain untold and who that has a heart which love or pity ever touched but will subscribe a wish that they had been unseen  in the next conversation that took place between claypole and sir roger the latter repeated the substance of what had passed between himself and his daughter expressing his entire satisfaction in the result of it and declaring in the joy of his heart that he was now perfectly at ease with respect to his late alarm about the inteveiw at the cottage claypole affected to receive this account with pleasure saying he was very glad he had taken that method of investigation which made the quickest dispatch in dismissing his uneasiness happiness he observed was worth obtaining even by delusion and for that reason he would recommend to him to sit down contented with the account he had received though it was from the party concerned and not expose himself to the risque of future inquietude by investigating the affair any further or seeking after witnesses whose accounts might perhaps perplex him by differing in some particulars from that which had been so satisfactory he then with an air of indifference turned the discourse to some other subject and left his observation to work as it might or might not within the mind of his friend to whom he addressed it  the next day ezekiel daw walked over from crowbery upon a visit to his friend dame may at the cottage bearing a kind message from her daughter and inviting her to take up her abode with her at the deceased mr blachfords house where by advice of her friends she purposed to establish herself and the infant heir he was also encharged by susan to apologize on her behalf in the most respectful terms to miss manstock for her not paying her duty in person and with other small commissions to be settled with the servants this brought him to the great house after halting on his way at the widows and his arrival was announced to isabella as she was in company with her father and mr claypole she would fain have left the room to attend upon him but the thought struck sir roger to have him introduced to the parlour declaring that he was not only greatly taken with the oddity of his character but that he esteemed him as a very upright honest creature  ezekiel made his advances in a respectful manner to the worthy baronet and was by him very kindly welcomed to manstock house he acquitted himself of his commission to the young lady after his manner properly enough and then made an effort to take leave but was stayed by a question from sir roger relative to the amount of what mr blachford had bequeathed to his heir ezekiel said that it consisted of property in jamaica which returned about two thousand pounds one year with another as far as he could understand with about ten thousand pounds in money and the small estate at crowbery but he desired not to be understood as speaking correctly sir roger said in an undervoice to claypole  it is not so much as i guessed he was possessed of but it is a great deal for a poor man to give up upon principle he then enquired if there were any legacies ezekiel informed him there were a few upon which claypole said  i suppose you have got a legacy sir  no reverend sir replied the good man i have no legacy nor did i covet one it fits not the servant of christ to be greedy after gain  then i suppose resumed he that it was by your advice mr fitzhenry declined his legacy  not so sir replied ezekiel the first i heard of it was just before you came into my poor cottage when if i mistake not you disapproved of that act which in my humble opinion was a very meritorious one but it is not by the praise or dispraise of men that actions can be truly tried heaven knows that excellent young man has received little else but unjust judgment upon earth and evil treatment from cruel hands even now he is gone forth to sea most barbarously wounded  do you pretend to know then said claypole how he got that wound  yes reverend sir replied ezekiel rising in his tone i do pretend to know  stop there mr daw cried isabella hastily interposing i dare say your absent friend would not wish you to speak of that affair in this company or any other i beseech you say no more upon the subject  lady i obey answered ezekiel and verily i am beholden to you for your timely counsel silence now ensuing honest daw made his bow and retired  pray madam said claypole may i ask without offense why you stopped that mans answer to a question which i who put it to him had a right to expect and no repugnance to meet  because i am persuaded replied isabella he had received no account of the transaction from the person who received the wound and i think it was both dangerous and improper for him to speak upon any other authority  suffer me to observe said he that i do not see the justice of saving any man from the danger of a malicious story when it is clear he has the propensity to publish it had he been suffered to proceed we might have been led through the medium of falsehood to the investigation of truth and i might have had a fair opportunity of vindicating the character of my niece as well as of punishing the wickedness of her defamers but i perceive ezekiel daw the itinerant preacher is considered by you as a sacred person and under your shield madam how can it be expected that my arm can reach him or indeed be raised against him i perceive madam there is a design to propagate a most villainous story and to affix a murderous intent upon a matter of mere accident when the wounded gentleman got his hurt nobody was present but my niece i am at a loss therefore to think from whom else this evil report should originate but from him to this isabella steadily replied whatever term you may affix to the report i dare say it did not spring from him if indeed it be an evil one it could not  then madam replied claypole we must lay it at the door of some tattling gossip who gathering some expressions from the terrified imagination of my niece when the sight of the accident had thrown her into fits founded this malicious interpretation of it and if that be all i am sure the wisest way is to disregard it for in truth their silly fables merit nothing but contempt they pretend to hear things that were never said and to see things that probably were never done and then they fasten their fictions upon you and upon henry and perhaps upon every one of us in our turn  what do they fasten upon me may i ask demanded isabella  what i paid little or no attention to when i heard it yet it serves to show how ingenious they are in their idle devices not to let the purest character escape their tongues what wonder then if their scandal is busy with my poor niece  there is a mysteriousness in this story said sir roger and i think all suck should be fairly produced with their authors especially where a ladys name is made use of  i am clearly of that opinion replied claypole and i hold it to be a duty which i owe to you to this amiable young lady and to truth itself not to let any report affecting her enter my ears without giving up both it and the author whom i am the less inclined to screen because she belongs to me for the present and as i am persuaded miss manstock can confute her tale i shall instantly proceed to punish her by a dismission from my service and sorry i shall be that my power reaches no farther  this is perfectly candid in you said sir roger and what i should expect from your friendship but without more delay let us hear the story i will venture to say my daughter has no objection to hearing it  none in life replied she if mr claypole has none to the relation of it but indeed he has now gone too far to suppress it  it is soon told madam said claypole and i doubt not as soon confuted but my foolish old woman at the vicarage pretends to say that calling upon the widow may whilst you and mr fitzhenry were together she was prevented from entering the room where you were with so much appearance of alarm on the part of the good woman who guarded the door that suspecting there was a secret and naturally curious as such silly old gossips are apt to be she took her opportunity of peeping in at the window and discovered you in an attitude impossible upon the face of it for the impudent hussy says she saw him with his arm round your waist and your head reclining upon his shoulder  how is that cried sir roger with vehemence starting at the same moment on his legs does the infamous trollop say that i will have her taken up and committed to the house of correction  no sir said isabella sinking as i was under my alarm at the bloody spectacle i had been surveying i can still recollect too much of my situation at that moment not to remember that there was a person came up to the window whilst henry was supporting me and if this is the person she says no more than the truth which mr claypole has very faithfully reported with what intent he best knows but justice compels me to say that correction is not due to the woman there was an air of so much conscious innocence in isabellas ready explanation and confession that claypole instantly perceived he had missed his aim in her particular at least but in sir roger he had lodged his shaft a strict observer of decorum in all its antiquated rigor he only looked to consequences not to cause it was enough for him to know his daughter had submitted to the embrace of this young man and that she had been a spectacle for vulgar eyes in that degrading situation it struck him with a painful recollection that she had suppressed this circumstance in the account she had given him at first and turning a severe look to his daughter he said isabella you never see that young man again whilst you live at least within my doors never you have deceived me child for the first time you have concealed from me a fact whilst you made me believe you had ingenuously related the whole of what passed between you you have been discovered in a situation unfit for you to be seen in by a peasant in the parish who having gratified her own curiosity will not spare to gratify the curiosity of others and the tale will be circulated through the neighborhood to your shame and to mine  to this our heroine instantly replied as follows  when i assure my father that such was the state of my nerves at the time i was discovered in the situation mr claypole has been describing that i must have sunk upon the floor had not henry prevented it i flatter myself i shall not be thought guilty of any great offense against propriety in accepting of his support neither perhaps can he be justly condemned for giving it i hope i have not hitherto been found so disingenuous as not to deserve credit for what i assert nor so flippant as to be thought capable of throwing myself voluntarily into any mans arms the sight of a deep and terrible wound streaming with blood upon the floor and the assistance that humanity compelled me to give in stanching the wound was a scene so new and alarming to me that my spirits could not stand against it i confess to you i suppressed this circumstance in my discourse with you but i had motives for so doing which did not spring from any consciousness of guilt or dread of explanation on my own part my silence had respect to others not to myself and the same motives that led me to stop ezekiel daw just now from speaking on this subject operated with me and will operate for avoiding as far as it is in my power any mention of that affair she then turned to mr claypole and in a calm unembarrassed accent said you will now perceive that your foolish old woman as you call her has done nothing to incur your displeasure or to merit the punishment you threaten her with she had only the curiosity to peep in at a window and seems to have related to you very faithfully what she discovered which you sir as faithfully have related to my father this no doubt you did in the pure spirit of friendship to my father and i have only to say for his sake that i hope this will be the last proof of your friendship accompanied with pain to him and that every subsequent one will communicate nothing but pleasure you have however told him something which i had not told him and so far i am made to appear evasive and disingenuous but i have given you the clue to my exculpation and if you have a mind to pursue it you will be led to the clear understanding of my motives i am willing to interpret the part you have taken as meant for my good and indeed if i have been guilty of thinking more favorably of this mysterious young man than you conceive i ought to think your measures have been so far crowned with success that you have had the satisfaction to hear my father declare that i am never again to see that person whilst i live at least within his doors to this i answer i have never yet disobeyed my fathers commands nor ever will let him therefore repeat that solemn denunciation again and here i am ready as solemnly to pledge myself to the observance of it let it cost me what it will i desire to live but to please him and only whilst i please him and though i dont wish to hold back the very high opinion i entertain of this proscribed young man or if you please to give it any other name that purity may acknowledge i will confess to that yet i now declare i will never hereafter hold correspondence direct or indirect with him unless it shall be with the privity and consent nay even by the requisition and desire of my father himself this sir i presume will satisfy you if you are sincerely bent to oppose my attachment and if my dear father is truly desirous to interdict it he will i dare say confide in what i have promised  chapter ix a tempting offer honorably withstood to this defense claypole made no reply neither did sir roger seem in haste to speak for the gust of anger which artifice had raised innocence and truth had now dispelled he turned his eyes upon the accuser first and then upon his daughter each look was decisive to the party it was addressed to neither of them stood in need of any further explanation of the opinion he entertained at last turning to claypole he said i think sir it had been better for us both if you had not listened to this eavesdropper for it appears to me that you have gathered nothing from her information but what my isabella has very naturally accounted for  it is very well replied claypole i know the consequences of overzealous friendship and none can accrue to me which i am not prepared for with these words he left the room  he is very angry said sir roger but his disappointments vex him rebuffd by lady crowbery rebuffd by henry and tormented with his niece his vexations have followed close upon one another we must make allowances for mens tempers and claypoles is not the most patient therefore let it pass well say no more of him and now my child a word or two with you upon what is nearest to my heart  your happiness and a right understanding betwixt us it is clear to me isabella that you are attached to this young unknown that is a very serious thing truly for who is he and what is he if you can answer to these points explain to me satisfy me i am not greedy of wealth i am not ambitious of titles for you but the character and condition of a gentleman is an indispensible requisite in the person of my son inlaw i cannot away with obscurity or meanness therefore if you know any thing of henry tell it to me it is your own concern and if a secret i will not reveal it  i am sure you would not replied she and was a secret imparted to me under strict injunctions to keep it inviolable i am no less sure you would hold me base should i reveal it i hope therefore you will not regard it as a breach of duty if i decline an answer to your question  hold there replied the father i am apt to think it is a part of your duty to take no secrets into your trust in which i am not to share especially when they are committed to you by a young man like henry  but if i have it not from him said she the case does not apply  no matter rejoined he it is of him it relates to him and that is reason enough why i should know it in one word isabella give me up the matter of your information without the author of it and if it appears to my satisfaction that this young man is by birth a gentleman and such as i can with propriety adopt into my family i pass my word to you that i will no longer oppose myself to your inclinations for his character and manners please me and i can well believe his person not less engaging but if you will not confide to me what you know of this young man i shall take for granted it is not fit to be known and in that persuasion exert the authority of a father for laying my injunctions upon you never to let me see his face or hear his name again neither shall i forgive you if i discover that you carry on any correspondence with him or about him this isabella is your alternative now take your choice and the consequences of your choice  a stronger temptation than was now offered to isabella could hardly present itself but her steady nature rejected it without scruple and by persisting in her good faith to lady crowbery she incurred to her infinite regret the displeasure of her father most tenderly beloved the conference therefore concluded in anger on his part and in a solemn promise on here is to hold no correspondence with henry nor even through her cousin lady crowbery about him in future time it is true might probably develope the mystery which her honor would not suffer her to do and to that alone she trusted for a justification of her silence both toward her father and her lover  the rev mr claypole meanwhile betook himself in sullen discontent to his chamber there to meditate upon future measures in the interim a letter was delivered to him which had come by special messenger from crowbery castle the contents of which were as follow   my dear uncle in consequence of a most polite invitation from the worthy lord of this castle i have been prevailed upon to take up my abode here for a few days the chief inducement with me for accepting this solicitation was the opportunity it affords me of being within reach of my dear uncle without the pain of taking up my residence in the same place with a family from whom i have received the most unhandsome treatment nothing can exceed the kindness and attention of lord crowbery and i am charged by him in the most earnest manner to request the favor of your company at the castle i am sure you will not regret the change from manstock house and if i have any interest with you his request will be complied with the rather as i find myself in lady crowberys absence in a situation to stand in need of your cover and protection being at present the only female visitor in the house  i am ever yours frances claypole   nothing could be more acceptable to mr claypole in his present state of mind than the invitation which this letter conveyed it relieved him from a situation of which he was heartily sick and offered him the gratification of putting a slight upon lady crowbery of the most pointed sort he well knew how it would be felt by sir roger manstock and on that very account he embraced it the more readily for there was no longer any trace of past favors in his memory and of favors to come all expectation was at an end he had however views upon futurity in lord crowberys particular for he had seen enough of lady crowbery to set her down in his account as a dead woman and his niece fanny was a very lively one he had more than once taken her with him to the castle in times when better harmony subsisted between the families and on those visits fanny had made her way much better with the lord than with the lady of the house with the latter of whom to say the truth she was in no great favor the fact was that lady crowbery regarded her character with contempt and fanny imputed it to jealousy to rouse this passion was a gratification too agreeable to be resisted and therefore though his lordship was nothing less than an adonis there was amusement at least in the experiment and she considered it as no small triumph to engage the attention of a man who was capable of neglecting a most lovely woman and devoting himself to her her purpose in hastening from the vicarage in the manner we have related was with the view of obtaining one more interview with henry or at least of gaining such intelligence as might satisfy her as to the consequences of his wound she therefore boldly shaped her course toward the port he was to embark at but in passing through the village of crowbery luckily fell in with the noble proprietor who was cheering his spirits with a morning ride in his ladys absence and after some importunity prevailed upon her to stop short in her progress and repose herself in the castle here she remained some time till propriety or something else dictated to her the expedient of writing to her uncle in manner above related to which his lordship with equal propriety very courteously acceded  sir roger manstock who perceived that his daughter was in possession of a secret that he could not extort from her concluded very naturally that it came from lady crowbery and this brought to his recollection what she had said to him upon their parting relative to the paper she had enclosed under the same cover with her will to be opened after her death this packet he had deposited in his strong box it was under four seals and evidently enveloped more papers than one he had no doubt from isabellas answers that the secret she had in charge from lady crowbery related to henrys birth and that it would be discovered upon the opening of this packet he could not reconcile to himself the being excluded from a confidence which had been reposed in his daughter and was not a little discontented to find that his niece had referred him to her death for a discovery that she had already made to isabella  he now summoned isabella to him and holding lady crowberys packet in his hand addressed himself to her as follows  i am here encharged with a paper sealed as you see containing your cousins will and other private matters which are only to be opened by me upon the event of her death i have no doubt but it incloses a discovery of that very secret which she has already imparted to you and that it refers to the mystery of this young mans birth who has caused so much unhappiness to me and my family i understand withal that i am to be the executor of this will and most probably of certain instructions and trusts relative to the gentleman who is then for the first time to be made known to me now these are terms that i will not agree to i am no dealer in obscure matters and it is therefore become my fixed resolution peremptorily to decline the commission and so to inform lady crowbery by special express unless you are prepared to tell me what it is you know of these secret contents so far as they relate to the person called henry fitzhenry for i do not hold it becoming me in any respect to be surprised into a trust that may involve me with a person whom at present i have every reason to hold at distance and for whom perhaps i may never choose to be concerned even in the most trifling degree now then isabella let me ask you if what i have been saying seems reasonable and whether you rightly comprehend it to this she replied in the affirmative upon which he thus proceeded  if it is reasonable then that i should not be blindly committed in a business i am ignorant of and if you are interested to retain these papers in my hands rather than to have them sent back to her from whom they came you have the alternative at your choice tell me what you know of them or take the consequences and abide by the promise you have made me never let me hear the name of henry fitzhenry from your lips any more  if that be the alternative replied the lovely isabella whilst the tears started in her eyes necessity imposes the hard task upon me of abiding by the painful consequences you have stated can i violate my promise ought not every trust to be held sacred this is of all most sacred and i dare not betray it let me then for the last time in your hearing declare that wherever this discarded person whose name i will not utter in your ears shall betake himself he carries with him to the end of life my prayers my blessings my unalienable affections and my heart for ever but let not this ingenuous confession of my love shake your confidence in my honor for upon my knees i take to witness truth and heaven itself that i will faithfully perform the promise i have made you and renouncing him devote myself to your commands and to my duty  chapter x where is the daughter that may not take a lesson from our heroine the definitive answer which our last chapter concludes with put a period to any further conference between the respective parties and determined sir roger manstock to take the very measure he had threatened to pursue he immediately wrote a letter to his niece explanatory of his sensations with respect to henry and beseeching her to excuse him from any trust that had relation to a person who had caused him such uneasiness and whom he was determined never to be connected with he also informed her of the promise made to him by his daughter and prayed her to send down a trusty person properly authorized into whose hands he might safely render back the packet she had entrusted to him he then concluded in the most conciliating terms that his tenderness could suggest wishing her a return of health and assuring her of his unalterable affection  a servant was ordered to set off express with this letter who had directions where to find the lady in town if he did not overtake her on the road of which however there was the greatest probability as her daily stages were very short  in the mean time our amiable heroine did not like some others dedicate every hour to sullen silence and continual melancholy for though her private moments were sad enough she had yet a smile for her father when they met and the same eyes that showered tears in secret reassumed their native cheerful luster when her parent was in sight  not so the reverend mr claypole there was something in his breast resembling those goads and stings which disappointed malice or ambition sometimes entertain themselves with in secret in the way of penance for attempts which conscience does not quite approve of he was indeed superior to that tergiversation and incertitude of purpose which consciences over nice sometimes impose upon resolutions not over strong for he was firmly resolved to turn his back upon his old friend and his face toward his new one but he could not quite persuade himself that such a resolve had all the qualities of a virtuous purpose for he could not but feel that he ought to be grateful to the one and suspicious of the other he had motives however and principles of action in his mind which some soft souls in the world seem to know nothing of amongst these the gratification that his visit to lord crowbery would administer to his mind as an insult to the patroness of ratcliffes living was to him very pleasing on reflection that his visit would be highly offensive to sir roger and cut off his return for ever after to the house of manstock he clearly saw but there was no loss could accrue from an exclusion where he never wished more to be admitted in fact he saw how totally he was ruined in this family and having no doubt that his niece had dealt the stab to henry he was not sorry to avail himself of the protection of lord crowbery and the countenance which his reception of her would give to her story in opposition to all others but what above all weighed with him for accepting the invitation was the hope it held out to his ambition upon the event of lady crowberys death if his niece would consent to govern herself by his advice  reasoning in this manner he prepared for his departure from the house of his friend and this he did so secretly and expeditiously that he stole his march unknown to sir roger leaving only the few following lines as his apology and adieu   mr claypole leaves his respectful compliments to sir roger manstock with thanks for all favors the duty which he owes to a muchinjurd orphan niece compels him to so hasty a departure that time conspiring with his own feelings prevents him from taking leave in person of a friend whom he has so long and justly held in honor an order was now dispatched from sir roger directing dame may to come to him at the great house this was instantly obeyed by the good woman who was given to understand in a few words that her longer residence in the house which isabella had provided for her would be very readily dispensed with to this she immediately answered that she would without delay prepare for her removal having received an invitation from her daughter who by the blessing of providence was now in a condition to support her she therefore begged leave to return her humble thanks for the favors she had received and would no longer be a burden to his charity she would be gone that very night if sir roger wished it and leave the few things she had in the house to follow her the next day to this the baronet shortly answered that it was very well and there the business would have closed but that it occurred to him as she was leaving the room to put a question to her for curiositys sake respecting fanny claypole which was simply this  if she understood or believed that the stab in henrys arm was given by her hand purposely and revengefully the poor woman was staggered with the abruptness of the question and the stern manner in which it was put she hesitated through fear and confusion upon which in an angry tone sir roger told her he had no wish to hear her answer for he should put little faith in what anybody said who was not always ready with a plain reply to a plain question and with this rebuke waved his hand and dismissed her  in relating this short scene as it passed we are sensible that we must represent the character of the worthy baronet in a harsher light than it has hitherto been seen but in extenuation we have to say that he had impressions on his mind not favorable to this poor woman and was also disturbed in temper at the present moment by the valedictory note of his seceding friend mr claypole just before delivered into his hands under the same impression he was meditating to give orders for dismantling the cottage of its furniture when isabella entered the room upon which he thought proper to apprize her of his design qualifying it with some introductory observations upon the jealousy which such favors created in the parish and the unsuitable elegance with which she had fitted the apartment with your leave therefore added he i shall give orders to have the furniture removed and the cottage reduced to a condition better fitted to the poverty of the next inhabitants whom charity may recommend to it isabella bowed her head in token of obedience but felt the unkindness of this order in the most poignant manner she recollected that she had been allowed to consider this little tenement as her own and to carry on her works both within doors and without after her own simple but elegant fancy the resumption of a fond gift and the reversal of all her little amusing operations by a decree so peremptory and unexpected struck deep into her heart yet she commanded herself so far when asked if she had any further use for the furniture as to make answer with great mildness and submission that there was nothing there she particularly wished to preserve but a certain print which she had hung up in the parlour as a memorial of the donor and the similitude of a face which had ever been accustomed to look upon her with the tenderest affection pooh pooh replied sir roger you have copies enough of that unhappy countenance and i would advise you to put this out of the way as speedily as you can lest it should sometime or other tell tales of what it has been a spectator of  i am answered sir replied isabella and with a reproach which if i am capable of deserving from you i must be unfit any longer to remain in your presence  so saying she hid her face in her handkerchief and hastened out of the room to give vent to her agony  chapter xi a pious mind resorts to providence for its support few moments had passed after isabella left her father before he felt as much pain from the asperity of the retort he had given as she had experienced in receiving it nature could not be long expelled from his heart nor could ill humor take any lasting possession of it he wished he had not said it he felt the cruelty the injustice of wreaking vengeance on the harmless works of her fancy and perhaps he would at this moment have not been sorry could he have recalled the messenger he had dispatched to lady crowbery those sensations of regret which a good mind is capable of sir roger felt but to confess and atone is the effort of a great mind as well as good and that was not bestowed by nature upon him men who affect the reputation of a decided character are too apt to mistake obstinacy in error for consistency of opinion and this was sir rogers misfortune few things could have galled him more than claypoles conduct yet his whole life did not furnish so great an instance of weakness as his pertinacious attachment to that unworthy friend no hypocrisy is sooner discovered than the pretended generosity of a selfinterested man and opportunities enough had offered themselves to sir roger manstock for developing the real character of claypole but the stronger the light was that struck upon him so much the closer he shut his eyes against it the veil was now drawn off at once and prejudice could no longer save him from the conviction of his own mistake this vexatious discovery was just rankling in his mind when innocence unfortunately falling in his way was made to suffer as too often happens for the guilty who had escaped his resentment  the next morning brought over susan may to manstock house who was admitted to her lovely mistress to pay her last duty and take leave on this occasion she was led into a diffusive recital of all particulars respecting henrys late generous proceeding to which isabella lent a willing ear as the one recounted the noble acts of her benefactor the heart of the other glowed with delight his virtues his sufferings his magnanimity his selfdenials were enumerated and acknowledged when the subject of his mental perfections was exhausted his person his graceful form the beauty of his countenance became the topic of their praise and on this subject susans eloquence seemed animated into warmer phrase and diction than on the former whilst this was going on isabellas blushes witnessed to the sensibility of soul which this recital inspired at last no longer able to refrain from joining in the praise of one so dear to her she said i perfectly agree with you in every thing you have said or can say in commendation of your amiable benefactor i do not think it is in nature for any human being to be more noble in mind more charming in person and i feel no shame in confessing to you what i have avowed to my father that in purity of soul i love him but alas alas i have difficulties to encounter objections to overcome and sorrows to endure that will probably make that a condition of necessity which you may remember was once my choice and devote me to a single life  heaven in its mercy forbid cried susan that so much beauty and love should be left to pine away in solitariness and disappointment fathers must have hearts of marble that can so control and thwart the virtuous affections of their children  hold cried isabella you must not talk in that style susan if you have any value for my friendship my father must always be spoken of with respect in my hearing we will therefore change the subject to what we cannot differ about and you will tell me what you think of henrys wound did he tell you how he came by it to this susan replied that he had been very reserved upon the subject but for her own part she was certain it had been given him by that desperate creature fanny claypole in the rage of disappointment which indeed added she her own confession puts out of doubt for my mother told me in secrecy that when she attended her in her fits and ravings that and many other things came out which are almost too bad to relate  i dont wish to hear them replied isabella for things of that sort are perfectly disgusting to me and i dare say if any thing improper passed she herself was in the fault of it  so much i will venture to inform you of said susan that she was not in the fault that it did not pass but the truth of the fact is that the rage of the lady was roused by the virtue of the man and the stab was given him in the fury of revenge and disappointment  that i can well believe replied the blushing fair and i own to you i am glad at my heart that henry did not demean himself by stooping to her arts but i wonder what is become of her to this susan answered that she was now with the lord of crowbery castle where she was treated with great attention and where she did not doubt but she was playing a very deep and cunning game and the rather as she understood that her reverend uncle had made one of the party and was now upon a visit at the castle  so soon after the departure of my cousin cried isabella sighing that is indeed extraordinary on his part i understood he had left us but i did not guess he was gone thither of all places i am sure my father must have felt that affront very severely  i hope it will open his eyes replied susan for all the neighbors cry out upon mr claypole already isabella made some slight observation upon this and here the conference ended  isabella now alone resigned herself to meditation and after a few minutes so employed broke out into the following soliloquy  oh henry mysterious son of an unhappy mother little does my father think how nearly thou art allied to him and though i am now interdicted from all communication with thee i will still nourish one spark of hope that thy affection may prevail against appearances and thou persist to love me till time shall develope the secret which honor now forbids me to divulge in spite of all temptations may providence protect thee in all dangers and by restoring thy beloved parent to health crown thy filial undertaking with a happy event meanwhile though i will pray for thee in secret i must remember the promise i have given to my father and sacredly fulfill it in its strictest sense without prevarication this is my duty but when i reflect what circumstances may occur to shake my constancy and overpower my nature i tremble at the task i have engaged in where then shall i find fortitude in the hour of trial and whither shall i resort but to thee o thou who art the father of all those that faithfully refer themselves to thy protection take then i pray thee into thy most gracious disposal my heart and its purposes too weak without thy strengthening providence too fallible without thy merciful support  end of the eighth book book the ninth chapter i a short interlude between the acts whilst the dramatic author cheers his audience with a tune between the acts i am forced to fill up my intervals with a treatise and what is still worse with a treatise of my own making which is not quite the case with his tune his spectators are regaled with harmony in a brilliant theater amidst a blaze of lights my reader in his solitary chair sits moping over the dull strain of an uninteresting dissertation which probably has little other merit but of putting him to sleep what inspires his critics with good humor only stupifies mine  but if these are his advantages in the periods of suspension many more and much greater are they when he returns to the stage and i to my history the actor before the curtain and the scenist behind it conspire to lift him into fame almost without any effort of his own he is upheld by the charms of spectacle i am loaded with the drudgery of detail he has castles in the clouds that drop down at the word of command we are forced to labor late and early till our brains are well nigh beaten into brick and mortar with the slavery of building them a nimble scenepainter will dash off a cataract in full froth and foam that will cost us twenty pages of hard pumping before we can get a single drop to flow how many pens do we split in conjuring up a storm of thunder and lightning whilst he by one mark in the margin of his manuscript sets all the elements in a roar we find it a very troublesome job to furnish horses and carriages for the conveyance of our company his characters are wafted from scene to scene by a whistle when his heroine is in a crisis some one cries  hah she faints  and the inimitable siddons dies away another cries  hah she revives  the inimitable siddons is alive again we cannot do this without salts and hartshorn at the least and in an obstinate sit hardly with the help of burnt feathers an unsavory experiment he is never driven to  let us put the case that the author of a novel shall lay his scene in the house of some abandoned strumpet where a set of cutthroats resort for the plotting of some murderous conspiracy and let the hero of his story for whom our pity is to be interested enlist himself in this gang and let him introduce a virtuous wife the darling of his heart and the faithful partner of his bed into this house of illfame and assembly of villains there to be left in the hands of these miscreants as a hostage for his good faith telling her withal that he is sworn to assassinate her father that very night who but would cry out against the conduct of such a fable but let otways fascinating muse put this into melodious meter let the bell toll for execution bring forth the rack send the actress on the stage with hair dishevelled cheeks of chalk and eyes wildly staring  no matter why so mad at once nor what she talks of be it of seas of milk or ships of amber  all hearts bow down to her resistless energy she takes her poet on her wings and soars to fame  wonderful in all ages and honored by all enlightened nations has been the actors magic art the theaters and forums of greece were embellished with his statues they gazed upon him like a descended god their greatest poets down to aeschylus and aristophanes trod the stage in person rome also honored her actors and they in return were the grace and ornament of all societies their sayings were recorded and collections of their apothegms have come down to our times caesar in all his power made suite to them and even knights of rome did not revolt from the profession it remained for modern times to complete their triumphs by admitting female candidates into the lists from that moment nature took possession of her rights the finest feelings were consigned to the fairest forms the very muse herself appeared in her own sex and person beauty that gives being to the poets rapturous vision a voice that guides his language to the heart smiles that enchant tears that dissolve us with looks that fascinate and dying plaintive tones that sink into the soul are now the appropriate and exclusive attributes of that allconquering sex in short they bind our nobles in chains and our princes in links  of love  chapter ii an adventure on board a frigate we now return to our hero who with fair weather and favoring gales was far advanced upon his voyage a few and but slight sensations of uneasiness had attended his initiation on shipboard carys gay and gallant spirit cheered him at all moments the novelty of the scene the succession of adventures which occurred to him in passing through the channel and the striking characters of british seamen for ever in his view were to a mind like his most interesting contemplations the cleanliness good order and discipline of carys frigate were exemplary and as she had cleared the channel and was upon the sharp lookout for an enemy expectation kept every body alert and in a state of warlike preparation  tom weevil was a lively thoughtless fellow and had passed through all the discipline of being seized up to the shrouds and every other species of seajokes practiced upon fresh water novices with perfect good humor he had made acquaintance with several gentlemen of easy address particularly in the foretop with the captain of which jack jones by name he had established a sworn friendship and as tom was very fond of taking the air on that elevated station where jack presided he was mostly to be found in the aforesaid top where in leisure hours he edified his company with reading a gift which he alone possessed the illustrious history of robinson crusoe to which all ears were open and universal faith from all parties subscribed without reserve happy would it be for congregations in general were they so attentive to their preacher as toms audience were to him they were also able commentators upon many parts of the work but as they did not always concur in the same explanations and remarks the progress of the history was liable to considerable interruptions and chasms whilst the interlocutory parts were filled up with oaths and lies given and taken very liberally in the true spirit of controversy  mr william williams the surgeon or in the sea phrase the doctor had so ably conducted the cure of henrys wound by adding nothing to natures operations but cleanliness and fresh lint that his arm was come to its perfect use and it may be presumed his spirit was not unwilling to try its strength upon the enemies of his country if they came in his way it was now early morning and that wishedfor opportunity was in near approach henry was on deck enjoying that most magnificent of all spectacles the sun rising over the waters a rayless globe of fire his heart expanded at the sight and his thoughts ascended toward the creator of those wonders he contemplated captain carry was at present under easy sail and the weather fine when the man at the masthead descried a sail ahead instantly the officer on watch informed the captain who leaping out of his cot huddled on his clothes and in little more time than a lion would bestow upon his toilet presented himself on the quarter deck having ordered all hands up and sail to be made a very little time discovered her to be a squarerigged vessel and as she kept her course toward carry with the wind in her favor she was soon visible from the deck where every glass in the ship was directed toward her and every voice pronounced her to be a frigate of equal or superior force to their own and upon a nearer view from certain marks which experienced seamen are quick in discerning she was adjudged without one dissenting voice to be an enemy and an enemy it should seem that did not decline an action  now began that aweful arrangement in which silence still as death prevailed and every thing moved at the word of one man whose voice and none other was heard and to whose command absolute obedience followed on the instant henry surveyed the whole with silent awe and reverence for a service so conducted his heart glowed with love and pride for his friend whom situation seemed now to have transformed into a new creature that countenance which hitherto he had only seen charactered with the mirthful smile of raillery and frolic was now terrible and frowning as he bent his eye upon the enemy in the same act of preparation with himself he was a perfect hero arming for battle courage tempered with deliberate circumspection marked every word he said which were distinctly and precisely given out in orders to every officer in the ship the lieutenants repaired to their quarters the men assembled in the tops and honest weevil was honored with a post at one of the cabinguns in company with eight other brave fellows carry having hoisted his colors addressed himself to his men in a short but animating speech that in language suited to their habits and apprehensions gave them to understand that whilst he had breath in his body those colors were never to come down that the advantage of the few guns the enemy had over them was to be compensated by superior skill and courage and he was resolved that republican frigate should either follow him into a british port or sink alongside of him this was followed by three cheers when turning to henry he said now my brave henry if you like the sport we will give you a taste of it this fellow seems to have some stomach for fighting but no great management in bringing it to bear i see he means to fight us on the starboard side and has armed himself accordingly but i shall baulk his fancy and take him where he is not prepared this said he gave the word helmaweather and by a rapid maneuver well executed brought his frigate on the other side pouring in a raking fire as he sheered across him this maneuver produced much confusion and some loss to the enemy who are in the practice of arming only on one side the position carry had taken and the rapidity of his fire had great effect as the action was close when the enemy had recovered from his surprise his behavior was perfectly gallant and by something giving way on board the british frigate she became unmanageable and fell broadside to upon the frenchman part of the crew being occupied in repairing this accident the enemy seized the opportunity for boarding being full of men henry now felt his spirit called upon in a manner not to be resisted a confused and scrambling fight took place upon the gangway where the french had lodged themselves in some numbers under conduct of a spirited officer whom henry immediately singled out as his man he flew to the scene of action sword in hand shouting to the people as he advanced and at the very first stroke brought down the leader of the boarding crew who fell dead into the waste animated by his example the defendants became invincible and repulse and slaughter ensued the few that escaped back to their ship were instantly followed by the victorious party henry being one of the first if not the very first that leapt on board the national frigate there was no leader like him to rally the fugitives in the first fury of the onset the carnage was indiscriminate till a general cry for quarter recalled that mercy which is never long absent from the hearts of our countrymen and stopped the hand of death the colors were hauled down and three cheers from the conquerors gave notice to their gallant captain and comrades alongside of them that they were in possession of their prize a crowd gathered round henry who like achilles bathed in the blood of hector stood in the midst of them tremendously beautiful he had thrown off his coat before he entered into action his hat had been beaten off and his hair medusa like fell in wild disorder on his forehead his eyes seemed on fire the frown yet dwelt upon his brow and the angry spot of crimson hue still burnt upon his cheek a confusion of voices now arose all applauding their young volunteer with many huggings and squeezings and slappings on the back garnished with oaths of the most unaccountable variety which through an excess of good will blasted every limb in the company and sent our hero himself to the devil by a thousand different conveyances amongst these vociferous admirers his eye singled out a figure in the outward row whom he discovered to be his friend tom weevil in spite of a small alteration in his countenance occasioned by the removal of one ear and part of a cheek out of their place and dangling upon his shoulder by the help of certain fibers which still restrained them from total separation henry flew to his wounded friend compressed the fleshy fragments into their place as well as he could and taking off his neckcloth bound them up and hurried him away to doctor williams whom he found in the cockpit stripped to his shirt with his sleeves rolled up to his shoulders and bathed in a mingled stream of blood and sweat when you can turn your hand cried henry to a brave lad who wants a little of your art i shall be obliged to you a foretop man one of weevils audience was then under williamss hands who seemed in a most hopeless case it is all up with me cried the dying sailor death has stopped my grog for everlasting therefore do you see doctor never break your head about me but turn your hand to the lad splice his chops and send him going the heroism of this expiring warrior the scene of human misery which the cockpit presented and the gory figure of williams himself were too much for the unhardened nerves of henry  the tears started from his eyes the dying man was still anxious for the glory of his country and demanded to know what had been the event of the fight when henry had informed him of this life seemed to reinspire his halfclosed eyes a gleam of joy fleeted over his distorted visage oh that i could have one peep at the prize he exclaimed before my daylights are out  so thou shall exclaimed jack jones who was standing over him if the brave volunteer will condescend to bear a hand  if i was an admiral replied our hero i should be honored by the office and having so said taking up one end of the hammock on which the dying man was stretched and jones taking the other they carried him up the ladder and placed him where with the prize in his view he breathed out his gallant spirit in the arms of victory  chapter iii our hero makes an interesting discovery when our hero had performed the last offices to the dying sailor he went upon the quarter deck where captain carry was busily occupied in giving orders upon various matters the first moment he could detach himself from business he ran to henry and throwing his arms about him overwhelmed him with applauses great was their mutual joy to find that neither had received the slightest hurt but what a change did it appear to henry as he cast his eyes about the frigate late in such beautiful and perfect trim now exhibiting nothing but a penthouse of dangling rags and mangled rigging overhead and below a chaos of broken booms shattered boats and decks floated with water black as styx with the scattering of the powder when carry had devoted a few moments to his gallant friend he called the first lieutenant to him and shaking him cordially by the hand gave him joy of his prize go my brave fellow he cried and take possession of that noble frigate which your valor and good conduct has contributed to conquer and you volunteer added he addressing himself to henry go with your officer and board her for the second time but here pointing to his coat that laid under the barricade slip on your clothes and get a hat he then gave directions for shifting the prisoners and that proper care should be had of the wounded men by superintending the treatment they received from their own surgeons and now began the carpenters and boatswains reports with a long train of various duties that fall to the share of every one in carys situation and which none were better qualified to execute than he was  when the first lieutenant accompanied by our hero came on board the prize he found the crew and passengers of a lisbon packet which she had captured in her cruize and of these he bade henry take charge whilst he gave attention to more pressing matters henry now acting under orders immediately began to exert his delegated authority by assembling his countrymen from all parts of the vessel for the joyful purpose of restoring them to their liberty when he was about to embark them in the boat that waited to receive them under the command of lord frederick our young midshipman heretofore described one of the company informed him there was a sick gentleman in his hammock below whose state of health required instant attention to this person henry immediately went with one of the party for a guide who brought him to the cabletier where the sick gentleman was lying in his hammock attended by two servants when our hero had imparted to him the cheering purpose of his visit and recommended a speedy removal on board the british frigate where he would be better accommodated he answered in a faint tone that it would be a most welcome release he had been tortured with noise and clamor and at the same time nearly suffocated with heat and stench but surely added he i have heard that voice before though i cannot discern your countenance in this dark place is it possible sir that you and i can have met at crowbery a short explanation now took place which to henrys great and joyful surprise convinced him that providence had directed him to the rescue of his father difficult though it was to suppress his emotion on such a discovery yet he had command enough over himself to check his tongue and immediately began his operations for removing him from his loathsome abode all which he planned and executed with the tenderest care and attention the refreshing sensation of air and motion revived the spirits of the redeemed prisoner he was lifted into the boat in his bedding henrys eye watched every movement that could annoy him henrys arm supported him through every moment of the passage and his care superintended the operation of getting him on board where he instantly assigned him his own cot and recommended him in the strongest terms to his friend williams  so reformed was the appearance of carys frigate that it appeared to henry as the work of magic but what cannot british seamen well commanded perform she was now once more in sailing trim her decks washed and her lumber stowed away henry delivered up his redeemed prisoners with a list of their names to the captain and having executed these instructions demanded if there were any further commands for him nothing at present but to refresh yourself in the cabin replied carry where you will find cold meat and wine and some of the national officers at work upon it thither our exhausted hero eagerly repaired and as he was mixing with the prisoners he heard one of them relating a circumstance of an english deserter who being mutinous at his gun in the time of action and refusing to serve it against his countrymen had been run through the back by one of the officers on the spot this was told in french which henry had enough of the language to understand and in the same language made shift to enquire the name of the renegado this the frenchman did not know but he learnt enough of his station and description in the ship to guide him in the enquiries which his humanity toward a fellow creature under such circumstances inspired him to make he therefore snatched a hasty morsel took a refreshing draught of wine and jumped into the boat that was just then going off to the prize here he soon traced his enquiries to the wretched object he was in search of and in whom there appeared so much to pity and condemn he found him stretched at his length upon the bare deck beside the gun he had been posted at incapable of raising himself up floated with his own blood and at the point of death judge reader what was henrys sensation when in this expiring wretch he recognized the features of his acquaintance bowsey ah miserable man he cried is this your fate at last do you not know me speak to me if you have strength to utter look on me if you can lift your eyes and i will yet give you the last comfort of knowing that your victim thomas weevil survives the blow you dealt him  good lord good lord murmured the expiring man weevil is alive then i am no murderer i know you mr henry you are a good man i wish i had taken your good counsel then i had never been in these damned fellows hands i am dying i am dying i would not fight against my country though bad enough in all reason i was not such a shabby rascal as that came to so a scoundrel thrust his sword into my back the devil reward him for it and here i have lain ever since henry saw the agonies of death upon him he grew convulsed at times then brought out a few words and seemed struggling to reach out his hand which henry no sooner perceived than stooping down he took him by the hand saying farewell the lord have mercy upon you and forgive you this was understood by bowsey who deeply groaning muttered something of which henry could make out no more than sleep sleep  they say it is all sleep  they are liars and blasphemers exclaimed henry and was proceeding when he perceived the senses he addressed were closed the last breath was spent and the soul had taken flight to those unknown regions where all who credit or inculcate these impious doctrines will be destined to experience a terrible confutation of their eternal sleep  chapter iv first love strikes deep when captain carry had taken into consideration the state of his prize a large forty gun frigate the number of his prisoners and various other circumstances which made a separation unadviseable he determined to avail himself of a fair wind and his proximity to the coast for convoying her into the first english port he could make though his own destination was for the tagus he therefore made known this his resolution to his officers in each ship and steered for the channel the wind continued to serve and he pushed into falmouth as the first port that was favorable to his purpose  here henry landed with his father who still concealed himself under the name of smith the ships took the first occasion for proceeding to plymouth where they could receive the necessary repair whilst henry staid with his two convalescents at falmouth for tom weevils wound was now by williamss skill far advanced toward a cure the last conversation that henry held with williams was on the evening preceding the departure of the ships when with some difficulty he prevailed upon him to accept a suitable present for his great attention to his own and weevils wounds mr smith so called had rewarded him in a more magnificent style according to the customs of the east in this conversation williams whose modesty had seldom permitted him to speak of himself and his own adventures was enticed into a more circumstantial detail of past occurrences which it imports not this history to record in any other period than that in which he was employed as an assistant to our acquaintance zachary cawdle at crowbery where the youthful charms of susan may then in their first blossom made sad havoc with williamss susceptible heart it did not appear even from his own modest account that susan was altogether inexorable for williams was a very handsome fellow with a thousand good qualities and over all one of the sweetest tempers man ever possessed but there were rubs innumerable which fortune perversely threw in the way of his passion that williams had not skill or confidence to struggle with the chief of these had root in jemimas jealousy and spite some sprung from honest zachary himself who thought love no great recommendation in a compounder of medicines and others were thrown in his way by the collusion of blachford with dame jemima the bright eyes of the damsel having set fire to the bilious particles of the justices blood in no less degree than to the milky ones of williams to extricate himself from this dilemma by deliberate means required more nerves than williams had to spare he therefore took quicker but less regular measures and fairly escaped by flight taking nothing away with him but an aching heart and defrauding his master of no one tittle of his right save only of the pleasure of paying him certain running arrears of wages which williams probably had neither time nor inclination to demand  when williams had concluded his narrative henry resolved first to try the pulse of his affection before he threw the lure of susans fortune in his way and this he rightly conceived to be the most honorable proceeding to both parties he therefore began to discourse with him in such a way as might best discover how far susan still kept any hold upon the heart of her first lover and when this was made clear to him he proceeded to unfold the dark transaction which blachford had been concerned in and the consequences it had produced here williams no longer able to restrain himself broke out into violent denunciations against her betrayer taking heaven to witness that whenever opportunity should serve he would have his revenge upon him for what he had done but this henry soon put a stop to by informing him how completely the offender was now out of his reach it is an exit too good for such a villain cried williams he should have died by the halter or if the law could not have reached him my arm should but though his life is out of my reach his memory is not and i will vindicate the innocent against the guilty by making public the truth and sharing my last shilling in support of my poor girl wherever she can be found and to whatever situation she may be reduced  that is a resolution said henry every way worthy of you and bespeaks a generous soul it also convinces me that you loved her honorably and esteemed her worthy of your love  and she is worthy still rejoined he can i love her less because she has suffered wrong and violence from the blackest wretch that ever breathed no i should be base as he is if i could but i am impatient to know what has been her fate and how she has struggled under misery so complicated this drew out that account which no relater but one of henrys delicacy of sentiment would have reserved for the conclusion of his story and though it may be well believed the facts now recounted were not embellished with any selfencomiums yet the coldest color he could give to truth could not prevent his hearer from receiving it with transports of admiration and gratitude  oh heavens cried williams what a soul is yours and have you risqued a life so precious in a voluntary combat with those madmen god be praised the villains have not drawn one drop of blood from your veins well might we conquer who were headed by an angel  stop cried henry we will talk common sense if you please and treat each other like rational creatures i have been telling you mere matter of fact and as you seem to take a warm share in our friend susans interest so far my story has repaid you for the pains it gave you in some parts by the pleasure you receive in the conclusion of it when your duty permits and your inclination disposes you to make a trip to crowbery you will find your old acquaintance respectably established and if you see her with my eyes and judge of her as i think you must i persuade myself you will find no one charm of person or good quality of heart impaired by what has passed since you lost sight of her and now a thought strikes me mr williams as a hint for you to turn in your mind which is simply this your old friend zachary cawdle is now from home upon a service which i have reason to believe will set him free from business for the rest of his days should this be the case and if you prefer a stationary employ to a roving one like your present it is not improbable but means may be taken for settling you in his business if the spot is agreeable to you and the object worth your thoughts to this williams answered that the situation indeed would be very desirable but he doubted his capacity of obtaining it for he had no money nor was in the way of getting any  then i perceive quoth henry my good friend you have no present thoughts of marrying williams blushed and was silent henry smiled and shaking him by the hand bade him be of good courage telling him that it was probable he should have an opportunity of talking with zachary before long and that he would find means to inform him of the result of their conversation  chapter v our hero quits the sea the next day captain carry took his departure for plymouth carrying his prize with him some time would be necessary for repairing the damages his frigate had received in the action and this determined henry to stay at falmouth not only for the purpose of attending upon his father but in the hope of hearing some tidings of lady crowbery whose arrival might now be looked for from day to day mr smith had taken lodgings in a private house and was recovering his strength apace to him henry repaired after his conversation with williams above related and found a chaise waiting at his door for a morning airing his tender attentions had so won the heart of his unconscious father that he seemed to live only in his company and as this airing was a first effort henry offered to attend upon him in the carriage which was most thankfully accepted the driver was directed to choose the smoothest road and go gently along the sick mans spirits were revived by the air and motion and now for the first time he found strength to converse more at large than as yet he had been able to do  your goodness to me dear sir said he has been such as i can never find words to express my sense of i have hitherto been silent not through want of gratitude but want of powers to give utterance to it yet i have much to say to you some things to explain and others to apologize for in the first place i should tell you that in all our casual rencounters since the first time we met when i pretended to have picked up a ring of lady crowberys i have been imposing myself upon you under a feigned name and character i am the third son now living of the lord pendennis my name henry delapoer a very early attachment to the loveliest of her sex being most unfortunately traversed by her father decided my fate and hurried me to the east indies with a broken heart upon a desperate adventure it was the will of providence i should survive my loss of happiness by turning aside from me in various ways almost miraculous that death which i presumptuously courted as my heart never varied from its first affection i never have had a thought of marrying and though i have been little studious of accumulating money yet circumstances unsought for on my part have thrown a fortune upon me which though not to be compared with many is an affluent one and which is better fairly earned without cruelty or extortion having now disclosed to you who i am i shall next inform you of my purpose in setting out for lisbon in which undertaking i suspect it will be found that we have both the same object namely that of tendering our last melancholy offices to the much injured lady of that execrable tyrant crowbery of your motives my dear sir i know no more than common report has given out and they do credit to your gratitude for i have heard she has been a beneficent and kind friend to you and i cannot doubt but she has acted on the purest principles how it comes to pass that i am so affected by her situation and enraged against her oppressor a single word will explain when i tell you she was all but my wedded wife when her inexorable father overtook us in the last stage of our progress toward gretna green and obstinately severed that knot which a very few hours would have made indissoluble merciful heaven what a heartrending moment was that which tore me from the arms of my cecilia oh sir it was attended with such aggravating horrors figure to yourself the circumstance most killing to the heart of honor and that case was ours what might have been the result of it i can well conceive what it was heaven only knows for i was hurried out of england and remained in ignorance of her fate and now i find her wedded to a brute childless unhappy and alas far gone in a decay if providence shall graciously permit her to survive her voyage lisbon gives me one last chance of meeting her on this side heaven if not the short remnant of days that may be left to me shall be spent in bewailing her loss and if opportunity can be found in avenging her wrongs  here the father ceased exhausted not less by the agitation of his mind than by the exertion of his discourse a short silence took place which henry was too considerate of his repose to interrupt at length perceiving that he expected a reply he spoke as follows  i am greatly honored by the confidence you repose in me and it gives me the highest satisfaction to know that my small services have been useful to you in any degree i was certainly well prepared for the discovery you have been pleased to make for it has long been out of doubt with me that your first assumed condition was not your real one the manners character and deportment of a man of birth and education cannot easily be disguised and yours least of all i am not totally uninformed of lady crowberys early attachment to the honorable captain delapoer my life from infancy to a period not long passed having been spent under the care and tuition of a most intimate friend of here is the reverend mr ratcliffe lately deceased by that excellent man i was received as a deserted nameless infant deposited at his door and recommended to his benevolent protection by my mysterious mother through some secret channel unknown to me the charges of my maintenance were supplied when at his death they stopped at once and i was thrown friendless and helpless on the world at large misfortunes which at some other time i will detail to you fell upon me pressing me down to the extremity of human misery and distress in this state the charity of lady crowbery found me her bounty to me drew the malice of her tyrant into open acts of oppression loading her with calumny most gross and injurious and racking her too sensitive feelings till her tender frame gave way and sunk under the attack it is to me therefore belongs the punishment of that monster for it is i who have been made the plea and apology for his abominable cruelty her death which heaven avert would set my hands at liberty and as i have an auspicious impression on my mind that time will shortly reveal the present mystery of my birth i may then be in possession of a name cowardice cannot shrink from and when his pride can no longer shelter itself in the obscurity of my person his cunning will no longer be able to evade the terror of my appeal here then you see the motives of my journey to lisbon and rightly suggest that they are in some respects congenial with your own undiminished affection on your part and ardent gratitude on mine attract us to the same point and this being the case i should humbly conceive it will be our mutual wish to wait her arrival in this port and if she has no objection to embark with her in the same packet if your health serves for the undertaking  you speak my wishes correctly replied the father and as for my health it is so secondary an object compared to here is that i do not suffer it to occupy a single thought as these words were uttering a chaise came in sight followed by another and by two servants on horseback henry started at the sight and exclaimed my god here is the very lady herself then calling to the postillion to stop he hastily opened the door of the chaise and leaping out planted himself by the side of the road which it was necessary for the approaching carriages to take  henry though greatly agitated was not wanting in sufficient presence of mind to be cautious in his mode of stopping lady crowberys carriage which he did as gently and as silently as he could contrive when he presented himself at the window the exhausted traveller had raised herself up to enquire into the cause of the stop when immediately as her eyes lighted on the face of her son the blood rushed into her faded cheeks and she exclaimed  my henry my henry is it possible and was proceeding when to save her from unseasonable exertions he told his story in as few words as possible omitting for the present the circumstance of his meeting with his father who remained in his chaise drawn out of the road at some distance  he had taken the precaution to secure her quiet apartments in a private house and having directed her drivers to follow his chaise he left her and returned to his father whom he found in great agitation of spirits it was agreed between them that henry should prepare lady crowbery before mr delapoer attempted to see her and as soon therefore as he had entered the town he quitted the chaise and conducted lady crowberys people to the door of the house he had taken for her  here she alighted and between henry and doctor cawdle was conducted to her apartment which presenting her with a fine view of the sea and being both in point of aspect and interior accommodations much to her liking seemed to have the effect of reviving her spirits exhilarated no doubt by the sight above all others of her beloved henry  honest zachary little less delighted than his patient at this unexpected meeting now let out the circumstance hitherto suppressed by henry of the action carry had had which he had picked up by report upon the road but prudently forbore to speak of this forced our hero upon a narrative of the whole affair in which he took not the glory to himself that was due but in all other particulars was a very correct relater of facts zachary now began his journal and traveled very circumstantially from london to falmouth commenting upon his own sagacious proceedings by the way to which he very justly ascribed the success that had hitherto crowned his operations and certain it was the health and strength of the lady did not appear to henrys observation to have suffered much if any diminution by the journey a restorative was now administered on which zachary descanted with much learning and at the same time pronounced that a repose of some days would be indispensible for her ladyships safety before she embarked on board the packet a fresh supply of certain drugs being wanted he sallied forth in search of a proper shop from whence to replenish his stock as soon as he was gone the mother being left with her son threw her arms about his neck and gave full vent to those exquisite sensations which nature and affection hitherto repressed had implanted in her soul moments so free and mutually delicious they had never yet enjoyed they exchanged embraces and mingled tears till henry recollecting that even joy may be too violent gently extricated himself from her embrace rose from her feet where he was kneeling and having seated himself at her side clasping one of her hands in his she began a conversation which will be recorded in the following chapter  chapter vi friends long divided meet at last i have received a letter said the lady crowbery from my uncle manstock which occasioned me to make a longer stay in london than i should else have made it obliged me to send down my lawyer to receive from his hands the packet containing my will and other papers which i had deposited with him what particular reasons he had for declining a trust that he had willingly accepted is matter of conjecture only but i suppose they proceed from some suspicion entertained of your attachment to isabella and here is to you for which he is probably indebted to the kind suggestions of his friend mr claypole from whose resentment upon being refused the living of our lamented ratcliffe i have every thing malicious to expect if then my uncle will surrender up his understanding to that unworthy guide can i help it i have appointed my executor and shall put into your hands a copy of my will with full directions where to apply for the original which i have lodged with mr g  of grays inn a man in whose integrity the most sacred trust may be reposed but how far this change of opinion in sir roger manstock may affect his amiable daughter is a question of very serious concern for if i understand his letter rightly you are put under absolute proscription nor do i expect she will be allowed to correspond with me unless my letters are submitted to inspection before they reach her hands and as for her writing to me i do not suppose she will be suffered to do it on any account you see therefore in what light you stand and according to your own feelings must either prepare yourself for mortification and disappointment if you persist in thinking of her or if you can let your judgment overruled your passion you will divert your thoughts from a pursuit that now seems hopeless for to attempt at detaching isabella from the strict observance of her fathers commands is an undertaking as impracticable as it would be dishonorable  that is an attempt replied henry i shall never make for that would be to ruin myself both in her esteem and my own interdicted by her father i am excluded from all hope at the same time if i know my own heart i know that time can work no change in its affections and if i am totally to despair of isabella so long as it shall please heaven to impose upon a wretched creature life bereft of all happiness so long i shall with all the resignation that becomes me endure the dispensation for it is not my nature to rebel against my creator  i perceive said the mother that your love my dear henry lies deep and is immovable hasty passions waste themselves in vehement asseverations the flame burns out and there is an end to them but yours is fixed deliberate approbation therefore i shall not argue against it on the contrary i must confess to you that before i parted from isabella i confided to her the secret of your birth i owned myself your mother and disclosed to her the whole purport of those papers which i deposited with her father to be opened only on the event of my decease she knows you therefore for the son of delapoer the heir of my estate and perhaps of his fortune if he has returned as i am informed without connections and in affluent circumstances in her heart therefore i should flatter myself you will keep your place unless my uncle should extort from her any promise to your absolute exclusion in the mean time i could wish before i die to obtain if possible an interview with your father who is unconscious of your existence and which might have taken place but for the provoking oversight of honest cawdle who forgot to give you my note with the ring whilst i was in london i caused enquiry to be made after delapoer i was informed he remained unmarried had preserved an excellent character and brought home a respectable fortune very honorably acquired he was not in town nor was it exactly known where he was gone for he had neither house nor servants in london and the report was that he was going out of england for the winter to a warmer climate it occurs to me therefore that if he has heard of my being ordered to lisbon he may possibly make that his point  and should you be well pleased if it was so demanded henry  i confess to you i should not be sorry replied the lady for the reasons i have already stated  then i may venture to inform you said henry that he was with me in the chaise when i met you on the road at these words the blood rushed into the cheeks of the feeble invalid her eyes sparkled with joy and she exclaimed with unusual energy how wonderful are the ways of providence what an unexpected blessing that i am now permitted to be a happy instrument of a discovery like this let me see him without loss of time let me not postpone even for an hour a duty so important an opportunity so graciously offered i take for granted you have not declared yourself to him he assured her he had not then run for him she cried bring him to me this instant nature struggles at my heart and will not be restrained  henry was gone whilst the words were on her lips she immediately gave orders to her servants to prevent interruption and then began to collect her thoughts for the awful interview whilst she reflected on the extraordinary combination of events that had brought about this unexpected meeting it inspired her to hope that heaven had sealed her pardon for the past offenses of her youth and brought her sufferings to a period when she endeavored to put her thoughts into some form of words and prepare for the discovery she had to make she found herself incapable of arranging her ideas and gave up the attempt it is in vain she cried to meditate on what i am to say i must leave it to nature and the impulse of the moment and now the voice of henry in the house warned her of his approach and soon she heard the steps of two men upon the stairs when the door being opened presented to her view the sickly and emaciated form of delapoer leaning on the arm of his conductor trembling as he advanced toward her and panting for breath through faintness and agitation henry instantly retired not a word was uttered by either of the parties she made an effort to raise herself from her seat but sunk back and putting her hands before her face burst into tears there was a chair beside her in which delapoer sat down how shall i express my thanks to you he said after a short pause for this indulgence providence seems to have brought us together by the most extraordinary means in the last scene of our lifes sad tragedy that we may once more exchange a parting look upon the ruins of time before we separate to our unchangeable destinations your lot my everbeloved lady i am persuaded will be blessed you have labored much and will reap abundantly i snatched a sight of you at crowbery it was too much for an exhausted frame i have been sinking ever since for i heard you was unhappy and my heart rose against your tyrant though discretion stopped my hand i passed several days about the purlieus of your castle disguising both my name and habit lest i might awaken the suspicion of your jailer i met that excellent young man who accompanied me hither and sent you a pledge by his hands which i thought you would understand as a token i was yet alive ever since the inexorable decree that tore us from each other i have been struggling with my hard fortune in the hope of earning by my sword and services a competency to enable me to return an independent man but alas a variety of crosses and misfortunes bore so strong upon me for a course of eighteen years that until the last few months of my abode in india i was toiling against the stream of adversity at length one lucky expedition of which i had the conduct presented to me the alternative of enormous plunder with a guilty conscience or moderate earnings with a clear one i chose the latter and am now returned affluent in circumstances and i thank god irreproachable in character never during this tedious period did the eye of beauty indian or english draw aside one thought one wish one even the slightest regard from the center where first love and the memory of my everadord cecilia had fixed it for life the vow that i had made so sealed so sanctified so rivetted into the very heart of honor was to me a marriage vow  but i perceive i give you pain let me not do that my expressions though strong were only binding on myself you was not free you had a father whom you was forced to obey and i implore you to believe they were not pointed against your proceeding i can well suppose your marriage with a wretch like crowbery was a compulsory one  it was indeed replied she raising her eyes for the first time and turning them upon him in the most affecting manner it was imposed upon me not only as a command which i could not disobey but as an atonement for an offense which i could no otherwise expiate  gracious heaven he exclaimed and was my unhappy cecilia made to atone for an offense for which i vile betrayer as i was am alone responsible it is i then who am the source of all your sorrows i to whose unceasing solicitations your kind heart at last reluctantly gave way i have been the hateful cause of all your sufferings like the deceiver of our first parents the father of all evil  not so rejoined she hastily say rather you have been the father of my only blessing  what do you mean he exclaimed in a tone of impatience and surprise speak to me i beseech you without reserve lead me the straitest way to truth for you have stirred a thought within my heart that will not bear evasion or delay am i a father answer me  you are you are a father she replied and henry is your son  as she spoke these words delapoers senses seemed lost in astonishment he smote his hands together in a transport of joy gazed upon her eagerly for a while then cast his eyes to heaven his lips moved but no voice was heard then throwing himself back in his chair he seemed lost in meditation till roused to sudden recollection he adjured her in the most solemn terms to confirm the truth of what she had told him by an appeal to heaven i take heaven to witness she replied to the truth of what i have said conscious as i am that the judge is at the door in whose presence i must soon appear i repeat to you at the peril of my soul were i capable of deceit that henry is your son and mine  i am satisfied cried delapoer and dropping on his knees broke forth into prayers and praises to the supreme disposer of all events she then imparted to him the purport of her will and briefly related what had passed between her uncle and herself since her departure from manstock when he found she had confided the secret to no one but isabella except henry himself and zachary who was professionally made privy to it he paused for some time and then demanded why he alone might not stand forth to the world as the father of henry without committing her name in any future time let it remain a mystery he said or at most a surmise why should we give that triumph to the malice of lord crowbery why should we put to shame the family pride of sir roger manstock i have fortune enough to bestow upon my son and the first lawyer that is capable of drawing a deed of gift shall secure the reversion of my whole property to him as for your paternal estate bequeath it in it is natural course so that no suspicion rest upon your memory  your suggestion said the lady is truly generous but it is far too important to be adopted without due reflection my uncle manstock has but one child and she a daughter she is already superabundantly endowed and to accumulate estates upon the heiress of that wealthy house is mere supererogation unless our henry who is master of her affections was as much in favor with the father  cannot it be left conditionally upon her marrying henry said delapoer  lady crowbery shook her head and remarked that this would little differ in appearance to the world from an absolute bequest to him yet if i could depend added she upon her attachment to henry or rather i should say upon her fathers consent all might be well and my son through her medium would still be my heir but there is little reliance on my uncle whilst he is under influence hostile to my wishes  did you not say he rejoined that miss manstock was privy to the secret of our henrys birth if so it is to be presumed you have perfect confidence in her honor you also believe she is attached to him else you would not have trusted her with an unnecessary secret how then can this young lady knowing henry to be your son act otherwise by your estate than either share it with him as his wife or restore it to him as your heir  there is much argument she replied in what you say and i believe more true honor does not exist in a human heart than in my cousin isabellas but after all we must talk with henry this was the most immediate wish of delapoers heart who was longing to embrace a son justly so dear to him  and now he recited to lady crowbery the whole narrative of the action dwelling with rapture upon the bravery and humanity of our hero the sensations it produced in a mothers heart need not be described and it is well they need not for i should doubt if they can  in short we hold our readers in too much respect to sicken them with our descriptive powers convinced that there is no incident arising from this history or any other of the kind which may not be referred to their feelings in natural language without those tedious circumlocutory embellishments which only serve to load the page i trust they will not think the worse of my females if they are not drowned in floods of tears upon every occasion or fall into fainting fits with excess of sensibility for to such as are pleased with these tricks we do not write contented to devote our labors to the friends of nature and to them alone  chapter vii our hero is restored to both his parents our readers need not be reminded that the hero of this history knew delapoer to be his father before he was called to a conference upon the proposal stated in the preceding chapter the meeting took place in lady crowberys presence and the nameless foundling whom adversity had so lately crushed now heard himself acknowledged and felt the animating pressure of a parental embrace by turns bestowed upon him with praises prayers and blessings superadded in abundance  son cried lady crowbery it has now pleased heaven to let me see this hour which closes every wish that my fond heart conceived and blesses me beyond what i have ever merited or can compute i have lived to place you in the protection of a father i have survived to behold you clasped in his embrace and what can i say  but that the transport is unutterable a term of life beyond what may suffice to execute the few maternal ties that are yet unfinished is what i dare not what i do not pray for let us not therefore loiter for the time is short let us work while it is day for darkness and death are at hand there is a business to be done upon which i must consult you my paternal estate is as you know in my disposal it is yours on whom but on my son can i bestow it  not so replied henry bestowing it on me you avow me as your son and bequeath your name to detraction and disgrace suppose which heaven forbid lord crowbery survives you what will he say outrageous insult to your memory will ensue this may be repelled you will say but what can be opposed to sir roger manstocks discontent if he will not suffer you to leave a paper in his hands upon the suspicion only of my name being found in it how will he resent a will that is to make me the heir of your estate to the exclusion of his family  and if isabella inherits it said the mother what then  then she who best deserves it has it replied henry and as no earthly blessing can accrue to me but what originates with her you put my fate into her hands who is the mistress of it whether you so consider her or not to her i am known by her alone i can be made happy if i have any interest dear to me upon earth it is to recommend myself to her thoughts and therefore what can best do that is best for my interest let the lovely isabella then possess what she is entitled to of which if any share devolves to me let her bestow it with herself i cannot be too rich in fortunes gifts with isabella to partake of them without her i shall be beyond the reach of fortune nothing can lessen or augment my wretchedness  oh my dear son cried delapoer how perfectly you speak my sentiments i adopt your reasoning nay rather i anticipate it for it is exactly what i recommended to your beloved mother i have enough and all i have is yours  the business was no further pressed for the conference had been long and lady crowbery seemed exhausted she was silent but it was a silence that betokened acquiescence as the business could not be done to her satisfaction without the presence of her confidential lawyer mr g  who was in possession of papers which according to this plan it behoved her to cancel she determined to write to him by express and request him to come down to her if his business admitted of it in person else to dispatch some trusty and sufficient proxy who might act in his place the intermediate time was not longer than seemed requisite for her case which now became more and more doubtful for zachary who began to assume a very pensive aspect had taken a medical assessor into council and both joined in pronouncing that unless some favorable and speedy change took place the project of embarking her for lisbon must be abandoned delapoer and henry saw these inauspicious symptoms in the same melancholy light and drew the most desponding conclusions from them one evening when they were in anxious expectation of mr g  henry perceiving that his mother would be glad to dispense with zacharys attendance drew him aside and walking down to the beach began to question him about his patient expressing himself as without hope of her recovery and under momentary terrors of her immediate dissolution to this zachary replied that although be saw that sad event in approach and in his own judgment regarded it as inevitable yet he conjectured that she would have a gradual and lingering dismission out of life without pain or loss of senses and that no rapid or immediate dissolution was to be apprehended i hope therefore added he our dear lady will yet find time and capacity to settle her affairs to your satisfaction and advantage and put you in a situation to propose for the loveliest girl in england to whom i perceive you are very seriously attached no answer being returned to this he proceeded  for my own part i am persuaded there is no love lost between you as the saying is and if you have left your heart with miss manstock in pledge you have taken here is away with you in possession for i am no indifferent physiognomist and not apt to be out in my conjectures as to the human heart i had a little private talk with the young lady during our halt at manstock house and i believe my friend i did your cause no harm by what i said on that occasion  the less you said the better henry coldly replied  come come young gentleman resumed zachary you are too modest too diffident it is not the first time you have stood in your own light with the ladies and that puts me in mind of my poor boozy dame who has now i suppose drank up her drink and sleeps in peace alexander kinloch writes me word and i have this morning received his letter that she is absolutely at deaths door well gods will be done i must bear it with christian patience mors omnibus communis  here the doctor took out his handkerchief and in conformity to custom upon such occasions applied it to his eyes where if there had been a tear no doubt the aforesaid handkerchief would have done its duty and disposed of it but i must prepare myself to expect the worst added he for if death be at the door and none but sawney kinloch to keep him out why it is natural to conclude that all is over with my poor dame to be sure she had her failings as who has not but custom familiarizd me to them she certainly made some trips in point of fidelity to my bed but then she was overpartial to the brandybottle and that accounts for her incontinence you know very naturally she was a little overrighteous it must be owned and saddled me with the saints rather more than was agreeable but then her religion was mere hypocrisy so that i could not quarrel with her on that account she was something of a termagant i cannot deny told a pretty many untruths and bred a pretty many disturbances in my family but then she did the same by all her neighbors as by me so that i had no cause in particular to complain of her and upon the whole have as much reason to regret the loss of my wife as most husbands have to lament for theirs  well my good master said henry smiling notwithstanding all these good qualities which you have counted up i am in hopes you will hear your loss with tolerable composure and that your days to come will not pass the less to your content because you have no longer a wife in existence who answers to the description you have been giving at least i hope life may be tolerable though you have neither sot slut nor shrew in your house to entertain you and as the time i fear is not far off when you will have a real friend to lament i foresee that your professional cares will not long survive your domestic ones and in that case you will have to look out for a successor in your business should that be the case and should alexander kinloch not be the man that answers to your wishes i beg you will let me recommend to you a friend of mine for whose sufficiency in all respects i will make myself responsible the person i speak of is your quondam assistant mr william williams at present surgeon of captain careys frigate a man very highly to be esteemed for his private character and of whose abilities in every branch of his profession i am bold to promise you may be furnished with the strongest testimonials  to this zachary replied that he had a very high opinion of williams and without hesitation should prefer him to every other proponent not only in respect to henrys good wishes for him but on the score of his own merit as for the old scotchman he protested against him in any other capacity than as a cheap drudge at the mortar if williams chose to continue him there which however he should not be very forward to advise  this matter being adjusted to henrys satisfaction he now perceived a chaise and four stop at lady crowberys door and running to it had the gratification of finding that mr g  himself had complied with that ladys request and come down in person a short conversation with that excellent man soon opened to him a character in which integrity is so prominent that nature in the formation of it seemed determined so to place her work as that no one should overlook or mistake it it will suffice therefore to say that every thing was done acording to the will of the testatrix which method in business and correctness in form could effect the same opportunity also served for mr delapoer to make his promised settlement on his son our hero and this being done our honest lawyer and as such we venture to pronounce him one of the worthiest members of the community returned to his station in life where we hope he will long abide to protect the property of his clients and enliven the society of his friends  chapter viii a gentle being drops into the grave a few days had passed after the departure of mr g  when the lady crowbery perceiving her small remains of strength hourly on the decline communicated to her friends her total abandonment of all hope of stirring from the spot she was in at the same time expressing her acquiescence in the call of providence and the thankfulness with which she should obey the summons in the presence of those who were dearest to her in this world she still found strength by intervals to write a farewell letter to her unworthy lord also one of a very affectionate cast to her uncle manstock both which she committed to the post to isabella she likewise wrote on a subject more important to her than that of taking leave for life as it respected the future happiness of her beloved son and explained in terms however the most delicate her implied hopes and views in the disposition she had made of her estate and this letter she put into henrys hands referring it to his discretion in what manner and at what period to make use of it  to zachary cawdle she bequeathed an annuity of three hundred pounds a year chargeable upon her estate to be paid quarterly and punctually in small legacies to servants and charitable donations a further sum was involved for which due provision was made and direction given of henry no mention was to be found in her will but both to him and his father she gave with her own hands several little articles valuable only as tokens of affection and pledges of remembrance every thing that personally belonged to her in crowbery castle of which she had many particulars were left to the lord of that mansion the residue was bequeathed in trust to sir roger manstock for the use and benefit of isabella without entail and at her free disposal when she should attain the age of eighteen years of which there yet remained some months only before her nonage should expire  neither her senses nor spirits seemed to yield at the approach of death every morning she was conveyed from her bed to a couch in her sittingroom which had a pleasant view of the sea and shore here she was constantly attended by one or both of her beloved friends whose tender assiduities cheared her to her latest moments she took particular delight in listening to delapoers narrative of his adventures in india which he contrived to render both interesting and entertaining to her introducing it at such times only as she seemed to call for it and in such proportions as might not weary her attention or too forcibly agitate her feelings  she also in her turn had a story to relate which though told with great mitigation toward lord crowbery and with the suppression of many cruel circumstances in his conduct and sufferings on her part was not always heard with the temper and patience that she wished to inspire delapoer in spite of all his caution would sometimes give way to the warmth of his natural character and once or twice to her sensible regret broke forth into menaces and denunciations these she would with anxious solicitude strive to qualify and repress if you love me delapoer she would say you will remember my words after death and not disgrace my memory or disturb my spirit in the grave by a revengeful and violent proceeding toward lord crowbery had he been indulgent and kind to me how severely would my conscience have reproached me and if on the contrary he has been somewhat harsh and ungentle cannot you recollect enough both committed and omitted on my part to extenuate if not to warrant his unkindness you will say my marriage was a compulsory one  it is true it was so but still i was a party though a most unwilling one in the imposition that was put upon him in my heart he never could obtain a place i paid him obedience  i had no more to bestow  the last conversation of this sort she had with delapoer was on the evening preceding the day on which she died she was fervent in prayer that her errors might be pardoned and in the most solemn manner conjured him to conspire with her in atonement by giving double diligence to the performance of those duties which their joint offense had entailed upon them in the person of their son whilst she was thus addressing him delapoer who was supporting her as she sat erect on the couch perceived a convulsive symptom in the muscles about her mouth which gave him instant alarm and the eager look with which he pursued his observation convinced her that some change had happened in her features to occasion it  ah my dear friend she said i understand your looks i am dying perhaps i am disfigured if so leave me i implore you do not let the last impression of this face which you once beheld with pleasure remain upon your memory with disgust and horror if i am fit to be seen let me thus expire supported in your arms if not farewell for ever let my servants be called and let me not shock either you or my son with an object so distressing as she faintly uttered these words she put her hands before her face which delapoer gently clasped in his assuring her that her suspicion was unfounded and that her features indicated no such symptoms as she apprehended he soon after rung the bell when henry entered hastily followed by zachary and two female attendants henry threw himself on his knees by the side of her couch and continued for some minutes enfolded in her arms in speechless agony for he also perceived the change and saw the hand of death was upon her a convulsive tremor now seized her whole frame and she sunk down on her couch insensible while the doctor exhorted them to leave her to the care of himself and the women through the remainder of the night she dosed with short intervals in which she appeared to have some degree of recollection but never uttered a word or seemed to experience a pain at an early hour of the morning she drew her last sigh and expired the father and the son were standing by the side of the bed at that awful moment and the smile which love impressed upon her features as her eyes caught a parting sight of them before they closed for ever remained after death as if to tell the beholders that her soul unwilling to derange the beautiful frame in which it had been encased had left its peace behind it whilst it conveyed itself away to the mansions of immortality and bliss  chapter ix our history presents a scene not very flattering to human nature we have now closed the history of the amiable but unhappy lady crowbery and we would fain hope that such of our readers as are parents will think the moral of her fate not unworthy of their consideration and reflection  one of the first duties that devolved upon her afflicted friends was to give information of the mournful event to her absent connections this business was undertaken by doctor zachary who immediately penned a respectful epistle to sir roger manstock and also one in like terms to the lord viscount crowbery which were sent off by express  delapoer and his son determined upon staying by the remains of their lamented friend till orders should be received from lord crowbery respecting the funeral and henry took an early opportunity of making his friend captain carey acquainted with the sad event that had now occasioned him to decline all thoughts of rejoining the victorious frigate the return of the post brought him the following answer from that gallant officer  my dear friend i loved and respected my relation lady crowbery as much as i despise and abhor the wretch who not only shortened but embittered her days and i lament her sad fate and your loss from the bottom of my heart bear up however my brave fellow and when you are weary of the shore remember you have a messmate who so long as he has a plank to float on will be proud to approve himself yours on all occasions most sincerely and affectionately   carey   the messenger in the mean time who was charged with the mournful tidings of his ladys death proceeded on his way with all possible expedition and according to his instructions first presented himself at the castle of his lord and delivered his dispatch it was received and read in the company of the reverend mr claypole and miss fanny the former of whom had deported himself with all possible address and enjoyed the satisfaction of contemplating the flattering prospect that every hour brought nearer to his view from the increasing attachment of that noble personage to his amiable niece an uncle more sensitive to appearances or less persuaded of the purity of the female character might have proved a troublesome guest to a nobleman of his lordships irritable feelings at certain moments when the vehemence of his passion carried him beyond the bounds which some people of more rigid notions would have thought a little on the outside of discretion but mr claypole was not one of these formal disciplinarians and accommodated himself to times and seasons with admirable facility with a soul superior to suspicion he heeded not those innocent dalliances that passed between the lovers whilst he had the resource of a book or a walk and sometimes of a nap in his chair to fill up an hour when conversation was suspended and dumbshew took place of dialogue  captain crowbery was upon a visit to a friend in a distant country so that the society of the castle was very much confined and their harmony seldom if ever interrupted by the intrusion of unwelcome visitors miss fanny possessed the apartment of the absent lady and had already made some arrangements in the disposition and furniture of it which she asserted and my lord acknowledged to be very striking improvements two or three old domestics who had considered themselves as appertaining to the lady of the house were now very naturally regarded as supernumeraries and upon a principle of economy which the reverend mr claypole took all proper occasions to inculcate were paid off and dismissed one or two of these who had belonged to lady crowberys family from their youth and were past the age of service were entertained by sir roger manstock and charitably enrolled amongst his band of pensioners the others sought their livelihood where they could find it by an arrangement with the parson of crowbery the reverend mr claypole took the duty of that parish upon himself and transferred to him the service of the church at manstock to which sir roger very willingly accorded from motives that in candor we must acknowledge to have had some respect to his own ease and convenience as well as to the aforesaid mr claypoles no intercourse whatever had in the mean time passed between the allied houses of crowbery and manstock few souls were less akin than those of their owners and their respective associates  no charge could be laid against mother nature for having misapplied her workmanship upon the mould in which she had cast the person of lord crowbery nay on the contrary it should seem she had both tempered and modelled it with the most accurate attention and harmonized it to the soul which it enveloped with the nicest art no man of common observation could receive a false impression of his lordships character from the first glance of his exterior nature had not given to him the outward semblance of any one virtue dignity or endowment which he did not mentally possess neither was there one moral failing or defect to be found in the journal of his life which might not figuratively be said to stand recorded in the title page of that history in short if he had had hypocrisy enough to affect the manners of a gentleman nobody but a fool would have been capable of being duped by him  this accomplished peer though not quite fitted in all particulars to fill up the vacancy which henry had left in the soft heart of miss fanny nevertheless was encouraged by that young lady to believe that he was in absolute possession of it to develope her motives for deceiving him into this opinion might be an unpleasant investigation but when we have said that ambition and revenge were of the party it is not necessary to search for others to make up the number this young lady and his lordship were just then engaged in conversation on a very interesting topic whilst the reverend mr claypole had dropped asleep on a sopha that filled up a recess in the room when the servant arrived from falmouth with the letter which announced the death of lady crowbery his lordship read it with a countenance that did not indicate any of those weaknesses which human nature sometimes is betrayed into upon a sudden surprise he perused it with a steady eye folded it up again with a firm hand and putting it into his pocket in a tone of voice which abated nothing of its usual energy coolly observed that the expected event was come to pass  lady crowbery was dead  miss fanny started from her seat with an exclamation very frequently applied by ladies of her fashion to express either joy sorrow surprise or any other passion that attacks their gentle spirits unawares at the same instant the reverend sleeper sprung from his couch ready prepared to second any emotion that his noble friend might be pleased to express either of joy or sorrow his noble friend did not as yet discover to which party he was disposed to incline therefore mr claypole judiciously kept silence and held his faculties suspended in a neutral state till circumstances should determine them i guessed how this scheme to lisbon would end cried the peer  yes replied the parson i suspected it would terminate as it has done when that booby of an apothecary took upon him the charge of her ladyships constitution  a pretty fellow truly resumed my lord to be traveling physician to a woman of quality but i can understand nothing from his letter but that his patient has slipped through his hands therefore with your leave i shall step into my library and try what information may be gathered from the messenger  this said he rose from his chair and calmly stalked out of the room  the uncle and niece were now set free from all restraint and soon began to let loose their sentiments upon this interesting event without reserve  i judged her case to be desperate cried the uncle she was a lost woman when i saw her at manstock i cannot say she gave me any great reason to lament her loss if i ever had any obligations to her she canceled them all by her last haughty treatment of me when i modestly made suit for the poor favor of succeeding parson ratcliffe to this the niece made no answer nor indeed had she paid any attention as her mind was just then engaged in computing the period of a widowers first mourning and as this meditation involved her in some dilemma she abruptly appealed to her uncle whether it was totally out of form for his lordship to be married before he was out of weepers and black gloves that is as it may be replied the uncle some people judge in those matters with more liberality and latitude than others i am no great critic in forms but this i know that the sooner you bring his lordship to the point my dear fanny the better  why that is done already cried the lady elect the point is carried and i have his honor in pledge else can you suppose i would admit  certainly not cried claypole interrupting her i cannot doubt but you know the ground you are upon and therefore it is that i have never interposed my advice but now that there is no longer any obstacle i should recommend you to hold back till he fulfils his engagements a seasonable reserve may quicken desire too much kindness may chance to quell it  i believe cried the niece i am fully capable of conducting myself in this affair without resorting to an adviser where there is no passion at the heart it is not likely there should be any error in the judgment and i flatter myself you do me justice to believe i am not in love with the person of lord crowbery he is not a henry to catch the eye or engage the heart but he is a peer of england has a good estate and a noble castle which when i am the mistress of i confess the triumph it will give me over that provoking chit isabella whom i hate and detest at my heart will not be amongst the least of my enjoyments  lord crowbery in the meantime having asked a few trifling questions of the bearer of the letter dismissed him and sent for his agent lawyer ferret to whom he dictated the following lines by way of answer to the questions referred to him in zacharys dispatch  mr cawdle sir i am commanded by the lord viscount crowbery to say that he has received yours of the   th ultimo informing him of the death of your patient on the morning of that day with respect to your further enquiries touching the burial ceremonies his lordship bids me tell you he has no answer to give the heir or heirs of the deceased whoever they may be will act as they see fit in the case you have no instructions to expect from him  i am sir your humble servant john jeffery ferret   chapter x the scene is shifted to manstock house when the messenger arrived at manstock house sir roger was just returned home from the county town where he had been unanimously elected representative in parliament the mournful news caused deep affliction both to him and the sensitive isabella the same servant was charged with a verbal message from lord crowbery signifying that he declined interfering with any wishes sir roger might have respecting the place of burial and the disposal of the remains he added that when the will was opened he presumed he should have notice sir roger well understood the spirit of this message and properly felt both the insult and the meanness it implied the instant he could compose his thoughts sufficiently for the purpose he wrote to zachary cawdle requiring him to transmit the body with all proper decorum and attendance fitting the quality of the deceased by easy stages to the family vault of her ancestors at her paternal seat of hagley hall where himself and his daughter purposed to be in waiting to receive it and to pay the last honors to the corpse of his most dear and lamented niece the business this involved him in had probably the effect of occupying so much of his time and thoughts that grief had the less opportunity of fixing upon him but the tender isabella who had not so full a share of those avocations surrendered herself to melancholy and desponding meditations in her breast also there was lodged a secret of most serious import and in the mean time she had no instructions how to dispose of it these she expected to receive by some hand or other but what to wish she knew not whether they should be to impart it to her father or still to conceal it from him was an alternative that offered nothing to her reflection but difficulties and distresses on both sides that henry should be left heir to his mothers estate was naturally to be expected but how he could be named or described in her will without a discovery of his birth was what she could not comprehend the papers that had been written for her fathers inspection after her cousins death she knew had been destroyed and that purpose revoked she apprehended therefore that some order would come to her for divulging it to sir roger and this was a task which of all earthly undertakings was most dreadful to her in the meantime the preparations were put forward for the journey and servants were dispatched beforehand to get the house in order to receive them and to set on foot all the preliminary ceremonials for a respectable and splendid funeral  in this interval arrived mr g  with the will and his coming was most seasonable for it was on the very eve of sir rogers setting out on his journey this event was immediately communicated to lord crowbery and with the messenger who carried sir rogers note to his lordship returned not the principal himself but his representative mr john jeffery ferret attorney at law and agent to the noble peer aforesaid  the arrival of this august personage being announced the baronet with his fair daughter and the respectable holder and maker of the will assembled in the bookroom and were soon honored with the presence of mr ferret before whom the seals after being submitted to his inspection were solemnly broken open and the will distinctly and audibly read by mr g  the signatures seals dates and every other particular were minutely examined by the said mr ferret who was asked by mr g  if he was satisfied as to what he had seen and heard to which after due time for recollection he gravely replied in point of form i see nothing at present to object to in point of essence i shall decline giving any answer till i have advised with counsel this lady died in an obscure and distant corner of the island the will is also dated not many days previous to her decease it will be requisite to ascertain that the testatrix was actually and bona fide of sound mind and judgment at the time of her signing the said will understand me not i pray you as insinuating any thing to the contrary but being a professional man yourself you will admit the reasonableness of what i say which is no more than my duty to my principal requires of me  i believe your principal replied mr g  received a letter from the testatrix written throughout with her own hand since the date of this will which if he is not disposed to refer to sir roger manstock i am persuaded has one of as late a date to produce which will testify to her capacity together with other proofs which will be forthcoming whenever you are instructed to call for them in short sir we shall be ready to meet you in any way you shall think fit to require of us  during this conversation sir roger sat in silent astonishment to find the purport of the will so contrary to his expectations inasmuch as the name or description of henry was no where mentioned nor any bequest whatever specified that could by any implication refer to him whilst the agitation it occasioned in the bosom of isabella was such that unable to keep her seat she rose and demanded of mr g  if she might not be permitted to leave the room which being answered in the affirmative she lost no time to avail herself of and hastened away i perceive said lawyer ferret that my lord crowbery has no further interest in this will than what respects a few personals appertaining to the deceased left behind her in the castle of which perhaps a query might be made as to her ladyships right of disposal  that is a query cried m g  we have no concern with it can only affect yourselves therefore you will manage it in your own way  i perceive also resumed ferret with some surprise here is no mention made of a certain young man whom we in these parts expected to find remembered by her ladyship at her death having seen him so much favored by her in her life time upon this sir roger rose from his seat and addressing himself to mr g  said i humbly conceive sir if this gentleman has no legal observations to state we are not bound to listen to any others and may break up the meeting mr g  having made sign of assent the baronet departed without further ceremony and lawyer ferret having put in his claim for a copy of the will called for his horse and set forward on the spur to report his proceedings at the place from whence he came  this business being ended mr g  joined the baronet and the heiress who were expecting him in the adjoining room sir roger began the conversation by expressing himself very greatly surprised at the purport of his nieces bequest of her entire estate to his daughter nay i must fairly declare to you added he that i am at a loss how to reconcile myself to the justice of it the remark which that impertinent attorney made upon the total silence observed toward a certain young man who to my knowledge was encouraged to expect a provision was a very natural one in itself though out of place in his mouth and to say the truth sir i cannot for the life of me comprehend how such an omission could take place after the promises and assurances i myself have been a witness to may i ask you to explain this and how it came to pass that either he forfeited her favor or that she forgot to make good her promise to this mr g  replied that he could only answer that enquiry in part by assuring him that the young gentleman in question had in no degree forfeited the favor and good opinion of the lady deceased  then i am more than ever puzzled to find a cause of her neglect of him said the baronet permit me to ask you if he saw my niece before her death  he was with her ladyship as i believe to the very hour of her death  and was he privy to the will demanded sir roger i doubt said the worthy respondent if i ought in strictness to answer that question but in confidence i will venture to disclose to you and this lady present that he was not only perfectly made acquainted with the disposition of lady crowberys property but also a very active party in the promotion of that measure then upon my life exclaimed sir roger that same mysterious unknown is without exception the most extraordinary and unaccountable young man now living this is the second time he has put fortune from him and voluntarily preferred poverty to affluence  i protest i do not see any mystery in that said the other i clearly understand there are certain sensations he prefers to others and certain things in this world which he loves better than his interest  at this moment mr g  in taking his snuff box from his pocket dropped his glove upon the floor without perceiving it which the lovely isabella immediately picked up and presented to him with a grace peculiar to herself an attention so flattering naturally drew a return of excuses and apologies from mr g  for his inattention in suffering her to condescend to such an office to which she replied whilst blushes overspread her cheeks and gratitude glistened in her eyes  any thing i can do to show my respect for mr g  will be an office i shall be proud of this was pointed in so marked a manner and introduced with a look so expressive that it would have been impossible for any common observer much less for that intelligent person himself not to comprehend the motive of it and though sir roger gave no sign of his having regarded it otherwise than as an ordinary act of politeness yet we may risque a conjecture that he argued from it in his own thoughts pretty much in the same way with the gentleman to whom it was addressed  this little incident did not however altogether turn their discourse from the topic they were upon isabella ventured to enquire of mr g  if henry was recovered from his wound which question he conceiving it to allude to the action on board the frigate drew him into a description of that fight as he had heard it from mr delapoer this was in itself an interesting narrative though not altogether new to the hearers of it for carry had written to his uncle since he came into port and done justice to his brave volunteer but the warmth of his heart who had it now in narration and the affection he had conceived for our amiable hero through the natural sympathy of congenial souls gave a brighter hue to the description and animated one at least of his audience in so peculiar a manner that at the conclusion of it she was impelled to venture upon an inference which in a more collected moment she would hardly have risqued viz that where so much courage and benevolence were united it was no wonder if every action of such a character produced something uncommonly noble and superior to views of worldly minds  an apostrophe so much above the pitch of isabellas natural diffidence would hardly have passed without a comment from sir roger had not mr g  been present or let us rather say had it not been justly due to the merits of our hero  chapter xi a gleam of hope suddenly reversed what imprudence have i given way to said isabella within herself when she retired to her solitary meditations in her own apartment i shall certainly receive the rebuke which i have merited from my father but oh that i might be suffered to give vent to my respect and gratitude for that charming man who spoke so warmly of my henry yes yes he is all that is good and generous all that is brave and benevolent all that is engaging amiable and excellent in human nature and now i can interpret his proceeding i can solve his motives for the sacrifice he has made of his inheritance to preserve the memory of his mother from disgrace and shame glorious unequalled generosity which throws him on my honor for restitution and thank heaven that honor glows within my breast as warmly as within his own let the consequences be whatever they may i swear to truth i will not be a day in possession of the power to do him justice without seizing the opportunity for performing it but is that enough is there not another hope at his heart is there not another wish in mine may i not believe he loves me have i not heard him tenderly express his feelings his affections and what answer did i make oh such an one it was as opened my whole soul without the feeble the fallacious aid of words my sighs were vows my parting tears were seals of love more sacred more sincere than all the bonds that law or language can devise and i will keep them faithfully in remembrance yes henry whilst i have life my heart can never change i may be wretched false i will not be  here sir roger entered the room his plea was to enquire if she was preparing for her journey on the next morning but he sat down and entered into a discourse that certainly was not calculated to forward those preparations he began by observing to her how much he had been surprised at the reading of his nieces will and asked her with a smile how she felt herself affected by the sudden accession of so great a fortune i fancy said he you did not expect when we proposed this mournful journey that you was going to take possession of your own estate i can assure you isabella it is a very fine place and i am told has been well kept up though our poor friend never visited it i hope however it will not put you out of conceit with manstock house  so long as you inhabit it she replied no place can rival manstock in my thoughts  but when you marry you may entertain other thoughts  i will never marry any man capable of an attempt to detach me from a preference so natural so unalterable  then you must not marry any man said sir roger who has a predilection for his own family seat  having already one more than i want replied isabella smiling i hope you think there is no occasion for me to add to it  i understand you said the father in a tone of good humor the man to your mind must have no encumbrances of house or home he must be without fortune i confess answering quickly said isabella i could readily wave that if he had virtue courage generosity good sense and discernment to respect and honor you without these qualities i should despise him had he the wealth of worlds  but you know no such person not you said the baronet looking archly at her as he spoke you have never met with any lover of this description and whilst you persist in so many unreasonable demands upon his character probably you never will  not above once in my life i dare say answered isabella  and once is enough said he if you are sure of your man look ye daughter i love fair dealing and confession i fancy our friend g  and you are pretty much of the same opinion in this case for i observe you seconded his encomiums on a certain person with uncommon ardour now i conceive when a young lady is so warm in the praises of a young man and both parties are unmarried it is a strong presumption that there is a liking in the case if so why not confess it seeing i have no other power over your mind except by correcting your judgment where i think it errs or confirming your choice where i think it is well placed  oh my dear dear sir replied the grateful damsel i should be indeed unworthy of so much goodness if i did not meet your candor with the sincerest exposition of my heart and its affections yes my everhononrd father i will confess to you and i trust i need not blush at the confession that i contemplate henrys character with admiration and delight i do believe it is a combination of all human virtues and i ground my faith not upon presumptive partial conjecture but upon proofs which will bear the strictest examination which cannot be contraverted by malice itself and to most of which you yourself can witness let his conduct be scrutinizd from the first moment that fortune threw him upon our mercy to the present instant where can be found an example of such patience resignation fortitude of such benevolence bravery generosity what has he not endured what has he not forgiven who ever made such disinterested sacrifices to a principle of justice and honor in the most refined the most exalted sense of those virtues neither is he less to be admired for the purity of his morals than for the delicacy of his principles  well well cried the baronet so far so good you have gone on briskly with his mental qualities and i dont know that you have said a word too much but what is it all if that one thing should be wanting without which no young lady ever yielded more than her approbation to the bed of men if the person in which all these virtues center is not agreeable to you if the form is not elegant the manners not engaging the address not captivating why then you know there can be no love in the heart and praise is all that poor henry is ever to expect from your lips  ah my beloved sir cried isabella blushing yet with eyes that showed it was the blush of joy now you are rallying me because i have forborne to speak of what i dare say you suspect was foremost in my thoughts but in points of truth and fact there can be but one opinion in matters of taste there may be many it appears to me that nature has been as partial to henry in person as in mind you may not see him with the same eyes  not exactly perhaps he replied smiling but yet i can see enough to comprehend why fanny claypole fell in love with him why susan may was distracted for him and why you my dear isabella do not absolutely dislike him  dislike him echoed the fond damsel oh heavens i should be a wretch insensible to the finest work of the creator if i could dislike him surely sir nothing in the human form can be more perfect than henry  come come resumed sir roger you have made up for all deficiencies at last more need not be attempted for more i think cannot be said and now isabella having heard your confession it is my turn to call upon your attention whilst i make mine in every thing your have said of henry i perfectly concur greater proof i cannot give you of my very high opinion of his merit and accomplishments than by assuring you that the reasons i have hitherto had for opposing your attachment to him are by recent circumstances in a great degree removed and as want of fortune alone would in no instance have been my absolute objection i shall the less insist upon it in the present case forasmuch as your means are now so great as to make any further augmentation of them by marriage an object not worth attending to in the place therefore of several impediments i now see but one remaining and that is my ignorance of his birth and condition i cannot dispense with obscurity or meanness now although the mystery is not cleared up by the melancholy event of your cousins decease yet the terror of it is removed from my mind by the circmstances of her will for i shall now disclose to you what i should never have mentioned whilst lady crowbery was living that there was something in her deportment toward your friend henry that gave me great uneasiness and alarm not that i entertained suspicions of the sort which her imperious husband had or affected to have of their connection no that was not the nature of my terror the thought was out of reach of probability the character of the lady gave no countenance to it on the contrary there was such an air of maternal tenderness in her regards that i protest to you isabella i found myself haunted by an idea that the idle rumor which was spread about the neighborhood after my niece had elopd with mr delapoer might have been true and that this same youth had been the unlawful issue of that connection under the impression of such an idea you cannot wonder at the vehemence with which i interdicted your correspondence with him but now that i see him totally overlooked in her will i can no longer entertain any suspicion of his standing in so near a relation to her and with that suspicion of his being her son i now dismiss my opposition to his pretensions as your admirer  had sir roger manstock waited for an answer to this speech it would have been impossible for isabella to have disguised the sensations it produced sensations as opposite to those it was meant to convey as chilling disappointment is to thankful joy but he was gone as soon as he had uttered the concluding words and gone in the persuasion that he had made a being happy who was infinitely dear to him whilst she was left to reflect upon a situation now rendered far more hopeless and distressing than it had been in the worst of moments when his opposition was more open and declared whilst she pondered upon this her bosom heaved with sighs and her eyes streamed with tears all those fascinating ideas which her fond fathers encouraging discourse had raised in her mind were at once dispersed and succeeded by a press of thoughts that presented nothing but despair and disappointment to her imagination what to do she knew not and how to shape her conduct in a dilemma so full of difficulties she was incapable of deciding for if she availed herself of her fathers permission for readmitting him into the family what consequence could ensue from such a fruitless indulgence but an aggravation of regret which every hour of increasing love and approbation would accumulate upon her on the other hand what would her father think after the confession she had made if she was now to hold back when she had his leave to advance what but that she was the most obstinate and capricious coquette in nature who was no longer pleased than whilst she was opposed and had no wishes of her own when they were found to coincide with his it was now for the first time she lamented the confidence that had been reposed in her by her deceased friend and benefactress for being entrusted with the secret she could in no case violate her honor by betraying it and being now made acquainted with her fathers motives for proscribing henry whilst he suspected him to be the son of his niece no temptation upon earth could overcome her abhorrence of duplicity or deceit whilst he should retain a sentiment so adverse to that connection and in this she foresaw no probability of change  with heavy heart therefore we must leave the unhappy isabella to struggle with these conflicting thoughts and turn to other scenes that are prepared to open the succeeding book  end of the third volume
