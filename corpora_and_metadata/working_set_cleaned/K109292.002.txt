the difference between words esteemed synonymous in the english language  and the proper choice of them determined together with so much of abbe girards treatise on this subject as would agree with our mode of expression  useful to all who would either write or speak with propriety and elegance  vol ii  london printed for j dodsley in pall mall mdcclxvi  the signification of words esteemed synonymous in the english language investigated  0  effigy image statue corporeal representation is the common idea of these three words but an effigy is to supply the place of the real thing an image is to show the attitude and design but in miniature a statue the same but as large as life  persons who draw on themselves the popular odium are sometimes hung in effigy images are made of china silver etc and set up in houses by way of ornament we erect statues of our kings in grateful remembrance of them   0  to give present offer of these three words that of give is generally used in a familiar sense that of present in a respectful one that of offer in a religious one we give to our servants we present to princes we offer to god  we give what we would have received we present what we think will be agreeable we offer what we imagine will be acceptable  we cannot give what does not belong to us nor offer what is not in our power but we sometimes present what is neither ours nor in our power to give    0 frugality economy frugality implies only discretion of expense economy includes in its idea some kind of management in order to eke matters out  frugality is generally the province of the husband whose business is to take care his expenses do not exceed his income economy is principally the care of the wife whose study is by a prudent management if possible to make up every deficiency      clothes dress clothes express simply that which covers the body and includes all for that purpose from head to foot and nothing more it is for this reason we say with propriety the necessaries of life consist in meat drink lodging and clothes dress has a more confined meaning besides that of a bare covering it includes in its idea a relation to form and fashion as well to the ornaments as the necessaries thus we say a spanish dress a hungarian dress a rich dress etc  though the sword and cockade cannot be called clothes they are nevertheless part of the dress of an officer      wonder astonishment amazement consternation surprise of these words that of wonder implies admiration at something extraordinary astonishment is a sudden confusion of mind arising from either fear or wonder amazement implies a greater degree of astonishment consternation such a degree as almost borders upon horror arising chiefly from dreadful circumstances as to surprise it means only being taken unawares  of all these words wonder and surprise are supposed to be nearest to each other in signification but even between these may be observed a difference the first being generally considered as relative to things good in themselves the latter with respect to either good or bad we are apt to wonder when a bad man does good and be surprised when a good man does ill  besides wonder includes in its idea some small degree of consideration surprise does not  if a meanspirited person whom i have insulted should come to me in order to solicit a reconciliation i should naturally say i am surprised at his coming but when i reflect on the meanness of his spirit i do not much wonder  wonder and surprise act upon the mind astonishment and amazement upon the senses consternation upon the heart  the words astonishment and amazement equally with that of surprise are used be the matter referred to either good or bad but consternation is never made use of but with respect to bad  we wonder and are surprised at the miraculous events of providence we are astonished and amazed at the extraordinary qualities of the magnet an unexpected calamity will throw us often into the greatest consternation      liberality generosity bounty a ready and willing distribution according to our abilities is the general idea of these three words but they have each a particular one as follows liberality implies acts of mere giving or spending generosity acts of greatness bounty acts of kindness  a liberal man gives freely a generous man nobly and a bountiful man charitably  liberality is a natural disposition generosity proceeds from elevation of sentiment bounty from religious motives  liberality denotes freedom of spirit generosity greatness of soul bounty openness of heart  too great liberality borders upon profuseness it then becomes a fault generosity is a princely quality and if it does not exceed the bounds of our abilities is always commendable bounty is an amiable virtue and never goes unrewarded      prepossessed opiniated obstinate infatuated headstrong these epithets denote a folly which consists in being too much wedded to our own opinion but that which is particularized by the word prepossessed seems to arise from excess of prejudice which seduces and causes us to think what we have preconceived the best paying little or no regard to the opinions of others in one opiniated this folly seems to be the effect of an overfondness for his own notions and a contempt for those of others obstinacy seems to spring from an affected perverseness which renders it intractable and which against the rules of goodbreeding will never give way an infatuated person is supposed to be follystruck to suffer some loss of reason which is the occasion of that inflexibility we observe in him as to the word headstrong though often used as synonymous with the above it appears to me to have a greater relation to a mans actions intimating a blind determination that stops his ears to every argument and renders him ungovernable  prepossessed and opiniated imply a mind strongly prejudiced obstinate and headstrong an unruly will infatuated a wandering in the dark  thus to be prepossessed opiniated or infatuated is involuntary to be obstinate or headstrong voluntary  a person prepossessed follows his own opinions after examining in some sort those of others one who is opiniated follows his own notions implicitly without ever listening to those of others obstinacy pursues its own way in spite of every opposition and often through mere caprice infatuation acts so strongly as in some measure to take away that reason which is the light of the mind and thus darkening it leads a man into the grossest errors the headstrong person often acts through a spirit of opposition and seldom leaves his course till he has completed his ruin      to lift raise we lift in taking any thing up we raise in setting it upright or placing according to some order thus we lift a weight etc we raise the head we raise a ladder we raise a mast      to institute found to establish endow to institute is to create and form things having some relation to the author or him who first contrived or laid down the plan to found is to give birth to such plan to establish is to fix that plan upon a lasting basis to endow is to provide the necessaries for its subsistence  after universities were once instituted colleges were founded though not at first endowed since which those noble institutions have been well established by such endowments as do honor to our country      chance fortune chance forms neither order or design we neither attribute to it knowledge or will and its events are always very uncertain fortune lays plans and designs but without choice we attribute to it a will without discernment and say that it acts blindly  the chief of our successes are more owing to chance than skill it is sometimes a long while before fortune will look upon us with a favorable eye      lot destiny lot supposes distinctions and a method of decision we attribute to it a hidden determination which keeps us in doubt till the instant it shows itself destiny forms designs dispositions and connections we attribute to it knowledge will and power its views are determined and unalterable  lot decides destiny ordains  we observe many so extremely rash as to leave their lives to the lot of a die whatever destiny decrees is inevitable because we can neither force its disposition nor see beyond the reach of its light      religion piety devotion the word religion is not considered here as signifying the worship we owe to the deity and the tribute of our dependence upon him but as denoting a quality of the soul and a disposition of the heart toward god it is in this sense only that it is reputed as synonymous with the other two this disposition then prevents our failing in any part of our duty to the supreme being piety makes us acquit ourselves with greater respect and zeal devotion adds to this outwardly a serious composed behavior  it is sufficient for a worldly person to be religious piety agrees best with persons who pride themselves in virtue and as to devotion it is the employ of people perfectly recluse  religion is more internal piety is both internal and external devotion is sometimes more external  where there is no integrity there is no religion he who fails in his respect for religious worship fails in piety devotion unless sincere is mocking the most high    0 able skilful learned that knowledge which we can reduce to practice makes us able that which requires speculation makes us skilful that which fills the memory makes us learned  we say an able preacher or lawyer a skilful mathematician or philosopher a learned historian or civilian  able seems to imply something more extensive skilful something more profound learned something more universal  we become able by long experience skilful by deep study learned by great reading      empire kingdom these are names given to different dominions whence princes take the title of emperor or king it is not however in this alone that their difference consists  it appears to me that the word empire conveys an idea of a vast territory composed of various people whereas that of kingdom implies one more bounded and intimates the unity of that nation of which it is formed it is perhaps from this difference of idea that the different denomination of states and the titles their princes enjoy take their rise if it is not the only reason it is at least the common one as we may remark in the empire of germany the empire of russia and in the ottoman empire of whose diversity of people and nations the world is well acquainted on the other hand we see in those states which bear the name of kingdom such as france spain poland etc that the division of provinces does not destroy the unity of the people  there is in kingdoms a uniformity of fundamental laws the difference of particular laws arising from different customs which in no respect hurt the unity of political administration it is from this uniformity or single government that the words king and kingdom take their rise for this reason also though there may be many persons in the administration there is nevertheless but one prince or sovereign minister but it is not the same in empires one part of which is sometimes governed by fundamental laws very different from those by which another part of the same empire is governed this diversity destroys the unity of government and it is the submission of certain chiefs to the command of a general superior that preserves the union of the state it is also from this right of governing that the words emperor and empire are derived hence it is that there are many sovereigns and kingdoms in the same empire  the roman dominion was originally a kingdom being formed of one single people the name empire was not given it till such time as it brought under its subjection other foreign ones who became though in themselves distinct nations members of that state and over whom the romans established one government though they had separate administrations  the advantages we find in the society of a body politic contributes as much on the part of subjects to form kingdoms as the desire of governing on the part of princes it was ambition alone that formed the plan of empires which were established and are supported chiefly by the force of arms      power ability faculty these words are explained and taken here in a moral and literal sense they all signify a disposition in the subject by means of which it is capable of acting or producing an effect but that of power results from supply or liberty of acting ability rises from strength faculty from natural properties  a man without the aids of grace has not even the power of doing good youth is in want of wisdom to deliberate old age of ability to execute the human mind has the faculty of reasoning  our power frequently diminishes by long use age destroys our ability to satisfy the passions though it does not our desires the mind will often lose its faculties by accidents happening to the organs of the body      pleasure delight the idea of pleasure is of a good much more extensive than that of delight because this word relates to a greater number of objects than the other whatever agreeably affects the mind the heart the senses the fortune etc produces pleasure the idea of delight rises upon that of pleasure by force of opinion but is nevertheless a good of much less extent with respect to objects it is limited properly to sensation and has a particular relation to good entertainment  true philosophy finds pleasure in every occupation there cannot be a greater delight than in the true relish of innocent mirth  there is still another sense in which these words are used that in which we say of a person that he gives himself up entirely to pleasures that he enjoys the delights of the country taken in this last sense they have equally as in the other their differences and particular niceties thus pleasures relate more to personal practice such as customs pastimes and recreations delights more to the charms which are furnished by nature art and opulence such as sweet habitations studied conveniences and choice company      content satisfaction content alludes properly to that inward serenity of heart which renders the soul sedate and composed satisfaction relates more to the passions being a change owing to some success in which we hug ourselves  no restless or turbulent man can ever enjoy true content satisfaction hardly ever accompanies immoderate ambition      excursion ramble jaunt excursion supposes a pleasurable expedition to some distant place determined on some time before ramble implies an irregular roving in places unthought of till the time we arrive there by jaunt is understood a walk or journey agreeable to the person who takes it but held in contempt by others or considered as an act of levity  we say innocent excursions wild rambles and imprudent jaunts  excursions are necessary to persons in a sedentary way of life in order to unbend the mind and exercise the body rambling is an evident sign of an unsteady disposition jaunts in parties of pleasure have been often attended with calamitous consequences      alehouse publichouse nothing is more common than the general use of these terms to express one and the same thing but with great impropriety though every alehouse is undoubtedly a publichouse it does not follow that every publichouse is an alehouse publichouse is a more extensive expression implying a house open for the entertainment of the public whereas alehouse is more limited denoting a particular species of publichouses that which is appropriated to the sale of beer thus taverns coffeehouses etc are publichouses but not alehouses  gentlemen frequent many publichouses without any sort of disgrace but it always lessens their character to be seen in an alehouse      lie falsehood contrariety to truth is the general idea of these two words but that of lie supposes always something criminal whereas that of falsehood does not  if questioned in a cause wherein bound to tell the truth we do not we are guilty of a lie if we deviate from truth where there is no such obligation it is no other than a falsehood  lies are always sinful falsehoods many times justifiable a lie is an offense to god and a disgrace to man a beneficial falsehood is preferable to a destructive truth      sea ocean by sea is understood a large body of water opposed to land confined within certain bounds by ocean a much larger body whose utmost verge is not particularly known thus we say the baltic sea the mediterranean sea the adriatic sea but the western ocean the atlantic ocean the pacific ocean so again the wide sea but the vast ocean      social sociable of these two words that of social relates more to a christianlike disposition that of sociable more to a familiar one  it is goodness of heart that makes a man social sweetness of temper that makes him sociable  humanity benevolence beneficence friendship etc are the social virtues goodnature good humor condescension etc are the qualities that render sociable    0 luxury voluptuousness in the general sense of these words luxury implies a giving ones self up to pleasure voluptuousness an indulgence in the same to excess  the luxury of a people is the forerunner of their ruin the voluptuous man wallows in sensuality and is void of the feelings of humanity  besides this distinction there is one far more delicate and refined and which requires some attention to be thoroughly conceived notwithstanding custom has always made use of the word voluptuousness in a bad sense equally with that of luxury it appears to me that it may sometimes be used with propriety in a good one to comprehend this properly it must first be considered that luxury implies gross corporal indulgence only voluptuousness mental as well as corporal thus ebriety epicurism venery etc are each a species of luxury but we may be voluptuous even in things innocent in themselves as in the rapturous enjoyment of a fine prospect the studied delightfulness of a rural retreat  in this sense lust indulged to excess is luxury love indulged to excess voluptuousness      sober temperate abstemious a man may be sober and not temperate temperate yet not abstemious  in that sense in which these words are reputed synonymous sobriety implies present freedom from the power of strong liquor temperance signifies moderation in drinking and by abstemiousness is understood a refraining from all sorts of liquor that may intoxicate  some men who have the character of being sober very little deserve it as their freedom from intoxication is more owing to strength of constitution which resists the force of strong drink than to the virtue of temperance an abstemious person practices the virtue of selfdenial and by a rigid abstinence from all liquors that may hurt him keeps his head clear and his constitution sound  a sober man may drink much and not be affected with it a temperate man drinks little an abstemious man drinks not at all  note by the word drink here is meant the use of strong drink      sharp sour acid these words express different degrees of sourness sharp implies sourness without astringency or a small degree of sourness thus wine beer etc grow frequently sharp by long keeping sour includes in its idea little or no acrimony thus cider vinegar verjuice etc are sour but palatable made so for use by acid is understood a corrosive sour as the acid lemon the acid vitriol etc      unreasonable inconsistent absurd the general idea of these three words is incongruity but that of unreasonable implies rather nonagreeableness to reason that of inconsistent contrariety of act or argument where one part destroys the other that of absurd seems to intimate both  nothing can be more unreasonable than requesting the services of another to his detriment he who complies with such request would act very inconsistently and both would commit the grossest absurdity  he who endeavors to raise his own name by crushing that of another acts unreasonably he who would be thought a man of sense and learning and strives to support that character by a contumelious contempt of others acts inconsistently he who is culpable in either of these particulars acts absurdly      abstinence fast abstinence implies a forbearance from such food as is supposed to pamper the flesh fast a refraining from all sorts of food wednesdays and fridays are appointed by the church as days of abstinence ash wednesday and good friday as fastdays      contiguous adjacent by the word contiguous is understood so situated as to touch by adjacent so lying as having nothing of the same kind between thus one house or one room is contiguous to another but we say an adjacent church the adjacent village  the true sense then of these words is that contiguous implies actual contact adjacent only hard by      benevolence beneficence of these two words one is the intention the other the act benevolence being the desire of doing good beneficence actual goodness  a benevolent man delights in beneficence  providence has sufficiently evinced its love to mankind by planting in our nature a benevolent disposition and rewarding the effect of that disposition beneficence      acquainted familiar intimate a slight or initial knowledge of any one constitutes acquaintance to be familiar requires an acquaintance of some standing intimacy supposes such an acquaintance as is supported by friendship  these words then rise one upon the other by gradation intimacy resulting from close familiarity which proceeds from long acquaintance  those who are apt to be familiar on a slight acquaintance will never acquire any degree of intimacy as forwardness of that sort generally meets with the contempt of mankind      pillar column by the word pillar is understood a supporter of some roof by the word column a particular kind of pillar that which is round thus every column is a pillar though every pillar is not a column  in most buildings where the beauty of the architecture is studied columns are generally insulated whereas square pillars are for the most part set within a wall showing only a fourth or fifth part of their thickness      servitude slavery the state of a hired servant is servitude that of one mancipated is slavery the one is voluntary the other involuntary servitude is a kind of willing bondage if the expression may be admitted slavery is a yoke dreaded by all mankind  servitude is in some measure honorable slavery generally contemptible  all persons strictly speaking are in a state of reputable servitude with respect to one another but slavery has been ever considered as derogatory to the character of man    0 amusement diversion the general idea of these words is innocent recreation but that of amusement implies tranquil entertainment that of diversion tumultuous merriment  cardplaying concerts plays etc are amusements cricket cudgelplaying horseraces etc are diversions  some persons are so quietly inclined as to find great amusement in reading while others are of such a riotous disposition as to imagine all diversion consists in uproar and confusion      satire lampoon satire is general being a poem in which the folly and wickedness of the times are severely censured written with an intent to reform lampoon is a poem also but personal containing invective reflections against one person in particular with a design only to vex  a satire then is commendable a lampoon scurrilous the lash of satire has been often found more beneficial to a state than the scourge of power the writer of a lampoon may be well compared to a be whose sting wounds but slightly and whose malicious act is sure to be punished by the whole swarm      steeple spire tower by these three words is meant a high building raised above the main edifice but that of steeple is more general those of spire and tower more particular  steeple implies the turret of a church be it of what form soever by spire is understood a steeple rising taper to the top by tower is implied a square steeple  spire and tower then are certain kinds of steeples the steeple of st brides church london is a spire the steeple of st andrews a tower  the words steeple and spire are never applied but to churches the word tower is sometimes made use of with respect to other large edifices  in former times palaces and gentlemens seats were commonly built with towers such as the tower at st jamess london the tower at lord rochforts feat at st ofyth essex  spires are generally erected upon towers bells are usually hung in towers weathercocks commonly fixed on spires      religion persuasion the sense in which these words are held as synonymous is that of a certain system of divine faith and worship but that which religion implies seems to be one more general and established that which is understood by persuasion more particular and vague  by persuaston then is meant a deviation from some settled religion  the divine systems of the church of england and of the church of rome are religions those of a presbyterian and a lutheran are persuasions      letter epistle custom has made the word letter of more general use than epistle letter being quite familiar epistle rather pedantic but this is not the only observation i would make letter appears to me more proper when the matter relates to private correspondence epistle when the business is public thus we say letters of friendship letters of business but if these letters relate to public matters or appear in print we may with elegance call them epistles as pauls epistles ovids epistles melmoths epistles      gold golden the present age has made an innovation with respect to these two words converting the substantive gold into an adjective and altering the sense of golden which in reality implies made of gold into that of gilt in this corrupted sense then i am obliged to consider them as such the word gold relates to the metal of which a thing is made that of golden to the hue it bears thus we say a gold ring a gold watch a gold buckle but the golden lion the golden head the golden lamp that these ideas are often confused is very evident as we sometimes hear of a golden cup or a golden ewer should it be said such a one stole a golden cup from the house with the golden lamp we must either imagine that both cup and lamp were of solid gold or that they were only gilt      endeavor effort endeavor is labor directed to some certain end effort is a laborious endeavor  when we would accomplish a design we use our endeavors if we meet with any considerable and unexpected obstacles in the way we apply our utmost efforts      mute silent by mute is understood incapability of speech by silent a voluntary forbearance  in eastern countries nobles have mute attendants silence is a mark of wisdom  a man had sometimes better be absolutely mute than inadvertently betray himself as is frequently the case by too great a volubility and which silence only would prevent      beam rafter though the distinction of these words may be thought useless to the general reader yet to him it is more particularly serviceable they being seldom if ever confused by the carpenter or builder by beam then is meant the main piece of timber that supports the house by rafter the secondary timber which is let into the great beam to make them better understood beams are those timbers that girt the top of a building rafters those that support the tiling      room chamber apartment with respect to the two first room is a general expression chamber a particular one room implies any divided part of a house chamber is a room appropriated to sleep in  by apartment is understood a set of rooms convenient to dwell in  we say a spacious room a snug chamber a commodious apartment  some chambers are so contrived as to conceal the bed and make the room fit to entertain company many families of slender fortune choose rather to live in elegant apartments than in indifferent houses    0 house tenement the present signification of these words is that house means a dwelling distinct by itself tenement part of a house divided off for the use of another family  we say a spacious magnificent house a snug pretty tenement  large houses which the owners find difficult to set to one family are frequently converted into small tenements and let out to many      lodging apartment lodging relates more to a set of rooms appropriated to a family in some private house apartment more to a convenient dwelling in some public edifice  the first or second story of a house let out is called a lodging any particular range of rooms in a large building so allotted as to contain a number of families one over another is called an apartment as the apartments in an hospital the apartments in an inn of court the apartments in a palace  it is in some respect mean to live in a lodging but persons of great fortune have dwelt with credit in apartments      warmth fervency considering these words in a religious sense that of fervency seems to rise upon warmth warmth implying a flame of devotion in opposition to coolness fervency great heat of mind as opposed to coldness  warmth is in some measure necessary it will make us punctual in the exercise of our duty through a sense of gratitude and affection fervency has a dangerous tendency it will if not kept within due bounds drive men into enthusiasm  warmth is the offspring of a good heart fervency of a weak mind  warmth makes the heart beat high in the cause of god fervency will carry us into a vain considence of having some intercourse with the deity      plenty abundance by plenty is understood enough and some little to spare by abundance more than enough or a considerable deal over  he that wants but a yard of cloth and possesses a yard and a quarter has plenty he that needs but one yard and has several may be said to have abundance  a contented man will be satisfied though he should fall short of plenty but the covetous man is still grasping for more even though he enjoys abundance      surmise suspicion surmise is imagination in general without certain knowledge suspicion is imagination of some ill without proof  surmise is often used with respect to things good in themselves suspicion never but with regard to things that are ill  surmise is an imperfect notion or a kind of conjecture rising in a great measure from curiosity suspicion supposes a degree of fear and jealousy concerning things not known  we should never build an opinion upon bare surmise which is at best but a sandy foundation suspicion is in reality its own tormentor raising in the mind a thousand apprehensions which is no easy matter afterward to quell      sequel conclusion sequel is the succeeding part conclusion the close  the sequel continues the conclusion ends  a story is unintelligible without its sequel but not so without its conclusion the conclusion being comprehended in few words the sequel requiring many  the sequel in part forms the story the conclusion puts the finishing stroke to it  before we pass any judgment on what we hear we should attend to the sequel and wait till the conclusion      to disperse scatter the act of spreading abroad is the general idea of these two words but that of disperse seems to imply some sort of order and care that of scatter means to throw about loosely and carelessly  in order to sow a field we disperse the seed in different places he who scatters his wealth without making a proper use of it will one day come to want  to disperse is always voluntary to scatter is frequently involuntary  when a family of children are come to years of maturity they generally disperse themselves into various parts it is almost impossible to carry a load of hay from one place to another without scattering some of it      new fresh recent that which has not been used is new that which is not stale is fresh that which has just happened is recent  we say of clothes that they are new of topics that they are fresh of actions that they are recent  a thought is new by the turn we give it fresh by the sense it expresses recent by the time of its production  new things carry with them a creditable appearance fresh matters are food for tatlers we are more affected with recent stories than with those of long date      expression word these words have been treated of before when that of expression was considered as implying a phrase of speech but there being another sense in which it is used as synonymous with word it may not be unnecessary to show the difference between them and as the distinction is very delicate we must view it with attention  expression then represents the meaning a word expresses the idea which we employ to form that meaning it is in order to use the expression that the word is established the first is natural general and universal among all men the second is arbitrary and different according to the varied custom of the people the yes and the no are always and in all places the same expressions that is they carry the same meaning but that meaning is not expressed by the same words in all languages and on all occasions  we have the gift of expression and the knowledge of words we give a turn and justness to the one we choose and range the others  the production of sense and formation of a proposition are what we expect from an expression but a word is commonly of no other value than to make a part of that sense or of that proposion thus expressions differ among themselves according to the difference of the senses they bear and words differ among themselves either by the simple articulation of the voice or by the difrent ideas they convey a word is no otherwise bad than by its not being in use in the polite world  a variety of expressions proceeds not always from the fertility and extent of the mind an abundance of words enriches not the language unless those words convey an abundance of ideas      not no not barely expresses the negation no strengthens and seems to affirm it the first often denies the thing in part only or with limitation the second denies it always absolutely wholly and without reserve thus we say he has not money he has not patience meaning he is not overburthened with either but when we say he has no money he has no patience we would be understood to say he has none at all  it is on account of this limitation that the word not is generally used in company with those words that mark either the degree of quality or quantity such as much very one and the like  there is not commonly much money to be found in the possession of men of letters the major part of those who frequent divine service are not very devout it often happens that he who has not one single penny in his pocket is much happier than many rich men    0 great sublime these words here are considered in no other sense than as they relate to language in which that of great seems to me to have more relation to the learning or the nature of the subjects we treat of and that of subtime more to the spirit and manner in which we treat them  lock on human understanding is a very great work miltons paradise lost is very sublime one  great or scientific pieces are often starched and discover the labor of the author but sublime pieces though composed with a great deal of art seem always natural  studied words known only to the learned joined to profound and metaphysical reasonings form the great or elevated style expressions equally just and brilliant joined to beautiful thoughts finely and nobly turned constitute the sublime  it is not possible for every work to be great but it may be sublime sublime works however are more rare than great ones      to excel be excellent to excel supposes a comparison is being superior to all of the like kind excludes equals and is applied to all sorts of objects to be excellent is being in the highest degree without any sort of comparison it admits of equals and agrees best with things of taste thus we say that titian excelled in coloring michael angelo in design and that garrick is an excellent actor  persons who excel in any particular art gain a name the more excellent the meats the more dangerous the feasting      lazy indolent a lazy man never goes through with an undertaking an indolent man will undertake nothing the first wants courage and resolution he stops he turns he fears and changes presently the second wants will and emulation one cannot animate or make him sensible  the lazy man is a burden to society the indolent man is an enemy to himself      to name call as much as these words differ in in their meaning they are nevertheless used frequently to express the same idea the absurdity of which is gross we name to distinguish in conversation we call as for help when wanted  the lord called every living creature before adam and he named them  it is not proper to name all things by their names nor call all sorts of people to our assistance      quality talent qualities form the character of persons talents are their ornament the first render them either good or bad and have a great influence over their morals the second make them useful or entertaining and go a great way toward making them esteemed  we may use the word quality either in a good or bad sense but we cannot take that of talent in any other than a good one  man is a mixture of good and bad qualities sometimes so strange as to possess the extremes of each there are persons possessed of such talents as make themselves admired and yet give some pain to others who would be witnesses of them but in this case i should think it more eligible to endure the caprice of the entertaining than the disagreeableness of the tiresome  the qualities of the heart are more essential those of the mind more brilliant talents which are of use in necessity are more necessary those which conduce to entertainment are best rewarded  our qualities render us either beloved or despised our talents make our company coveted  excellent qualities joined to rare talents constitute great worth      to extol praise we extol a person to procure him the esteem of others or raise his reputation we praise him to testify the esteem we have for him or to applaud him  to extol is to say a great deal in the favor of others and ascribe to them great qualities whether they possess them or not to praise is to approve with a kind of admiration whatever they say or do whether they deserve it or no  we extol the abilities of a man we praise his conduct  the word extol supposes that the person of whom we speak and the person to whom we speak are diffrent which the word praise does not  quacks never fail to extol themselves they promise always more than they can perform and pride themselves in an imaginary esteem conceited persons frequently praise themselves and are generally well satisfied with that praise  it is far more ridiculous in my opinion for a man to praise himself than extol himself for we extol ourselves through a desire of having the esteem of others which is a vanity one may look over but when we are guilty of self praise it is done through the great esteem we have for ourselves which is a pride insufferable      darkness obscurity darkness seems to signify something real in opposition to light obscurity is a mere privation of brightness  we say often of darkness that it is thick of obscurity that it is great  considering them in a figurative sense darkness implies a state of life in which we are shut up from the world as the state of a hermit the state of a recluse by obscurity is understood a state of retirement or a state unnoticd as when we retreat into the country far from the observation of the public eye  he who lives in a state of darkness is useless to society and dead as it were to mankind he who lives in a state of obscurity enjoys a serenity unknown to him who revels in the open world      to feel handle we feel lightly we handle with the full hand  we feel a column to know whether it be made of marble or wood we handle stuff to know what strength it has or what body it is of  it often happens that a thing though disagreeable to the eye shall be agreeable to feel there is no pleasure in handling any thing that is rough      translation version translation relates to the turning into modern language version into ancient thus the english bible is a translation but the latin greek arabic and syriac bibles are versions  translations to be perfectly good should be neither more or less ornamented than the originals the ancient versions of scripture have acquired almost as much authority as the hebrew text  a new translation of virgil and horace would still please notwithstanding the many that have appeared the time when the version of the septuagint was made is unknown      vile bad although the first of these words is not in very general use with respect to the sense in which i would here consider it yet it is not so entirely disused but that i may characterise it without fear of impropriety as to the second word it is not here taken in all its significations but in that only in which it is used as synonymous with the first  uselessness and little or no value make a thing vile defect and loss of merit render it bad thence it is we say in a mystic sense that we are vile creatures intimating that we are nothing with respect to god or that he does not stand in need of our services and that we say he is a bad christian who is void of faith or who has through sin lost the grace of baptism  he is a vile subject who is fit for nothing or who cannot be of any service to the community he is a bad subject who will not attempt to do good but gives way to every vicious inclination  a vile man is contemptible and becomes the outcast of the world a bad man is condemnable and draws upon himself the hatred of every honest person  in speaking of useful things as stuffs linen and the like the word vile rises upon that of bad that which has been much used but will still serve upon an occasion is bad that which cannot be used any more or that we cannot use with credit is vile  bad clothes are not always a mark of poverty there is sometimes more pride under a covering of vile rags than under that of gold and purple      matter subject matter is that which we use in the work subject is that on which we work  the matter of a discourse consists in the words in the phrases and in the thoughts the subject is that which we explain by those words those phrases and those thoughts  the reasonings the passages of holy writ the characters of passions and the maxims of morality are the matter of sermons the mysteries of faith and the precepts of the gospel ought to be the subject    0 to mask disguise in order to mask it is necessary to cover the face with a false visage but to disguise it is sufficient to change the common appearance  we mask ourselves to go to a ball we disguise ourselves to bring about an intrigue      view prospect the sight of something distant is the general idea of these words but that of view seems in my opinion to imply a sight more extensive than that of propect thus we say a little or confined prospect but a long or extended view  besides there seems to be less variety in a view than in a prospect thus we say the pleasing prospect of the neighboring villages the fine view of a distant mountain      hovel shed a hovel is a small place indifferently run up with mud walls in order to preserve things from the weather a shed is a supported roof only a place covered overhead but open on the sides generally erected as a dry standingplace for carts or other things  hovels are seldom seen but in country places sheds frequently in towns  the poor in many parts of the kingdom are reduced to the necessity of dwelling in huts very little better than hovels happy is the traveller in bad weather to take shelter even under a shed      oval oblong by oval we mean that which is regularly so by oblong that which resembles the longitudinal section of an egg whether regular or not  tables are frequently made oblong though not exactly oval  we may say with propriety that an oval is oblong though custom will not admit us to invert the expression      mist fog by mist is understood a thin cloud hanging very low or rain so extremely small as not to be perceived in drops by fog is implied a moist vapor near the surface of the land or water so dense as to obscure the sight  the mist falls the fog rises  a mist prevents our seeing things at some distance a fog those immediately before us  some days are so extremely misty as to obstruct prospects others so very foggy as to be unhealthy and mislead the traveller in his way      genteel elegant genteel implies something above the common run elegant means beautiful without grandeur  genteel carries with it the idea of something reputable elegant of something tasty  by a house genteely furnished is understood a house containing every necessary good and creditable by elegantly furnished is meant genteely and in such a manner as to please without elevation  genteel relates more to the neatness and goodness of the furniture elegant more to the disposition of it  a mans notions are discovered in the genteelness of his house his taste in the elegance      to beat strike in order to beat we must redouble the blows but to strike we need give only one  we are never beaten without being struck but we are often struck without being beat  we never beat but with design we often strike by accident  wise men have said that the rod should be always on the back of children those therefore who have the bringing of them up should never think differently however we are to interpret these words no otherwise than alluding to fear not imagining that we are to be constantly beating them for nothing is more opposite to good education than the example of violent conduct and severe discipline the preceptor who strikes his pupil does it oftener through hastiness of temper than design of correction      coward poltron the coward will fire up upon the least offense but proceed no farther the poltron is so meanly spirited as through want of courage to take every insult calmly  the coward draws back the poltron dares not advance  cowards they say will fight when desperate we must not depend on the succor of a poltron      to think study muse we think quietly and orderly to be thoroughly acquainted with our object we study with inquietude and without order to attain our wishes we muse deeply to pass away the time agreeably  the philosopher thinks on the arrangement of his system a person in difficulty studies for expedients how to get out of it the solitary lover muses on his mistress  i have often remarked that obscure things frequently appear clear to those who know not how to think properly they comprehend but are not able to explain it is an act of prudence to study to avert such evils as threaten us the pleasure of musing is perhaps most agreeable but less useful      sign signal the sign makes known and is sometimes natural the signal gives notice and is always arbitrary the appearances of the face are commonly the signs of what passes in the heart the hoisting of a flag in one ship is a signal to another  we make ourselves understood by the deaf by signs the readiest way of making persons understand us at a distance is by signals    0 only alone when speaking of a thing we make use of the word only we mean there is no other of the same kind when that of alone that it is not accompanied with any other  a child that has neither brother or sister is an only child a person when by himself is said to be alone  that thing must be very rare of which we can find only one nothing is more tiresome than to be always alone      love gallantry as different as these words may appear they have nevertheless been and are still frequently used as synonymous when intended to imply courtship it may not be then unnecessary to point out their peculiar ideas  love is more sanguine than gallantry having for its object the person whom we are studious to please through a view of possessing and whom we love as much on her account as our own it takes possession of the heart suddenly and owes its birth to a certain something which enchains the sentiments and draws the esteem without any examination or information gallantry is more sensual than love having for its object the sex we enter into intrigues in hopes of enjoying it and love more on our own account than on that of our mistress it acts upon the senses much more than upon the heart and is more owing to constitution and complexion than to the force of beauty  the one has a power of making those persons agreeable in our eyes who study to please the object of our love provided they in no respect raise our jealousy the other engages us to keep an eye upon all those who are capable either of forwarding or hurting our designs and to watch them as we would a rival taking every advantage within our reach  the first leaves us not the liberty of choice it commands in the beginning as a master and reigns afterward as a tyrant till we are accustomed to its chains by length of time or till they are broken by the efforts of powerful reason or the caprice of continued vexation the second suffers sometimes another passion to get before it reason and interest often hold the bridle and make it give way to our situation and affairs  love attaches us solely to one person and delivers up our heart without reserve so as to engage it wholly and make every other object of what beauty or merit soever indifferent to us gallantry rivets us generally to all persons who are either beautiful or agreeable and unites us to those who make the least returns to our eagerness and desire in such a manner however as leaves us no liking for others  it appears to me that love delights in difficulties so far from being weakened by obstacles they generally increase it and we make it one of our most serious engagements as for gallantry it banishes formality is less accustomed to difficulty and is often entered into merely for amusement it is for this reason we observe more spirit of gallantry in men than love for it is rare to find a first love followed by a second and i doubt whether ever it can be said by a third but gallantries are sometimes without number and succeed each other till that age arrives when their source is dried up  there is always honesty in love but it is troublesome and capricious we consider it nowadays as a distemper or as a weakness of mind in gallantry there is a degree of knavery but it is free and good humoured and is become the taste of the age  love designs on the imagination the flattering idea of eternal happiness in the entire and constant possession of the object we love gallantry fails not to paint there the agreeable image of a singular pleasure in the enjoyment of the object we pursue but neither the one nor the other copies after nature experience showing us that their colors however agreeable are equally deceitful all the difference we find is that love being more serious the unfaithfulness of its pencil gives greater offense and the recollection of the pain it has given in seeing it so ill rewarded creates our disgust whereas gallantry being more wanton we are less sensible of the fallacy of its coloring and the vain notions we have of being arrived at the end of its designs reconcile any disappointments we may have met with  in love it is the heart which principally tastes the pleasure the mind making itself a slave without any regard and the satisfaction of the senses contributing less to the sweet enjoyment than a certain contentedness of soul which produces the charming idea of being in the possession of what we love and receiving the most sensible proofs of a tender return in gallantry the heart is less affected with the object the mind being more free to indulge itself and the senses more attentive to their own satisfaction partake the pleasure with greater equality voluptuousness contributing more to its enjoyment than the delicacy of sentiments  when we are too much tormented by the caprices of love we endeavor to disentangle ourselves and become indifferent when we are too fatigued by the exercises of gallantry we take a resolution to desist and become sober  excess makes love degenerate into jealousy and gallantry into libertinism in the first case we are subject to trouble of mind in the second we are in danger of destroying our health  upon the whole love is generally justifiable gallantry always blameable      to lower let down we make use of the word lower with respect to diminishing the height of things or to certain motions of a body we lower a beam we lower the sails of a ship we lower a building we lower the eyes the head we use the expression let down with regard to things made to cover others and which being lifted up leave them uncovered we let down the lid of a trunk we let down the eyelids we let down the lappets or the gown  the contrary of to lower is to raise that of to let down is to lift up  to lower is in use in the neuter sense to let down is not  rivers lower in the summer tall persons are obliged to lower their heads when they pass through small doorways it is dangerous to let ourselves down as advantages are frequently taken of it it is not a princes letting himself down even to familiarity that acquires him the reputation of being good but the mildness and equity of his government      plant herb a plant is any vegetable production arising from seed but seems confined to such as are not very large thus saplings are the largest that should be called plants herbs are those plants whose stalks are soft and have no woody substance in them such as grass hemlock etc  the knowledge of plants is both useful and entertaining there are many medicinal qualities in herbs      to grow increase things grow by the nourishment they receive they increase by the addition that is made to them of the same kind corn grows the harvest increases  the better we manure the land the faster the trees grow and the more our revenues increase  the word grow signifies only the augmentation independent of that which occasions it the word increase gives us to understand that that augmentation is caused by a fresh quantity which casually joins it thus to say that the river grows larger is to say only that the water is risen without expressing that it is become so by the arrival of an additional quantity of water but to say that the river is increased is to say that it is swelled by a fresh quantity of water this distinction is extremely delicate it is for this reason therefore that we make use of the words grow and increase indifferently on many occasions where that delicacy of choice is of no great importance as in the example i have mentioned for we may say with equal propriety that a river either grows larger or increases although each of these words has its particular idea but there are other occasions where it is proper and sometimes even necessary to pay a regard to the peculiar idea and make some kind of choice between these terms according to the strength of meaning we would give our thoughts for example when we would be understood to say speaking of the passions that they are in our nature and that the nourishment we take to support life at the same time gives strength to them the use of the word grow would be elegant otherwise we might employ that of increase with respect either to the passions or the talents of the mind  the passions in general receive birth and grow with the man but there are some which exist but for a time and which after having increased to a certain age diminish and disappear with the powers of nature there are others which last the whole life and which are always increasing so as to be stronger in old age than in youth  love which forms itself in infancy grows with age true courage never brags it increases at the sight of danger ambition grows proportionably as our wealth increases  it is easy to see through all these examples that one of these words will agree in some places in which the other will not for what person is so little delicate in expressing himself as not to perceive by his natural taste if not on reflection that there is more propriety in saying ambition grows proportionably as our wealth increases than to say ambition increases proportionably as our wealth grows if it is not difficult to perceive this delicacy it is to explain the reason of it to do this i must express myself a little metaphysically and have recourse to such ideas as may enable me to explain it these ideas however shall be no other than the proper ones since wealth consists in many different things which unite themselves in the possession of one single person the word increase which as i have said before denotes the addition of a fresh quantity agrees better with it than that of grow which precisely marks the augmentation of one single thing caused by some sort of nourishment for this same reason the word grow agrees best with ambition it being a single passion to which wealth serves as a kind of nutriment to support it and make it act with more force and ardour  corporeal things grow by an inward and mechanical addition which is in effect their proper and real nutriment they increase by the bare outward addition of a fresh quantity of the same matter spiritual things grow by a kind of nourishment considered in a figurative sense they increase by the addition of degrees they bear  an egg does not begin to grow in the ovaria till it teems that is till fruitfulness has made it fit to receive nourishment nor does it leave the body till its bulk is sufficiently increased to cause an alteration in the membrane that encloses it  our pride grows in proportion as we exalt ourselves and increases sometimes till we become contemptible in the eyes of the world      to rise get up to change our posture from recumbent to erect is the true meaning of the verb to rise whereas to get up implies rather to climb thus we rise from the ground we rise from our bed we rise from our seat we get up stairs we get up a ladder      copy model the sense in which these words are reputed synonymous does not instantly present itself to the reader the first glance of the eye that shows us a copy made after an original work and a model made as the original of a work throws them so far distant from each other as not to admit the least similitude but a second reflection will make us sensible that custom has used these two words under one common idea on many occasions and that to denote equally the original after which a work is made and the work made after the original copy having been understood as well as model to mean the first work by which we form the second and model as well as copy the second work formed after the first thus then they have been considered as in a manner doubly synonymous but they have each their peculiar ideas as follow  in the first sense copy should be never used but with respect to the manuscript of an author upon which the printer works model may be used on every other occasion as well with respect to morality as the arts  a proof sheet is not often very incorrect unless the copy is so booksellers who often refuse to purchase excellent copies frequently buy bad ones at too great a price there is no perfect model of virtue i should imagine that the arts and sciences would gain more ground if artists and authors would pursue more their own genius than imitate the models they meet with  in the second sense copy is used for painting model for relief a copy ought to be faithful a model just the second of these words seems to suppose a greater resemblance than the first  some copies are so extremely well performed as to be little inferior to the originals models of antiquity are frequently more expressive than modern originals      precision abstraction the common idea of these two words is that of a separation made by the force of the mind in the consideration of objects but difficult as it is to find out their peculiar ideas and determine their respective characteristics i have attempted it in the best manner i am able  precision then separates things distinct in themselves in order to prevent the confusion which arises from a jumble of ideas abstraction if i may use the expression separates things that are in themselves inseparable in order to consider them apart independent one of another the first is the effect of the justness and clearness of the understanding which prevents our adding any thing that is useless or foreign to the subject we treat of consequently it will agree in every circumstance either with respect to affairs or sciences the second is the effort of a metaphysical mind which removes from the point of view all that we would detach from the subject it in some respect mutilates but sometimes contributes to the discovery of truth and sometimes draws it into error we may however use it but with care  it appears to me that precision is more applicable to things which may not only be considered apart but may be conceived to be one without the other such as for example alms and charity and abstraction more particularly to things which may indeed be considered apart but which cannot be conceived to be one without the other as body and size thus the design of precision is to prevent a wandering from the subject removing for that purpose all that is foreign to it and that of abstraction to obviate our entering into the utmost extent of it considering only one part without any regard to the other  there is no science more certain or more clear than that of geometry it making very exact precisions there are however certain metaphysical abstractions blended with it which make geometricians fall into errors equally with others not indeed when size and quantity are in question but with respect to physics  our ideas cannot be too precise but it is sometimes dangerous to have them too abstracted the first is the surer way of arriving at the truth in science and our aim in affairs whereas the second often puts us farther from both  precision is the gift of nature receiving its birth with the mind those who are endowed with it are excellently qualified for conversation we listen to them with pleasure because they listen to us in return they understand what is said to them equally as they make themselves understood abstraction is the fruit of study produced by profound application those who are familiar with it talk of common things sometimes with too great refinement simple and natural subjects are in their conversation very difficult to comprehend in the manner they speak of them  precise ideas embellish common language and make it in my opinion sublime abstracted ideas are very tiresome they seem to me to be of little use except in the schools or in certain learned debates  we express by precise ideas the most simple and most sensible truths but we cannot prove them otherwise than by ideas very abstracted      justness precision justness prevents our running into errors precision removes every thing that is useless  the precision of discourse is a common mark of the justness of the mind      astronomer astrologer the astronomer is thoroughly acquainted with the course and motion of the celestial bodies the astrologer reasons upon their influence the first observes the state of the heavens marks the order of time the eclipses and revolutions which arise from laws established by the first spring of nature in that immense number of spheres of which the universe consists and hardly ever errs in his calculations the second foretells events casts nativities prognosticates rain cold heat and all the variations of the weather but seldom if ever calculates to any purpose the one explains what he knows and merits the esteem of the learned the other vends his imaginations and seeks the admiration of the vulgar  we apply ourselves to astronomy through a desire of knowledge we dive into astrology from disquietude about events to come  the generality of people look upon astronomy as a science of mere curiosity and of little utility not reflecting that its object is the arrangement of seasons the regulation of time and the various motions of the heavenly bodies all which is of great service to agriculture to the proper ordering of every thing in civil and political life and is the necessary groundwork of geography and the art of navigation but when on such reflections they come to know that without this science history and chronology would be nothing but confusion perpetually contradicting each other on account of the different manner in which different nations regulate their days and years they would pay that respect to astronomy and its professors as their merit deserves astrology is at present much less in vogue than it was formerly either because men are grown less credulous that the love of truth is more the taste of the learned part of mankind than the desire of dazzling or imposing upon the world or because the brilliancy of reputation does not in this age depend so much upon the number of fools we make as upon the approbation of the discerning and the wise    0 attachment passion devotion although the word attachment may sometimes be used with respect to things bad in themselves it is however applied with more propriety when an honest or moderate passion is in question than either of the two others as for example we are attached to our duty to our friends to our families and to virtuous women whom we esteem that of passion is more applicable with respect to things less approved or when they are carried to excess thus men are said to have a passion for gaming for women etc as to the word devotion though i have ranked it here as most agreeable to the other two substantives the idea it is supposed to convey is best comprehended by the preterite of the verb devote the substantive devotion being very rarely used in this sense by it then is understood an implicit obedience or a perfect disposition to conform in every thing thus we say a man is devoted to his prince to his master to his benefactor to a lady who has acquired an absolute empire over him  attachment is strong passion is violent devotion has no reserve  the first unites us to what we love the second to what we thirst after and the third makes us submit to the will of those we are desirous of serving  the manners of the present age have banished from the laws of friendship all attachment contrary to interest we dare not confess a passion for any thing through fear of censure we often observe that those persons who devote themselves to others in expectation of future advantage are frequently disappointed  life would not be agreeable without some attachment a passion for any one thing generally gives as much pain as pleasure it is difficult to please the great without devoting ourselves entirely to their will      in love lover it is sufficient to regard with passionate affection in order to be said with propriety that we are in love but we must testify that affection in order to be called a lover  we become in love with a woman whose beauty affects the heart we become her lover by waiting on her  variety of tender sentiments crowd into the breast of a man in love passionate airs appear with caution in the behavior of a lover  we are often very much in love without daring to appear a lover we frequently declare ourselves a lover without ever being in love  it is always the passion that constitutes our being in love of which the possession of the object is the only end we propose reason and interest may form the lover of whom an honest establishment or some particular advantage is the chief aim or tendency  it is very rare to be in love with two persons at the same time there is none that i ever heard of except phillis of siro who was so much in love with two men that she could not give the preference or her company to either one or the other but it is not very rare to find a man at the same time the lover of many mistresses which they continue to be frequently to the very hour of marriage we may also be in love with one person and the lover of another i speak of that case where interest engages us to the one whilst we sigh in secret for her whom it is not convenient for us to marry  assiduity finds opportunity to favor the designs of a man in love riches give the lover a great advantage over his rivals      absent inattentive these two words equally express want of attention but with this difference that it is our own inward ideas occupying us so fully as to prevent our attention to any other thing that offers which renders us absent whereas it is some fresh outward object attracting our attention in such a manner as to turn it from what we at first gave it to or from what we ought to give it to that makes us inattentive when these faults are become habitual they are very inconvenient in our commerce with the world  we are absent when we think not of any present object or any thing that is said to us we are inattentive when we pay more regard to any other object than to that which is proposed to us or when we listen to any other conversation than to what is addressed to us  very studious persons and those who have great affairs upon their hands or are endued with strong passions are more apt to be absent than others their internal ideas and designs quite engrossing them young people are the most apt to be inattentive a mere nothing being sufficient to amuse and divert their attention  our absence of mind is owing to thoughtfulness our inattention to curiosity  the mind of an absent man is never where he himself is nothing round him makes the least impression on him he is often at athens or rome in the midst of london or paris and frequently muses upon politics or geometry while the conversation perhaps runs upon love or gallantry the mind of an inattentive man is always present with him is caught by every thing he either sees or hears he quits his attention to one thing in order that he may attend to another listening to all that is said both on the right and left he frequently understands not thoroughly or comprehends but in part which makes him liable to take things sometimes in a quite opposite sense to what they are meant  the absent man cares little for conversation the inattentive man loses the fruit of it when we are in company with the former we had best give ourselves up to silent meditation when with the latter we had better wait for their attention till every other object is out of their way  a new passion if strong seldom fails to render us absent we can scarce help being inattentive when listening to a tiresome story or when we hear on the other side something more interesting      to conduct guide lead the two first of these words suppose a superiority of light which the last does not but on the other hand the last carries in its idea a degree of credit and ascendancy entirely foreign to the other two  we conduct and guide those who know not the way we lead those who cannot or care not to go by themselves  in the literal sense it is properly speaking the head that conducts the eye that guides and the hand that leads  we conduct an affair we guide a traveller we lead an infant  it requires understanding to conduct in business politeness should be our guide in all proceedings taste should lead the way in pleasures  we are conducted step by step that we may do exactly what is necessary we are guided in roads to prevent our losing the way we are lead to the knowledge of people in order to procure their acquaintance  wise men do not conduct themselves by the light of others so much as by their own an attentive perusal of the gospel is sufficient to guide us in the way of salvation it is great weakness to suffer ourselves to be lead in all our actions by the will of another sensible persons will indeed consult a friend in matters of doubt but they make their determinations themselves      to fortify garrison we fortify a town in strengthening it against attacks by walls and works we garrison it by placing soldiers in it to defend it  we are said to fortify strongly to garrison largely  a town without a soldier or any one inhabitant may be fortified but cannot be garrisoned  some fortified places require a greater number of men to garrison them than others      entire complete a thing is entire when it is neither mutilated broken or divided but when all its parts are together as they ought to be it is complete when it wants nothing but has every thing that is necessary  the first of these words relates more to that totality of parts which constitutes the whole of a thing the second more to that totality which contributes to its accidental perfection  small families in the country occupy entire houses but in london they have scarcely complete apartments      disgraceful scandalous both these words express the effect of those actions that hurt the reputation of those who commit them with this difference that a disgraceful action is an obstacle to glory loses us the esteem and draws on us the contempt of the honest whereas a scandalous action is a shameful blot in our life destroys our honor and draws on us the hatred of the just  he who has the folly or the misfortune to do any thing disgraceful should be very careful not to give himself any unbecoming airs when we have been guilty of any thing scandalous the best thing we can do is to hide ourselves entirely from the eyes of the world  nothing is more disgraceful to men than meanness of spirit nor any thing more so to women than gallantry carried to excess nothing is more scandalous to all sorts of people than to be punished according to the sentence of public justice      reserved modest the advantage of these two qualities is confined to the person who possesses them they contribute to his perfection and are nothing to others but an object of speculation which merits their approbation but is sometimes injurious to their satisfaction  we are reserved in our words and actions taking too great a liberty is the fault in opposition when that liberty is carried to excess and we are in no respect reserved it becomes impudence we are modest in our desires in our gestures and in our dress there are three kinds of modesty those of the heart the mind and the body but their opposite vices are not all expressed by the word immodesty which denotes only that which regards the body proceeding from the indecency of gestures and clothes that vanity which we assume in giving ourselves bold and unbecoming airs is the vice in opposition to modesty of mind that which is contrary to modesty of heart is immoderate ambition which makes us covet all that comes in our way and all that we can possibly attain  reservedness is good at all times but it is absolutely necessary in public and in company with our superiors any liberty they may seem to wink at giving some degree of offense for they reserve to themselves a certain title to respect the failure of which they consider as an unpardonable fault modesty is an ornament to persons who have some pretense for carrying their head higher than others and to those who are possessed of some known and distinguished merit but to all other persons it is an indispensable virtue and a quality without which they cannot appear becoming or avoid ridicule      ashamed bashful it is the reproach of conscience that makes us ashamed but the sentiments of modesty that make us bashful both one and the other throw a color into the face but when we are ashamed we redden when bashful we blush  we need never boast or be ashamed of our birth which is a mark only of pride but it is praiseworthy in all ranks of people both high and low to be ashamed of their faults although bashfulness is a virtue there are nevertheless occasions when it would pass for weakness and timidity      to finish cease leave off we finish by putting the last hand to a work we cease in quitting it entirely we leave off in discontinuing  to finish a discourse properly we should do it just before it begins to grow tiresome we ought to cease from our pursuits as soon as we discover them to be useless we should not leave off work but to refresh ourselves that we may begin again with fresh spirits and more vigor  man is born to trouble he has no sooner finished one affair than another succeeds he may indeed seek repose and tranquillity but providence will not permit him in this life to cease from labor and if want of spirits or fatigue induces him sometimes to leave off his work it is not for any length of time he is presently obliged to return to his task and continue his employ  that is certainly a good maxim which says we should not begin a thing which we cannot finish but that in my opinion is much better which forbids our ceasing from one work in order to begin another without necessity obliges us when our mind is employed it is necessary sometimes to leave off not at that time when the imagination full of fire finds itself best capable of its task but only at the first instant we perceive it flag it being wrong either to stop it in its career or attempt to drive it when it stops  persons who never finish their stories cease talking or leave off are as little fit for conversation as those who never speak a word   00 to invent find out we invent new things by the force of imagination we find out things that are hidden or unknown by examination and study the one denotes the fruitfulness of the mind the other the penetration  it is the principle of mechanics to invent tools and machines of physics to find out causes and effects  the ventilator was invented by dr hales harvey found out the circulation of the blood   0  joy gaiety joy is in the heart gaiety in the manners the one consists in the sweet sentiments of the soul the other in the agreeable situation of the mind  it sometimes happens that the possession of a good from which we expected a great deal of joy gives us a great deal of uneasiness it is often owing to a turn of imagination only that the bitterest tears are succeeded by the greatest gaiety   0  project design a project is a plan or an arrangement of means in order to execute a design the design is what we propose to execute  we commonly say of projects that they are fine of designs that they are great  the beauty of projects depends upon their order and magnificence the grandeur of designs rises from the advantage and glory they may procure we should not suffer ourselves to be dazzled with the beauty of the one or the grandeur of the other for practice does not often agree with speculation the admirable order of a system and the advantageous idea which we form from it do not always prevent projects from running aground or put designs out of the possibility of failing  the experience of all ages teaches us that heads fruitful in great designs and excellent projects are frequently chimerical  the word project is taken also for the thing we even propose to execute as well as that of design but though these words considered in that sense are more nearly synonymous we shall nevertheless find a difference very conspicuous to those who have any delicacy of taste the following is such as i am able to discover  it appears to me that project relates to something more distant design to something more near we make projects for the time to come we form designs for the time present the first is more vague the other more determined  the project of an avaritious man is to enrich himself his design is to amass money  a good minister of state has no other project than the glory of his prince and the happiness of the subject a good general studies as much to conceal his own designs as discover those of his enemy  the union of all the states of europe into one single republic for general government and the discussion of their particular interests without changing the interior government peculiar to each of them was a noble project of henry the ivth of france but perhaps more difficult to execute than the design of universal monarchy in which spain was at that time busied   0  to oblige engage to oblige implies rather something of force to engage rather something agreeable duty and necessity oblige us promises and good manners engage us  convenience often obliges those who are abroad in the world to do things they very much dislike complaisance engages those who are not very choice in their company sometimes to enter upon bad actions   0  also likewise also relates more to number and quantity its proper office is to add and to augment  love is not only liberal but also prodigal  likewise is used with most propriety when it relates to similitude or comparison its particular office is to denote the conformity and equality of things  when the body is sick the mind is so likewise politeness is not only to be met with in london but likewise in country places   0  upright up we are upright when we are neither crooked or stooping we are up when upon our feet  a graceful air requires us to be upright respect makes us sometimes hold ourselves up   0  flags colors by the word flags we understand ensigns hoisted upon the top of towers castles or churches the word colors implies the jack ensign and pendant of a ship or the standard of a regiment  the arms of england are generally painted upon flags the union upon colors  the first for the most part is used in the singular number the second never we say the flag of a fort the colors of a regiment english flags except those on which the arms of the country are painted are commonly of one color such as white blue etc but colors are of many  flags are hung out on days of public rejoicing and frequently hoisted as signals great respect is usually paid to the colors of a regiment as military honor seems there to be chiefly centred   0  trench ditch a trench is either a channel made in lands by digging out the earth in order to carry off the water or earth thrown up in order to defend soldiers in their approach to a town or to guard a camp ditch is a trench cut in the ground between two fields in order to separate them  the earth dug from trenches that serve as drains is generally spread so as to leave no heap the earth dug from ditches is usually thrown up into a bank on one side  trenches are commonly regular ditches are often irregular  the largeness of a ditch is determined by the wideness of the trench   0  fine delicate to conceive things that are fine we need only sufficient comprehension but it requires taste to conceive that which is delicate the first is within the reach of many persons the second but of few  a fine discourse is sometimes usefully repeated to those who do not at first comprehend it but he who perceives not the delicate at first glance will never perceive it we may seek the one but must catch the other  the word fine is of more extensive use we apply it equally with respect to the strokes of ill will as to those of good the application of the word delicate is more rare it agrees not with any thing malicious but is used with most propriety with respect to things in themselves flattering thus we say a fine satire a delicate encomium      steadiness constancy resolution steadiness prevents our varying and supports the heart against levity and curiosity which diversity of objects may produce it rises from preference and justifies choice constancy prevents our changing and furnishes the heart with resources against being disgusted or tired with the same object it results from perseverance and gives a luster to attachment resolution prevents our giving way and endues the heart with strength to resist the attacks it meets with it springs from resistance and throws a brightness upon victory  rakes pride themselves more in being fickle than in the steadiness of their engagements if the affections of the ladies do not last for ever it is less owing to a want of constancy to the persons they love than to a want of resolution in the object of their affections    0 to conceal dissemble disguise we conceal by a profound secret that which we would not have known we dissemble by reserve that which we would not have appear we disguise by contrary appearances that which we would not lay open to the penetration of others  it requires care and attention to conceal art and cleverness to dissemble labor and cunning to disguise  he who would conceal throws as it were a veil over himself that he may not betray himself through indiscretion he who would dissemble throws a veil over the eyes of others that what he does or says may not fall within the reach of their knowledge he who would disguise never opens himself any otherwise than to elude  were we to enter into affairs of interest or policy we should always conceal our designs often dissemble and sometimes disguise them with respect to matters which concern the heart we should be more frank  it is sufficient to conceal from those who cannot see without some additional light we must dissemble with those who can see without any such accessory brightness but it is necessary to disguise thoroughly from those who not content to piece through the darkness that opposes examine into that light with which we would dazzle them  when we have not resolution to correct our faults we should at least have wisdom to conceal them that maxim of louis the xith of france which says in order to know how to reign we should know how to dissemble is very just even with respect to domestic government when the necessity of circumstances and the nature of affairs require us to disguise it is political but when urged to it through an inclination to cheat or shuffle it is knavish      to adjust reconcile to adjust supposes some dispute or disagreement to reconcile supposes only some distance or difference  we adjust matters we reconcile minds  it seems impossible to adjust the liberties of the gallic church with the pretensions of the court of rome sooner or later one must necessarily destroy the other for it will always be difficult to reconcile the maxims of their parliaments with the opinions of the consistory  we use the word adjust with respect to opinions which oppose one another and that of reconcile with respect to passages that seem to contradict each other  want of justness in the mind is what commonly prevents schoolmen from adjusting their disputes a precise knowledge of the value of every word in all the different circumstances wherein they may be used would go a great way toward reconciling authors      to bring fetch to bring implies conveying a thing ourselves from one place to another in opposition to the verb send to fetch implies going to a place in order to bring  he who fetches a thing is always supposed to bring it but he who brings it is not always supposed to fetch it thus we cannot fetch without bringing but we may bring without fetching  if we send for a workman in any branch of business in order to make or repair he naturally brings his tools with him should he leave any behind through forgetfulness he is obliged to go back and fetch them      to swallow gulp in the literal sense these words are more nearly synonymous than in the figurative yet even in that they will admit of some distinction we gulp in order to swallow this however is not the only difference by swallowing we understand taking down the throat simply by gulping we mean sucking down eagerly or without intermission  with respect to eating swallowing carries in its idea the act of chewing gulping does not  the glutton will gulp down a greater quantity of food in five minutes than a moderate eater would swallow in half an hour  in the figurative sense gulping rather implies a difficulty of swallowing  we are all too apt to swallow flattery and as fulsome as it may possibly be there are some vain persons that will make a shift to gulp it down      detraction defamation injuring the reputation is the general idea of these two words but that of detraction implies the taking off from a mans good name defamation the giving him a bad one were we to be silent when asked the character of a worthy man it would be detraction were we to vilify him by declaring him guilty of infamous practices it would be defamation  defamation is punishable by human laws detraction is not  the one is an open and scurrilous way of injuring the reputation the other a close and demure one  there are those accustomed to detraction who would fly the thoughts of defamation little imagining that both are equally bad being two different means only working to the same end      meager lean in that sense in which these two words are reputed synonymous meager signifies want of flesh lean want of fat  meagerness supposes a waste of body owing either to a bad constitution or a scarcity of food leanness supposes no want of flesh being opposed only to corpulency or fatness  a man may be lean yet not meager  the lean are usually strong the meager commonly weak  the first is generally a mark of beggary the second frequently denotes the person accustomed to labor  activity attends the lean indolence the meager many persons if possible would choose to be lean but none would care to be meager      sailor seaman mariner these words denote persons who live by the sea or practice navigation but sailor in my opinion is used with most propriety with respect to the common men or in the sea phrase those before the mast seaman agrees best with regard to the superior class of the ships company such as the officers boatswain gunner etc mariner relates more to chose who gain their livelihood at sea but who are generally their own masters as fishermen  sailors are ignorant of navigation and are they who work the vessel by the direction of others seamen are supposed to understand it and are they who generally direct it mariners are supposed to have no greater knowledge of the art than such as is sufficient to serve their purpose working their vessels themselves  both sailors and seamen take long voyages whereas mariners do little else than coast  we say an able sailor an expert seaman a bold mariner  the great hardships the poor sailors undergo one would imagine should be sufficient to endear them to their country it is not every captain of a ship that is a good seaman mariners earn their bread very hard they not only being obliged to work more than other men but are in daily danger of their lives      grot grotto though these words are evidently one and the same grot being no more than an abbreviation of grotto yet custom has made them expressive of different ideas  grot then seems to denote something more natural grotto something more artificial  the first is in effect the work of nature the second the work of art  the one implies a cool cave appropriated to pleasure stony rough irregular and overgrown with moss the oother a pleasurable cave or room ornamented with shellwork  we say a pretty grot a beautiful grotto it is as much out of the power of the most ingenious artist to make a grotto any thing equal to a grot as it is for art to rival nature      cave cell the sense in which these words are esteemed synonymous is that of the retired dwelling of some religious person  cave is a habitation under ground made either by art or nature cell is some little dwelling raised above ground  we dig a cave we build a cell  hermits or such persons as choose to seclude themselves from the world bury themselves in caves they may chance to meet with or wear out their lives in cells remote from public view      broad wide by broad is understood extended each way as broadcloth a broadbrimmed hat by wide is meant broad to a certain degree as three inches wide four feet wide  broad seems to be confined to things of less extent wide to those of greater thus we say a broad bean a broad face a broad back a broad apron a broad tablecloth but a wide room a wide ditch a wide field the wide ocean    0 school academy school implies a place of discipline and instruction academy a place where the sciences are taught  school seems appropriated to the teaching of children academy to that of youth  in schools are taught languages writing music dancing etc in academies natural and experimental philosophy geography geometry astronomy ethics rhetoric etc  schools begin the education academies finish it  children who learn to read with a tone at school seldom get the better of it even when they are grown up academies are the nurseries of learned men      blessing benediction benediction appears to me to be limited to the decretory pronounciation of happiness blessing is a more general expression intimating the various means of happiness  religious men find as much comfort in the benediction of the church as others experience in the blessings of life  blessing seems to intimate divine favor benediction that which is human  we say the blessing of god the benediction of the priest  heaven showers down its blessings upon the virtuous the benediction of a good man is a very desirable thing      ambassador resident the general idea of these words is that of a minister representing the person of his sovereign sent from one court to another but ambassador seems to be superior to that of resident  the first are generally men of greater rank the second of less  ambassadors are not supposed to stay long at the court to which they are sent their office being to transact some state affairs between the two powers residents are supposed to reside for some considerable time as a testimony of the good harmony between the two states  the earl of northampton was sent from london ambassador to venice in the year      during the time that mr murray was there as resident      dregs sediment dregs are gross a sediment is fine  after the dregs are taken away there will frequently remain a sediment  we say the dregs of wine the dregs of melted tallow but the sediment of water the sediment of urine      lofty high lofty seems to carry with it an idea of magnificence which high does not thus we say a lofty room the lofty cedar but a high house a high tree  with respect to other things it is the same thus it is in the power only of a severe fit of sickness or a heavy stroke of adversity to lower the high looks of the great and the lofty imaginations of the proud      betwixt between if any two words in the english language may be said to carry the same meaning these in some respect may as a studied delicacy here is not immediately essential custom has made no other distinction than that of using the word between on every occasion as being softer on the tongue and almost banishing the use of the word betwixt as being much harsher but as i deviate from the common opion and think there is no word so trivial but the choice of it on particular occasions may be necessary i hope i may not be condemned as too nice with respect to the word before us  betwixt then appears to me to be used with most propriety when that which is in the middle is as it were embraced by the other two between when that which is in the middle is at some distance from the other two thus to speak properly with respect to a house standing in a row we should use the word betwixt as for example the house i dwell in stands betwixt two high houses but with respect to a tree standing in a line with others we should use the word between as for instance the oak tree i mentioned stands between two elms      middle midst a thing is in the middle when it stands at an equal distance from the two extremes it is in the midst when it stands in the center of a great many  thus we say in the middle of a pond in the midst of a crowd  there cannot be a more tormenting situation than to hang in the middle between hope and fear providence sometimes has taken a man out from the midst of misfortunes when he has seen no visible way of escaping      marshy boggy marshy lands are those that lie low and are watery boggy lands are those where there are many quagmires  in walking over the first we sink not deeper than our ankles in passing over the second we may entirely be lost  marshy lands frequently produce fine meadows boggy lands are wholly useless      rough rugged roughness is a small degree of ruggedness ruggedness a great degree of roughness  smooth is the reverse of rough level the reverse of rugged  we say a rough hand a rugged road      ray beam a beam seems to me to be more powerful than a ray casting a greater degree of light and heat  we say rays of light beams of the sun by the first of which expressions we mean that those are rays which shine early in the morning by the second that those are beams which gleam at noon  we frequently apply the epithet cheerful to the word ray that of scorching to the word beam  the rays of the sun being separated by a prism is the original of colors the beams of the fun collected into one point by means of a unequal lens will set fire to any thing they touch    0 clergyman parson there are three ranks of clergymen below that of a dignitary viz parson vicar and curate parson is the first meaning a rector or he who receives the great tithes of a benefice by the word parson then is implied one of a particular class of clergy whereas by the word clergyman is understood any person ordained to serve at the altar  parsons are always priests many clergymen are only deacons  every bishop dean etc is a clergyman though not always a parson  as the general and indiscriminate use of these two words has rendered it necessary i have pointed out the distinction that should be made between them but am of of opinion as custom has thrown into the word parson an idea of contempt it would be better not to use it at all but when we have occasion to point out one of that class of clergymen who enjoy the great tithes of a living to substitute in its room that of rector      suffocated smothered choked death brought on by a stoppage of breath is the general idea of these three words but that of suffocated implies an extinction of life occasioned by being in a place where we cannot breathe that of smothered by being in a place where we are not suffered to breathe that of choked by having the windpipe closed  thus men are frequently suffocated by smoke persons raving mad when in curable are sometimes smothered between two feather beds malefactors when hanged are choked  it has happened that travelers by falling into bogs have been sometimes suffocated before assistance could be had children are frequently smothered in bed through the carelessness of nurses persons are often choked by eating too greedily  the words smother and choke are often used in a figurative sense the word suffocate never  we smother a flame we choke a passage  it is an act of charity to smother the failings of another when interest is predominant it is sure to choke up all the avenues to the heart which would otherwise be open to the cries of distress      cloakbag portmanteau trunk these are machines for carrying clothes on a journey cloakbags are made of leather contrived to be laid upon the back of a horse portmanteaus and trunks are of wood generally covered with hair and made to be carried before or behind a carriage with this difference between them that portmanteaus are long and their lids round whereas trunks are made square every way      rule order rule respects properly those things that ought to be done order the manner in which they should be done in the idea of the first there seems to be something arising more from natural right in the idea of the second something resulting more from positive right  equity and charity ought to be the two grand rules of our conduct they may even deviate from all kind of order  we submit to rule we conform to order although the first is much more indispensable it is yet much more broke through the particularity of order making a greater impression on us than the advantage of rule      regular methodical we are regular in our conduct we are methodical with respect to our affairs  a regular man is careful of his reputation he runs into no excess a methodical man takes care of his time he gives no way to dissipation  with respect to expenses we are regular in relation to the bounds we set to them methodical with regard to the manner of them  regular persons are always admired methodical persons are frequently laughed at      to be sorry for regret we are sorry for the misfortunes of another we regret his absence the one is the effect of pity the other of attachment  grief occasions our sorrow repentance excites our regret  a court favorite in prosperity is the object of envy but when he falls into disgrace no one is sorry for him those princes who are most commended during their life are not always most regretted after their death  the expression sorry for when used with respect to ourselves in some measure changes its signification retaining the common and general idea of sensibility it ceases to express that particular motive of pity that makes us sympathise inwardly for the distresses of others and in its room marks only a certain uneasiness which discovers itself outwardly when we are sorry for the misfortunes of others we are often inwardly touched and perhaps no outward sign of it shall appear when we are sorry for our own we show it outwardly in order to draw the compassion of others this expression is sometimes used in another sense besides that mentioned instead of motives of pity it denotes motives of repentance in this sense we say he is sorry for the steps he has taken  as much taken up as we may be with ourselves there are eertain moments when we are sorry for the distresses of others however philosophical we may pretend to be it is extremely difficult to suffer a long time together without showing some signs of sorrow mercenary people are sorry for every step they take that does not turn out to advantage we often seem to regret the absent in order to affront the person present  a hard heart is sorry for no one an insensible man is never sorry for any thing that happens to him a miserly person regrets every morsel he eats  we should never be sorry for a man who suffers deservedly for ourselves when we can procure no kind of comfort nor for any trouble we take when prudence enjoins it we should not regret the departure of a friend when his absence will turn out to his advantage      rivulet brook stream rivulets and brooks are certain species of streams which are running waters with this difference that a rivulet runs between banks whereas a brook winds its way through the meadows or by a hedge side  a rivulet is a much larger stream than a brook  fish are found in rivulets but never in what we properly call brooks there not being sufficient depth of water  we say the rapid stream the clear rivulet the gurgling brook  heavy rains will swell a stream in such a manner as to overflow the neighboring grounds poets are very luxurious in their description of rivulets and brooks      stream current a stream issues from a head and moves forward with a continuity of parts a current is a certain progressive motion of some fluid body these words in the literal sense are applied to water thus we say the stream of a river the current of a sea  streams are frequently rapid currents are seldom so  in the figurative sense these words convey the same ideas thus we say a stream of light a current of air      to swear make eath of custom has made the word swear to signify the profane and illegal use of the sacred name in common conversation whereas by the phrase make oath of is understood the divine name used solemnly on legal occasions in confirmation of the truth  in courts of judicature we are required to make oath of every thing we have to say he who swears upon every occasion gives us to understand that his bare word is not to be credited      pleasing agreeable it is the air and behavior that renders pleasing good sense and good humor that renders agreeable  we love the company of a pleasing man because he charms we covet the company of an agreeable man because he diverts  wellbred persons are always pleasing merry persons are commonly agreeable  how difficult is it to avoid being attached to one of a pleasing address and agreeable coversation  it appears to me that it is more the behavior than the air that makes the men pleasing and that it is rather the air than the behavior that makes the women so it seems to me also that it is rather good sense and a liveliness in conversation that constitutes agreeableness in the men and that it is an even temper and a merry disposition that establishes that quality in the women  when these words are used otherwise than to denote personal qualities that of pleasing properly speaking implies something which flatters the sense or selflove that of agreeable something which agrees with the taste and the mind  it is pleasing to have always desirable objects before us nothing is more agreeable to a joyous man than good company  it is sometimes dangerous to approach that which is pleasing to the sight and it may happen that what is very agreeable may be very prejudicial    0 graces charms graces result from natural politeness accompanied with a noble freedom it is a varnish that appears in our conversation our actions and our carriage making us please in every thing we do charms rise from an assemblage of fine touches animated by good humor and goodsense and are sometimes far superior to what is perfectly agreeable  the body seems to be more susceptible of graces the mind of charms we say of a lady that she walks dances and sings with grace and that her conversation is full of charms  what can a man desire more in a lady than an outward union of graces and charms and an inward composition of solidity in her disposition and delicacy in her sentiments      ready easy both the one and the other of these words denote that which is done without difficulty but the first excludes difficulty which arises from obstacles and oppositions the second that which springs from the very nature of the thing thus we say a ready entrance when no one stops the passage an easy entrance when the passage is large and commodious for the same reason we say of a woman without reserve that she is ready of access and of a shoe that does not pinch that it is easy  it appears to me best to use the word ready in naming the action and that of easy in expressing the event of that action thus speaking of a commodious harbor i should say we have there a ready landing and that it is easy to land there  of these two adjectives there are formed two adverbs easily and readily which besides the difference of ideas remarked in their originals have one peculiar to themselves which i should not here omit taking notice of in speaking then of a sensible person i should rather say he comprehends easily and pardons readily than that he comprehends readily and pardons easily this choice of words i must confess is delicate but as i can perceive the necessity of it why should not another do the same      flat insipid that which is flat does not pierce the taste that which is insipid does not touch it in the least thus the last rises upon the first the one wanting only a degree of seasoning the other wanting it entirely  in works of the mind they are both very far from pleasant but the flat appearing to affect the graces displeases the insipid appearing to have no knowledge tires  in relation to the beauty of the sex i do not think the word insipid should be used but with respect to those who are of a disposition wholly insensible but we say beauty is flat when it is not animated and when it has neither the charms of vivacity nor those of softness      to keep detain we keep what we intend not to part with we detain what we propose not to restore  we keep that which is our own we detain that which is anothers  the miser keeps his money the debtor detains the property of his creditors  the honest man finds a difficulty in keeping what he possesses when the rogue finds none in detaining what he has taken      complicated involved affairs or actions are complicated one with another by their mixture and mutual dependence persons are involved in actions or in affairs when they are far immerged in them  things extremely complicated become obscure to those who have not sufficient understanding or discernment to unfold them if we are often in company with rash people we are liable to be involved in disagreeable matters  the most complicated affairs become simple and easy to be understood in the mouth or in the writings of an able advocate it is dangerous to be involved even innocently in the crimes of the great as at those time we are always the dupe and are sure to be sacrificed to their interests  complicated has a substantive in general use involved has not but in return that has a verb in general use which the other has not we hear frequently of complication seldom of involution so again we meet frequently with the verb to involve seldom with that of to complicate  nothing embarrasses physicians more than a complication of disorders of which the remedy of one shall oppose the cure of another it is very disagreeable to have such acquaintance as involve us always in their own faults      for as to however synonymous these may be for seems to me to agree best when speaking of a person or thing which governs the following verb as to appears to me to be used with most propriety when speaking of that which is governed by the verb i should say then for my part i will not interfere in such matters as do not concern me as to me all things are indifferent  the religion of the understanding part of mankind consists in a lively faith a pure morality and in a simple conduct guided by divine authority and supported by reason for that of the people in general it consists in a blind credulity and in exterior practices authorized by education and corroborated by the force of custom as to that of those belonging to the church we can determine nothing concerning it unless we could detach them from their temporal interests      trade business profession in the sense in which these words are esteemed synonymous that of trade implies a manual occupation that of business such an occupation as consists only in buying and selling that of profession such as results from the lucrative use of the sciences thus the occupations of a carpenter tailor baker etc are trades those of a linnendraper mercer haberdasher etc are businesses those of a physician counselor musician etc are professions  in point of rank professions take place of businesses businesses of trades      divination prediction divination brings hidden things to light prediction fortells what will come to pass  the first regards things present and past the objects of the second are things to come  a learned and discerning man one who knows what relation the least outward signs bear to the motions of the soul readily passes with the world as wellskilled in divination a wise man one who sees what will be the consequences of certain principles and the effects of certain causes may pass with the people as having the knowledge of prediction      to reprove reprimand he who reproves another points out his fault and blames him he who reprimands pretends to punish and mortifies the offender  we reprove a friend we reprimand a child  reprove is seldom used but with respect to the faults of the mind reprimand with regard to the manners and conduct  we sometimes reprove one who knows better than ourselves no one has a right to reprimand but superiors      austere severe we are austere by our manner of living severe by our manner of thinking  softness is the reverse of austerity it is rare to pass immediately from one to the other a common regular way of life is the medium between the two remissness and severity are the two extremes in one of which we are sure to fall few persons being able to distinguish the true medium which consists in an exact and precise knowledge of the law  we are austere only with respect to ourselves but we may be severe as well with respect to others as ourselves  enthusiasts give themselves up to the exercises of austerity this was also once the custom of recluses some casuists affect to distinguish themselves by a severe morality extending it even till it loses sight of every degree of reason  an austere life consists in the privation of pleasures and conveniences we sometimes embrace it through a taste of singularity and would fain have it thought to proceed from a principle of religion morals too severe may equally with morals too remiss wound the regularity of manners    0 tempest storm by tempest is understood the utmost violence of the wind by storm a commotion of the elements  tempests are more dreadful at sea than storms  we use the word storm to denote any violence of weather but then in order to determine what weather we mean we are under a necessity of adding such other words to it as shall express the idea we want to convey thus we say a storm of wind a storm of hail etc but the word tempest is understood to be neither more or less than as was said before the utmost violence of the wind should this excess of wind be atttended with rain thunder and lightning it then becomes a storm  we may say with propriety a great storm but a great tempest would be absurd  words cannot describe the distresses of seamen when out in tempestuous weather stormy weather is generally succeeded by serene      to appear seem i know not how much i may differ from the rest of my countrymen but the verb appear in my opinion relates more to the eye seem more to the imagination  an object always appears less the farther it is off many things seem practicable which cannot be carried into execution      fast hard the sense in which these words are accounted synonymous is that of quick motion but fast denotes quickness without force hard quickness with violence thus to run ride or rain fast implies a quicker motion than common but to run ride or rain hard some degree of force or violence  with respect to work fast means expeditiously hard laboriously thus he who works fast will soon have done he who works hard will soon be weary      clock dial these are both timepieces with this difference that the clock strikes the dial does not it is for this reason we call that plate which determines time by a shadow in the sun a sun dial  the clock tells the hour the dial shows it  dials were long in use before the invention of clocks      every all though the word every is more frequently made use of by itself it is sometimes connected with the word one especially when used as synonymous to all as all of us every one of us these expressions show that every is rather particular relating more to individuals and that all is rather general relating to the whole the word one being added to every specifying that determination  every includes always in its idea the word all though all does not always include the word every that is all speaks in general only whereas every excepts none  every man is undoubtedly bound to assist his neighbor all men are mercenary  all seems to me to be the plural of every every being constantly applied to the singular number all to the plural thus we say every man every thing every part etc but all men all things all parts etc      pity compassion commiseration i cannot say whether in the characterising of these words i may fall in with the opinion of the public but with respect to the two first pity seems to me to be rather particular and to be used with most propriety with regard to persons we have some knowledge of whereas compassion is more general and may be used equally with respect to those we know as to those we know not  we are said to pity the distresses of a friend and compassionate the misfortunes of a stranger  pity seems most applicable to the first emotions we feel at the sight or description of an object in distress rising from tenderness of heart compassion seems to result from reflection on the unmerited calamities of another springing from the truest benevolence  thus we say it was through pity we were led to compassionate his case  commiseration in my opinion implies a fellowfeeling or the bearing a part in anothers woe and rises from sympathy  we naturally commiserate the sorrows of one we love  according to this interpretation of the words we may pity and yet not have compassion we may have both pity and compassion yet not commiserate  the word pity on some occasions has been made use of by way of contempt as i pity her pride but it seems hare to be used rather ironically than to imply in its real signification any degree of scorn      slippery glib glibness implies a great degree of slipperiness slipperiness a small degree of glibness  all ice is slippery but that which is remarkably smooth is glib  the proper and literal definition of slippery is affording no firm hold or footing that of glib made easy to be moved in this sense the first denotes something natural the last something not so  an eel is so slippery as to be difficult to hold wet weather succeeded by a frost makes the ways slippery oiling the fly of a jack makes it run glib  so in the figurative sense speaking of a woman fond of gallantry we say she is a slippery dame nothing is of a more slippery nature than true happiness it slides through the fingers even while we think we hold it fast strong liquor on different persons has different effects some it sickens others it stupifies of others again it makes the tongue run so glib as to be greatly entertaining      ridicule derision laughter in scorn is the common import of these words but that of ridicule implies contemptuous merriment that of derision sportive insult  we ridicule in order to show another his fault and induce him to amend we never deride but with the utmost contempt  a friend will often ridicule none but an enemy derides  if we have done any thing deserving ridicule we should endeavor to retrieve our character lest we become the derision of all who know us      to cry weep shedding of tears is the general sense in which these words are understood but to cry implies shedding of tears audibly to weep shedding of tears with silence  children commonly cry grown persons generally weep  it is not the noise we make that denotes a greater or less measure of grief for the secret weeper may be more distressed than one who cries aloud  crying is found by experience to give greater relief to sorrow than bare weeping      to shake tremble both these words imply being agitated with a vibratory motion but as this motion seems to arise from different causes it renders the choice of them necessary  shake appears to me more applicable to a tremulous motion occasioned by cold tremble to a like motion occasioned by fear  we shake with cold we tremble with fear  when the blood is chilled we naturally shake the very thought of danger will make the coward tremble  the verb shake is often used in the active sense the verb tremble never thus we shake the house shake a tree shake hands etc    0 pedigree genealogy pedigree is our lineal descent from some ancestor ages back pointed out genealogy is a history of such pedigree  we trace our pedigree we write our genealogy  it is sometimes necessary to examine into our pedigree in order to claim or secure our property in lands the transmitting of genealogies to posterity though they may be in some respect useful is a standing mark of the vanity of our ancestors      prebend prebendary prebend implies a certain stipend granted to the clergy in cathedral churches prebendary denotes properly the person who receives that stipend though it is well known to every one that one of these words implies the stipend the other the stipendiary yet i thought fit to take notice of them especially as it gave me an opportunity of correcting their erroneous use it being common to employ the word prebendary to express the benefice and that of prebend to denote the dignitary whereas they should be reversed i e prebend should be used to mark the office prebendary to point out the person filling that office      discourse conversation the general import of these words is the mutual intercourse of speech but that of discourse implies serious or set talk upon any particular subject that of conversation such as is easy and familiar and not confined to any particular topic  discourse is generally formal conversation commonly cheerful  the attention of men is so much scattered by dissipation that when together exclusive of business they seldom enter into any discourse that is improving but their general conversation runs on things in their nature trifling and impertinent      impertinent impudent saucy nothing is more general than the indiscriminate use of these words though none differ more among themselves if a man gives rude language how common is it to say he is an impertinent impudent or saucy fellow one would imagine their peculiar ideas are so well known as to render it unnecessary to take farther notice of them but as some people never see the stumbling block till they fall over it it may not be unnecessary to give them a perfect view of it in order to which i need only define them  impertinent then means intruding and meddling with what no way concerns us impudent implies shamelessness or want of modesty saucy means insolent and abusive  to show a further difference between them or give any examples of their use would be needless      tongue language i know not whether in characterising these words i may fall in with the taste of the public but according to my opinion tongue seems to agree best with a corrupted language that is tongue appears to be more particular or provincial language more general or national thus i would say the vulgar tongue the mother tongue the yorkshire tongue but the english language the french language the spanish language  that of the indians may be rather called a tongue than a language it being neither formal or regular  the generality of people content themselves with speaking the tongue common to the place they are bred up in without paying any regard to the beauties of their native language      fuddled drunk intoxicated with respect to the two first of these words drunk rises upon that of fuddled fuddled implying a less degree of inebriation drunk a greater as to the word intoxicated its greatest distinction is that whereas fuddled and drunk are seldom used in the figurative sense that is hardly ever in the literal  half a pint of wine will make some men drunk when others shall drink a gallon without being the least fuddled good success will sometimes so intoxicate a person as to take him off from his business and render him disagreeable to all his acquaintance      bargain agreement contract bargain is more limited relating to sale agreement and contract are more general implying any sort of stipulation with this difference between them that agreement seems to denote a verbal one contract one that is written  it is a mark of honesty in dealing never to draw back from a bargain once made such is the unsteadiness of mankind that we are frequently obliged to enter into contract in order to bind them to their agreement      mine my own though many are of opinion that the the word own is added to the possessive pronoun my by way of emphasis or corroboration only yet custom seems to have thrown into the idea of the expression my own a greater degree of property than into that of the word mine thus a workman to whom certain tools have been appropriated by his master for the work he is employed on might with propriety say these tools are mine though at the same time they are not his own being the property of his master so again a wife might lay claim to the clothes she wears and say they are mine though she could not say with propriety that they were her own being in reality the property of her husband on the other hand the expression my own may with elegance be used by the person in whom the sole right of a thing is vested      nigh near i will leave it to the decision of the curious whether or no the word near is not a corruption of nigher the comparative of nigh be this as it may near in my opinion implies a less distance than nigh thus i should say when we come nigh to such a place we shall be near home the nigher the enemy the nearer the danger as a farther proof of this speaking of the close ties of kindred we use the word near in preference to that of nigh as implying a less distance or greater degree of consanguinity between the two persons thus my brothers child is my near relation or is nearly related to me      efficacious effectual with respect to these two words that of efficacious seems not so powerful as that of effectual the first gets the better of most obstacles the last of all  by an efficacious remedy we put an effectual stop    0 width wideness width seem more applicable to things small in themselves wideness to those which are large thus we say the width of paper the width of cloth but the wideness of a ditch the wideness of a field  an
