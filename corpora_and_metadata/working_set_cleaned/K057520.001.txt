timor dei nobilitas    the story of lady juliana harley  a novel  in letters  by mrs griffith  vol i  london printed for t cadell in the strand  mdcclxxvi  to the reader to such trisling works as novels are generally esteemed a preface may probably be deemed superfluous for which reason i shall bestow but a few lines on this and they shall only tend to obviate the remarks that may possibly be made upon the conduct of the story  in the first essay i attempted in this species of writing i acknowledged my deficiency in the principal article of such compositions namely invention preface to the delicate distress  the creative powers of fancy do not increase with years being rarely to be met with but in the spring of life on facts alone then my readers must depend for the entertainment i wish them to receive from the following sheets as the utmost merit they can pretend to is that the characters as well as the narrative are drawn from the fountain of reality though the stream by wandering from one country to another may have acquired some adventitious particles as well as have lost some portion of its original peculiarity  the most uncommon character in the following work is that of mr evelyn but i aver that i had the pleasure of being intimately acquainted with the person from whom the portrait is exactly copied when he had reached his fiftieth year and even at that period of his life his romantic passion remained unabated still though the object of it had been no more for several years and dead to him a considerable time before  from the favorable reception my former writings of this kind have been honored with i presume now once more though with extreme timidity to solicit the indulgence of the public to this further attempt and am with the sincerest respect its much obliged and most grateful humble servant  the author  the story of lady juliana harley letter i charles evelyn to william stanley delville if i was not a slave to my promise i should not write to you at present as i find myself utterly incapable of expressing the mixed sensation of my mind  i have often complained of the inadequateness of language but never felt it more strongly than now the most copious that i am acquainted with could by no means afford you even an idea of the different reflections that have progressively given place to each other in the space of eight and forty hours  i am provoked at this natural incapacity of conveying my sentiments to you words are but a cloak or rather a clog to our ideas there should be no curtain before the hearts of friends and the longing i have ever felt for an intuitive converse is to me a strong argument for a future state  what says my skeptical friend to this opinion  dont be alarmed i am not going to sermonize  but what is almost as dull to narrate  by the carelessness or ignorance of my postilion who drove me at least a dozen miles out of my road over salisbury plain it was near midnight before i reached this place  you who are thoroughly acquainted with the natural warmth of my temper and know how impatient i have been to embrace a favorite sister after an absence of twelve years may judge of my anxiety  but there was no remedy and i strove to amuse the irksome tediousness of my journey by endeavoring to trace in my imagination the growing beauties of my emmas features from ten years old when i last saw the little darling of our house to their meridian charms at twentytwo  at length we reached the gates of this noble edifice and had the pleasure to find the family not retired to rest by perceiving lights in the hall  i enquired for sir james desmond as i was determined not to announce myself and i thought it rather too late for an unknown visitor to demand an interview with his lady  i was shown into a saloon from whence the company had retired after supper and from an adjacent apartment i heard a confused sound of voices intermixed with the detestable noise of a dicebox  in a few minutes all was hushed and a man whom i believed to be an upper servant was sent to reconnoitre my person and enquire my name and business i told him i should not reveal either but to his master he smiled as it now seems at my ignorance and withdrew in about ten minutes which seemed as many hours to me sir james entered with an air compounded of fierte and timidity i presented myself with the best grace i possibly could and on mentioning my name was accosted with the utmost politeness by my brotherinlaw  on my expressing my impatience to see my sister he said he was pretty certain that she was not gone to bed and offered to conduct me to her apartment i declined his offer till a stranger was announced to her for i wished to surprise not alarm her a servant was then sent to let her ladyship know that there was a gentleman from london who desired to pay his respects to her  we followed the servant to her dressing room door she was sitting leaning on her elbow and seemed lost in thought the delivering of the message roused her from her reverie she started up and said who can it be at this late hour i flew and caught her in my arms crying out it is i it is charles she pressed me to her bosom softly exclaimed my brother and almost fainted in my arms  i will not pretend to describe my sensation for the reasons given in the beginning of this letter but i am certain i never felt such unimpassioned tenderness before  sir james who was not much affected with our interview left us to go and order some refreshment for me though in truth i needed none my mind being so perfectly delighted with beholding my beloved sister whom i had ever thought on with all a fathers fondness that i had no leisure to attend to the calls of appetite  i asked her a thousand questions without waiting for her answer except to one the number of her children  she replied i have but one  it is the image of our mother and named after her  come charles and let me show you my lovely fanny  she led me to the nursery where i beheld a little sleeping angel of about two years old  as we crossed the staircase i again heard the dicebox rattle  sir james is fond of play i fancy emma said i  she affected not to hear my question and did not answer it  a thousand disagreeable images rushed on my imagination in that instant i crushed their growth and talked of india of my other sisters lucy and mrs selwyn and of you also till we were summoned to the saloon where supper was prepared for me  i there met three gentlemen with sir james amongst whom was the person i had mistaken for a servant when he was presented to me i made my apology which he received with great good humor and congratulated lady desmond on my arrival with such apparent sincerity that i have taken a liking to this new acquaintance whose name is sewell   we spent a couple of hours most agreeably my sister became quite cheerful sir james and she sung two or three sweet duettos and we all retired to rest about three oclock in the most perfect harmony and at this happy crisis i will leave you having run my letter into too great a length though i have a thousand things more to say to you but i have quite as many to say to emma and so sir you must as in duty bound give place to your betters as you have gallantry enough i hope to agree with me that all amiable women are so  adieu c evelyn  letter ii charles evelyn to william stanley delville you know what an investigator of human nature i am and yet here have i been four whole days and as many nights under the same roof with sir james desmond and cannot form any fixed idea of his character one hour tender and polite to his wife fond of his lovely child and easy in his manners to all around him  the next cold distrait nay peevish to my sister insensible to the carresses of his little girl inattentive and indifferent to his guests  help me stanley to account for such an opposition of qualities and inconsistency of demeanor in the same individual  too plainly i perceive that emma is not happy yet she adores her husband and when she speaks of him her tongue grows wanton in his praise at his approach her eyes sparkle with delight but lose their luster when his countenance changes as it sometimes does from gay to grave the variety of expression that emmas cameleonlike features receive from her proteus serve but to heighten her beauty  i should think that nothing could be more interesting than her sprightly glance if i had not seen her downcast eye  why stanley do all women affect to charm us by levity when our affections are much more liable to be attracted by an appearance of sensibility however it is not the semblance but the reality that can please as i have very lately experienced  where it is only assumed it is easily detected and when the paint is washed off the complexion looks the worse for having worn it  affectation in women and hypocrisy in men are equally detestable  i have very uneasy apprehensions though i hope they are not well founded that sir james desmonds ruling passion is the love of play men addicted to this vice of all others should never marry it absorbs every generous affection of the human heart the drunkard has intervals of sobriety and in those may be capable of friendship and of fondness  the choleric man is not always in a passion and is even proverbially good natured and humane sorry for and ready to atone the evil his short lived frenzy may have caused  even the libertine though he may cease to love most generally esteems a virtuous wife and if not a despicable wretch indeed endeavors to compensate for his want of fondness by generosity and politeness toward her  but let a man be once possessed with a passion for gaming he becomes incapable of honor or affection he would wish to win money from his dearest friend though he knew that friend must be distressed by losing it and would sacrifice the interest of his tenderest connection to gratify this sordid vice which like a whirlpool swallows every virtue  his mind can never be at peace his losses are attended with a permanent regret his winnings with but a transient exultation the constant contention of his passion destroys his constitution and anticipates old age he passes his days and nights with harpies like himself he lives unloved and dies unlamented  i know not how i have been drawn into this long exclamation against a vice which you hold in as much abhorrence as i do but my mind was full of rancour against it merely on a supposition that it may interfere with the happiness of a beloved sister  i have now let out my venom and shall perhaps be able to throw off that reserve to sir james and his associates which this mental bile has hitherto been the cause of  i find from emma that my brother was rather averse to her marrying sir james desmond but that he had suffered too much from a disappointed love to inflict such torments upon her as she then confessed to him and does now to me that she could not have been happy with any other man  may her husbands gratitude reward her predilection  and indeed if my suspicion with regard to his love of play be groundless i doubt not but he will as i have already said he seems to love and esteem her the caprice of his temper may produce sudden changes in his manner but i think her beauty and tenderness must secure his affections  i will think no more upon this subject at present my mind is involuntarily occupied by more selfish reflections but in my next i shall afford you an opportunity of judging for yourself by reasoning from facts  adieu c evelyn  letter iii charles evelyn to william stanley i promised in my last to give you the minute transactions of this family but how impossible not only them but every trace of my past life except thy friendship are vanished from my memory  my sentiments my passions are engrossed by one object  my whole soul is hers  never was love so violent nor beauty so inspiring since the first fair that edens garden graced  would she were my eve and i her adam for in this peopled world there is no doubt but that she must have had as many lovers as beholders  perhaps some favored youth has already touched her gentle heart and your unhappy friend must sigh in vain  jealousy is twinborn with love but so is hope and i will hope while i exist  despair and death to me can be but one   i will strive to methodize my thoughts a little and attempt a description of this charming woman though i know it impossible to give you a just idea of her perfections we were at breakfast in lady desmonds dressing room when a servant announced the arrival of lady juliana harley  my sisters eyes sparkled with joy at her approach   she was dressed in a light gray cassimere cloth habit embroidered with black her hair was turned up under a white riding hat in which was a black band and feather some of her lovely auburn locks had broke from their confinement and wandered carelessly over her snowy neck  she is a little taller than the middle size her complexion dazzlingly fair the color in her cheeks so faint so transient that you can hardly pronounce there is any except when she speaks or is addressed and then we may say with done her pure and eloquent blood spoke in her cheeks and so distinctly wrought that one would almost say her body thought this circumstance however though it may perhaps lessen her beauties increases her charms for by appearing not to have been any original defect in her complexion but the casual effect of misfortune or illhealth captivate us through sympathy which is always stronger than the senses her eyes dark blue adorned with long black eyelashes her brows of the same color her nose the perfect grecian her lips and teeth  but i shall attempt no more  a statue may be described but not a living venus  she seems to be about four and twenty and has been near two years a widow  emma tells me that my elder brother had been proposed for her before her marriage with mr harley but her father the earl of k  had already entered into a treaty with her late husband and poor harry was of course refused  i grieve now for what he must have suffered at that time but console myself with thinking that he would have had a much severer struggle on his leaving life had he been possessed of such an object at least i strive to persuade myself that it was happy for him he was not married to lady juliana as i may hope at the same time that it was very fortunate for me  this charming woman has promised to stay a fortnight with my sister and then we are all to go to london together  i will use all my interest with emma to delay her journey and detain her lovely guest for a longer term if i do not obtain some little share in her heart whilst she remains under the same roof with me where i have a thousand opportunities of marking my attentions without appearing to obtrude them i must despair of making any impression when she will be surrounded by crowds of admirers and hurried into all the dissipation of the gay world  the country as the poets tell us is the scene for love the pleasing objects that surround us the pureness of the air but above all its stillness harmonize the soul and render it susceptible of every soft and tender feeling  noise is an enemy to all the gentle passions i agree with stern that a lover who was unfortunate enough to throw down the fire shovel and tongs when he was going to prostrate himself at his mistresss feet could have very little hopes of success from his flurried fair one  silence is rendered vocal at this moment by the soft sounds of lady julianas and my sisters voices under my window  they are going to walk perhaps  i fly i follow them  adieu charles evelyn  letter iv charles evelyn to william stanley some french writer says that there are men who are such egotists that rather than not talk of themselves they would even reveal their failings those men were never in love or they would have experienced a much higher delight in talking of the object of their affections than of themselves  for my part i can neither think talk or write upon any other subject than the charming juliana  if you were not a lover i should fear you would soon grow tired of my correspondence but as i know you are capable of all the pleasing weaknesses necessarily attendant upon that character i trust you will indulge me on my favorite topic  in my last i gave you a faint sketch of lady julianas personal charms but believe me stanley no pen or pencil can describe the winning softness and attractive grace that accompanies her every look and motion  i have seen many elegant women but she is elegance personified  ipsa forma  there is a plaintive sweetness in her voice that would render the most trifling expressions interesting even a blind man who did not understand her language would be enamoured of the sound  she talks but little and when she ceases i feel like our progenitor when raphael left off speaking  the angel ended and in adams ear so charming left his voice that he awhile thought him still speaking still stood fixed to hear   her words upon every subject on which she converses are perfectly well chosen from whence i conclude she has read the best authors in our language she is a perfect mistress of the french and emma says plays finely on the harpsichord but has not been prevailed on since she came here to afford us this delight i have never seen her laugh and she sighs oftener than she smiles  she seems to labor under an habitual melancholy which gives an additional softness both to her looks and manner   do you know that notwithstanding our friendship i should not be quite easy at your seeing lady juliana if i was not convinced that lucy has an unbounded power over your affections and will of course be kind enough to herself and me to prevent your becoming my rival as to the men who are in this house they are so entirely occupied by their sordid passion for gaming that i almost doubt whether the united charms of the whole sex could be able to make any impression on them their hearts are tied up in their purses but though i despise their stupidity i am indebted to it as it occasions their retiring to a distant apartment every day after dinner to pursue their sports and pastimes and leaves me happier than an emperor in the society of two most charming women  i am sometimes permitted to read to them milton is a favorite of lady julianas and you may see by my quotation that our tastes are the same i have sometimes perceived while i have been reading that she has looked earnestly upon me but the moment i have raised my eyes in hopes of meeting hers their modest lids have veiled them from my sight and i have frequently observed a silent tear steal down her lovely cheek  what can these marks of sorrow mean i would give worlds to know provided it was in my power to remove the cause  emma too whom you know to be the gentlest of the gentle kind appears absent and lost in thought frequently  from this account you will not suppose that our evenings are passed in the most lively manner yet believe me stanley i would not exchange the pleasure i receive from this devotement of my time for the broadest mirth unfeeling folly wears the minutes seem to fly while our society is confined to a triumvirate but as soon as sir james and his companions join us lady juliana retires and then all is what they call jollity and i call noise  i dont know whether you may not be inclined to laugh at my sombre ideas of happiness i know lucy will if you show her my letter be that as it may i am certain i never was half so happy before though perhaps neither you or she would be so in the same situation  i therefore wish ye both all the pleasures the gay world can give and am most affectionately yours  c evelyn  letter v william stanley to charles evelyn holy st francis what a change is here is rosaline whom thou did love so dear so soon forsaken and now i suppose like your gallant prototype monsieur romeo you have totally forgotten your former mistress and are ready to hang drown or put an end to your miserable existence in any other doleful way all for the love of your fair juliet alas poor charles  however i am glad you have been laid hold of by this charming relict  lovemaking and haymaking are the two most delightful rural pastimes that i know of but it is not requisite that both should be done while the sun shines  for the first is just as agreeable by a fireside under a roof with or without the singing of cagebirds as in a summers evening under the shade of a beech to the soft notes of the nightingale  for notwithstanding all that you or the poets have said in praise of the country i will venture to promise that your fond vows will be just as well received by lady juliana at her house in berkeleysquare as in the mossgrown woods or floweringshrubbery at delville  it is the man and not the place that must render his passion acceptable for every spot is an eden with those we love  i will allow there is much pleasure and perhaps some little advantage too in being in the same house with the object of our affections whilst we are endeavoring to inspire a reciprocal one but that once having taken effect believe me it is much more for the interest of the lover to be placed at a little distance than too near the plesaure of expecting his approach fixes the fairones attention to his most agreeable qualities and the flattering likeness which her fondness and selflove join to draw off the absent idol generally exceeds the merits of the original  if therefore you can flatter yourself with having made any impression on lady julianas heart and are seriously in love yourself which i know not how to believe after your seeming attachment to miss morton dont be afraid of her ladyships coming to london  remember that to a woman that loves there is but one man in the world some ladywriter has refined upon this sentiment of rousseaus and says that to a woman who truly loves there is no man in the world the object is more and every other less  i admire your ingenuity in endeavoring to persuade yourself that your brothers being unsuccessful in his addresses was a fortunate circumstance for him because it is a lucky one for you  just so do all men reason who speak from their passions selflove is an artful sophister and i have no doubt but you could easily prevail upon yourself to believe that it was a great advantage to poor harry to be taken off by a fever in his eightandtwentieth year as his death has put you into possession of a noble estate and recalled you from indias burning soil to the mild climate of your native land  your serious complaint of the inadequateness of language in your first letter made me smile  believe me you were more at a loss for ideas than words when you sat down to write or at least the former wanted prision for nothing can be clearer to me than that you were then undetermined with regard to sir james desmonds character  the new lights thrown upon it since in my mind do but puzzle the cause  i am not personally acquainted with him but he is generally well spoken of though said to be remarkably fond of play and i have heard it hinted that he has suffered by it considerably  i cannot tell why i should dislike your new acquaintance mr sewell and yet i do  your mistaking him for a servant is against him  a meanness either in manners or appearance is no favorable prognostic  or  dont be angry charles but possibly my antipathy may have arisen from your too sudden sympathy not from any spirit of contradiction but that i know you are often too liable to impromptu attachments both in love and friendship  and yet though you have smarted pretty severely for a firstsight connection before now i would not if i could restrain the openness and benevolence of your nature  every man that is not himself a knave is liable to be duped by one till a thorough knowledge of the world has taught him caution at the cost of one of the highest pleasures in life  that of thinking well of human nature  i dont know whether your sisters mrs selwyn and my lucy for i still hope to call her mine have not reason to be jealous in the friendly way of your partiality to lady desmond  she cannot in my mind have more excellent or amiable qualities than your eldest sister nor is it possible that she can have more charms either in mind or person than your youngest but i will not hint this unjust preference to either of them particularly as i have reason from your last letter to believe that they and all the rest of the world are quite upon a par in your present estimation your whole quota of fond affections being absolutely devoted to the transcendent beauties of your divine juliana  i hope that last line is sublime enough to satisfy your lovership  adieu my dear charles i have said nothing of my own affairs because they are still in an unpleasant train  yours w stanley p s i showed your last letter to lucy she smiled and said some men have strange fancies    letter vi charles evelyn to william stanley upon my honor you do me wrong stanley  i never loved or feigned to love miss morton  i thought her lively elegant and sensible and still think her so but were every charm she possesses augmented beyond the power of numbers to increase my heart could hold no sympathy with hers  for if she has a heart it is an unfeeling one  do not mistake me now by supposing that i complain of her coldness from having experienced it  believe me i never proceeded so far as to meet with a repulse  when i first came to england i saw her often liked nay admired and might perhaps have loved her had not the worthlessness of her disposition broke through the cobweb veil of an affected sensibility and turned my admiration to disgust  you may remember that at the time of my arrival in london miss morton was on a visit at my sister selwyns this circumstance occasioned our being particularly intimate we spent almost our whole time together and whether from any little design of rendering herself agreeable to me by indulging what you call my foible or from an affectation of singular sensibility i know not she used to launch forth into such effusion of sentimental tenderness and generosity as exceeded even our eastern ideas of humanity  i have seen her ready to weep for a drowning fly and my sister lucy used to say miss morton could only be a fit wife for the man of feeling the title of a novel   it happened one summers evening that we three walked in the park till near dusk as we came down constitutionhill a young woman in a wretched garb with a pale and emaciated countenance passed closely by us chance and chance alone directed my eyes to glance full upon hers in a moment her face was suffused with crimson she turned her head aside quickened her pace and was almost instantly out of sight  nothing is so swift as thought a ray of recollection beamed upon my mind and brought back to my remembrance the once smiling countenance of nancy weston whose father had been one of the under masters at winchester at whose house i boarded when i was placed at college there  her appearance spoke distress  saas adieu i quitted the ladies and set out with hasty strides to overtake and acknowledge my former playfellow or rather plaything for she was some years younger than myself and i had borne her in my arms a thousand times what convinced me that i was not mistaken in my conjecture with regard to the identity of the person was a pretty large mole at the bottom of her left cheek which used to give a thousand nameless graces to her mouth  i reached the top of the hill without perceiving the object of my pursuit but upon looking backwards i saw her lying on the ground at some distance from the footpath with her face covered by her hands  the little effort which conscious shame had impelled her feebleness to make in order to pass unnoticed by me had totally exhausted her last remains of strength and perhaps she had said with jane shore  why should i wander stray farther on for i can die even here  i flew directly toward her and raised her almost lifeless body from the earth  she could not articulate a single word but the dumb eloquence of flowing tears too plainly spoke unutterable woe  i saw a gentleman passing at some distance and called to him for help as he came near i entreated him to use the utmost expedition to fetch a chair to receive a young woman that i feared was dying  he said he was sorry my humanity was not bestowed upon a worthier object as he supposed her to be one of those unhappy wretches who nightlyinfest the park but she should not however perish for want of his assistance and at that moment set forward to call a chair in which at his return i placed her and desired the men to carry her gently to the first apothecarys shop in picadilly whither i attended her  every medicinal aid that is usually given to fainting persons was administered to her and she revived a little  the humane apothecary said she wanted food more than physic and made her eat a little bread and drink some wine and water i then desired her to direct the chairmen to her home and said i would follow her thither  she raised her languid eyes and said in a low and scarcely articulate voice i have no home i then requested the apothecary to provide a lodging for her near him and to attend her both as a physician and a friend promising to be answerable for any expense and trouble that might be incurred upon her account and as a counter security to which engagement left a bill for fifty pounds in his hands to be settled for at some future day  the poor unhappy girl then fell on her knees before me pouring out the strongest expressions of gratitude for my kindness i entreated her to compose her shattered spirits for the present and to rely upon my friendship not to desert her let her faults or misfortunes be of what nature soever they might so leaving my address with her that she might know where to apply i returned to mrs selwyns in order to account for my abrupt manner of quitting miss morton and lucy  when i had told my tale i expected to see the bewitching tear of pity stand in miss mortons eye  when to my amazement a settled gloom loured on her brow and indignation sparkled from her eyes  she continued silent till i addressed myself to her and lucy requesting them to spare me some part of their wardrobe to supply the immediate necessities of the unhappy nancy weston till there could be some procured more suited to her humble station   no words can describe the rage with which she told me that she was astonished both at my insolence and meanness in expecting that she would suffer any thing she had ever worn to be contaminated by the person of a prostitute for such she was sure i had known her to be and if i intended to restore her to her former situation she thought it would be but decent to cloth her at my own rather than at any other persons expense  it is impossible to express the sudden and forcible effect which both the manner and matter of miss mortons harangue produced on me suffice it to say that they unsexed her even from top to toe  and from that hour i have ever looked upon her mind with detestation and her person with disgust  i have entered into this long detail to acquit myself of a charge which by the generality of the world is scarcely deemed a vice but which i consider as an act of baseness that of engaging the affections of an innocent heart and then repaying its unmerited tenderness with black ingratitude  banished be the vile idea from every honest breast and may his couch be ever strewed with thorns that can for his sport create a pang in the bosom of unsuspecting innocence  away with the unpleasing subject and let it prove to my stanley of how much consequence his esteem is to my happiness when i tell him that it is now three oclock in the morning that i have danced from eight in the evening but not with lady juliana she having retired with visible dejection to her chamber on the arrival of some company yet could not lay me down in peace till i had removed the unjust suspicion he has hinted though seemingly in jest of my being a faithless lover or in other words a scoundrel  but though at this moment i am very far from being happy either on my own or emmas account i have the consolation of thinking that i have not deserved to be wretched and of knowing that i may boldly subscribe myself your sincere friend  charles evelyn p s lady juliana has appeared for some days past much graver than usual  she declines any little service from me though of ever so trifling a nature and seems cautiously to avoid entering into any conversation with me though in a mixed company ah stanley i have no hopes of making any impression on her heart either at delville or in berkeleysquare  mr sewell has lately dropped some hints to me that sir james desmonds finances are a good deal embarrassed by his ill success at play i think this person will justify my predeliction in his favor as he talks so very sensibly against both the vice and folly of gaming but that in so unaffected a manner that he acknowledges the necessity of it to those who would live in the world as at present constituted this is too sad a truth  the manners of life however corrupt must be our rule of action if we would preserve our rank in it  he who would be virtuous alone must live alone while he has been speaking upon this subject i have seen my sister steal a tender look at her husband more persuasive than all the rhetoric of demosthenes  but if she cannot cure his disease i can prevent its effects from becoming fatal for the present at least i should be happy to do so  if i could be happy  send me bills for the enclosed draft by return of the post  i may perhaps have occasion for more than mere traveling expenses before i leave this    letter vii william stanley to charles evelyn it is now very near eleven oclock and i am but this moment returned from an excursion i made into kent for three or four days of course i did not receive your letter till this instant  i should think myself unworthy of the very delicate attention you have shown to my good opinion were i to delay the thanks that are due for it to another post  accept them my dear evelyn and be assured that i consider your generous impatience of blame upon an article too lightly treated by the generality of men as the strongest proof of your friendship  the highest compliment we can pay to those we regard is the endeavoring to appear worthy of their esteem for though love may friendship never did or will subsist without a mutual exertion of good qualities as well as of kind offices  and he who can acquiesce in anothers thinking meanly of him betrays an equal want of regard to him and of respect to himself  so much in honor of your nice feelings and i heartily wish that all men and women too were possessed of the same  particularly the latter who like caesars wife ought not to be even suspected   i am extremely pleased at the little novel which my raillery for indeed i meant no more extorted from you  pray at your leisure let me have the remainder of nancy westons story i feel myself much interested for her which is more than i ever was for miss morton she always appearing to me a sort of madeup miss than which i know not a less amiable character  o charles if women would but trust to nature for their power to charm and scorn the mean the treacherous auxiliary of art how unbounded would be their dominion over us  but i have not time now to expatiate on a topic that has ever been my favorite one  for my mind is nice though my moral is not severe  i am glad to hear that lady juliana is grown cold and reserved to you  it is at least a tacit confession that she is apprized of your passion  no woman ventures to be disagreeably distant to a man to whom she has once been civil till she is quite certain that her caprice will render him unhappy  ladies are too tenacious of their sway to attempt an exertion of it where it is not likely to be felt but your true lover is the properest object in the world for tyranny and seems really designed for no other purpose but to be trampled on  courage then charles  the ice at least is broken and in such a changeable latitude who knows how soon the wind may veer about to the south and breathe its soft etesian gales upon you you will i doubt not perceive that i am not at present much inclined to write a panegyric upon the fair sex and will of course conclude that lucy and i have had a brouillerie  i always squabble with those i love  because they will not let me have my own way  for with those i care not about i have no way at all yes evelyn your sister is  a dear delightful charming woman  good night  w stanley your bills shall be sent by next post    letter viii lady juliana harley to miss lucy evelyn i know it will give my lucy pleasure to hear that i have passed some time with her amiable friends at delville i acknowledge a secret and irresistible charm that attaches me to every part of the evelyn family and in the society of lady desmond though far less intimately connected with her than you i hoped i should recover my spirits so far as to enable me to indulge your request of passing some months of the approaching winter in london   the unexpected meeting with mr evelyn at first a good deal disconcerted me for i am little used to seeing strangers his appearance perhaps too strongly recalled the idea of his brother but by degrees the painful suggestions of memory became less poignant and i fancied i might with safety indulge the melancholy pleasure of tracing henrys features in his brothers face  but even this transient  what shall i call it alas it will not bear the name of happiness  could not arrive to me without alloy  not to deal longer in mystery your brother to his great misfortune as well as mine i fear has conceived an affection for me nay i know he has  dissembling is beneath me  gracious heaven why was i born to be a curse to all the evelyn race why am i doomed to be the source of misery to those whom i love best on earth this is beyond the common course of ills  but let me recollect myself  your brothers passions seem to be violent and therefore may be the less permanent  i will stop the growing mischief then by flying from his fight i had resolved to go to london with lady desmond and have sent my servants thither  no matter  i will return to yorkshire which i never more intended to visit and pass the winter there or any where rather than hazard your brothers lady desmonds and my lucys peace  you may perhaps think that i am too easily alarmed upon this subject but o my friend those who have felt the pangs of real love should dread inflicting where they cannot heal them and pity poor cold pity is all that now is left me to bestow  your brother has not yet made any explicit declaration of his attachment toward me his pride will therefore be saved from the mortification of thinking that i fly from him  trifling as this consolation may appear i am glad he is in possession of it as any other reason that he may assign for my shunning his addresses must be less painful than the real one  if i were writing to any other person i should have some apprehension lest they might suppose my vanity had mistaken mr evelyns natural politeness for the effects of a commencing passion but his every look and action bear so striking a resemblance to those of his lamented brother who loved me but too well that it is impossible to doubt their motive  besides my lucy is a perfect columbus in the terra incognita of lovers hearts and discovered her faithful stanleys fond attachment in his speaking eyes for many months before his tongue revealed it  happy happy lucy whose hand and heart are free to bless the man who best deserves them whilst i  here let me stop nor pain your gentle breast with my complainings   i shall quit this house tomorrow five minutes before i set out i will acquaint lady desmond with my intention of returning into the north  how shall i be able to conceal the cause of this sudden alteration in my purpose from her yet i will conceal it from her from all the world but you  write to me i entreat you though i know i need not  the friend of my heart will continue as she has ever been attentive to its happiness   adieu  j harley  letter ix charles evelyn to william stanley o stanley she is gone fled and much i fear it is from me she flies   last night curse on all sports and sportsmen sir james desmond proposed our going out a shooting this morning early the day was gloomy and it was near nine oclock before we determined upon setting out  the ladies as i thought were not yet risen  while our horses were getting ready i took a turn in the garden and at some distance heard the sound of female voices  i stopped to listen from whence they came and at that instant perceived lady juliana and my sister coming toward me in close conference  they seemed to be engaged upon some very important subject and i fancied i heard my name mentioned  the moment they beheld me they turned about and with a quickened pace shot down another walk  i saw they wished to avoid me and therefore returned directly into the house i joined sir james and his friends and we set out together but i was too much occupied with the scene that had just passed before me to be at all interested in their sport  they rallied me upon my inattention and wished me to return home as i interrupted their amusement without seeming to be myself amused  i readily accepted my conge and clapping spurs to my horse galloped back again with an unspeakable anxiety  i found my sister alone in the drawing room and instantly enquired for lady juliana  she replied with a melancholy accent she has left us charles  whither is she gone and what could be the cause of such a sudden flight  on both these subjects i am as ignorant as you can be it is impossible i cried but if you ever loved me emma tell me and tell me truly have i offended lady juliana and is it from my hated sight she flies  i am sure she does not hate you she replied for her nature is incapable of repaying hatred for love  what then she knows i love her  from her discourse i believe she fears you do  but be composed sit down i beg of you  wherefore should she fear it does she think meanly of me my brother was not thought unworthy her alliance she would have given her hand to him but that her fathers promise was engaged to one she never loved  but i will know the cause of her disdain from her own lips will know it i rang the bell and ordered my chaise to be got ready instantly emma burst into tears and said do not render me more unhappy than i am already  my brother do not leave me in distress  alarmed as all my passions were her gentle accents vibrated upon my heart and calmed each throbbing pulse  i sat down by her took her trembling hand and said what does my emma mean  can i relieve her sorrows  her tears flowed more abundantly and for some minutes stopped her utterance  at length turning her head away from me she said yes charles thank heaven you can but do not let the present circumstance lessen my husband in your esteem no man is perfect and sir james has but one fault  he is too fond of play  there is an execution in our house this moment for seven hundred pounds  i would have joined with my husband to raise the money by relinquishing my jointure  but he would not listen to the proposal declaring he would perish in a gaol rather than injure me or our dear little fanny  he is indeed my brother the tenderest of husbands and of fathers  of those particulars emma said i you certainly are the best judge but have i not reason to resent sir jamess want of confidence in me why did he not prevent this disgrace to himself and family by acquainting me with his necessities  could he suppose me mean enough to suffer you to be distressed for any sum within my power to raise  ah charles she replied catching my hand the mind that feels its own reproach dreads to expose itself to that of others  they who have lost the fear of being contemned most generally deserve to be so  i will believe you reason justly emma and would not if i could refute your argument but time now presses  it is impossible that i can rest till my doom is pronounced by lady juliana  this night i must leave delville and am at present no otherways prepared to extricate you from your irksome situation than by taking the debt upon myself if your creditor will accept my security i am ready to give it but as i am not known to him he may perhaps object  if i could stay but three days longer it might be more easily accomplished for from some hints that have been dropped in relation to sir jamess circumstances i drew upon my banker for a thousand pounds but i cannot expect the bills should be returned to me till friday at the soonest  it is no matter she replied mr sewell will i doubt not gladly accept of your security is sewell then your creditor i exclaimed could he lodge an execution in the house under whose roof he dwells i know not how it is my brother but i believe the money was originally lost at play to mr sewell  sir james gave him a bond on which he raised the money from his brother who now exacts the payment in this severe manner  i fear then emma sewell is a knave and joined in mean collusion with his brother to distress your husband who looks upon him as his friend  you are deceived charles i am sure he is sir jamess friend and mine by his perpetually dissuading him from play  it may be so but tell me emma all you know and all you think of lady julianas sudden departure what can it mean  she replied i again repeat to you that i am as ignorant of lady julianas motives for her conduct as yourself  though to all appearance she has been perfectly blameless through the whole course of her life her actions have always been involved in a sort of mystery and seemingly inconsistent to my apprehension  my sister lucy may possibly be better acquainted with her sentiments than i am as she was very intimate with her even before her marriage she did not continue in that state above four months and though i had reason to believe she was an unhappy wife she lamented her husbands untimely death with such an extravagance of sorrow as placed her very nearly on a footing with the malabarian widows for her health was so much impaired by her grief that it was thought impossible she could recover nor have i ever seen her cheerful since her husband died  but from the moment she perceived your particular attachment her melancholy was increased and she has seemed twenty times upon the point of expressing her uneasiness at your constant assiduities for these last three days she appeared to be quite retired within herself and i have had so many disagreeable things to engross my thoughts that i was rather pleased at her reserve and did not attempt to draw her out of it  this morning she sent her woman to let me know that she wished to speak with me and that i should find her in the garden to which i instantly repaired she was seated in the temple by the rivers side leaning on her arm and seemed lost in thought when i approached her she started from her reverie and said  the ill fate that has ever attended me prevents my staying longer at delville or accompanying you to london i was born to create misery where i wish to confer happiness but i will not voluntarily increase the baneful influence of that malignant fatality which dwells around me  for this reason only do i now take a precipitate leave of you my dear lady desmond entreating you not to mention my departure till i have been gone some hours  i at first proceeded emma endeavored to rally her out of her resolution and told her that she seemed by her phrase to have been studying judicial astrology but that i was a greater conjuror than she took me for and assured her that i saw no baneful influence nor malignant fatality in her horoscope but on the contrary love joy and harmony proceeding from the little twinkling star that had directed her steps to delville from which place i earnestly entreated she would not depart till we all set out together  i had forced a smile into my countenance while i talked to her and did not till i had done speaking perceive that her eyes were filled with tears  she turned her face from me and stepping out of the temple said lady desmond has too much humanity to jest with the sorrows of her friend did she believe them real  and i have too much tenderness for her to convince her that they are so  again i take my leave wishing every good on earth to her and all that have the happiness to belong to her once more repeating my request of concealing my departure  the reason of this request must be sufficiently obvious to a person endowed with less perspicuity than are any of mr evelyns sisters  i need not proceed to relate emmas entreaties or lady julianas refusals  it is from me she flies  why then do i pursue her what a question do we not all pursue whatever eludes our wish and shun the bliss that meets it and sure if ever man was yet impelled by an irresistible impulse i am  you will perhaps smile at the seeming inconsistency of contenting myself with expressing my ardor through a long letter instead of indulging it by pursuing the fair fugitive but at present my impetuous passion is controuled by fraternal affection  i cannot leave my sister in distress and to relieve her from it i must wait the return of sir james desmond and his companions of the field  they are arrived i hear their boisterous and unmeaning mirth sir jamess voice sounds louder than the rest  thoughtless man  adieu my stanley c evelyn i find it impossible to set out this night  sewells brother is to be sent for  how cruel this delay i have this moment received your short billet accept my thanks in return they are all i have to offer my mind is too much disturbed to think on any subject but one and i have already tired you with that  i detest hazard and yet am going to play at it  they say it interests and agitates  i deny its power except on those whose minds are tainted with the meanest of all vices avarice  but i have a purpose in it which is not quite so selfish    letter x miss evelyn to lady juliana harley i do really and truly begin to think that you my dear lady juliana and all the rest of the world are agreed in believing that i am literally hewn out of a marble block and can bear disappointments and vexations as unfeelingly as the foresaid sturdy substance can endure the rokes of the hammer and the chissel but ye are all mistaken for i am and ver will be exceedingly grieved and provoked at the absurdities of my friends when they are either weak or malicious enough to interfere with my happiness or their own  why thou inhuman fair one what a roundeau of delights has thy caprice destroyed i could cry with vexation when i think of the dear little parties i had formed in your box at the opera your charles and my william with the lords a b c and so on to the end of the alphabet making their bends adorings  our suppers at almacks our private balls our masquerades but above all our quarres with our corydons in berkeleysquare  and can i bear the disappointment and all for what why truly because the thing in the world which was most likely to happen and which i most wished has actually come to pass  that charles evelyn should fall in love with lady juliana  o cruel cruel friend thou have almost broke my heart  but to be serious for whatever you may think i am by no means inclined to jest upon this subject what are these dreadful portents that have alarmed you and driven you at this season of the year to the very antipodes of our delights the chilling north if you really did not like my brother though i must say i see no reason why you should not you need not have given him any encouragement but merely suffered him to dangle after you till the beginning of next summer and by that time either he would have been tired of serving without wages or you would have been ashamed of acting a shabby part and so have paid the man for his pain and passion with your lovely self  for the sake of common sense my dear juliana think better of this business away with those glooms that should have been put off with your sables and order your chaise to london  you cannot imagine how much i am distressed for a chaperon  my sister selwyn is within a month or six weeks of lyingin and goes no where  my sister desmond is not come to town and when she does will be so taken up with her domestic concerns her child and her husband to be sure that i am not to expect much comfort from her  now you are to know as a very great secret that this is the last year of my reign  i feel that i must abdicate in spring if possible it shall not be till the ranelagh season is near over  but i must not trifle longer with stanley  you cannot conceive how i love him and yet i have now cookedup a most delicious quarrel about maria morton whom i know he detests and indeed so do all the men of her acquaintance merely to prevent his teizing me into matrimony at this time of the year when one has something else to do  i have now laid all my distresses before you and if your heart is not as much steeled to friendship as to love you will have pity on the sister though ever so obdurate to the brother and fly to the relief of your  lucy evelyn  letter xi charles evelyn to william stanley delville fate seems to oppose my every purpose stanley here am i still detained by drifting snows and piercing winds not that their force should stop my progress on my own account nor storms nor night should keep me here  but that fellow sewells brother who derives his greatness from that of his debtors and says like cacofogo the king of spain owes me money will not set out from his cottage though it is but eighteen miles off till the weather mends forsooth  and here must i wait like st laurence on the gridiron till his usurership arrives   i sat down to hazard as i told you last night determined like our former kings on a twelfth night if possible to lose a thousand pounds to sir james and make that sum a debt which must otherwise be deemed a courtesy  but here chance unluckily opposed my pupose  fortune as she is called favored or rather disappointed me i won every thing the baronet and both his companions are my debtors  n b sewell has again recovered some part of my esteem he lost his money like a gentleman  one must borrow similies when they cannot frame them  the other one simpson who they say is rich seemed to suffer the most dreadful agonies and sometimes vented his feelings in horrid imprecations o stanley how is it possible that a rational being should ever put himself a second time into such a situation as to render him at once both unhappy and contemptible   your letter has most agreeably interrupted my moralizing  thanks to my friend for his punctuality i will this moment go and present the bills to emma sir james is not yet risen if i can quit delville without seeing him it will save both him and me from an equal embarrassment yet their is something tells me that my going sans adieu may in his present situation perhaps offend the baronet and all impatient as i am i will stay breakfast  beyond the fixed and settled rules  this little business is finished and if i could describe the grateful tenderness with which emma received the present you would be charmed with the portrait stanley  sir james desmond too seemed to accept it from her hands with more sensibility and dignity than i imagined him possessed of  does not our selflove sometimes suppose merits where we bestow our favors in order to heighten our own pleasure in the act of benevolence  i am not at leisure now to investigate the philosophy of this idea but i am persuaded that we are generally more strongly attached to those we have obliged than even to those who have obliged us  is it not usury then to expect gratitude not that i would encourage the modern philosophy which reduces all virtue to selfinterest for if i may hazard an unborrowed simile the liberal mind may be compared to the nile which enriches the soil from its own abundance without requiring any return  adieu for a few hours  c evelyn  letter xii miss evelyn to lady juliana harley clargesstreet i have often heard that love makes wise men fools and turns our wits the seamy side without  poor charles it was almost midnight when he arrived here last night pale as ashes his eyes wild and haggard and his hair undressed my sister selwyn had not been well all day and was retired to rest  the moment he came into the parlour where i was sitting he cried out where is she lucy gone to bed said i thinking he enquired after mrs selwyn  do not torture me he replied but tell me where is lady juliana  a strange question truly answered i surely you have seen her long since i did  i spoke this in a miff for i thought he might have first enquired his sisters health after an absence of above a month  quite frantic he threw himself at my feet and said he would not stir from thence till i informed him where you were for that stanley had told him he believed i knew  mem i shall punish mr stanley pretty handsomely for pretending to guess at my secrets mr selwyn who was in his library in the next room composing a sermon for ought i know alarmed by the noise this inamorato made peeped into the parlour with his glasses on and seeing a man at my feet seemed doubtful whether he should retire or advance till i entreated him to come in assuring him it was not a lover but a lunatic he beheld in that situation  you are mistaken lucy charles exclaimed i am the tenderest fondest most unhappy lover that ever yet existed and if you have not a mind to drive me to distraction you will acquaint me where my deity resides and let me kneel before the shrine which she inhabits with purest adoration  psha very profane that said mr selwyn  for heavens sake charles said i rise and compose yourself  you must be very certain that if lady juliana had entrusted me with any thing she chose to keep a secret i would not violate the trust by revealing it to you you can therefore receive no benefit from mr stanleys information but whatever are her motives for retirement i hope they will not operate long and that she will be restored to the society of her friends in a few days or weeks at farthest  days or weeks exclaimed he  you talk of centuries i tell you lucy i will not rest till i behold her  nay then said mr selwyn i shall wish you a good night it will be vain for me to sit up any longer but if you choose to pass the night without sleep i will order the servants to mend the fire bring you fresh candles and go to bed for they must rise in the morning i could not help smiling at mr selwyns literal conception of my brothers expression  charles seemed much offended with both of us and rushed out of the room without even bidding us good night  now madam what do you think of the mischief your cruelty or caprice rather has occasioned may i not say with ophelia o what a noble mind is here overthrown and have i not a right in common justice to demand the restoration of my brothers senses from your ladyship or some other averdupois equivalent for the loss in short my dear juliana if you have any friendship for me you will immediately come to london and make an end of this simple business  if you cannot like my brother tell him so and perhaps the wound which his selflove must receive from your denial may rouse him to attempt the conquest of an hopeless passion  i am rather surprised at not having seen my poor lunatic today my sister selwyn is quite grieved about him and sent this morning to know how he did and to invite him to dinner  but the servant returned with a non inventus  he had drove out of town  whither can he have taken his flight mr selwyn thinks he ought to be put under doctor monros care but i make bold to say that you and only you can effect his cure  hasten then my sweet friend to the relief both of charles and  lucy evelyn  letter xiii charles evelyn to william stanley bath no stanley she is not here and this place though througed with numbers of the young and gay is to me a desert yet i confess there was a probability of meeting or at least hearing of her in such a concourse of people of her own rank  yet no tidings of her have yet reached me  pardon me stanley if i say that i can hardly forgive your lucy  i will not call her my sister  she certainly knows where lady juliana is and yet is so inhuman to conceal it from me  surely you must have power sufficient over her to make her reveal the secret be assured if she refuses to let you know it she is not worthy of your affection for i am certain it is impossible for a woman to deny any thing to the solicitations of the man she loves this maxim is too frequently proved to admit of its being doubted but what a wretch is he who takes advantage of its certainty to betray unsuspecting innocence or to involve the being he pretends to love in misery and guilt  i have been led into this reflection by the unsought confidence of our schoolfellow capt williams whom i happened to meet with here and who is a very libertine and at present engaged in an unworthy attempt on a young lady his equal in birth though not in fortune she has a brother in the army who is expected daily from ireland and the apprehension of his arrival hurries williams into the most imprudent conduct so that the young lady will probably lose her reputation if her brother should even come time enough to protect her innocence  i have expressed my sentiments upon this subject very fully to him but he only laughs at what i say except when i mention the certainty of the young ladys brother calling him to account for his ill behavior this part of the ceremony he says he does not like but has asked me to be his second in case he should be involved in such an adventure but i have declined the honor for the punctilio should be shown in avoiding an offense not in defending it  is it not amazing that a man should premeditately rush on to an action that his heart must condemn even at the hazard of his life anxious and unhappy as my mind is at present if i had the least acquaintance with the young lady i would do every thing in my power to save her from destruction but he has had honor or rather prudence enough to conceal her name and it is of course impossible for me to interfere further  once more let me entreat you to exert your utmost influence with lucy to make her discover lady julianas retreat and i here pawn my honor both to her and you that if after one interview her ladyship should persist in dooming me to perpetual banishment i will obey the stern decree will instantly quit england and never more obtrude myself into her presence   surely if lucy loves her friend she will be satisfied with this proposal  adieu c evelyn  letter xiv william stanley to charles evelyn i am sincerely sorry for your disappointment my dear charles though more surprised at the effect than cause as i could not possibly suppose that if lady juliana seriously meant to fly from you she could think of retiring to so public a place as bath  but i own i flattered myself that the peculiar gaiety of a scene so entirely new to you would have dissipated the chagrin you seem to feel from her flight or that some new object would have attracted your attention and engaged you in a less tiresome pursuit  but i find you are a brisk huntsman and are determined to pursue the sport though you have missed the quarry  i would by all means advise you to drink the bath water it is famous for exhilerating the spirits but if that should fail drink wine i entreat you  i have known many an unsuccessful passion cured by the bumpers that were filled to the obdurate fairones health wine is the modern lethe charles and as gay says  can banish care and cure despair if i had any better comfort to offer you i should not perhaps so strongly recommend the above recipe but indeed my friend i must beg to be excused from obeying the request you have so strenuously made to me for i never shall exert my influence over the woman i love to tempt her to an act of dishonor and such i hold a breach of confidence to be  and were i married to your charming sister  delightful thought i should esteem her still the more for preserving the secrets of her friends inviolate even from me  nothing but the romantic passion with which you are infected can excuse your condemning my lucy gladly do i accept the term for not betraying lady julianas confidence and give me leave to say that this passion has rendered your conduct both unjust and absurd toward the object of it  lady juliana has acted nobly and shown herself superior to the meanness and cruelty of coquetry she has even sacrificed her own happiness to yours by depriving herself of the society of her friends to enable you to conquer an hopeless passion  believe me charles women speak but too plain when they decline our company and i think it is high time that you should ask yourself what right you have to break in upon her retirement and compel her to receive your visits  your only plea is that she did not reject the addresses of your brother perhaps it is for that very reason that she declines yours  allow me to say that harry was to the full as amiable as you are  now surely it is not impossible that lady juliana might have loved your brother and if so can you imagine that her affections are to descend with the family estate to the next heir  for shame charles rouse your reason and cease to persecute this charming woman  she has already by all accounts suffered too much the sudden and yet unaccounted for death of her husband brought her almost to the brink of the grave though every one knew it was impossible she could love him yet her conduct toward him has ever been unimpeached and what must the delicacy of her mind have suffered from living with a man whom she could not avoid detesting  women have infinitely more merit in such cases than men  we are rarely if ever compelled to marry against our inclinations but if interest too often more powerful than any other attraction prevails on us to unite ourselves to a disagreeable object we are generally so inhuman as to make her suffer for the crime we have ourselves committed by punishing her with neglect or perhaps a worse species of ill treatment  whilst the poor girl who has been led an unwilling victim to hymens altar can have no safe resource but sighs and tears no indulgence is allowed to any former or future passion she may feel her affections must be restrained by the magical ceremony of marriage within her own bosom because she cannot confer them on a wretch she detests and must not dare to bestow them elsewhere  i am sorry that williams is a scoundrel such i think any man who lays a scheme to destroy innocence but since knight errantry is exploded and that the young ladies of our siecle are pretty well enlightened in matters of gallantry we must even leave them to take care of themselves  but as you so justly condemn his conduct i am pleased with your having refused to be his second  the man who appears in that character is always supposed to approve the cause of his friends quarrel  besides if you should engage in any such business you well know what you must necessarily suffer from parson selwyns preachments against the damnable sin of duelling  think on this and keep clear of the consequences  yours sincerely w stanley p s your quondam friend maria morton has made a runaway match with a young foreigner a monsieur du pont whom she has deceived by passing for a great fortune  in reality she is worse than a beggar as the little estate that is to come to her after her mothers death is involved for its full value by debts contracted for the indulgence of marias extravagance i pity lady morton much but the young man more    letter xv charles evelyn to william stanley dear stanley i have received your friendly may i not rather say your chiding letter i acknowledge the unreasonableness of my pursuit but when had reason power to conquer love  yet in behalf of my own weakness give me leave to say that acting as you think upon wrong principles by endeavoring to obtrude myself into lady julianas presence i have however shown much moderation by limiting my pursuit to a single interview  i am not a baslisk stanley the sight of me will not destroy this lovely woman and it is necessary i should first know her will before i can obey it  it is true my friend she has shown herself superior to coquetry and has voluntarily exiled herself from those gay scenes in which she ought to shine perhaps to shun my hated sight  then is it not incumbent upon me to restore her to an admiring world to the society of those she loves  o why alas am i not of that happy number  you will answer me that passion is involuntary  i know it but too well you seem to hint that she once loved my brother is that a reason for her hating me there is no rivalship between us now his passions are at peace and if he died possessed of her affections he was much happier than your living friend  you are a lover stanley but a calm because an happy one  lucy repays your tenderness and naught but worldly prudence now impedes your union for this reason you treat my sufferings lightly for even the tenderest simpathy of friendship cannot feel for woes it never has experienced  there is no lethe for unhappy love and let me add en philosophe that wine enflames but never cures our passions  i shall not therefore my kind physician venture upon your recipe but i will save you the trouble of a father prescription by following my own regimen and ceasing to complain  i have met with a tender sympathizing friend and confidante here  i shall be angry if you smile stanley when i tell you it is nancy weston  i never saw joy so strongly painted in any countenance as hers when she met me our surprise was mutual but luckily this unexpected interview happened about eight oclock in the morning and we had no spectators to restrain or comment upon the strong expressions of a grateful heart  she told me before i went to delville that she was very capable of the millinery business having formerly lived some time with a relation of hers who had kept a shop in tavistockstreet but who was now dead  i then told her that if she could find out any method of establishing herself properly in business i would assist her with the means of carrying it on and left her a few guineas to clothe and support her till my return  during the few hours i spent in london before i came here my mind was so violently agitated that i never once thought of nancy weston and the poor girls modesty would have prevented her from ever applying to me or being farther burdensome as she expresses it had not chance thrown her in my way at this time  she works with a very creditable chamber milliner who had known her formerly at her cousins and who will take her into partnership with a few hundreds which she shall have with an hearty welcome into the bargain for i think i need not tell you that her happiness will contribute to mine  that puppy williams has been witty upon hearing that an handsome milliners doll as he calls her drank tea with me on sunday last  he happened to call upon me that evening and my trusty scipio refused to admit him though he would not make the common excuse of saying i was not at home  he has teized me ever since with a deal of unmeaning ribaldry and presses me most vehemently to introduce him to my favorite but that i never shall she is much too good and amiable to be the sport of such a libertine  if he may be credited which i much doubt he has been successful in his amor  he no longer conceals the ladys name it is harrison he showed her to me in the rooms  i never saw a more elegant form nor a more lively countenance  when he saluted her she smiled and blushed  can it be possible that guilt should assume that first of female charms the joint result of senfibility and modesty  she danced a minuet with lord march and then took out captain williams  she acquitted herself in both the minuets with infinite grace and ease  surely it is impossible she could be conscious of having forfeited her honor and yet still continue to wear the semblance of cheerful innocence  as she did not dance country dances i joined her party and drank tea with her  i talked to her a considerable time and though i think there is too much levity in her manner i cannot prevail upon myself to believe that she has fallen a sacrifice to such a contemptible trifler as williams mrs peachurn says how are those mothers to be pitied who have handsome daughters i say how are those handsome girls to be pitied who have not mothers miss harrison has been an orphan from her birth her father was one of those gallant but unfortunate officers who lost their lives with braddock her mother was then pregnant of this girl  she lived but a few hours after she received the account of her husbands loss and expired in the moment of her daughters birth  there is something so affecting in the circumstances of both her parents deaths that has inspired me with a kind of additional tenderness toward her  i pity and will if not too late preserve her  i have received a letter from my loved emma by which i can discover that she is unhappy  sir james desmond is again involved in difficulties she has not particularized the circumstances nor given the least hint of expecting any assistance from me  does she not know i am her brother  assure mrs selwyn and your lucy of my affectionate regard and believe me sincerely yours  c evelyn  letter xvi william stanley to charles evelyn bravo bravo charles i am delighted beyond expression to find you like hudibras profiting of ralphos gifts at the very time you seem to disdain them  sly as you are i will bet an hundred guineas to five that before you sat down to indite your last epistle you had drank a couple of glasses of bath water or double that number of champagne  but no matter for the cause i congratulate you on the effect and will from thence take upon me to pronounce that your lovership is in a fair way of recovery  three whole pages without the name of juliana or the word love i should have been amazed indeed at this happy change in your style if you had not lessened my surprise by mentioning your little tender sympathizing confidante  o charles there is nothing like true female softness it is the very balm of life for when pity flows from beautiful lips who would not receive comfort gratitude too must have animated her speech glowed on her cheek and sparkled in her eyes i would have given fifty guineas to have been a witness of your accidental interview  you are a lucky man to have met with this charming girl for such i suppose her to be so critically  i think you are too severe upon williams it was natural enough for him to rally you a little considering the gravity of your character upon teteatete with a young woman especially as you make such a mystery of your connection and had refused to introduce him to her acquaintance in which however i think you perfectly right men of his character look upon all women who are placed in a situation beneath them as lawful prey whereas i consider that part of the softer sex whom fortune has dealt unkindly by whose principles and manners are more elevated than their station as peculiarly entitled to our respect and protection and could more easily forgive myself for a failure in a point of politeness toward a duchess than to a woman who is unhappy enough to feel her present condition a degradation from her former rank  i dont much like to introduce the subject of your passion for lady juliana but believe me if you are as you say sufficiently reasonable to be contented with one interview a little more reason will enable you to be contented without one  i heartily wish that was the case for my lucy is quite unhappy and dissatisfied at being deprived of lady julianas society and now openly declares that you are the sole cause of her exile  be generous charles and restore her to her friends without conditions  trust to chance for your meeting and to the nobleness of her sentiments when you do  the portrait you have drawn of miss harrison is by no means decisive with regard to her present situation  gaiety or gravity are in a great measure constitutional  i consider too great an addiction to the first as a misfortune rather than a fault but am far from thinking that liveliness and innocence are incompatible  too great freedom of speech or manner in a young woman certainly lessens the respect which is otherwise due to her it enfranchises the bounds that are placed between the sexes puts them too much on a level and tempts libertines to hazard improper freedoms which though rejected and resented necessarily sully the purity of female delicacy and leave a stain behind  for as lady mary wortley montague has justly said he comes too near who comes to be denied williams is certainly a worthless wretch and i heartily wish that capt harrison may treat him as he deserves but i dont see why you should take the work off his hands and thrust yourself into a scrape unless it be merely pour passer le temps  but if i might advise i should think you had better look out for some better amusement and can hardly seek amiss  joy to you charles mrs selwyn was yesterday brought to bed of a son i suppose you will be one of its sponsors and must of course appear in propria persona mr selwyn is you know a formal divine and will not admit of proxies  i was sitting with him when the glad tidings of his sons birth were announced to him he instantly rang his bell and summoned all the servants who were not immediately attending on his lady to prayers  i attempted to retire but he insisted upon my joining in thanksgiving for the birth of a male child which he said was an happy event let the parents be who they would  you have made me as errant a scribbler as yourself and i could go on in this sort of chitchat way for a year together but i have at present a more important though not a more pleasing occupation to pursue my lawsuit draws near a crisis i must pore over musty records and revise briefs in which i shall use the utmost dispatch as my lucy is then to be my fee  adieu my friend till i can call you brother  w stanley  letter xvii charles evelyn to william stanley my dear stanley i have seized upon the first minutes leisure i have been master of to acquaint you with an unlucky affair that has just now happened and which like all other extraordinary events will i suppose be aggravated in the repetition by a thousand falsehoods to you then i commit the care of my fame upon this occasion certain that you will exert the noblest quality of friendship in my favor that of justifying an absent friend  in order to make you thoroughly acquainted with this unfortunate business i must entreat you to read over the enclosed story of nancy weston which i wrote out some time ago as i received it from her own recital intending it for your perusal  the story of miss weston her father died when she was about fourteen and left to her and her mother in money and effects about seven hundred pounds her mother did not survive his loss above a year and when dying recommended her daughter to the care of a relation who kept a milliners shop in tavistockstreet  with her nancy weston lived perfectly happy for two years till she became acquainted with a young gentleman whom she had often seen a schoolboy at winchester though she had never spoken to him there  he endeavored to persuade her that he had been in love with her from her childhood and used every art to gain her affections and seduce her virtue  in the first he succeeded but too well but she continued proof against every temptation to become his mistress  the only expedient then left to get her into his power was to propose a marriage which he accordingly offered and as they were both under age a journey to scotland was agreed upon  they set off in the usual runaway mode but her lover had ordered the postilions to travel westward instead of northward and when they arrived at birmingham he told her they were then at berwick upon tweed and procured a person in the habit of a clergyman to perform the marriage ceremony  the innocent girl had not the least suspicion of the deceit and returned to london perfectly happy in the firm belief of her being legally married to the man she loved  during their journey both going and coming back he had charged her whenever she was out of his sight to keep a handkerchief close to her mouth and not to utter a syllable to any of the maidservants who attended her this command she had punctually obeyed though the caution was unnecessary for as she had no doubts she would not have made any enquiries   on their return to town he took lodgings for her in a little street near marybone and told her that she must be contented to live in the utmost privacy and retirement and by no means to assume his name or reveal herself to her relation in tavistockstreet as his father was living and would certainly disinherit him if his marriage was discovered  to these prudent restrictions she readily agreed and spent a year almost in the closest consinement hardly ever stirring out but at a very early hour in the morning or in the dusk of the evening  during this period of time she lay in of a daughter which increased her happiness by affording her constant employment in suckling and attending her and made the tedious hours of her husbands frequent absences pass with less regret away   as soon as they were married he possessed himself of the little fortune that her parents had left her mrs weston not having appointed any trustee and the money being placed in the funds  as his fondness abated his supplied toward her declined and she has frequently had no other subsistence for many days than bread and tea  in this inhuman manner did the monster continue to treat the unhappy girl for near two years till at length upon her venturing gently to remonstrate against his barbarity to his child and her he informed her that she was not any longer to consider herself as his wife and openly confessed the deceit he had practiced against her  the wretched victim became senseless at the shock she received from this discovery in which state he left her and when she had recovered her reason the woman of the house informed her that the gentleman whom she had hitherto called her husband had discharged the lodgings and desired her not to give her any farther credit on his account as he had turned her off and was going abroad for three years  think my dear stanley what the wretched nancy weston must have suffered at that instant and then tell me if you think there is any punishment too severe to be inflicted upon the fiend who caused her sufferings  the agonies of her mind drove her almost to despair and had not her maternal tenderness prevailed over her sorrows she would have terminated them and life together but her child was innocent was helpless and was dear to her and she virtuously resolved to struggle through every misery of life to arn the means of its support  she immediately stripped herself of every little valuable she possessed in order to discharge her maid and some other trifling debts which she owed in the neighborhood that done she determined to remove as far from her present situation as possible that she might not be reproached with the slander that her cruel husband had thrown upon her  this left her little to carry with her except her infant which she took in her arms to a twopair of stairs back room that she hired in the borough and then making herself as decent as her scanty wardrobe would permit she set out for tavistockstreet to acquaint her relation with her melancholy circumstances and entreat her to furnish her with work to enable her to subsist herself and her child to complete her miseries when she arrived at the house she found it oucupied by persons she did not know and was informed that her cousin had been dead above a year before  the elegance of her figure and dejection of her countenance interested the woman of the shop so far that she told her if the people in whose house she lodged or any other person of credit would be bound for her she would take her into the house as an assistant or furnish her with as much work as she could do  the unhappy girl knowing that she had no friend that would be responsible for her burst into tears thanked her and withdrew  the good womans heart sympathizing with her distress she recalled her and said for once she would trust to her skill in physiognomy and require no security from her but her face which she believed an honest one then gave her a capuchin to make  and my poor nancy returned home with the pleasing and virtuous prospect of independance through the means of honest industry  but misfortune was not inclined to relinquish its victim  for as she returned over westminster bridge with hasty steps to succor her child she was encompassed by a mob who had secured a pickpocket and were going to administer the supplemental discipline or common law of ducking to the culprit but as soon as she could get clear of this riotous assembly she found to her cost that the ministers of justice are not always free from the very vices they correct for one of this selferected tribunal had cut off her pockets in which was every farthing she possessed and what was still a far greater loss the capuchin which the compassionate prepossession of a generous mind had ventured to entrust her with  on discovering her loss the fiend was instantly at her elbow tempting her to wait till the mob should be dispersed and then throw herself into the thames  at that moment the cries of an infant struck her ear and instantly awakened all the mother in her almost frantic with grief she turned her back upon the shocking scene and with an agonizing heart reached her wretched home  she recollected that she had a silk gown almost as good as new it originally cost about five guineas and she did not doubt but she should be able to sell it for three  but there again she was disappointed the harpies in monmouthstreet would not give her more than one guinea and a half for it which she well knew would not pay for the materials of the capuchin she had lost  at length by stripping herself of almost the whole of her wearing apparel she was enabled to raise the sum of three pounds and went with it directly to her humane employer in tavistockstreet who listened to her tale with seeming incredulity said she was sorry for her misfortune but if she was subject to such accidents she could not venture to furnish her with any more work  she then received the full price for her silk and dismissed her giving her half a crown and a vast deal of good advice against evil company and bad ways  i will not dwell longer on the various scenes of wretchedness this poor creature passed through till her child fell ill of the smallpox and then all her former woes were swallowed up in her tender apprehension for its little life  during its illness she parted with even the common necessaries of raiment she had left and denied herself food to administer to its sustenance her fond maternal cares were all in vain providence was pleased to take her little darling she submitted with resignation to its loss when she reflected on the evils that must necessarily await it  life was now become a load that she determined to lay down but there needed no act of violence to hasten her dissolution famine and grief had seized upon her heart and in a few hours she would perhaps have resigned her gentle spirits into his hands who gave it had she been permitted to sigh it out in peace  but the woman in whose house she had lodged for a month was now perfectly convinced of her inability to pay and therefore demanded her rent in the most boisterous terms and threatened to send her immediately to a gaol upon her noncompliance the being a prisoner was the only species of calamity she had not yet experienced her mind was impressed with horror at the idea and whilst her worse than savage landlady went out to seek a constable she stole softly out of the house and fled she knew not whither  providence directed her steps to the park in that auspicious moment that i met her which i shall always consider as one of the fortunate events of my life here ends her little history  and now for mine   in my last i told you that i meant to settle this poor friendless creature in partnership with a chamber milliner of good repute  in consequence of this design nancy weston came to me yesterday morning to talk over her little plan of business and adjust all matters relative to it  be it observed that she never had once named the person to whom she had been married nor had i ever asked it  delicacy prevented my making any enquiry when she first told me her story lest my curiosity might be miscontrued into a suspicion of her veracity and my contempt for a man whom i supposed could never come across me made me decline the renewal of a subject which must give her pain  this upon my honor is truth  as i said before she was sitting with me when i heard a bustle upon the stairs between capt williams and scipio the former insisting in a laughing tone that he would come up she started at the sound of the voice but when he threw open the door of the room where we sat she cried out o my husband  and sunk senseless on the ground  williams gazed upon her with a countenance where rage and contempt seemed equally mingled  then turning to me who was just then raising his unhappy wise in my arms he said you need not sir have made a secret to me of your connection with that infamous woman i have long cast her off and it is natural to suppose she has passed through many hands before she came into yours  but beware mr evelyn of repeating any forged tale she may tell you of a sham marriage and such stuff for i will not have my character traduced and remember i have put you on your guard  my astonishment had almost deprived me of the power of speech but williamss insolence quickly restored it  i replied sir this roof which i wish you to quit instantly is your present protection but whenever i speak of you i shall talk of a scoundrel and wherever i meet you i will treat you like one  his wife had by this time thrown herself at his feet from whence he spurned her and rushing into my bedchamber snatched up one of my pistols which lay upon a table  i was lucky enough to seize his arm before he could discharge it but in the struggle between us it went off and wounded himself in the left side  the report of the pistol alarmed the family and in less than five minutes my apartment was crowded with persons of all ranks and denominations whose curiosity seemed so much more prevalent than their humanity that they neither thought of sending for a surgeon for the wounded person nor of offering any assistance to his wife who lay fainting upon the ground by his side  scipio upon seeing that i was safe leaped for joy and then ran for mr lester williams was put into my bed i committed mrs williams for so i shall henceforth call her to the care of my landlady and set out in company with mr herbert and my quondam friend sewell who arrived at bath three days ago to related this accident to the mayor the usual forms were complied with these gentlemen became bail for my appearance as i could not think of asking mrs williams to give her testimony upon this occasion to acquit me and her husband has not uttered a single word since he received the wound however mr lester says he hopes he shall be able to extract the ball and he will then be in a fair way of recovery if with his health he recovers the right use of his reason and reviews his past life with contrition i shall rejoice in his restoration if not i shall by no means lament the extinction of such a wretch from society  i have had a message from miss harrison desiring to see me the moment i have sealed this i shall attend her  i fear it will be an unpleasant interview  i think you will give me credit for being heartily tired of writing  i fear you will believe it feelingly  i sincerely wish success to your lawsuit and am with love to all you love ever yours  c evelyn  letter xviii charles evelyn to william stanley york i have seen her stanley the arbitress of my fate and it is irrecoverably fixed that i am to be unhappy  sewell informed me that lady juliana was certainly at her late husbands seat at harleyhill  i set out on the instant but i have not now time to acquaint you with the particulars of our interview as i have only snatched up the pen while the horses are putting to my chaise in order to retrace the horrid cross roads that i have traveled from bath hither  an express is this moment arrived from sewell to acquaint me that williams is not likely to recover and expresses the most impatient desire to see me  i feel that i shall be sorry for his death though it comes not near my conscience  i have not been in bed these three nights  what should i do there rest has forsaken my pillow i am more in love more distracted and more wretched than any mortal out of the purlieus of bedlam  adieu c evelyn  letter xix lady juliana harley to miss lucy evelyn harleyhill the so much dreaded interview is over i have seen your unhappy brother  do not think me inhuman lucy when i say that i hope never to see him more  it is my tenderness and not my cruelty that dictates this fervent aspiration  i was just returned from taking the air with miss harley who has been here this fortnight and was retired to dress when a chaise drove up to the door and i was informed a gentleman desired to see me as watson was at that time combing my hair i requested miss harley to step into the drawing room and make my apologies for a few minutes  she returned almost on the instant screaming out it is the ghost of evelyn  the likeness between your brothers immediately occurred to me at once accounted for her mistake and acquainted me with the name of my visitor i quieted her fears of an apparition and begged her to return to the drawing room  i was seized with an universal tremor and when watson had hurried on my clothes i found myself unable to walk or stand and desired that mr evelyn might be shown into the dressing room  as he approached me i made a vain effort to rise and i thought we appeared like two criminals who waited a sentence which they dreaded to receive  before i could prevent him he threw himself at my feet and entreated my pardon for having broken in on my retirement and said he had great reason to fear that he was the unhappy cause of my secluding myself from the world ah lucy have you betrayed me i told him with great sincerity that retirement was by no means disagreeable to me and that it was so long since i had been engaged in the gaiety of london that i feared i should make but an indifferent figure there  he said many civil things in answer which i shall not repeat and proceeded to avow his passion for me in the tenderest terms i would have interrupted him but he implored me to give him a patient hearing declaring that if i persisted in declining his addresses he would immediately quit england his family and friends and never more disturb the happiness he so sincerely wished me i was affected even to tears his looks his manner nay his voice pierced to my heart and recalled the kindred image of one who will ever survive there  i would erase this passage were i writing to any other person breathing  but let it go i scorn disguise with thee  i then told him that i was highly sensible of the honor he did me that i had not the least doubt of the sincerity of his regard and therefore would not trifle with his passion but heartily inform him that there was a bar an everlasting bar between us which could not be removed  but that if my promising never to enter into those engagements with any other person which i declined with him could make him happy he might depend upon my word provided he would in return give up the thoughts of abandoning his country family and friends on my account but endeavor to conquer his illplaced passion and never speak to me upon the unhappy subject more  he said he had already bound himself to abide by my decision though misery should be his doom but that he would by no means consent to my becoming a sacrifice to a wretch whom he was sure i detested though compassion for his sufferings might incline me to so generous a proposal and that all he could do in return was with humility to reject the offer and to rid me of his hated presence for that he never could subscribe to a falsehood by saying he could see me and cease to love  he turned his head aside to hide the manly drops that filled his eyes wiped them away gazed on me for an instant gave a deep sigh and bowing left me  i cannot describe the situation of my mind at that instant tears luckily came to my relief and when miss harley came into my dressing room i appeared more like a forsaken than a cruel mistress  she triumphed in my distress and sneering said what are you always to weep for an evelyn   i shall conclude this tedious letter with entreating that mrs selwyn lady desmond and you will exert your utmost influence over mr evelyn to prevail on him not to quit england believe me my dear lucy i am perfectly contented to remain where i am the gay scenes you describe have no charms for me or if they had much rather would i deprive myself of them and even your loved society than rob you of your brother  adieu my dear my cheerful happy friend long may you continue so fervently wishes your affectionate  j harley  letter xx miss evelyn to lady juliana harley why surely since the days of cassandra and orondates and such other silly gentlemen and ladies of absurd memory there never was and i hope never will be such a pair of ridiculous noodles as lady juliana harley and charles evelyn  whilst i read your letter my face was like an april sky half cloud half sunshine  i could have laughed but that i was vexed and i could have cried but that i was angry  fie charles i hate your weeping men yet i dont know why their tears affect one more than those of our own sex but what business have i to reason about such nonsense i am sure it will never be in my power to make stanley cry though i think i should like mightily to see him pout first and then blubber for he has not a good crying face and i am certain i should laugh at him  and so because your ladyship for what reason i cannot tell does not happen to like my poor unfortunate brother he forsooth must transport himself into some foreign country and you must remain locked up with that spiteful old sybil your sisterinlaw in your impenetrable fortress at harleyhill  ridiculous as if there was not room enough for you and charles evelyn to dwell in this great city without ever meeting for twenty years endways and i will warrant you by that time that if you should chance to knock your heads together you will not tremble nor he weep unless the concussion should happen to be violent indeed  thank you lady juliana you are vastly good indeed to confess your passion for my poor dead brother in order to excuse your cruelty to my poor living one  but i will not accept of such cold confidence  tell me thou little sly one who is the present possessor of your heart or i shall certainly persuade myself that it has been captivated by some yorkshire squire that you are ashamed of your choice and therefore make a merit of living in shades with him and love alone i like that idea well enough and i fancy i could be romantic if i would give myself time but i have not leisure  and show me to the company must serve my turn  we have had rare doings at our house  a son and heir born to the noble family of the selwyns and how do you think we have testiied our joy upon this occasion neither by dancing singing or any other act of festivity i assure you but by wearing out our knees and my poor sisters spirits in praying by her bedside twice a day at least  but to abate my spirits upon this joyful event lady desmond writes me word that sir james does not choose to come to london this winter and she like a gentle turtle as she is prefers the leasless woods of delville with her caro sposo to all the delights of this gay city without him  by the way their house has been aired and ready to receive them this month past  i have a great mind to take possession of it and set up for myself  if i dont do that i must absolutely marry stanley that i may be able to a go a little into the world for i am quite weary of waiting for a chaperon  well if i do marry i will show you all the difference my whole time shall be spent in matronizing young ladies unmarried ones i mean  poor things they are much to be pitied for even a damsel of threescore who has never had an husband must not venture into a public place unless she can persuade some goodnatured married girl who might perhaps be her granddaughter to let her tag after her  poor charles i will beg of him when i see him not to transport himself but transportation is better than hanging and i think as a despairing lover he is bound in honor to do something of that sort  once more i entreat you if you have either love or regard for me to leave your musty castle and come amongst us i have a very particular reason for desiring it stanley has got a verdict in his favor he grows importunate i fear i must yield like all bullies i feel myself a coward and shall never be able to keep up my spirits on the tremendous occasion if you do not lend your assistance  the very idea has sunk me to the center i can no more but adieu  lucy evelyn  letter xxi william stanley to charles evelyn my dear charles i have received both your letters and am sincerely concerned for the very disagreeable situation you are in  with regard to williamss accident you are by no means accountable for it  but had your hand directed the bullets which were lodged in his side after reading nancy westons story i should not only have acquitted but applauded you for ridding the world of such a monster  but as i think his blood would stain any hands but those of an executioner i am glad he has done justice on himself particularly as our legislature have not assigned a punishment for crimes like his though to the full as fatal in their consequences as any of those for which men suffer death  my indignation and pity were both extremely moved whilst i perused your little novel such would i fain think it for the honor of human nature  but facts are stubborn things and i must though unwillingly submit to be ranked of the same species with a villain who could first rob his wife and then leave her and his child to perish  though i would by no means have advised your pursuing lady juliana to her retreat i congratulate you on the conclusion of your romance for surely my friend will now exert himself to conquer a passion which he must own it would be the height of folly to indulge any further  my lucy for proudly do i now look up to a possession of that title dearer far than crowns has received a long letter from your cruel fairone as yet she keeps the contents of it secret but as i hope the day is not far off when we shall be but one i may possibly be acquainted with the particulars of your interview without putting you to the pain of relating them and believe me charles the less you think talk or write upon this subject the better  we all help to engrave our misfortunes on our hearts by bearing them constantly in mind and recurring back to them daily as if we were incapable of turning our thoughts to any other subject  the report of williamss accident has not yet made its way into clargesstreet and you may assure yourself i shall not be the first to promulgate the intelligence for many and good reasons  heavens how would selwyn preach and how terrified would your sisters be  the few persons i have heard mention the affair have been candid enough to suppose that the pistol went off by accident but they all believe that jealousy of a favorite mistress was the occasion of his snatching it up  fear not my friendship charles upon this or any other occasion though i both hope and believe this is the only one i shall ever have to prove it  you know i allow but two tests of this generous affection the not hearing ones friend abused and the sharing ones purse with him  you must be a spendthrift indeed if you should ever have recourse to mine  yet i have some apprehensions of your exhausting your own if you continue to supply sir james desmonds necessities which i hear and fear to be very great thee are no limits to a gamesters wants or a misers wishes and prudence should restrain us from casting wealth into a bottomless pit  if you did not know my heart to be as generous as your own i would not venture to speak thus freely but the large drafts you have lately made in favor of sir james desmond have alarmed my friendship so far as to make me wish to awaken your discretion  i suppose that sewell is come to follow his laudable vocation at bath as there was nothing left for him to prey upon at delville  i cannot help it charles but i detest that man  i give you joy my friend of my success i have obtained a verdict and shall immediately be put into possession of a fortune sussicient to gratify every honest wish of the human heart  may my lucy add value to its worth by deigning to accept the full enjoyment of it  i impatiently wish to hear of your safe return to bath  and am most truly yours w stanley  letter xxii charles evelyn to william stanley bath my spirits have been kept in so constant an agitation for some time past by the disagreeable scenes i have been engaged in that i know not whether i have recollection sufficient to describe them to you  however i will strive to methodize my thoughts and begin by recurring back to my interview with miss harrison  i found her pale trembling and in tears  as i entered the room she cried out o sir what is become of captain williams  in as few words as possible i related to her the cause of the unhappy accident that happened at my lodgings and when i mentioned his marriage with nancy weston she fell upon her knees and exclaimed  great author of all good accept my thanks and withdraw not thy protecting providence from the being thou have saved from the complicated misery of adding guilt to the sinners soul and sorrow to the wretched and innocent sufferer  this day sir i was to have been made his wife by such another marriage i suppose as was his first  the chaise now waits within an hundred yards that was to have carried my maid and me to bristol where he was to have met us with a clergyman a friend of his who as we were both of age would have dispensed with what he called the unnecessary formality of a license and married us in private  i most sincerely congratulated this amiable girl upon the providential escape she had met with in not being united to captain williams even though his intentions toward her might have been strictly honorable if that were possible in his present circumstances and which without want of charity i think i may reasonably doubt  she appeared extremely affected at mrs williamss distress said she hoped her husband would recover to do justice to her merit and reward her sufferings but that she never would upon any account see him more for she could not help owning that she had loved him tenderly  she talked of quitting bath immediately  as a friend i took the liberty of opposing her intention and advised her not only to remain where she was but to appear as little affected as possible at the misfortune that had befallen her worthless lover  she thanked me for my advice and promised to follow it as far as she might be able  the moment i left miss harrison i set off in pursuit of my destiny  you know it stanley  fear not that i shall ever attempt to describe the scene that passed between lady juliana and me  no words will ever be able to express my feelings nor no time to erase them from my heart  yet let me boast her tenderness and tell you that she wept for your unhappy friend  tears do not flow from hatred  angels tears are tears of pity  whilst i have life i will cherish the fond remembrance of her gentle sorrow  do not chide me stanley  the only glimpse i have of happiness is the being certain that she does not hate me   at my return hither i found williams in a very dangerous state the surgeons had extracted but one of the balls and he would not suffer them to proceed any farther till i was present as he seemed to be persuaded that he should die in the operation i went immediately to his bedside he was in a high fever but perfectly in his senses and his countenance expressive of the extremest anguish  he took me by the hand and said can you forgive the anxiety i have cost you and look with compassion on a wretch who is now expiating his crimes by the severest torments  i assured him that i sincerely lamented the accident that had reduced him to such a situation and most truly compassionated his sufferings but that i thought they might be relieved if he would suffer the surgeons to perform the necessary operation of extracting the other ball  he answered no  they cannot ease my pains  that wretched woman  but i own myself accountable for all her crimes and they sit heavy at my heart  she was innocent when i met with her  and is so still upon my honor  i replied her sufferings are all you have to answer for and they indeed have been great  but were i now even at the point of death i would attest her innocence with my latest words  i have known all her miseries but by all that is sacred she is free from guilt of any kind  he wept aloud  and with difficulty articulated  then i am still a greater villain  i told him i rejoiced in his contrition as he yet had it in his power in some measure to atone the crimes he had committed by doing justice to his unhappy wife  he remained silent for some time then groaned most heavily  and said  let me see her  but can she bear the sight of him who would have murdered her i caught the pistol up with an intent to kill her  but providence directed the wound to my own guilty heart  but all my crimes will be atoned by death  for never shall this bullet leave my side  i do not wish to live life would be hateful to me  miss harrison i have injured her too  believe me she is a virtuous woman evelyn  i replied i do believe it most sincerely  but do not wander from your present purpose  your mind will be much easier when you have seen your wife he gazed upon me with a piercing look and said you are a man of honor and could not be so base as to deceive a dying man you say my wife is guiltless free from stain  then let her come and pardon her cruel husband  i repeated every solemn assurance that i could give him of her blameless conduct with which he seemed perfectly satisfied and i went to bring her to his bedside  i found her in the dining room from whence she had scarcely stirred from the time i left her in her situation it was impossible her mind could feel repose or her body rest she appeared to me even a more melancholy object than when i met her in the park her eyes were swollen with tears and her face pale and emaciated when i told her that her husband desired to see her she said it was impossible she dared not could not look upon the man she had murdered nor could she ever more know peace or comfort  with much difficulty i reasoned down her groundless apprehensions of having caused his death and led or rather supported her trembling feeble frame to his bedside she dropped upon her knees and i retired quick from a scene that was by much too interesting for my present state of mind  in about an hours time he sent for me he appeared much more composed than when i left him but still in extreme agony  he begged i would consult his surgeon and let him know his real state for he had much to do and he believed but a very short space to get it done  he promised to submit to any operation that should be thought necessary to save his life and thanked me a thousand times for the gleam of peace which i had given to his torn mind  i immediately summoned a consullation of all the physical people of eminence at bath but they would not venture to pronounce with any degree of certainty till a further experiment had been made to come at the ball  i acquainted him with their opinions and begged of him to let the trial be instantly made but he peremptorily refused to submit to it till twelve oclock tomorrow as he said he had still more important affairs to execute than that he desired a proper person might be sent for to draw his will and entreated me to obtain a license and get a clergyman to marry him in due form at nine oclock tomorrow morning to his present nominal wife he also most earnestly requested me to wait upon miss harrison and implore her forgiveness of an unhappy dying man who never could forgive himself  need i tell you that i have been strongly affected with williamss contrition i most sincerely pray that he may live to enjoy the fruits of his repentance and by his future conduct obliterate his past  i have obeyed all his commands and am at present so completely harrassed both in mind and body that i must decline entering into the particulars of your letter till another opportunity  i shall be present at williamss marriage and at the dressing of his wounds tomorrow but i much fear that i shall see him in his wedding and his winding sheet at once  adieu c evelyn  letter xxiii charles evelyn to william stanley it is all over with poor williams a mortification had begun some hours before the time that his surgeons were appointed  he was sensible of his situation by the perfect ease he enjoyed and entreated their humanity not to torture him in vain he bore the certainty of his approaching dissolution with the utmost calmness and spent the few hours that were allotted him in imploring the forgiveness of heaven and his injured wife  he has bequeathed four hundred pounds a year to mrs williams for now she is entitled to that name according to all the forms of law  he has left an hundred guineas to be laid out in a ring for miss harrison on which is to be enamelled the word beware  and has appointed me his residuary legatee  i staid by him the whole day and night and about four oclock this morning he expired  i will not pain you or myself with a description of his melancholy exit  i do not think his widow will survive him long  though he has acquitted me in the fullest and handsomest manner of his death i am advised to take my trial at the ensuing assizes as the lawyers here inform me that if i avoid doing so i shall always be liable to a prosecution which may at some time or other be commenced against me from malice  i must desire you will consult the ablest lawyers in london upon this occasion and let me have their opinions  my mind is oppressed with an uncommon gloom  death is a tremendous subject of contemplation when we view it near  seen in perspective only we cast a transient glance and turn our eyes away  perhaps it would disrobe the spectre of his terrors were we to look more frequently and steadily upon it  but these reflections are out of season to a joyful heart long may it be before one pang of sorrow shall find entrance there may lucy soon increase your happiness by sharing it and may it remain as uninterrupted as the sincere friendship of  c evelyn  letter xxiv lady desmond to charles evelyn my dearest charles i have read in some good author that generosity and gratitude are twins who have never been separated but always subsist in the same heart  in yours then my brother you will find the sentiments of mine sentiments which can only be felt but never expressed or if they could the sensation would still remain as unintelligible to the bulk of humankind as the idea of a sixth sense  you will perhaps be suprized when i tell you that i have shed more tears this last week than i have for many months before  but joy has its tears as well as grief and mine were tears of joy there would be no enduring the transport of conferring happiness on those we love without that kind relief  surely my brother you must have wept yourself when you made emma happy  i think myself much obliged to mr sewell for the dispatch he made from bath to delville with your bills every thing here now wears a cheerful aspect and i fancy as i look upon the lawn that it has acquired a brighter verdure than it used to wear even in the spring  but though this idea may be imaginary i am certain that my beloved sir james has cast away the gloom that hung upon his brow and the soft smiles of sweet content now reign triumphant there i think he was even more oppressed with gratitude than me when i delivered your generous gift into his hands  he is gone to london to fulfill the purpose for which it was designed  we shall now have no more creditors for sure i am that he will never more involve himself by play  though at this time i could not bring myself to hint even the most distant desire he should relinquish it but well he knows how ardently i wish he should and as he loves me with the utmost tenderness i cannot doubt his giving me this proof of his affection  mr sewell is gone with sir james to london and i am to follow in a fortnight  sir james thinks our house cannot be sufficiently aired in less time and would not have me or our dear little fanny run the hazard of catching cold  i have a thousand apprehensions about his health and earnestly wish that he could have been content to pass the winter here as we had intended  mr sewell has informed me that you had paid a visit to lady juliana harley he could not tell me what was the result though i guess it but too well from his saying that you appeared dejected at your return  why will you court unhappiness by pursuing perhaps the only woman within your sphere of life that would fly from you blessed as you are with virtue health and fortune why must you add to the too numerous proofs that happiness is not attainable on earth  forgive me charles this little opposition to your only irrational pursuit  few are the persons even amongst the best within whose reach felicity seems placed all must deserve before they can obtain it but even then we sometimes cast it from us and like ixion grasp a cloud  may you reverse the fable and long enjoy what you so well deserve my little fannys playful fondness will not suffer me longer to indulge in expressing the ardent wishes of my heart for my loved friend and brother but from that source they shall for ever flow to the great fountain of all good to bless protect and guide you  your grateful e desmond  letter xxv charles evelyn to lady desmond i sincerely wish that my dear emmas nerves were a little stronger for though i confess myself extremely pleased with the tenderness of your letter i for your sake lament the sensibility which dictated it  this is not a world for delicate minds to be happy in  nor peace nor ease that heart can know that like the needle true turns at the touch of joy or woe but turning trembles too there never was a sentiment more elegantly expressed  i would rather have been the author of that single stanza than of a dozen volumes of poetry nay and of good poetry too but why my emma will you distress me by talking of gratitude of what value is wealth if it does not enable us to purchase happiness and to diffuse is to enjoy it the greatest miser upon earth cannot confine his possessions solely to himself nor can the most luxurious man that lives appropriate to his own use the tithe of what he dissipates  he who bestows preserves his property a gift once made cannot be lessened it is a fund established in a grateful heart which even the great destroyer time cannot impair  but holding riches lightly as i do i would not wish that mine should flit away on the gross pinions of folly or of vice i therefore entreat you to exert all the influence you have over your beloved sir james to prevail on him to conquer a passion that must come under one or other of those denominations  you must know that i mean his love of play  yet i approve of your delicacy in not mentioning the subject at a time when it might have appeared like making conditions for what he thought a favor and indeed i should be better pleased if he were voluntarily to renounce gaming than if he sacrificed his inclination even to your request  one of those harpies whom i saw at delville a mr simpson has i hear lost large sums of money here  i am glad sir james is not near enough to assist in repairing his losses  i think mr sewell a worthy and i may add a sensible man as he has had prudence enough to relinquish gaming  he professes the sincerest regard for both you and your husband  however i think i have a little reason to chide that he should inform me of sir jamess difficulties  was he more worthy of my emmas confidence than i  i am very glad to hear you are going to london dissipation contrary to its usual effects will be of infinite service to you the generality of public entertainments which are frequented by persons of rank are calculated entirely to amuse the senses the heart has nothing to do with them and of course insensibly retires within itself its feelings lie dormant its sensibility becomes obtuse and i am apt to think that persons who live in a constant circle of dissipation do not know that they have an heart  but as i am by no means apprehensive that you are likely to forget that part of your anatomy i shall be glad the little flutterer should repose for a time in the apathy of what is so falsely styled pleasure  i hope you will be time enough in town to be present at our dear lucys wedding  i wish you could contrive to call upon me in your journey it will not be much out of your road and if we do not meet here it may be very long before we do  i thank you for the tender concern you express for me on account of my unhappy passion it is the only subject on which i would not listen to my emmas advice  but remember my sister  they never knew to love that knew to change and be assured that no other woman can ever make the slightest impression upon the heart of your sincerely affectionate brother  c evelyn  letter xxvi george sewell to john simpson what the devil could prevent you jack from meeting us at salisbury do you know that the baronet has been very near slipping through our hands and that at the very time when he is best worth our holding why man we have found a mine the treasures of the east lie before us evelyns whole fortune may be ours lady desmond has got a key to his purse out of which she will certainly fill her husbands and we the galant knights of industry will as surely empty it  but to explain this mystery we were all in a doleful way when you like a false friend left us at delville not a shilling to be raised not a stake left unmortgaged but my ladys jointure and the baronet swore he would perish rather than rob his wife the intended journey to london was entirely laid aside and they were to pass the winter solus cum sola  he grew grave and peevish she retained her usual gentle cheerfulness upon my soul jack she is a very amiable woman and i am really glad we did not meddle with the jointure particularly as we can now do very well without it  it was impossible for me to think of remaining in such a dull scene where i knew there was nothing to be got so i made a few wry faces at table talked of a flying gout and set out to drink the bath water which like the irish usquebaugh has always a little gold floating in it which may be easily extracted by such ingenious chemists as you and i  to my great joy one of the first persons i met with there was the prudent and sensible mr charles evelyn  i had you know ingratiated myself into his good opinion at delville by advising sir james desmond against play and i resolved to strengthen his prepossession by declaring that i had entirely left it off myself  that was a stroke beyond you simpson  i was fortunate enough to be able to acquaint him with the place of his dulcineas retreat which he considered as a real obligation  there has not been such a quixote in england these fifty years  before he set out on his wildgoose chase i took occasion to mention the distressed situation of the desmond family but under the seal of secrecy as i told him i knew the baronets pride would never suffer him to reveal the consequences of that misconduct he now so sincerely repented of  i talked in raptures of lady desmonds virtues and swore that sir james and she would be the happiest couple on earth if their circumstances were tolerably easy  the gudgeon bit and immediately asked me what sum i thought would relieve sir james from his present difficulties i hesitated to pronounce but upon being pressed said i imagined four or five thousand pounds would discharge all his impatient creditors though i well knew that thrice that sum would not extricate him  the idiot evelyn whom i suppose to be as rich as the great mogul sat down directly and drew drafts for six thousand pounds in favor of sir james desmond and as soon as they returned accepted consigned them to my friendly care to be delivered into the hands of his fair sister  and am i not a friend indeed for i dont expect above half this sum to roll into your pocket or mine  both sir james and lady desmond were strongly affected at this proof of evelyns generosity and the former was very near making a vow never to play again  i trembled lest his wife should have strengthened his wavering resolution by making it her request but if she had i would have laid five to three against any promise that sir james could make for a man may as easily be cured of the hydrophobia as of an itch for gaming  all i feared was that he might get into other hands and therefore wrote to you to meet and accompany us to london for to be sure if he was not an egregious gull he must be surprised at our constant good luck  i contrived as i wrote you word that we should lie at salisbury  after supper the baronet seemed pensive i pushed about the bottle and expected he would call for cards but he yawned and talked of going to bed  on which i stepped out of the room and returned in a moment with a box and dice and proposed taking a cast or two merely to amuse the time for silver  he could not resist the dear temptation and that jilt fortune and my own negligence in not having a die in my pocket turned against me and i lost an hundred guineas  but tant mieux say i it is a good bait and will catch thousands  the baronet exulted violently as all those fellows do that are not used to win  i congratulated him on the change of his luck said fortune was certainly weary of persecuting him and that it was highly probable he would now recover all his former losses  he smiled at the idea and went to bed in high spirits  we did not get to town till late last night and then parted this day he dines with his brotherinlaw selwyn and has desired me to meet him in the evening at his own house  i have accepted the invitation and shall go properly prepared in my next i hope to give you a good account of him or his money which is a much better thing  i am sorry you are not here we must strike while the iron is hot and rescue his dear guineas from falling into the hands of odious vulgar tradesmen as lady townley says  i hope you are successful at bath though there is danger there of meeting with your match and give me leave to say you are not qualified for such an encounter  you lose your temper with your money and know not how to retire with the easy gentlemanlike sans froid of yours  g sewell  letter xxvii lady juliana harley to miss evelyn yes my lucy i will hasten to your relief or rather to my own  miss harleys ill temper has rendered this place so hateful to me that i can no longer abide in it  surely there is a fatality that attends the meeting of an evelyn and an harley  from the moment that your brother left this house she has treated me with the utmost asperity  she says she is certain that the whole race of evelyns are idiots or that i must have given them philtres  but it is they not me who have the art of fascination for this poor lady is become enamoured by a single glance of your brother  perhaps the sudden fright she received from the strong resemblance between him and the lamented henry has occasioned this extraordinary prepossession  though love is by no means the offspring of fear  but no matter for the cause the effects have been dreadful to me and i am resolved to withdraw myself from them as quickly as possible  heaven knows that this poor sinking heart of mine needs not to have its sorrows aggravated  it is true my lucy that your brother and i are not under an absolute necessity of meeting yet surely unless he or i relinquish the enjoyment of your society we cannot well avoid it  justice and reason ordain that i should make the sacrifice and what a desert will london be to me deprived of your sweet converse  on the approaching i hope happy event of your changing your name  o name for ever sad for ever dear  i beg if mr evelyn should be in london that his presence may be considered as more essential on that occasion than mine  my lucy does but jest when she talks of terrors at giving her hand where she has long since bestowed her heart  though i will allow that even thus happily circumstanced there is something extremely awful in the marriage contract to a sensible and delicate mind i have often wondered where those very young ladies who elope from their families and friends have found resolution sufficient to support themselves through that solemn ceremony but think what she endures who is compelled to make a joyless loveless vow  i purpose being in london by this day fortnight but let me conjure you not to delay mr stanleys happiness upon my account your sister selwyn whom i sincerely congratulate will support your spirits and to say truth my lucy i would rather be excused from being present at a ceremony where love hope and joy should fill each cheerful heart  these charming sensations have alas been long banished from mine and the only pleasing one which now inhabits there is the affectionate regard with which  i am most truly yours j harley  letter xxviii miss evelyn to lady juliana harley thank you my good miss harley with all my heart for having been able to effect by the pure dint of a diabolical disposition what all the earnest entreaties of lady julianas favorite friend had solicited in vain old adages have always been highly esteemed by me for i firmly believe our ancestors were wiser than the present generation and the needs must i shall henceforth look upon as an oracular truth  i ask ten thousand pardons thou departed spirit of chesterfield for having ventured to quote an old proverb against your injunction  i am delighted at the idea of miss harleys falling in love by a coup doeil and shall certainly congratulate charles on his conquest dry wood is more apt to take fire than when it is green we all know but why the deuce came miss touchwood to make such a smoke and pother  i never knew but one person besides miss harley whose temper was not softened by love she poor dear was a middleaged lady also and the fonder she grew of her lover the more spiteful she became to all the rest of the world  but various are the effects of the same disease upon the human body and as various are the effects of the selfsame passion upon the human mind  i think that last a good pretty philosophical sort of a sentence  it is poetical at least  and so my dear lady you are pleased to say that i do but jest when i talk of terrors in regard to a certain event and in the very next line you kindly allow that there is something very awful in a marriage contract to a sensible and delicate mind  thank you my sweet friend for this obliging inuendo  but i am not in a humor to quarrel and the only revenge i desire to take for this sly hint is to insist upon your being present at my nuptials i think that sounds better than wedding and conveys a more dignified idea of the solemn ceremony to be serious  for i am not merry though i do beguile the thing i am with seeming otherwise i feel that there is something very tremendous in uniting our fate with that of a person whose temper and sentiments it is impossible we should be thoroughly acquainted with and becoming as it were dependent upon another for our temporal and eternal happiness  for i agree with dr tillotson that an unhappy marriage is a lesser hell in passage to the greater   i tremble whilst i write this sentence  yet wherefore should i be so much alarmed stanley is generous and humane and should he even cease to love me  shocking thought i will not dwell upon the gloomy subject  now for the other end of the perspective  we have got the prettiest house imaginable very near berkeleysquare not far from my sister selwyns and in the same street with emma  apropos sir james desmond is come to town and her ladyship is expected in a few days he seems in high spirits which i rejoice at because i know my sisters gentle nerves are always in strict unison with his  i should be glad to know if she is very happy  if she is not lord have mercy upon me for i never shall make half so good a wife and yet i assure you i am resolved to be as good as i possibly can  i did not intend to write above six lines when i took up the pen and they were meant to tell you that i vow and declare and still more i swear that while in the country you tarry i may laugh jest or sing or do any odd thing but depend on it i will not marry there is an extempore for you  we have a great deal of company to dine and i must dress  your ladyships most humble lucy evelyn  letter xxix william stanley to charles evelyn i by no means wonder at the oppression of spirits you seemed to labor under when you last wrote to me  such a succession of melanchcly scenes would unstring the nerves of an hercules  i know not how to say i am sorry for williams and yet i feel something like concern for his death mixed with a fear that if he had lived he would have relapsed into his former errors to conquer habitual vice is a more than herculean labor it requires strength of mind and preseverance qualities which are seldom to be met with in a vicious person  for all kinds of baseness enervates the soul and render it averse from pain or difficulty  but peace be with his ashes and may his widow live to enjoy content if not felicity  i have consulted some of our ablest lawyers and they agree in desiring you should take your trial at the ensuing assizes but i hope neither this or any other business will prevent your being a witness and partaker of my happiness in receiving the completion of my every wish from my dear lucys hand  the long desired day is at length fixed for the eighteenth of next month  by that time lady desmond and lady juliana harley will both be in london and my lucy says will both be present at what she calls the awful ceremony  after this hint i think i need not press your coming but let me entreat you my dear charles upon this occasion to cast off your glooms and sables  for if looking well will not move her looking ill will never prevail it is a general remark that grave ladies like sprightly men  contrasts oftener create affection than similarity  in manners only i mean  for there must be a sympathy of sentiment to form a perfect love  her taste was his own is one of the very best reasons for a real attachment that i know of  i write in haste for i resent the loss of every moment which i do not enjoy in my lucys company  my carriage waits to convey me to clargesstreet you will therefore i hope forgive this abrupt adieu  w stanley  letter xxx charles evelyn to william stanley bath no stanley no my friend i will not damp your joys nor gloom nor sorrow shall obtrude on your festivity  i never shall put on a wedding garment and therefore will not be a guest at yours  yet shall my heart most truly sympathize in my friends happiness nor can his own form any wish more ardent that it may be lasting  lucy has many good and amiable qualities and will i am convinced exert them all to insure the happiness of the man she loves  i dont know any young woman better qualified to make a good wife she has an excellent temper and constant spirits and i am persuaded that chearsulness is a very necessary ingredient in matrimony  the languid and dejected part of her sex seem to claim a constant exertion of their husbands tenderness they appear to be incapable of bearing their part in the difficulties or distresses of life and of course throw the whole load upon the men  but though it is natural to love the being we protect it is as reasonable to expect that the companion of our journey through life should at least endeavor to enliven the dreary part of the road and make it seem less tiresome  you know the adage jucunda comes in via pro vehiculo est such a one i hope you will find in my sister and may your journey be long but not tedious  believe me my friend i am sincerely rejoiced at hearing that lady juliana means to return to the world and her friends again  may every happiness the world can give be hers  and never never shall i interrupt it  how could you think that i would break my promise and sink myself in her esteem i scarce can pardon the idea  my gentle emma too will grace your wedding  too surely may i say my heart will be amongst ye  the rest of me the mere animal body will remain here till after the assizes and when they are over i shall accompany miss harrison and her brother to ireland  he is a very sensible elegant man and thinks himself obliged to me for the attention i have shown to his sister  poor mrs williams continues in a very weak and languid state of health fortune cannot repair the wrongs it has already done her her physicians have hopes of her recovery from drinking the bristol waters next summer but i can scarcely form a hope that she will remain amongst us long enough to try their efficacy  present my sincerest congratulations to your fair bride though i shall write to her and my sister selwyn by next post these letters do not appear   farewell my stanley and be assured that even the name of brother cannot add to the unfeigned regard with which  i am unalterably yours c evelyn  letter xxxi miss lucy evelyn to charles evelyn clargesstreet my dear charles i will not say with beatrice against my will i am sent to bid you come to dinner  for with my whole heart that is with all that i have left of it do i entreat your company on the eighteenth inst  surely my good my generous brother will not deny to grant the only request that i have ever made to him  should you refuse even your princely present would lose its luster in my eyes or at least your unkindness will diminish its brilliancy for indeed i have set my heart upon your coming and one should not be crossed upon ones wedding day  let the honeymoon at least shine unclouded to its wain  suppose lady juliana should be there she is no gorgon  she has the beauty indeed of the medusa head but without its terrors  for my life i cannot find out why you and she are so horridly afraid of each other  i am certain that if you never meet you will never come together and i think that is an event that might probably enough be brought about if you did not take so much pains to avoid it  neither women nor men i fancy should be understood au pie du lettre upon the article of love  both sides generally say more than they literally mean  for my part i know have told mr stanley twenty times that i should never marry and heartily sorry should i now be if he had been such a dunce as to have taken me at my word  for shame then charles take courage and dont give out on a first denial  all women should be wooed and not unsought be won but let this matter be settled between you and your fair relict as you please it has nothing to do with my request with which i again entreat your compliance and am most affectionately  yours l evelyn p s castlefranc has executed your commission in a most elegant taste  thank you my sweet brother for the handsomest pair of earrings i ever saw  i mean to surprise mr stanley with them and will never forgive you if you are not present to enjoy his astonishment and hear mr selwyns remarks on the folly and vanity of such fopperies the answer to this letter being to the same purport as the letter xxix does not appear  there are also many other letters relative to mr stanleys wedding omitted     letter xxxii lady desmond to charles evelyn charlesstreet berkeleysquare not all the gay and pleasing scenes in which i have been engaged since my arrival here have been able to efface the tender melancholy i felt at bidding you adieu  though we parted at the devizes you accompanied me all the way to london not even my little fannys cheerful prattle and innocent curiosity could rouse me sufficiently from my reverie to make me answer her questions rationally  my mind was totally occupied on the peculiar unhappiness of yours in not being able to conquer a passion which you acknowledge to be hopeless  my anxiety for you has rendered me unjust i could not receive lady juliana with the cordiality and affection i used to feel for her nor cast my eyes upon her elegant form without wishing to lessen her charms  no woman ever took more pains to depreciate a rivals beauties to a wavering lover than i have done to find some fault with here is  but it is in vain  i cannot discover a single imperfection except her being the cause though an innocent one of your unhappiness  i think she is thinner than she was when you saw her at delville and is almost as much spiritualized though without the appearance of ill health as your fair idea mrs williams for whose recovery i am much interested and entreat you to present my best wishes to her  lady juliana endeavored to appear cheerful at my sisters wedding but every one might see she strove to be so  what cause can be assigned for such a depression of spirits in one who is surrounded with all the outward signs of happiness  she cannot surely love in vain  i know not what to think of her  but this is the last time that even your entreaties shall prevail on me to mention her again  i have been involved in a continued circle or rather whirl of public and private amusements ever since i came to town yet i feel i have an heart and that it grieves for you  i look back with pleasure on the three days i spent with you at bath though there is a good deal of regret mingled with the recollection at not having had it in my power to persuade you to come up to london  mr and mrs stanley are as happy as it is possible to be and with true joy i say they have a prospect of continuing so if happiness were a perennial flower  but alas few are the soils in which it always blooms  in most that i have seen it is but an annual nay sometimes blasted ever it can take root  it is a celestial plant and was not meant to flourish here below  do not from hence conclude i am unhappy if i were i should deserve to be so for i should be ungrateful to providence and to you  no let my thankful heart acknowledge its felicity by saying that my beloved sir james and fanny both are well and that i am to the best of brothers an affectionate sister  e desmond  letter xxxiii george sewell to john simpson devilish bad indeed jack what routed horse and foot stephens undone as well as you  no hopes of repairing the damage but by my success  let me tell you gentlemen this will never do  you are mistaken if you fancy i have touched all the baronets cash  no more than a paltry seven hundred has come to my share  i was obliged to take in a partner as sir james objected to playing with me teteatete for large sums  not from any suspicion but as i was his friend he did not choose to win my money scrupulous idiot he need not have feared hurting me  a gamester like an historian should have neither country religion or friends  there must be no boggling i called in kelly and passed him for a rich west indian  we divided fourteen hundred for as kelly is not of our set he insisted on the ready  he is an errant jew and it grieved me to go snacks with such a niggardly rascal  however it was lucky that i struck the iron while twas hot for since my ladys arrival in town the baronet has not touched a die  there has been a wedding in the family and a deal of dining and supping together  the new brotherinlaw mr stanley is i fancy a devilish keen one  i was in hopes to have touched him for a little of his wifes fortune but upon sir james proposing play a few nights ago at his own house this same wiseacre talked of gaming and gamesters in such a style as made me almost blush and wish myself fairly out of the company  i perceive there is nothing to be got by him  though lady desmond appears the gentlest of beings i begin to fancy that her husband is a little in awe of her from his not venturing to play since she came to town  if this should be the case i will take care that her reign shall be short by throwing out hints of his apparent subjection at which i am sure the baronets pride will revolt and then let her ladyship look to her jointure  if i can cure his qualms about it i shall have none of my own hencesorward   there is a good clever woman in their set that i think has spirit enough for any thing a madam du pont she loves play and seems to understand it but i fancy she is poor suppose we were to admit her of our society women are the best decoyducks in the world  i dont fancy she would have many scruples for i have heard that she is an infamous daughter to an indulgent mother whose circumstances she has ruined   i have some doubts about monsieur her husband he seems to be a man of honor but if he is fond of her he will easily be converted into  what i do not like to answer the question  it is devilish hard lads that we must be confined to this piddling work  if they had not black balled us at the great clubs we might have rolled in our chariots long since not but that there are many of our fraternity amongst them and some not half such honest fellows as ourselves   i enclose you bills for five hundred to make a push with  i desire jack that you will be cautious how you play with foreigners they generally know as much of the matter as we do the east and west indians are our best marks  full purses and honest hearts the true ferae natura for gentlemen gamesters  i have just received a message from sir james lady desmond goes to a ball he has strained his ancle and desires to see me  it is not impossible that i may make him dance without a fiddle before the night is over luck attend us all adieu   george sewell  letter xxxiv charles evelyn to william stanley bath my trial is over and i stand acquitted by the laws of the land as well as my own conscience  the process was very short williams had taken every possible precaution to secure both my life and honor  poor fellow i wish he had taken as much pains to preserve his own  the formalities of a court of judicature even to a mind conscious of its innocence and certain of acquital have something very awful in them  i am amazed how any person who stands self convicted is able to support himself on such a tremendous occasion shakespeare says  i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaimed their malefactions i should think such an effect much more likely to be produced by putting a culprit on his trial at least i am sure i should plead guilty if i was conscious of being so  but we are not judges of situations that we have not experienced and perhaps if i was capable of committing murder i might be mean enough to deny my guilt for the poor privilege of carrying upanddown a wretched restless being  but away with these tyburn topics and let me talk to you of love and joy  to you i trust they are terms synonimous to me they never can or will be so but tell me stanley how does your lively bride become that character  has she assumed an air of dignity and put the matron on even with the wedding ring as i have seen young ladies do ere now  or is she still the same unaffected pleasant lucy not changed in any thing but name  how go the selwyns and the desmonds on  and answer me this once has lady juliana ever mentioned me   there is a fister in law of here is here at present a miss hartley she did me the honor to address me in the rooms from having seen me for a moment at harley hill i had not the least recollection of her  how should i  i saw her not nor should have seen the grecian venus had she stood before me  i had no eyes but for one single object but i will not indulge myself with dwelling on the dear painful subject  miss harley has been particularly civil to the harrisons and me i almost fancy she likes the captain and it is a very probable conjecture for he is extremely agreeable both in his person and manners yet i shall be sorry if it is so for i would not have any one who bears the name of harley wretched and i am pretty sure that his affections are already bestowed upon mrs williams but i fear he will not be successful there as he has a potent rival in the grim king of terrors who lurks in ambush even beneath her smiles  i purpose setting out for ireland in about ten days if my sisters have any commissions to execute i beg they will employ me as i am to them and you a sincerely affectionate brother  c evelyn  letter xxxv mrs stanley to charles evelyn charlesstreet berkeleysquare i have snatched the pen from my husband  how oddly that word looks because i am resolved to answer for myself as i have heard it remarked that one should never rely upon what a man says of his wife  there is another queer word  and because i have a secret to tell you that i dont choose to trust mr stanley with  you see that i am already au fait of the mysteries of matrimony and understand my place  now to your queries  i have not assumed any matronly airs as yet merely because i dont think they would become me  besides the man likes me as i am at present but the moment i perceive the least alteration in his manners toward me i will turn the tables upon him study the graces become at once a very dignified fine lady scorn to laugh at any thing however ridiculous and be as dull and as formal as any donna elvira at the court of madrid  if variety has charms such a contrast surely must delight him  now for my secret  hush let me whisper in your ear  it is not captain harrison but charles evelyn that has captivated the tender heart of the young and beautiful miss harley  lady juliana assures me that her sisterinlaw is very little turned of thirty but were i to judge i think we might add ten to the score and bring her almost on the road to fifty  but were she fifteen i should not like her but that is no reason for your dislike and now that i am married and settled as it were i would fain have you in the same predicament  yet i wish you to look somewhere else for a wife as i am persuaded there never will be a match between a harley and an evelyn  they say the irish ladies are remarkably handsome who knows but some fair bogtrotter may lay hold of your heart and transmogrify you into a brogueneer  you ask me for commissions bring me over a sisterinlaw and i will not trouble you for any else but if you return single i desire you to bring me a great quantity of irish stuff and every other kind of countraband commodity you can contrive to smuggle that is the manufacture of that country  i know you will not think my letter worth the postage if i dont say something of lady juliana  seriously charles she gives me great uneasiness both her health and spirits decline visibly and i am certain there is a cruel something that preys upon her heart  she laments her being the cause of your absenting yourself from your family yet highly approves your shunning her  she sometimes talks of going abroad but i dont believe she will ever have resolution enough to travel for even i cannot prevail on her to stir from her own fireside  in short she is a riddle too difficult for me to expound  the selwyns and desmonds all salute you as does my sposo and your affectionate sister  lucy stanley p s madame du pont whom you will possibly know better by the name of maria morton desires her compliments to you  she is a great deal with us at present as my brother and sister desmond seem to have taken a particular liking for her  i think she is more agreeable as madam du pont than she was as miss morton  but i hear shocking stories of her behavior to her mother  if they are true i shall renounce her  for to me not all the charms of wit and beauty can compensate for a bad heart  pray write from ireland and tell me all about it    letter xxxvi george sewell to john simpson so the wheel is gone round i find and you are now pretty near the top  climb away jack but remember to sit fast when you get on the pinnacle  such another tumble as your last would go near to undo us  dame fortune has been pleased to give me a lift also yet i could not have gone on cleverly if you had not supplied me with the ready  the baronets cash is exhausted and i have been kind enough to furnish him with a brace of hundreds which added to the sum he has lost to me since i wrote last makes a cool thousand and all i have to show for it is a piece of stamped paper bond and warrant my boy that is all  give me credit jack i am a machiavel in politics  madame du pont is the finest bait i ever had to angle with she is really a woman of sense and spirit and will very soon be as adroit as any of our fraternity  her husband is a silly fellow but he is a frenchman and suffers her to do just what she pleases  she coquets with the baronet and he loses his money with the best grace imaginable  filthy dice are banished monsieur du pont thinks it too masculine for ladies to play at hazard and the noise of the box gives lady desmond the headache  i am much mistaken if the heartach is not added to her other complaints very soon  so now we only piddle at loo quinze pharo vingt et un  lady desmond never plays and i think she begins to look coldly on her female friend but while sir jamess warmth continues her ladyships frigidity is of small consequence  the only end it can answer will be to disgust her husband for she is too timid to oppose him and our fair ally is not of a humor to be easily discouraged where either her pleasure or profit is concerned  i rejoice to hear that evelyn is gone to ireland i was devilishly afraid he would have come athwart us  i made him believe i had left off play and i must have looked silly if he had found me at it  i wish we were as fairly rid of stanley  i cannot bear that man  i dont know why but i shrink before him and yet i am no coward jack  a man should have courage that plays all the game and yet not affect the bully either  i have seen you much too hot upon some occasions  but i hope that humor was pretty well corrected by your irish expedition  i wish you joy of your lordly nabob  he is a prize indeed  stick to him like a leech jack for there can be no sin in robbing those who have robbed others  it is every honest mans duty to recover stolen goods from a thief though he had no original claim to the property  go on and prosper then  yours george sewell  letter xxxvii charles evelyn to mrs stanley bath i have not words to express the pain i have suffered from your last letter  her health and spirits decline visibly  a cruel something preys upon her heart  o lucy how could you write those words and not efface them with your tears  i thought i had already experienced every species of anguish that could be inflicted by disappointed love  from respect and tenderness to the dear cause of all my sufferings i had brought my humbled mind to such a state of acquiescence as to forbear complaining  nay i am persuaded i could without repining have endured to see her married to the object of her choice  but to know she is unhappy must render me so beyond a hope of cure  i have been long laboring to consider this idol of my heart as misers do their hidden treasure though hopeless of enjoying it yet while i thought twas safe i could not look upon myself undone  now i am robbed of my ideal wealth and am left poor indeed  o lucy if you ever loved me strive i conjure you to assuage her gentle sorrows and pour the balm of friendship on her wounded heart gracious heaven what can the affliction be that thus oppresses her mild spirits would i could bear it for her and ease her troubled breast  perhaps this place or bristol might be of service to her health perhaps it is that alone which is impaired and the now coming spring may with its vernal breezes bring back health to her and happiness to me  comparative happiness i mean for i have long been wretched but never was completely so till now  let lady juliana know that i shall quit this place immediately  you know that i intended it before but if i had not nothing on earth should now detain me here i would fly to the antipodes to leave it free for her surely my fate is singularly severe that thus impels me to a voluntary banishment from every place in which my happiness is centered  i cannot lucy enter into your raillery in regard to miss harley i do not think her amiable but were she all that could attract envy in woman or desire in man her charms would be entirely lost on me  my eyes are closed to beauty i only feel its power when i turn them inward and gaze upon the image in my heart  i am sorry to hear that madam du pont is so intimate with emma though i am certain it will never be in her power to pervert her principles or render her heart callous yet from the hint you give and my own observation i by no means think her an eligible companion for my sister  a female mind cannot have too much delicacy provided that it does not degenerate into affectation  a gross or boisterous woman is an unnatural character and were i married i had much rather my wife should converse with men than monsters  the freedom that subsists between female friends renders the conversation of such a person as i have mentioned infinitely more dangerous than that of a malelibertine  a woman easily sees through his designs and may if she pleases be on her guard against them  while the insiduous companion of her private hours without alarming saps the foundation of her every virtue  but grant they should be fixed and are impregnable will not the tainted gale by often passing over the beauteous flower tarnish its luster abate its fragrant scent take off its polish and fade its blooming tints as chaste as delicate believe me lucy as the opening rose should be the female heart  not even the present anxiety of my mind can render me indifferent to the happiness of one with whom i am so tenderly connected as lady desmond  read the above passage to her and i am certain she will want no further caution  i shall set out for ireland tomorrow  remember my sister though sure i need not urge your friendship that the treasure of my heart is committed to your care and may your kind attention be rewarded with the restoration of lady julianas health and happiness  present my affections to our sisters to yours and my stanley and write soon i entreat you to your unhappy and affectionate brother  c evelyn p s direct for me at captain harrisons kildarestreet dublin  i am all amazement  harrison is just come in and tells me that miss harley has offered to accompany his sister to ireland what can she mean she shall not go if i can prevent it    end of the first volume
