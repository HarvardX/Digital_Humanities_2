still undetermined notwithstanding all the arguments brought on one side to support their authenticity and on the other to prove them the forgeries of a young literary adventurer the question is still brought to no conclusion and as the partisans of each hypothesis declare themselves unconvinced by the evidences of the other the matter may be considered as yet involved in doubt and obscurity the following collection of pieces are liable to none of the objections which are made to the other they are the genuine and acknowledged productions of thomas chatterton a person whose genius and abilities exercised at a very early period of life will no less command the respect of posterity than they have excited the attention and divided the sentiments of the ablest judge of the present age  with respect to rowleys poems the prevailing opinion seems to be the they were actually written by chatterton for though the antique manner in which they were clothed had served greatly to disguise them yet it could not but be observed that that the smoothness of the versification and the frequent the argument arising from the coincidences which might be pointed out between the supposed ancient poems and later writers has not been attended to in the manner it deserves it would be more decisive than any other yet made use of let any person compare the parallel passages lately pointed out by a writer in the st jamess chronicle no      may         and at the same time advert to the rules laid down by bishop hurd for the discovery of imitations and he will not hesitate to acknowledge that the writer of rowleys poems certainly lived in the present century as this letter will be considered as a curiosity by all who interest themselves concerning the authenticity of those poems and as it is not readily to be referred to being printed only in a newspaper we have subjoined it to the present publication see page xxiv  traces of imitation of later writers  utterly inconsistent with the  their being the productions of the fifteenth century these circumstances did no escape the observation of many gentlemen at their frst appearance but that forgeries ld be attempted by one who had not reached the age of seventeen years and that these attempts should be conducted with a degree of skill and judgment which obliged the most intelligent to doubt and at the same time almost compelled the most doubtful to assent seemed to be hardly within the reach of probability it rather in the opinion of many bordered on imimpossibility  it has been presumed though without duly weighing circumstances that it would be a wild conjecture to suppose a young and almost uneducated man was capable of conducting a complicated fraud which required applications very different from those which the season of his life and his means of information seemed to point out and at the same time such a course of study as is very seldom pursued until a more advanced period but before this is granted it should be recollected that he was as mr warton additions to history of poetry vol ii observe a singular instance of a prematurity of abilities and that he had acquired a store of general information far exceeding his years that he possessed a comprehension of mind and activity of understanding which predominated over his situations in life and his opportunities of instruction when these facts are remembered it will not be considered so very incredible and the history of the human mind will furnish many examples of a maturity of judgment in persons at as early an age which will diminish the surprise which must at the first glance impress every person who reflects upon this extraordinary phenomenon it should be recollected before we pronouce decisively upon this subject that there have been instances almost as extraordinary as that we have now under consideration dr wotton at the age of six years acquired a considerable knowledge in the latin greek and hebrew tongues and dr johnson has given the life of one john phillip barretier who mastered five languages at the age of nine years these acquisitions are certainly as wonderful as chattertons knowledge of the obsolete language of the   th and   th centuries which he was known to be fond of and to which he had particularly applied his attention nor should the contrivance of such a fraud be deemed beyond the reach of one who possessed such abilities it is known that a person who was distinguished by the name of psalmanazar in the beginning of the present century fabricated a new language and actually succeeded in imposing upon some of the most intelligent and inquisitive persons of the times who were equally as desirous as able to detect the imposture had it not been managed with a degree of art which eluded all their vigilance  it will hardly be denied that acquisitions like those we have before mentioned are equally surprising with any which chatterton is supposed to have reached unless the invention of new characters for a language or the difficulties of obtaining an accurate knowledge of the latin greek and hebrew are more easy to overcome than to imitate the manner of writing in the time of edward the fourth but instances may be produced of persons whose extent of intelligence has been as great in subjects more abstruse and not less out of the common walk than those to which chatterton devoted his attention it will be sufficient to name the celebrated crichton and m servin mentioned by sully between both whom and our author a resemblance might be discovered as well in their astonishing abilities as in those defects which marked the private characters of each of these young adventurers  as the present publication consists of pieces of which not the smallest doubt was ever entertained of their being genuine it is totally unnecessary here to enter into any argument either to support or invalidate those proofs which have been adduced of the authenticity of the supposed ancient poems and it is the less incumbent on the present editor as the public has lately received entire satisfaction on that head from the same gentleman to whom we are indebted for the first collection of this writers works it may not however be unnecessary to add a few words in order to complete the short account given by that gentleman of so extraordinary a personage who may be considered as the literary phenomenon of the times and whose genius if it had been properly fostered and encouraged might have carried english literature to as high a pitch as any author in the present century one can scarce avoid drawing a parallel upon the present occasion from the similarity of circumstances between our author and the great father of the english stage the one obliged to cramp and abase his genius to the ideas and taste of a barbarous audience the other from necessity compelled to obey the mandates of the directers of our monthly publications equally dogmatical ignorant and insipid  the former editor has already set forth the few circumstances relative to his author which he possessed in common with other men the time of his birth and death the names of his parents his profession and the confined mode of his education are all accurately stated it is to be regretted that he permitted the sangfroid of the antiquary to repress that warmth which the excellence of his author might have been expected to excite surely that excellence demanded some few words of commendation it is also to be lamented that he did not enter more minutely into the disposition and circumstances of one whom he could not but respect as an author however he might dislike his chararacter as a man and here it must be confessed chatterton appears to us in the most unfavourabe point of view he possessed all the vices and irregularities of youth and his profligacy was at least as conspicuous as his abilities although he was of a profession which might be said to accelerate his pursuits in antiquities yet so averse was he to that profession that he could never overcome it one of his first efforts to emerge from a situation so irksome to him was an application to a gentleman well known in the republic of letters which unfortunately for the public and himself met with a very cold reception and which the disappointed author always spoke of with a high degree of acrimony whenever it was mentioned to him  after his quitting bristol he was engaged to assist mr northhook in a history of london then publishing in numbers and at the same time was daily writing some piece for the magazines every effort appears to have been insufficient to ward off the approach of poverty and very soon after he settled in london his distress became so great that he meditated a design of going to senegal see poem to miss bush page    this intention was never executed he continued drudging for the booksellers a few months when at last oppressed with poverty and disease in a fit of despair he put an end to his existence in the month of august    0 with a dose of poison  such was the wretched life and such the fatal end of one who had he not prematurely finished his days had bidden fair to do the highest honors to english literature the reader will anticipate every reflection of regret which can be made upon this occasion and while he sympathizes with the unfortunate he will lament that one who is allowed to have been as mr warton expresses it a prodigy of genius should by the mere dint of distress be tempted to rid himself of an insupportable existence he will feel himself hurt at the idea that no notice should be taken of one who the last mentioned writer pronounces would have proved the first of english poets had he reached a maturer age and perhaps he may feel some indignation against the person to whom his first application was made and by whom he was treated with neglect and contempt it were to be wished that the public was fully informed of all the circumstances attending that unhappy application the event of which deprived the world of works which might have contributed to the honor of the nation as well as the comfort and happiness of their unfortunate author  it is observed by the elegant writer before quoted that some of the verses contained in the following miscellany which are those written by their author without any design to deceive have been judged to be most astonishing productions by the first critic of the present age after such a judgment it cannot be mentioned without exciting wonder that writings which deserve such a character should continue undistinguished amidst the trash of monthly compilations a striking similarity may be observed between them and their author both having met with a fate very unworthy their merit equally contemned and despised he living and dying in obscurity they remaining neglected and almost unknown  that they may hereafter stand a monument of the application and abilities of an unfortunate man untimely lost to himself and to the public one who had a slight knowledge of him in his life time but not enough to be acquainted with his merits until too late who considers the neglect which has been shown to these his acknowledged works as an imputation on the taste and curiosity of the age has employed a few leisure hours in collecting the following miscellany which he trusts after such respectable opinions as are before quoted will not require either excuse or apology but on the contrary will entitle him to the acknowledgments of those readers whose candor will induce them to applaud the marks of genius which may be found herein and at the same time make every due allowance for those imperfections which haste or the unhappy circumstances in which many of them were written would have given the author had he been living a title to expect and demand  j b bristol june  0      to the printer of the st jamess chronicle sir after the opinion which the reverend mr thomas warton has delivered concerning the authenticity of the poems attributed to rowley it may be expected that those who maintain a contrary doctrine should publish some arguments in support of it for my part i shall rather employ memory than sagacity on this subject and have no weight to throw into either scale except the following parallels observing at the same time how extraordinary it is that so

manuscript may not at this time be unacceptable to the generality of your readers  yours dunelmus bristolnensis   on fridaie was the time fixed for passing the newbrydge about the time of tollynge the

ethelgar a saxon poem it is not for thee o man to murmur at the will of the almighty when the thunders roar the lightnings shine on the rising waves and the black clouds sit on the brow of the lofty hill who then protects the flying deer swift as a sable cloud tossed by the whistling winds leaping over the rolling floods to gain the hoary wood whilst the lightnings shine on his chest and the wind rides over his horns when the wolf roars terrible as the voice of the severn moving majestic as the nodding forests on the brow of michelstow who then commands the sheep to follow the swain as the beams of light attend upon the morning  know o man that god suffers not the least member of his work to perish without answering the purpose of their creation the evils of life with some are blessings and the plant of death heals the wound of the sword  does the sea of trouble and affliction overwhelm thy soul look unto the lord thou shall stand firm in the days of temptation as the lofty hill of kinwulf in vain shall the waves beat against thee thy rock shall stand  comely as the white rocks bright as the star of the evening tall as the oak upon the brow of the mountain soft as the showers of dew that fall upon the flowers of the field ethelgar arose the glory of ex exanceastre noble were his ancestors as the palace of the great kenric his soul with the lark every morning ascended the skies and sported in the clouds when stealing down the steep mountain wrapped in a shower of spangling dew evening came creeping to the plain closing the flowers of the day shaking her pearly showers upon the rustling trees then was his voice heard in the grove as the voice of the nightingale upon the hawthorn spray he sung the works of the lord the hollow rocks joined in his devotions the stars danced to his song the rolling years in various mantles dressed confessed him man  he saw egwina of the vale his soul was astonished as the britons who fled before the sword of kenric she was tall as the towering elm stately as a black cloud bursting into thunder fair as the wrought bowels of the earth gentle and sweet as the morning breeze beauteous as the sun blushing like the vines of the west her soul as fair as the azure curtain of heaven she saw ethelgar her soft soul melted as the flying snow before the sun the shrine of st cuthbert united them the minutes fled on the golden wings of bliss nine horned moons had decked the sky when aelgar saw the light he was like a young plant upon the mountains side or the sun hid in a cloud he felt the strength of his fire and swift as the lightnings of heaven pursued the wild boar of the wood the morn awoke the sun who stepping from the mountains brow shook his ruddy locks upon the shining dew aelgar arose from sleep he seized his sword and spear and issued to the chase as waters swiftly falling down a craggy rock so raged young aelgar through the wood the wild boar bit his spear and the fox died at his feet from the thicket a wolf arose his eyes flaming like two stars he roared like the voice of the tempest hunger made him furious and and he fled like a falling meteor to the war like a thunderbolt tearing the black rock aelgar darted his spear through his heart the wolf raged like the voice of many waters and seizing aelgar by by the throat he sought the regions of the blessed  the wolf died upon his body  ethelgar and egwina wept  they wept like the rains of the spring sorrow sat upon them as the black clouds upon the mountains of death but the power of god settled their hearts  the golden sun arose to the highest of his power the apple perfumed the gale and the juicy grape delighted the eye ethelgar and egwina bent their way to the mountains side like two stars that move through the sky the flowers grew beneath their feet the trees spread out their leaves the sun played upon the rolling brook the winds gently passed along dark pitchy clouds veiled the face of the sun the winds roared like the noise of a battle the swift hail descended to the ground the lightnings broke from the sable clouds and gilded the dark brown corners of the sky the thunder shook the lofty mountains the tall towers nodded to their foundations the bending oaks divided the whistling wind the broken flowers fled in confusion round the mountains side ethelgar and egwina sought the sacred shade the bleak winds roared over their heads and the waters ran over their feet swift from the dark cloud the lightning came the skies blushed at the sight egwina stood on the brow of the lofty hill like an oak in the spring the lightnings danced about her garments and the blasting flame blackened her face the shades of death swam before her eyes and she fell breathless down the black steep rock the sea received her body and she rolled down with the roaring water  ethelgar stood terrible as the mountain of maindip the waves of despair harrowed up his soul as the roaring severn plows the sable sand wild as the evening wolf his eyes shone like the red vapors in the valley of the dead horror sat upon his brow like a bright star shooting through the sky he plunged from the lofty brow of the hill like a tall oak breaking from the roaring wind saint cuthbert appeared in the air the black clouds fled from the sky the sun gilded the spangling meadows the lofty pine stood still the violets of the vale gently moved to the soft voice of the wind the sun shone on the bubbling brook the saint arrayed in glory caught the falling mortal as the soft dew of the morning hangs upon the lofty elm he bore him to the sandy beech whilst the sea roared beneath his feet ethelgar opened his eyes like the gray orbs of the morning folding up the black mantles of the night  know o man said the member of the blessed to submit to the will of god he is terrible as the face of the earth when the waters sunk to their habitations gentle as the sacred covering of the oak secret as the bottom of the great deep just as the rays of the morning learn that thou art a man nor repine at the stroke of the almighty for god is as just as he is great the holy vision disappeared as the atoms fly before the sun ethelgar arose and bent his way

black waves rode over the roaring winds and the darkbrown clouds hid the face of the sun when the silver brook stood still and snow environed the top of the lofty mountain when the flowers appeared not in the blasted fields and the boughs of the leafless trees bent with the loads of ice when the howling of the wolf affrighted the darkly glimmering light of the western sky kenrick terrible as the tempest young as the snake of the valley strong as the mountain of the slain his armor shining like the stars in the dark night when the moon is veiled in sable and the blasting winds howl over the wide plain his shield like the black rock prepared himself for war  ceolwolf of the high mountain who viewed the first rays of the morning star swift as the flying deer strong as a young oak fierce as an evening wolf drew his sword glittering like the blue vapors in the valley of horso terrible as the red lightning bursting from the darkbrown clouds his swift bark rode over the foaming waves like the wind in the tempest the arches fell at his blow and he wrapped the towers in flames he followed kenrick like a wolf roaming for prey  centwin of the vale arose he seized the massy spear terrible

     0 gorthmund translated from the saxon the loud winds whistled through the sacred grove of thor far over the plains of denania were the cries of the spirits heard the howl of hubbas horrid voice swelled upon every blast and the shrill shriek of the fair locabara shot through the midnightsky  gorthmund slept on his couch of purple the blood of the slain was still on his cruel hand his helmet was stained with purple and the banner of his father was no more white his soul shuddered at the howl of hubba and the shrill shriek of locabara he shook like the trembling reed when the loud tempest rolls the foaming flood over the pointed rocks pale was his face as the eglantine which climbs the branches of the slowery bramble he started from his couch his black locks stood upright on his head like the spears which stand round the tent of the warriors when the silver moon spangles on the tranquil lake  why will thou torment me hubba it was not by my hand that the sword drank thy blood who saw me plunge the dagger to the heart of locabara no nardin of the forest was far away cease cease thy shrieks i cannot bear them on thy own sword thou have thy death and the fair virgin of the hills fell beneath the rage of the mountains leave me leave me witness hell hela or hell was the idol of the danes not as some authors falsely aslert of the saxons he was the god of battle and victory it is worthy remark that every pagan deity of the northern nations had his symbol or type under which he was worshipped the type of hell was a black raven hence the danish standard was a raven the symbol of woden was a dragon which was the standard of the saxons in general and the arms of wessex i knew not locabara i forced her not to my embraces no i slew her not she fell by the mountaincers leave me leave me o soul of hubba  exmundbert who bore the the office of shieldbearer was very ancient and honorable the leaders of armies had generally three shieldbearers one to bear the shield painted or engraved with the symbol of the god and the others were employed to sound the shields of alarm silver shield of gorthmund flew from his downy couch swift as the rumor of a coming host he struck the golden cup and the king of the flying warriors awakened from his dream of terror exmundbert is he gone strike the silver shield call up the sons of battle who sleep on the mossy banks of from but stay it is all a vision it is over and gone as the image of woden in the evening of a summerday hence to thy tent i will sleep again  gorthmund doubled his purple robe and slept again  loud as the noise of a broken rock breaking down the caverns of seoggeswaldscyre seoggeswaldscyre from seggeswald where ethelbald the ninth king of the mercians and fifteenth monarch of england was slain in an insurrection of his subjects this poem is certainly older than alfreds time and is among numerous others a proof that the division of england into shires was not introduced by that glorious monarch  was the voice of hubba heard sharp as the cry of the bird of death at the window of the wounded warrior when the red rays of the morning rise breaking from the east and the soul of the sick is flying away with the darkness was the shriek of locabara rise from thy couch gorthmund thou wolf of the evening when the sun shines in the glory of the day when the laboring swain dances in the woodland shade when the sparkling stars glimmer in the azure of the night and contentment sleeps under the rustic roof thou shall have no rest thine are the bitter herbs of affliction for thee shall the wormwood shed its seed on the blossoms of the blooming flower and imbitter with its falling leaves the waters of the brook rise gorthmund rise the saxons are burning thy tents rise for the mercians are assembled together and thy armies will be slain with the sword or burnt in the image of the pagan saxons had a most inhuman custom of burning their captives alive in a wicker image of their god tewisk whilst this horrid sacrifice was performing they shouted and danced round the flames tewisk the god of victory shall be red with thy blood and they shall shout at the sacrifice rise gorthmund thy eyes shall be closed in peace no more  the king of the swift warriors started from his couch he shook like an oak through which the lightnings have cut their rapid way his eyes rolled like the lights on the saxons barks in the tempest of the dark and black night  exmundbert flew to his chief he struck the silver shield sueno of the dark lake and the black haired lecolwin caught the lance and the shield and pressed into the royal tent  warriors strike the shields of alarm the mercians are assembled together the saxons are burning our tents give the cry of war and issue to the battle come upon them by the side of the thick wood near the city of rowcester in derbyshire a place of great antiquity reggacester lift the banner reafan and he is a worshipper of false gods who withholds his sword from blood the silver shield resounded to the wood of sell and the in the original muchilney as there were several islands of this name the particular one here mentioned is aubions great island trembled at the clamorous noise  delward of the strong arm and axbred of the forest of wolves led the warriors to the thick wood but quiet was the forest as the tranquil lake when the winds sleep on the tops of the lofty trees the inhabitants of reggacester slept in the strength of their walls the leaders returned  there is no enemy near o king still as the habitation of the dead are the kingdoms around us they have felt the strength of thy arm and will no more rise up to oppose us as the grass falls by the hand of the mower so shall they fall before us and be no more the banner reafan shall be exalted and the seven gods of the saxons be trampled in the dust let the armies of the north rejoice let them sacrifice to the gods of war and bring out the prisoners for the the danes not to be behindhand with the saxons in acts of barbarity had also their bloody sacrifices their captives were bound to a stake and shot to death with arrows feast of blood the warriors threw down the lance and the shield and the axe of battle the plates of brass dropped from their shoulders and they danced to the sound of the the word in the original is regabibol an instrument of music of which as i know nothing farther than that it was used in sacrifices i have translated as above ribible among the anglosaxons was an instrument not unlike a violin but played on with the fingers instrument of sacrifice confused as the cry of the fleet dogs when the white bear is pursued over the mountains of the north confused as the resolutions of terror was the noise of the warriors they danced till the mantle of midnight ascended from the earth  the morning shook the dew from her crown of roses on the yellow locks of the dancers and the gleams of light shot through the dark gray sky like the reeking blood over the shield of steel see warriors a dark cloud sits on the mountains brow it will be a tempest at noon and the heavy rains will fall upon us yes ye in the original tanmen which signifies either danes or northern men danes it will be a tempest but a tempest of war it will rain but in showers of blood for the dark cloud is the army of a mercian of this name commanded the army of offa and a nobleman named sigebert was of great account in the court of brightrick king of essex segowald he leads the flower of the warriors of mercia and on his right hand is the mighty son of battle the great sigebert who leads the warriors of wessex  the dance was ended and the captives of sacrifice bound to the sacred tree they panted in the pangs of death  sudden from the borders of the wood was the alarm given and the silver shield rouzed the sun from behind the black clouds the archers of the sacrifice dropped the bow and caught the lance and the shield confusion spread from watchtower to watchtower and the clamor rung to the distant hills  gorthmund raged like a wild boar but he raged in vain his whole army was disordered and the cry of war was mixed with the yell of retreat  segowald came near with his mercians on the right hand and the great sigebert led the saxons round the thick wood  the danes rage like the tempest of winter but the mercians stand firm as the grove of oaks on the plains of ambrosbury in wiltshire where alfritha wife to king edgar built a nunnery to atone for the murder of her soninlaw edward in this place eleanor queen to henry the third lived a nun ambroisburgh great is the strength of the swift warriors of the north but their troops are broken and out of the order of battle  the saxons with the great sigebert have incircled the wood they rage in the fight like wolves the danes are pressed on all sides they fly like the leaves in autumn before the strong wind  gorthmund scorns to fly he is descended from the son of battle lachollan whose sword put to flight the armies of moeric when the sun was covered with a mantle of blood and darkness descended upon the earth at noon day he bears upon his arm the shield of lofgar the keeper of the castle of teigne lofgar never fled though the lances of the foe flew about him numerous as the winged ants in summer lofgar never fled though the warriors of the mountains hurled the rocks upon him in the valley when he fought for the shield of penda and should gorthmund fly gorthmund whose sword was his law who held justice in his banner  segowald sought gorthmund he found him singly encountering an army  turn to me son of lofgar i am segowald of the lake have thou not heard of my fame in battle when the army of hengist panted on the darkbrown heath i cheared them to the war and the banner of victory waved over my head turn thy arms upon me gorthmund i am worthy thy strength  the son of lofgar rushed to the son of alderwold they fought like the children of destruction on the plain of marocan gorthmund fell he fell like the mountain boar beneath the arrow of the hunter  as the shades of death danced before his eyes he heard the yell of hubba and the shrill shriek of locabara thou art fallen thou son of injustice thou art fallen thy shield is degraded in the dust and thy banner will be honored no more thy swift warriors are fled over the plain as the driving sheep before the wolf think gorthmund think on hubba the son of crinewalch of the green hill think on locabara whom thy sword sent to the regions of death remember thy injustice and die  narva and mored an african eclogue recite the loves of narva and mored the priest of chalmas triple idol said high from the ground the youthful warriors sprung loud on the concave shell the lances rung in all the mystic mazes of the dance the youths of bannys burning sands advance whilst the soft virgin panting looks behind and rides upon the pinions of the wind ascends the mountains brow and measures round the steepy cliffs of chalmas sacred ground chalma the god whose noisy thunders fly through the dark covering of the midnight sky whose arm directs the closeembattled host and sinks the laboring vessels on the coast chalma whose excellence is known from far from lupas rocky hill to calabar the guardian god of afric and the isles where nature in her strongest vigor smiles where the blue blosson of the forky thorn bends with the nectar of the opening morn where gingers aromatic matted root creep through the mead and up the mountains shoot three times the virgin swimming on the breeze danced in the shadow of the mystic trees when like a dark cloud spreading to the view the firstborn sons of war and blood pursue swift as the elk they pour along the plain swift as the flying clouds distilling rain swift as the boundings of the youthful roe they course around and lengthen as they go like the long chain of rocks whose summits rise far in the sacred regions of the skies upon whose top the blackning tempest lours whilst down its side the gushing torrent pours like the long cliffy mountains which extend from lorbars cave to where the nations end which sink in darkness thickning and obscure impenetrable mystic and impure the flying terrors of the war advance and round the sacred oak repeat the dance furious they twist around the gloomy trees like leaves in autumn twirling with the breeze

stand complete fragment of a sermon by the celebrated rowlie to the editor of the gentlemans magazine sir the late publication of a volume of poems said to have been written by thomas rowlie in the   th century having given rise to some ingenious criticisms respecting their authenticity i beg leave to send you the following fragment of a sermon by the same author it was given to me some time since by mr george catcott whose name has been so often mentioned on the present occasion and to whose inquisitive disposition and very commendable zeal the public is principally indebted for the preservation and appearance of these valuable productions of antiquity it may be necessary to inform you that when chatterton gave this fragment to his friend he was utterly and ever after continued unacquainted with any language but his mother tongue and that the citations of these languages from two ancient authors have been fully authenticated the poetical talents of our bard are established by the publication of his poems but the following fragment of a sermon on the divinity of the holy spirit displays him in the more illustrious character of an orthodox divine every circumstance which tends to throw light on the history of rowlie should be given to the public and his sentiments on so essential a point of the christian religion by no means suppressed notwithstanding they may not have the sanction of an age unhappily overgrown with arianism and infidelity chatterton himself although he totally disbelieved the subject of the fragment had however the ingenuity to produce it and i am sorry that the ingenuous editors had not thought it and some others of rowlies prose productions in their possession worthy of being published together with his poetical compositions  yours etc a b   i have been favored with the perusal of some prose mss now in mr catcots possession that prove rowlies existence beyond the possibility of a doubt  fragment havvnge whylomme ynn dyscourse provedd

with very great expense and rowley assisted him in making the collection the greatest part of a large folio was filled with his compositions this folio rowley says was a present wordie of a great king and the loss of it will be sincerely regretted by the friends of literature as the writings might have thrown some light on the learning of those times canynge was also a man of an extensive genius and a liberal turn of mind the distinguished patron of literature and a lover of the fine arts rowley it appears by his writings lived in the greatest intimacy with him and received very extraordinary marks of his favor and generosity on all occasions he shows his gratitude to his illustrious friend takes perpetual delight in dwelling on his many amiable virtues and constanly manifests an earnest desire of transmitting his fame to posterity this appears not only in many of his poems but also in the following prose work preserved by chatterton and printed in the town andcountry magazine for nov      which as a literary curiosity our readers we doubt not will be glad to see republished here with several corrections for other particulars of this maecenas of the bristol virgil they must wait till mr barrett favors the world with his history of that city  some farther account of this extraordinary person written by rowley the priest i was fadre confessor to masteres roberte and mastre william cannings mastre robert was a man after his fadres own heart greedy of gaynes and sparynge of alms deeds but master william was mickle courteous and gave me many marks in my needs at the age of    years deacesd master roberte and by master williams desire bequeathd me one hundred marks i went to thank master william for his mickle courtesy and to make tender of myself to him  fadre quod he i have a crotchett in my brain that will need your aid master william said i if you command me i will go to room for you not so far distant said he i ken you for a mickle learnd priest if you will leave the parysh of our lady and travel for me it shall be mickle to your profits  i gave my hands and he told me i must go to all the abbeys and pryorys and gather together ancient drawyings if of any account at any price consented i to the same and pursuant set outt he mundaie following for the minster of our lady and saint goodwyne where a drawing of a steeple contryvd for the belles when runge

yoynge thomas took on so that he was shorn  he drew many fine drawyings on glass  the abott of the minster of peterburrow sold it me he might have bargaynd  0 marks better but master william would not part with it the prior of coventree did sell me a picture of great account made by badilian yallyanne who did live in the reign of king henry the first a mann of fickle temper havyng been tendered syx

the church of our lady to the astonishing of king edward who was so suriously madd and ravyngs withal that master cannings was wyling to give him  000 marks which made him peace again and he was admyted to the presence of the king staid in bristow partook of all his pleasures and pastimes till he departed the next year  i gave master cannings my bristow tragedy for which he gave me in hands twenty pounds and did praise it more then i did think my self did deserve for i can say in troth i was never proud of my verses since i did read master chaucer and now having naught to do and not wyling to be idle i went to the minster of our lady and saint goodwin and then did purchase the saxon manuscripts and set my self diligentley to translate and word it in english meter which in one year i performd and styled it the battle of hastyngs master william did bargyin for one manuscript and john pelham an esquire of ashley for another  master william did praise it muckle greatly but advisd me to tender it to no man beying the menn whose name were therein mentiond would be offended he gave me  0 marks and i did go to ashley to master pelham to be paid of him for the other one i

house and i much marville it was untenanted a person greedy of gains was the then possessour and of him i did buy it at a very small rate having lookd on the ground works and main supports and fynding them staunch and repayrs no need wanting i did buy of the owner geossry coombe on a repayring lease for    years he thinkying it would fall down every day but with a few marks expense did put it up in a manner neat and therein i lyvd    antiquity of christmas games in the days of our ancestors christmas was a period sacred to mirth and hospitality though not wholly neglected now it cannot boast of the honors it once had the veneration for religious seasons fled with popery and old english hospitality is long since deceased our modern playthings of fortune who make the whole year a revolution of dissipation and joyless festivity cannot distinguish this season unless by resting from their laborious pleasures and if they can think find a happy serenity in solitude and reflection unknown in the tumult of hurricanes  the ancient christmas gambols were in my opinion superior to our modern spectacles and amusements wrestling hurling the ball and dancing in the woodlands were pleasures for men it is true the conversation of the hearthfide was the tales of superstition the fairies robin goodfellow and hobgoblins never failed to make the trembling audience mutter an ave maria and cross their chins but the laughable exercises of blindmans buff riddling and question and command sufficiently compensated for the sew sudden starts of terror add to these amusements the wretched voices of the chanters and sub chanters howling carols in latin the chiming of consecrated bells the burning consecrated wax candles curiously representing the virgin mary praying the saint whose monastery stood nearest the munching consecrated crossloaves sold by the monks all which effectually eradicated the specter of their terrific stories nor were these the only charms against the foul fiends and nightmare sleeping crosslegged like the effigies of knights templars and warriors and the holy bush and churchyard yew were certain antidotes against those invisible beings after this representation i may be thought partial to my own hobbyhorse as an antiquary in giving the preference to the amusements of the days of old but let the sentimental reader consider that the tales of superstition when believed affect the soul with a sensation pleasurably horrid we may paint in more lively colors to the eye they spoke to the heart  the great barons and knights usually kept open house during this season when their villains or vassals were entertained with bread beef and beer and a pudding wastol cake or christmas kitchel and a groat in silver at parting being obliged in return to wave the full flaggon round their heads in honor of the master of the house sometimes the festival continued till twelfthday when the baron or his steward took the deis or upper seat of the table and after dinner gave every man a new gown of his livery and two christmas kitchels  this kind of liberality endeared the barons to the common people and made them ever ready to take up arms under their banners  a register of the nunnery of keynsham relates that william earl of gloucester entertained two hundred knights with tilts and fortunys at his great manor of keynsham provided thirty pies of the eels of avon as a curious dainty and on the twelfthday began the plays for the knights by the monks with miracles and maumeries for the henchmen and servants by minstrels  here is plainly a distinction made between maumeries and miracles and the more noble representations comprehended under the name plays the first were the holiday entertainments of the vulgar the other of the barons and nobility the private exhibitions at the manors of the barons were usually family histories the monk who represented the master of the family being arrayed in a tabard or heralds coat without sleeves painted with all the hatchments of the names in these domestic performances absurdities were unavoidable and in a play wrote by sir tibbet gonges constance countess of bretagne and richmond marries and buries her three husbands in the compass of an hour sometimes these pieces were merely relations and had only two characters of this kind as that in weevers funeral monuments none but the patrons of monasteries had the service of the monks in performing plays on holidays provided the same contained nothing against god or the church the public exhibitions were superior to the private the plot generally the life of some pope or the founder of the abbey the monks belonged to i have seen several of these pieces mostly latin and cannot think our ancestors so ignorant of dramatic excellence as the generality of modern writers would represent they had a good moral in view and some of the maumeries abound with wit which though low now was not so then minstrels jesters and mummers was the next class of performers every knight had two or thee minstrels and jesters who were maintained in his house to entertain his family in their hours of dissipation these chancer mentions in the following passages do

servant d b bristol may         anecdote of chaucer after chancer had distributed copies of the tale of piers plowman a franciscan friar wrote a satiric maumery upon him which was acted at the monasteries in london and at woodstock before the court chancer not a little nettled at the poignancy and popularity of the satire meeting his antagonist in fleet street beat him with his dagger for which he was fined two shillings as appears by a record of the inner temple where chancer was a student  anecdote concerning lord jeffries a few months before the abdication of the dastardly tyrant james ii lord chancellor jeffries of detested memory went to arundel in sussex in order to influence an election he took his residence at the castle and went the day fixed for the election to the town hall where mr peckam who was then mayor of arundel held his court jeffries had the impudence to show his bloody face there the mayor ordered him to withdraw immediately and in case of refusal threatened to have him committed you said he who ought to be the guardian of our laws and of our sacred constitution shall not so audaciously violate them this is my court and my jurisdiction here is above yours jeffries who was not willing to perplex still more the kings assairs and to enrage the populace retired immediately the next morning he invited peckham to breakfast with him which he accepted but he had the courage to scorn to take a place which the merciless executioner offered him  taken from the records of the town of arundel  to the printer of the town and country magazine sir being a little curious in antiquities i have found that the saxon heralds had these three tinctures heofnas weal and ocyre heofnas that is in saxon heaven i take to be azure weal that is strange or foreign purpure ten or any other color brought from soreign countries and ocyre may be the same with oker a yellow sossil and signifies or  if any of your ingenious correspondents whether heralds or antiquaries do not approve of my conjectures i should be glad to know their opinion of the above  i am sir your humble servant d b bristol feb        to the editor of the town and country magazine sir

sketch for the statue ordered to be erected to the memory of the late william beckford esquire by the court of common council explanation mr beckford in his robes as lord mayor treading on tyranny and supporting britannia who in a recumbent distressed posture looks up to him as imploring his assistance on an altar on which are the arms of the city of london the address surmounted with the cap of liberty and the city regalia the sword resting on magna charta encircled with laurel    sculpture is an art which by design and solid matter imitates the palpable objects of nature it is difficult to ascertain the epoch of its origin it is lost in the most remote antiquity the arts of imitation in general as painting architecture sculpture etc where the first invented sculptors began to work upon clay and wax which are more flexible and more pliable than wood and stone they soon made statues of trees which were neither subject to corruption nor worms as the lemontree the cypress the palm the olive the ebony and the vine at last they made use of metals ivory and the hardest stones marble especially became the most precious matter and the most esteemed for works of sculpture  the nations amongst which this fine art was in the greatest honor were the egyptians those people so celebrated by the monuments of their gratitude toward the memory of the kings their benefactors it was to perpetuate their names that they erected in the earliest ages the two colossean statues of mocrus and the queen his spouse  the egyptian sculptors excelled all others in exactness of proportion the different parts of a statue were often formed by diverse artists and these parts united made the whole perfect  the greek historians boast of the invention of that art in their country which they attribute to love however it is certain that the first essays of sculpture in greece were very unpolished but dedalus having traveled into egypt improved himself in this art and formed afterward pupils who became the admiration of a people whose taste was not yet refined by the elegant statues of phydias myron lysippus etc  the greeks subdued by the romans degenerated insensibly and the arts vanished with their freedom  sculpture was an exotic which never could thrive in victorious rome its transient glory was eclipsed by the other arts in the reign of augustus it declined under tiberius caius and claudius and reappeared with an enormous magnitude under nero  the gothic sculpture sprung afterward from a wild imagination unassisted by nature  the epoch of sculpture is the same in france and italy the celebrated michael angelo worked in rome under the pontificate of leo x whilst john goujon was admitted at paris under the patronage of francis i  the english advanced by slow degrees to the perfection of that art in which they now rival their ancient masters  the sculptors gave the name of statue to a figure in embossed work that stands by itself in wood stone marble or metal of persons conspicuous by their birth their rank or their merit  the ancients often represented figures of men kings and even gods under a species of statues smaller than the natural size  those of persons who had distinguished themselves by their superior knowledge their virtues or some important services to the commonwealth were erected at the public expense in statues of human size  the third species of statues was designed for kings and emperors they were taller than men commonly are and those which personated heroes were larger in proportion  as for the colossean statues they represented gods and often kings and emperors desirous to magnify themselves by these stupendous works reared at their own expense monuments of their vanity and folly  an equestrian statue exhibits a man on horseback as the statue of charles i at charing cross the statue of henry iv at paris and that of cosmo de medicis at leghorn  a greek statue is naked and antique thus called because the greeks displayed in that manner the gods the heroes and the athlets of the olympic games  the roman statues are all represented with a drapery  a mausoleum is a pompous funeral monument decorated with sculpture and architecture with an epitaph sacred to the memory of some considerable personage it derives its etymology from the magnificent tomb which queen artemisa caused to be erected for mausolus king of caria her husband  heroes patriots and statesmen are not only entitled to the love and veneration of their cotemporaries during their lives but their virtues and services ought to be transmitted to the latest posterity this vanity of surviving our dust by lasting monuments of national gratitude has prompted men to the most noble actions and inspired them with the emulation of being enrolled in the records of time with those great heroes whose statues and inscriptions they contemplate with a sort of extacy the tombs of westminsterabbey fill the mind with that awful reverence which a magnificent and grateful nation testifies for its benefactors the portraits of the illustrious warriors who have subdued our inveterate enemies in both hemisphered exposed to public view in vauxhallgardens create even in a dissipated multitude a kind of admiration greatly superior to that inspired by the enchantment of the place the spirit and magnamanity of the incorruptible beckford so becoming the first magistrate of the metropolis of a powerful empire his noble and animated speech to the throne which was the last public testimony of his unwearied zeal for his countrys cause will be echoed with applause at the sight of his statue by the succeeding generation to whom he tried to transmit our constitution restored to its pristine purity  adventures of a star i shall omit the minute passages of my life which happened whilst my members were in a state of separation and begin my history where i began to see the polite world  in the lacemans shop my possessor was a substantial man and of some account among the monied men at jonathans he was accounted a wit at his club at the robinhood which was not then altogether as patriotic as it is now no cato being permitted to mount the table and harangue himself into an asthma here i lived in a state of inactivity for above a month and heard nothing but the usual discourse of trade when one day a couple of pretty ladies hurried into the shop from a coach dignified with a coronet well mr spangle we want to take a view of the newest patterns you have lord my dear and is the wretch really jealous quite mad pon honor dont you think this pattern very pretty why he had the impudence to declare that i should receive no more visits from the colonel an amazing pretty stomacher pray what is the price and i hope you answered him like a woman of quality and spirit certainly my dear fifty guineas mr spangle well let me have it and book it to lord g  r i will never disgrace my title but my dear harriot i have reason to fear his jealousy will veer round to the right object reason to fear my dear what an expression is that for a woman of quality you have reason to fear nothing but his interrupting your happiness and that i defy him to do here harry take the trifles yours mr spangle and away drove the titular honourables whom i heard no more of till my exaltation among the quality the next discourse of any consequence happened between mr spangle and his son jack spangle was as complete a city buck as any who srequent the park when the sun shines he spoke an anglicised french very sluently and murdered an overture upon the violin to admiration jack said the old gentleman to him one day when the ungracious spendthrift had made application for the other bank bill these wild courses will never do i hear you have a mistress i dont begrudge it jack but why will you pay so confounded dear for her i make allowances you are flesh and blood as well as myself would you had as much prudence as many years have taught me i protest when i was a young fellow i cut as pretty a figure as you with half the expense i used to take a trip into the country hire a good handsome wench as my servant put her into reputable lodgings and buy every thing necessary for her myself and by these means fix her my own at an easy rate here was the surgeons bill saved and my constitution kept whole and sound for matrimony if ever fate should throw a wife with ten thousand pounds in my way i made every lady a compliment but seldom accompanied it with any other present than a kiss would you jack pursue the same prudent method you would find the benefit of it but i am afraid you are resolved to buy experience dear  jack heard this admonition with a sheepishness natural enough to the choice spirits of the city when they are under the rod of correction but the old gentleman producing a bill at the end of his harangue jacks countenance brightened up he received it and bowing respectfully stammered out it is very true sir as you say sir  after lying in the shop three months and four days i always endeavor to be precise in my chronology as it gives the reader assurance that the history is really and bona fide true one of my rays by an accident began to be a little tarnished this was a terrible misfortune as in consequence of it i was degraded to the glasscase at the door i now gave way to the most violent emotionsof despair and thought my splendour irretrievable saw all my hopes of rising in the polite world vanished and expected never to be relieved till the day of transmutation from my disgraceful situation but fate had kinder days in store for me the first object that claimed my attention in the street was the superb chair of mrs spermacety the waxchandlers wife her chairmen were loaded with silver lace and the footman who cleared the way had an enormous bag wig i expected to have seen it filled with the dignity of a duchess but how great was my astonishment when i perceived a short fat woman of the same complexion as the sign of the saracens head fastened in it she was dressed meanly rich without the shadow of elegance in any thing but her chair which had formerly belonged to a lady of quality having purchased it at her decease her sneaking pitiful countenance did not discover one grain of generosity or nobility she appeared an absolute burlesque on the grandeur which surrounded her the following dialogue between mr spangle and his good friend and neighbor mr pickle let me into her whole history good morning to you neighbor spangle as the man said methinks mrs spermaceti shines today she shines every day at home and abroad mr pickle but there may be reasons for it and the gray mare is sometimes the better horse this stroke though in my opinion not very brilliant brought a horselaugh on both sides for about ten minutes you are a wit neighbor you are a wit but they say as how that mrs spermaceti was formerly her husbands cookmaid but lies and snowballs gather in rolling pray is there any truth in the matter between ourselves there is a great deal of truth in it and the first charm that mr spermaceti found in his spouse was that she dressed ortolans to a miracle another loud laugh of applause echoed to the end of the street and they say mr spangle as how that she lost three thousand pounds one night at the gaming table to lord whatyecallum  lord dillitanti is that true very true upon my word for tom shamwell who now lives by his wit stood behind her chair to let him into her hand as they call it well the lord help us all it is a sad thing to have a spending wife who consumes all the money before we gets it  this edifying discourse was terminated by a hearty shake of the hand and an invitation from both parties to partake of a bottle of wine i had now remained exposed to public view for about three weeks and had caught the eye of every staring countryman who did honor to my fallen brightness by exclaiming odzounds what a woundy pretty thingamy fortune at last began to smile and my deliverance from disgrace was effected in the following manner  father landridella was at the time of the intended assassination of the king of portugal treasurer to a principal college of the order of jesus in the city of lisbon he was the intimate friend and considant of malagrida and assisted him in composing those ridiculous whimsies which the inquisition condemned as heretical he was also deep in the important secret and when the conspiracy began to unravel was happy enough to escape the flames which malagrida and the other conspirators perished in the inhumanity with which the innocent families of the only two noble conspirators were treated is too shocking to be dwelt upon  andridella went first to paris where he was employed by st florentin to bear certain presents to certain ministers in england on a pacific account but he demanding more for his trouble than st florentin chose to give he was threatened with being confined for life in the bastile which threat would have been actually carried into execution had he not timely got away to england  how a certain physician came by his intelligence shall be known in due time  andridella for reasons best known to himself shifted his habit and equipped himself as a pedlar being a man of an extensive genius and great knowledge in chemistry he prepared several tinctures for taking spots out of linen recovering tarnished gold or silver and other ingenious minutiae in one of his diurnal rotations he called on mr spangle and imparted to him the virtues of his box i was accordingly taken down to bear witness to the excellence of his tincture and on the touch of his brush moistened by it shone forth with redoubled luster which by a natural sympathy glittered also in the eyes of mr spangle andridella was paid generously and i was once more carefully laid up in the shop but my stay there was very short for mr buckram the tailor gave me the preference before twenty of my brethren and fixed me to a magnificent suit of clothes which were conveyed to b  n house for the use of a young d  just stepped into his estate and title  the duke of d  e was the nobleman upon whose breast i commanded respect paracelsus and that ingenious astrologic physician culpeper assert that gold and silver have a magic virtue the magic of this virtue commercially considered is interest physically it is chimerical and metaphisically it is a fine subtle genius or spirit as capable of reasoning upon matter as any deist since bolingbroke by the magic of my composition i was enabled to look internally into the bosoms which i adorned externally and had no reason to be dissatisfied with my situation as his graces heart was no dishonor to his star he was young and had his foibles the principal of which was a strong passion for gaming reason in vain endeavored to convince him of his error had he been convinced his resolution would have been too feeble to bear him through in a reformation the first time i adorned him i visited the court after the levee was over he was accosted by lord rattle ah d  e how the devil do you do to day i was horridly dipped last night thirteen bottles of champaigne demme lord shuffle was bit this morning of three thousand and has sent to his steward to cut down a whole forest to have a better stock to proceed upon pray have you seen c  ds letters o horrid dont mention the stuff i sicken at the idea lady bab blouzy has had the vapors these five days by perusing as many lines nauseous pon onour i always write my billets in french a certain preservative against vulgar criticism gadso youre right my lord but as i always thought writing pedantic and beneath a nobleman my valet always writes my amorous epistles and a fine fellow he is too trims a sentiment like a bagwig and twists a meaning like a curl i admired his lordships prudence in making his valet a secretary as it was more than probable he was better qualified for the office than his honorable master  in the evening i accompanied the duke to the gamingtable my luster sickened and my whole frame trembled at beholding the knot of rascals and villains who surrounded him some he honored with a nod and others he condescended to enter into a conversation with and then with an air of careless indifference sat down to play and before he rose lost above eight thousand pounds this loss but very little affected him and he went home with the same composure of mind he brought out with him the sharpers who shared the booty were sir richard  lord m  jack hounslow and father andredilla whose ingenuity had raised me to my present exalted station sir richard had a legal claim to his title but no man could disgrace it with more villainies or meannesses his humble soul stooped to every thing when interest was in the way and his tender conscience never gave him any trouble about the matter though lord m  and this conscientious knight of the post were continually quarrelling every were else they always agreed at the gamingtable in a very capital point viz to bubble his grace his grace was so easy so superficially learned in the art of gambling and his antagonists so cunning and deep in the mystery that b  nhouse was more than once on the verge of being sold to pay these inpostors what the world calls debts of honor lord m  who though young yet enervated with pleasure had still a hankering desire to be sacrificing on the altar of the cytherean goddess and by the infallibility of a bankbill had gained admittance into the chamber of miss r  rs the baronets mistress his lordship was making his addresses when sir richard made his appearance as the baronet was a man of prudence and knew how to make use of an opportunity he proposed to his lordship that if he should be permitted to partake of the profits arising from his grace and an eminent east india bubble his lordship should partake in common with the baronet in the charms of miss r  rs lord m  stretched his gallantry to the utmost and complied and it was upon this consideration that the baronet had admittance to the gaming table jack hounslow was his lordships understrapper he had been an upholsterer but having squandered his stock and nothing being left but a pair of pistols he employed them to the most profitable advantage by levying contributions on the highway the frequent executions of his fellow laborers striking a damp upon his spirits and having now pretty well recruited his pockets he gave up his hazardous employment and commenced sharper lord m  soon discovered his inventive genius and useful parts and engaged him in his service  sir kenelm digby who so religiously maintained the doctrine of sympathy would have attributed his lordships discovery to similar feelings in his own breast but as many tedious and learned arguments may be brought to maintain it and to say but little in a case of importance is worse than nothing at all and for other good causes and considerations i shall leave it entirely to the reader  father andredilla having acquired a considerable sum by his tinctures put himself into a magnificent dress hired three servants and assuming the title of marquis de villa garcia completed the party who were continually preying upon the inexperience of the duke one morning lord rattle came thundering in upon his grace o d  e i shall die with risibility never was such a comical figure demme no masquerade face can be half so laughable there is c  d gone to his trial with a countenance as dejected as lord b  es when at kingston and lady harriet g  r with a face as bronzed and as impudent as a naiad of covent garden pretty work rattle and what do you think will be the issue between you and i i have a very important secret and could i confide in your retentive faculties by the lord i have no friend upon earth i would rather reveal it to you may depend upon my honor jack did i ever betray your inestimable secrets why then d  e it is absolutely determined that when a divorce is obtained c  d shall positively marry lady harriet i may confide in your honor now i hope undoubtedly replied his grace smothering a laugh your secrets are of too much importance to be trisled with lord rattles whispers had generally as much truth as those of a coffeehouse politician who is happy in the acquaintance of a paragraphmaker  i had lived with his grace long enough to see him bubbled out of thirty thousand pounds and was then configned as a customary fee to his valet who immediately carried me to monmouthstreet to take my chance with an army of decayed gentry some of whom i had been acquainted with in their days of prosperity as i had lived my usual time among the great i submitted to my fate without murmuring a black velvet coat and waistcoat my near neighbors were taken down to give physical dignity to a young fellow who had newly commenced quackdoctor and found out a nostrum to cure distempers which never existed this suit had once adorned a genius of the same profession whose extraordinary operations in moorfields had made him the envy of all hattongarden doctor bialini the original wearer was quite an esculapius in his way he was unacquainted with every principle in surgery but having as much courage and impudence as ignorance he boldly undertook the most difficult operations when he happened to divide an artery in the cure of a scratch it was all very well and he had discovered by experience that diverting the distemper to the nobler parts was an infalliable cure for inconsiderable ailments he couched for the cataract and where he cured one by chance he made twenty totally blind beyond all possibility of recovery but success did not always attend his adventure a young lady of great family applying to him to be eased of a troublesome pain in the head he gave her such a dose of his cathartic pills that she expired under their operation the friends of the deceased accused the doctor of murder and left it to his choice either to take a dose of his own cathartics or leave england to return no more as he knew the merit of his medicaments too well to choose the first he returned to italy to exercise his honester occupation of a tailor his solemn habiliments were now disposed of to his successor in fame mr perron who had been educated a cobbler and on the merit of being twice salivated advertised to cure a certain distemper in all its extensive branches the regular surgeons have had no reason to complain of his success as he has greatly increased the business of the faculty by confirming the disease and ruining the constitution in every patient he undertook to cure the warehouse i was laid up in was greatly frequented by secondhand gentry among whom i heard many entertaining discourses but too foreign from my purpose to be related here a servant enquiring for a rich suit with a star i was accordingly taken down approved of and carried off i wondered what use i was going to be put to when a meagre tall old man made his appearance well done my bra bonny laddie this is saving the siller and laying up more for the bairn these words were uttered by the identical duke of a  who putting on his prudent finery stepped into a coach as antiquated as hospitality and rattled off to court the reception he met with from his m  would have shamed virtue out of countenance when we see villainy and avarice caressed what shall we say but that k  s are men his only merit was in being born a scot and distantly related to lord b  i had examined his breast and found him nothing but a composition of pride fraud and avarice as he was deep in all his favored countrymans secrets the affair of the peace was not unknown to him and he had no inconsiderable share of the booty not contented with his share he revealed the transaction to a certain western physician binding him by oath not to discover from whom he had his intelligence and articling to receive a moiety of whatever should be given the doctor to stop his mouth or say nothing at all to the purpose the whole juggle was transacted entirely to the dukes satisfaction and he partook so gloriously of the hushmoney that for a moment emerging from his usual avarice he gave his servants new liveries and matched one of his horses having before paired a bay and a black one the nobility did not receive him so well as his m  as he was universally looked upon as a scandal to his title he was shunned by every polite company unfortunately the too retentive memory of a gentleman discovered his graces clothes to have been worn by a more honorable nobleman and having whispered his discovery to lady henrietta f  h as a very great secret it was known all over the town before the evening that the duke of a  had been to court in the duke of d  s castoff clothes nothing can express the vexation of the old duke his pride which had stooped to his avarice in the purchase of his prudent bargain began though too late to have the preeminence he ordered his servant to bear me back to monmouthstreet and desire the fripperyman to refund the money which he did after deducting a guinea for the use of his magnificence i was now taken off the coat and condemned to the meltingpot but whilst the executioner is preparing my siery grave i have time to subscribe myself  the publics humble servant a star  to the printer of the town and country magazine sir as there are few monthly productions so universally read as your agreeable miscellany i have taken the liberty to beg the insertion of the following short account of my life in which i shall be as brief as possible and which if you think proper to countenance may be a means to warn others of my sex from falling into the same unhappy snares which i now fatally experience have been my ruin  my parents were people of some repute for my father enjoyed a place under the government of upwards of two hundred pounds a year besides a small estate in the country which brought him in about a hundred and fifty pounds a year more as i was their only daughter they naturally took the best care of my learning that their income would permit and i was sent early to a boarding school where i received the rudiments of a polite education and made as great progress in french music etc as could reasonably be expected  i was in my thirteenth year when my father died of a fever and as he had been no great oeconomist and the estate which he enjoyed was to leave our family at his death my poor mother and i were left without the least resource grief for the loss of a tender and affectionate husband soon put an end to my mothers distress and i was now the only one left to suffer for the faults of my poor fathers imprudence it happened i had a near relation who was married to a gentleman of fortune who pitying my situation took me home with her to be a companion by the cheerfulness of my disposition and my universal assiduities to please i ingratiated myself so much in the favor of my cousin and mr m  and received for it such convincing proofs of their friendship and desire to make me happy that i soon forgot the loss i had so lately sustained mr and mrs m  were extremely goodnatured and affable and i enjoyed every felicity i could wish for in my dependent state unluckily for me mrs m  was threatened with a consumption just as i had attained my fifteenth year which daily increasing in about six months terminated a life the loss of which i have now the utmost reason to lament but not before she had recommended me to the care of mr m  in such terms that none but a wretch abandoned to all manner of villainy could have ever forgot  i felt every emotion of grief which a heart truly susceptible of gratitude could experience at such a shock but my concern was soon alleviated by the assurances i received from my surviving benefactor of a continuance of that protection and esteem i had hitherto met with by his genorosity i was rendered sole mistress of his house and had every indulgence granted which i could expect as he had no children he took me frequently with him for an airing in the chariot and though i observed his fondness for me daily increase i did not suffer the least suspicion to enter my breast being of an age in which young women are initiated in company and as i was to move in a more genteel sphere than formerly i was no longer to be supported in my present character but at a considerable expense so that he spared no cost to make me appear suitable to that rank in which he placed me  by this stratagem which i did not at first understand he filled me with additional tenderness and gratitude compelled me to repose on him as my only support and by my sense of his favor and the desire of retaining it disposed me to unlimited complaisances at last the wretch took advantage of the familiarity which he enjoyed as my relation and the submission which he exacted as my benefactor to attempt the ruin of an orphan whom his indulgence had melted and his authority had subdued shocked at the baseness of his designs i summoned all the courage which a weak woman could employ and resented his behavior with a becoming indignation but instead of recoiling at the deed he upbraided me with ingratitude and mingled his artifices with menaces of total desertion if i should continue to resist  i was now completely depressed and though i had seen mankind enough to know the necessity of outward cheerfulness i often withdrew to my chamber to vent my grief and examine by what means i might escape perpetual mortification the loss of my indulgent parents and kind cousin were now severely felt and i only reflected that had i been taught a more useful kind of learning than a boardingschool produces i might still live secure under the consciousness of an unblemished reputation unaccustomed and unexperienced to earn my bread in a menial capacity i had no hopes lest but such as might proceed from his future honor and genorosity i soon found myself cruelly deceived no art or cunning was left untried to accomplish his purpose the most subtle protestations of protection and maintenance were made use of and a solemn promise of marriage to silence all my fears  oh woman woman thy name is frailty  young and credulous i swallowed the glittering bait and fell an easy victim to the unruly passion of an ungrateful wretch  but alas when he found the consequences attendant on our crime which i tremble to relate he not only refused to fulfill his promise of marriage but also abandoned me to all the pangs of recollection and the frowns of a merciless world yet villain as he was he did not turn me out of doors till he had given me money to support me in those moments of perturbation which his passion had forced me to suffer and an untimely birth at length relieved me from the anxieties of a mother though it left me under the severe pressures of infamy and the painful prospect of approaching poverty  friends and acquaintances have now forsaken me and i am reduced to the lot of those unhappy beings from whom many who melt at the sight of all other misery think it meritorious to withhold relief whom the rigor of virtuous indignation dooms to suffer without complaint and perish without regard and whom i myself have formerly insulted in the pride of reputation and security of innocence  let others who read my story be warned by my example and however specious the pretense avoid the consequences let them consider that however secure they may think themselves they will have need of all their fortitude when put to the test whatever they may think of me let them judge as favorably as possible and as it is out of their power to assist let them at least pity a wretch destined to suffer for the faults of an ungrateful monster  i am sir your humble servant maria friendless june       0 to the printer of the town and country magazine sir permit me through the channel of your magazine to lay before the public scenes of distress of no common kind though it can afford me no pleasure to recite the many sufferings of a wretched victim to misfortune yet by my errors others may be convinced that the way of virtue only is the way to felicity born to an elevated rank in life i was instructed rather to value myself on the blind acquisitions of fortune and the tinsel of external accomplishments than on the more solid and commendable qualifications of the mind my years of infancy were marked by an infant pride and the mercenary disposition of menial servants did not fail to make the evil increase with my growth  when i just entered my sixteenth year i was initated into all the economy of high life should the rustic or mercantile reader find fault with the expression economy when applicable to high life his ignorance is seen in the censure dames of spirit have their mean savings and a titled lady is as anxiously avaricious in her way as any plodding citizen whose business and pleasure unite in gain most of the estates of our nobility are heavily mortgaged or lie useless to the owner till the rent clears the encumbrances this is all that can be urged in defense of a lady of qualitys sharping upon her servant and slripping her fille de chamber of all her ready cash to answer some urgent demand upon her honor which she protests by that sacred honor shall be returned with interest in a few days but alas among quality things equally as sacred as honor are abused and trifled with if there is any real spirit in high life any generous indifference as to the affairs of this world which should constitute the sole merit of noblesse it is oftener found in a citizens wife however the court may exclaim against the city there is less mercenary meanness in the dames of ludgate hill than in a whole masquerade of right honorable dishonourables  but to return to my own story happy in the notion of the world by being born to a title and a large fortune it is not to be doubted that the coxcombs of the court were busy to ingratiate themselves in my favor by genteely letting me know they thought themselves very pretty fellows some indeed went so far as to assure me by the lard and all that that i was consumedly handsome still keeping a distant view to the dear subject self and never lending a compliment unless it might be returned to the maker these shadows of men were my continual torment being my settled perhaps prejudiced aversion  another class of lovers deserved rather my friendship or my pity than my love these were men of sense who by the malice of their fortune or their stars if you are an astrologer had never risen in life to what their ambitious ideas aspired to  as the customs of the world are by the courtesy of it allowed to be just these men imagined every girl of conspicuous accomplishments whose unexperienced heart they could deceive into love their lawful prize dangerous is that lover who has more sense than virtue his sense when perverted is the greatest evil he can possess fools are mere ciphers they are like the air when the arrow flies no traces remain to tell its way they are like the sea where every single impression is lost in multitudes of impressions though i easily defended myself against the egotisms and addresses of the coxcomb i found it no easy task to ward off the assaults of the man of sense his batteries are levelled at the heart and where he has mutual youth to plead in his favor seldom fails of carrying the day in the early bloom of life we are not ourselves and i confess had not pride been a more certain guard than virtue my fortune would have fallen into the hands of the creditors of an unfortunate but amorous author however this was an error of youth and the passion fled with my experience and the absence of the bard but my god why did it fly to make room for one which should torment me for years better had it been for me to live poor by the villainy of another than to be rich great and miserable by my own villainy but just heavens i deserve it all  i was in my nineteenth year when the personal accomplishments of a young gentleman of inferior rank and fortune to mine a mr knowles first engaged my notice i cannot say i conceived a passion instantaneously for him i was never so romantic i admired his manly figure his easy air and affable behavior in short i wished to know him which was going as far as a woman of prudence could go upon first sight i was then universally allowed to be a beauty and was unhappy enough to engage his attention if his person pleased his conversation charmed me i was now madly in love a solid judgment without the least cynical cast a florid easy manner of speech without the least affectation and a fluent tongue without any impertinence all inspired to make me so from the minute of our conversation we began an acquaintance an illfated one for me mr knowles had never spoke of his passion though his fine eyes expressed unutterable things we were often together and i did not think it an unhappy circumstance that no declaration had been made for that chilling coldness which by the custom of the world necessarily succeeds a declaration till the matrimonial act is determined must to mutual lovers be a ceremonious torment in the ensuing spring mr knowles being in the country as i was one morning playing on my harpsichord my father came hastily into the room my dear girl said he throwing his arm round my waist i am overjoyed partake of my transports and ease one part of them  i replied whatever gives my father joy must consequently be welcome to me  it is in your power answered he in your power alone to insure this happiness to me the earl of  has seen you he likes he loves you he has this day offered proposals to me and will settle more than your own fortune on you  i was thunderstruck at this intelligence i could hear no more i fainted my father was frighted he called for help and soon recovered me seeing me revive he changed his tender solicitude to rage called me an ungrateful vile disobedient wretch in having engaged my affections to another which he was sure was the case without his consent told me i should marry his lordship in three days time or turn out of his doors with nothing but what i could demand saying this he flung out of the room and left me to consult with janet my waiting woman who was privy to my prepossession in favor of mr knowles oh janet i exclaimed was ever poor creature so suddenly plunged into the depth of misery why to be sure madam returned she the matter is a little sudden but as to misery i have heard your honorable father say that happiness and misery were both in our own hands suppose madam this affair had not hapened would you ever have had mr knowles no replied i warmly no i would never have stooped below my birth why then dear madam if he is out of the question who could you have better than an earl it is true he is old but then you will have a man of quality and have all your own fortune settled on you for my part i can see no reason to hesitate weak as these reasons may appear it was such cogency of argument that urged me to consent to be countess of  doubting the stability of the resolution i hastened to put it into execution and in one fatal minute did what ages of repentance could not undo my lord was affable and kind my father transported out of himself and i was neither miserable nor happy in a kind of negative existence which for want of a better name we call the vapors a latitudinary word which meaning every thing means nothing mr knowles heard of our marriage he flew on the wings of love as i was sitting alone in my parlour amusing myself with fruitless repentance he burst in upon me and giving me an inexpressible look exclaimed oh my fanny that short sentence did more than the bitterest reproach could have done it threw me into agonies not to be described at last i gathered strength enough to speak sir since the laws of the world have have bound me to another to whom my kind regards are due they cannot now be yours this i murmured in articulations scarce to be understood i knew not what i said he started from his chair and eagerly seizing my hand exclaimed and was there ever a possibility they could be mine this reply embarrassed me greatly i was all confusion and hurry when my lord entered  nothing can paint the distraction of his features lunacy itself could not be more enraged he fiercely commanded mr knowles to walk out of the house without permitting him to speak and returned to me with the countenance of a fury madam said he could you carry on your vile intrigues no where but in my house but i will take care for the future you shall have no intrigues elsewhere saying this he left me and never afterward suffered me to stir out but with an old woman who served me in the office of a duenna  vexed at this barbarous treatment i resented it like a woman of quality and spirit i insisted on the dismission of my spy and being left to my own liberty this his lordship flatly refused madening with rage i made an immediate assignation with mr knowles exerted my authority sent back my guard and flew in my own coach to the place of appointment  when a woman has taken one false step it is too late to think of receding she is necessitated to go on jealousy is certainly the effect of love yet it is a very troublesome effect and only tends to make the possessor hated by the object he loves  my husbands behavior grew intolerable and i was determined to leave him this i did soon after with mr knowles and we retired to a neighboring kingdom happy in not being disturbed we thought his lordship sat easy under his loss when the first intelligence we had of him brought his will distracted at the fatal consequence of my resentment i flew to the house once his now mine his generosity having left me all laying the blame on the disparity of our ages my prepossession and his jealousy here had i the unhappiness to find my father dying stabbed to the heart with the news of my flight o my god what an everlasting hell of reflection must attend the guilty  frances  memoirs of a saddog to the editor of the town and country magazine sir the man who sits down to write his own history has no very agreeable task to execute the chevalier tailor is the only egotist since julius caesar who has made tolerable work in drawing the picture of himself julius had but two colors to paint with truth and classic elegance here the chevalier had the advantage for he was too great to be confined within the bounds of the first qualification and has  with a thousand materials the sentimental john buncle should not be forgotten the man who admires the mountains of the north in his description will lose all his admiration in the real prospect  but to proceed to my own affairs i am mr editor a sad dog a very sad dog have run through many sad adventures had many sad escapes from the clutches of baliffs and at the time of writing this sad relation am throned in a broken chair within an inch of a thundercloud  i set out in life with a fortune of five thousand pounds which the old prig my father left me with this memorable piece of advice item i leave to my youngest son henry five thousand pounds with an old book formerly his grandmother bridgets called the way to save wealth containing a thousand choice receipts in cookery etc and i advise that he read two pages of the said book every day before he dines very pretty advice but i had not veneration enough for the parental character to follow it  when the legacy was paid me i bid my brother adieu drank three bottles of claret with sir stentor ranger who had married my sister and drove furiously to the metropolis in my own phaeton and sour honor was the only book which i ever honored with a perusal and being pretty well dipped in the theory of gambling i ventured to engage with some knights of the post which were a little better versed in the practical part and at one sitting lost one fifth of my fortune this was a terrible stroke to me and i began for the first time in my life to reflect but a bottle of champaigne and a night at the hotel drove every troublesome idea out of my head  miss fanny h  t who by a natural transition is transmigrated from a whore into a bagniokeeper was then in the bloom of her charms she was never a firstrate beauty but always a very favorite toast among the bucks and pretty fellows of the city  i was one evening strolling the park when miss fanny had experience enough to perceive that she had nailed my attention as i was neither acquainted with her character or situation i was not a little elated with the condescending glances she honored me with presuming on my conquest i made her a few compliments squired her out of the park and thought myself blessed in being permitted to accompany her to her lodgings i had not enjoyed my teteatete five minutes before i was astonished at hearing the wellknown thunder of the voice of jack n  tt sblood and oons you old harridan she is mine for a month and i would rather lose fifty per cent than lend her for a single night to the dearest friend upon earth to this vociferous exclamation the venerable matron replied will not miss kitty do for once or polly or miss nancy i will have no miss but fanny by g  replied jack bursting into the parlour upon us i was now sufficiently in the secret and not displeased at finding my charmer no vestal jack who had paid fifty pounds for his month insisted on his right of purchase but miss fanny thinking me a better play master heroically turned him out of the parlour telling him for his comfort that he should have his month another time miss fanny pleased me so well that before i was weary of her i had sunk another thousand when in a fit of reflection i bid her adieu and left her to jack and the rest of her monthly keepers  to make a little digression i think this method of hiring for a month preferable to the wholesale bargains for life and of mutual advantage to the keeper and kept if that form will stand good in law for a man will find it all rapture and love without disgust and in a few months play the the same part over again with no decay of vigor  jack n  tt is now a principal merchant and rolls about in his coach and four to every public dinner where his appetite and solidity of judgment in the edible way does honor to the city it is notorious that he is a cuckold and by more than one method free of his company but that is no detriment to him in the scale of mercantile merit the extraordinary bustle he has made in a late political affair is very little to his advantage but it must be observed in his defense that the earl of h  lsb  h did him the greatest act of friendship mortal man could do him viz invited him to a turtlefeast and revealed to him a secret in the culinary art till then utterly unknown to all the world but his lordship and his cook some indeed pretended to say that this secret is nothing more than giving venison an additional flavor by basting it with a preparation of french cheese and rancid butter but as i would not presume to give my opinion in a matter of such importance i shall leave jack to the pleasure of the table and proceed in my relation  on this considerable decay of my fortune i began to consider seriously of my departed fathers curious advice and in consequence of this consideration resolved to set up for a fortunehunter and retrieve my affairs in the sober track of matrimony a miss l  n was the girl i had fixed upon and accordingly dressed at she raised my hopes and gratified my vanity by several significant glances and i was so certain of carrying her off in the end that i cheerfully launched out five hundred pounds in dress and equipage which had such an amazing effect that in three weeks time i had three kisses of her hand and in the fourth week she took a trip to scotland with her fathers footman this unexpected stroke created in me an absolute aversion to matrimony and a resolution not to endeavor to better myself by the hymenial knot  soon after this affair i made an acquaintance with the wife of an alderman i shall conceal his name as his patriotic behavior has rendered him respectable in the city mrs  was of an amorous complexion her husband had too much of the citizen to be like her turtle venison and popularity were the only objects of his attention out of the comptinghouse though he has never repeated three periods with propriety except when assisted by the ingenious device of placing the readymade speech in the crown of his hat yet his mercantile genius has often struck upon very lucky hits he is unrivalled in reckoning the amount of rate per cent and no stockbroker at jonathans can whisper a piece of secret intelligence with half his dexterity between you and i and the post mr editor the stopping the circulation of bad halfpence inconsiderable as the coin may appear to some has brought him in no less than seven thousand pounds and increased the trade of him and his partners amazingly  mrs  had penetration enough to find out my good qualities and you will suppose that i was not wanting in acknowledging her partiality we had frequent interviews at the house of a capital miliner in the strand and the amor for some time went swimmingly on  mrs  was under no apprehensions of my being satiated with enjoyment for generously considering i was but a younger brother i never sacrificed on the altar of the cyprean goddess without receiving a bankbill worth my acceptance but alas happiness is of short duration or to speak in the language of the highsounding ossian behold thou art happy but soon ah soon will thou be miserable thou art as easy and tranquil as the face of the greenmantled puddle but soon ah soon will thou be tumbled and tossed by misfortunes like the stream of the watermill thou art beautiful as the cathederal of canterbury but soon will thou be deformed like chinese palacepaling so the sun rising in the east gilds the borders of the black mountains and laces with his golden rays the darkbrown heath the hind leaps over the slowery lawn and the reeky bull rolls in the bubbling brook the wild boar makes ready his armor of defense the inhabitants of the rocks dance and all nature joins in the song but see riding on the wings of the wind the black clouds fly the noisy thunders roar the rapid lightnings gleam the rainy torrents pour and the dropping swain flies over the mountain swift as bickerstaff the son of song when the monster bumbailiano keeper of the dark and black cave pursued him over the hills of death and the green meadows of dark men o ossian immortal genius what an invocation could i make now but i shall leave it to the abler pen of mr duff and spin out the thread of my own adventures  mrs  having dispatched a billet to me i flew to her in her own house the knight as she thought was fixed to the table of sir tunbelly grains knight citizen and alderman who had invited him to dinner on a delicious turtle a blessing not to be neglected but oh grief of griefs the knight having forgot his favorite tobaccobox popped in upon us unexpectedly and found us too familiarly engaged instead of bursting into the rage which might have animated an italian or spaniard on the occasion he shook his head and pronouncing coolly very fine all very fine he left us and returned to sir tunbelly to finish the turtle as by his hasty throwing open the door he had exposed us to the view of two of his servants i was terribly afraid of a prosecution for crim con for though it was as fashionable then as it is now i was not very eager to lose the remainder of my fortune fashionably but the knight considering his reputation would receive a severe stroke should the affair be made public contented himself with demanding two thousand pounds for the injury i had done him as he threatened to prosecute for larger damages unless i complied i was obliged to refund more than mrs  s bounty had bestowed upon me  the old curmudgeon had heartily provoked me and i resolved though at the expense of every shilling i had to be revenged on him for this purpose i published the whole affair and the devil assisting my invention i struck upon another expedient to gratify my vengeance  the knights eldest daughter sabina whom he had by a former wife was a fine sprightly girl and wanted nothing but the bon ton to render her perfectly accomplished about eighteen a remarkable fine complexion and expressive blue eyes she was at the time of the unlucky discovery with a relation in essex as i had formerly paid a few compliments to her beauty which i had reason to say without vanity were not ill received i instantly dispatched an epistle to her the most tender my imagination could dictate it wrought the effect i designed and she returned an answer after a long farce of lying and intriguing on my part and credulity on hers i accomplished the grand end  you will guess what i mean  we lived in love and rapture about a month when her father bid her prepare to marry mr lutestring the mercer by the next week she flew to the usual place of assignation bathed in tears with a face expressive of the most violent grief  i was now almost persuaded to love her in earnest but i was a sad dog to suffer revenge and when i seriously reflect a revenge which had no foundation in reason to get the better of every nobler passion  o my dear harry exclaimed the beautiful unfortunate let us fly immediately to scotland otherwise my father inhuman man will oblige me to marry bob lutestring next week  bob lutestring my dear replied i indifferently is a substantial man and i would not have you disoblige your father on my account  and is this your advice returned the heroine assuming a dignified air be assured sir i shall follow it saying this she slung from me her ideas i suppose a little different from those she brought with her  but i had not yet accomplished my revenge steeled in impudence as i am i blush to write the rest but it shall be out i informed mr lutestring of my intimacy with his future spouse and advised him not to unite himself to a woman of such principles i made certain of receiving a challenge and a string of curses for my information but alas i knew not the city sir replied the mercer i thank you for your intelligence this day received but your advice is not worth a yard of tape you say sabina has been faulty allow it but will her father give me any thing the less for her fortune on that account on the contrary were not my notions of honor very refined i might make it a means of raising my price i slunk away astonished at this reply reflecting how various are the species and refinements of honor  i was now just on the brink of poverty i had made a considerable breach in my last five hundred and began to shudder at the contempt with which the decay of my fortune threatened me relying on his former professions of friendship i posted down to sir stentor ranger in hopes he would have assisted me i found the knight very busy with sir charles banbury in tracing the honorable pedigree of an arabian barb hey hal exclaimed the knight with a voice which would have drowned the full chorus of a foxchace what the devil brought thee here i thought thou were grown a gentleman and had forgotten us all he received me with as much kindness and civility as his rustic breeding would permit and invited me to his antiquated hall  after a noble dinner of venison when sir charles had retired on cracking the nineteenth bottle i ventured to open the business nothing can express the surprise which distended the knights ample countenance i made no very agreeable comments on his astonishment but thank heaven those comments were as groundless as the rev mr bentincks on the bible  zounds thundered the knight five thousand pounds gone already you have been a sad dog hal that i will say for thee but howsundever as thou be my nown flesh and blood do you see i will do something for thee let me see let me see do understand horseflesh  i answered that i was not very deep in the mystery but i hoped with a little of his instructions to be serviceable to him  adad thou art in the right hal nobody knows these things better than me there is my lord grosvenors filly long dick he would have it that he was got by his own horse thunder when i by the mere make of his pastern found um out to be got by sir george blunts white horse duke do know any thing of dogs can train a pointer or a hawk or such like things  this i replied i could with safety undertake  well then zay no more no more words to the matter i will do for thee thou shall have one hundred and fifty pounds a year and so gees thy hand hal a bargains a bargain i scorn to flinch from my word thou shall hait odzookers thou shall hait  in consequence of this bargain i commenced superintendant of his stables and kennels i discharged my office much to his satisfaction and by dint of application acquiring some knowledge in the mysteries of the turf i began to be of consequence in the racing world sir stentors hall was very ancient and had been in days of yore a family seat of the mowbrays it had not undergone any considerable reparation since the reformation when an ancestor of sir stentors having often had quarrels with a neighboring abbot in the sacrilegious pillage purchased his abbey for less than the onetwentieth of its value and robbing it of all its ornaments and painted glass made the abbey a stable and turned his dogs into the chapel  sir stentor had many curious visitors on account of his ancient painted glasswindows among the rest was the redoubted baron otranto who has spent his whole life in conjectures this most ingenious gentleman as a certain advertiser styles him is certainly a good judge of paintings and has an original easy manner of writing that his knowledge in antiquity equals his other accomplishments may be disputed as sir stentor had ever been politically attached to his family he welcomed the the baron with every demonstration of joy and ordered the bells of the parish church to be rung as a further testimony of his joy he sent for a blind fiddler the barthelemon of the village to entertain the baron with a solo during dinner and after the desert robin hoods ramble was melodiously chaunted by the knights groom and dairymaid to the excellent music of a twostringed violin and a bagpipe a concert by the first masters in europe could not have pleased the baron so well he imagined himself carried back to the age of his favorite hero richard the third  should any critic assert that it is impossible such an imagination could enter the cerebellum of the baron who confines all his ideas within the narrow limits of propriety for the songs of robin hood were not in being till the reign of queen elizabeth his assertion shall stand uncontradicted by me as i know by woeful experience that when an author resolves to think himself in the right it is more than human argument can do to convince him he is in the wrong  the baron after dinner asked the knight if he had ever discovered in any place about his house an escutcheon argent on a fesse gules three garbs or between as many shields sable cheveronny of the first  to this learned interrogatory the knight answered with a stare of astonishment and anon sir what do you talk of i dont understand such outlandish lingo not i for my part  otranto finding it impossible to enter into a conversation suitable to his hobbyhorse begged leave to visit the kennel desiring the knight to permit the huntsman to go with him lest the dogs might not be over civil to a stranger  odzookers cried sir stentor are you afraid of the dogs i will go with you myself man  the baron found many things worthy his notice in the ruinated chapel but the knight was so full of the praises of his harriers that the antiquary had not opportunity to form one conjecture after looking round the chapel for some moveable piece of age on which he might employ his speculative talents to the eternal honor of his judgment he pitched upon a stone which had no antiquity at all and transported with his fancied prize placed it upon his head and bore it triumphantly to his chamber desiring the knight to give him no disturbance the next day as he intended to devote it to the service of futurity  this important piece of stone had by the huntsman been sacrilegiously stolen from the neighboring churchyard and employed with others to stop up a breach in the kennel through which the adventurous jowler had squeezed his lank carcass  nothing can escape the clutches of curiosity the letters being ill cut had an appearance of something gothic and the baron was so far gone in this quixotism of literature that at the first glance he determined them to be of the third runic alphabet of wormius  the original inscription was james hicks lies here with hester his wife  the broken stone is here represented  the baron having turned over camden dugdale leyland and wever at last determined it to be hic jacet corpus kenelmae sancto legero requicseat etc etc what confirmed him in the above reading and made it impossible for him to be mistaken was that a great man of the name of sancto legero had been buried in the county about five hundred years ago  elated with the happy discovery the baron had an elegant engraving of the curiosity executed and presented it to the society of antiquaries who look upon it as one of the most important discoveries which have been made since the great dr trefoil found out that the word kine came from the saxon coice  when this miracle of literature left the village the bells were again rung and the baron was wrapped in elysium on the success of his visit  i had served sir stentor above two years when by a lucky hit sir charles banbury and myself took the whole field in and cleared above twenty thousand pounds eight thousand of which fell to my share  i was now once more established in the world and redeemed from the dependence which had mortified my pride as i was seldom ungrateful i repaid sir stentors kindness by revealing to him the whole arcana of the turf which he has improved to so much advantage that he has added five hundred per annum to his paternal estate by his successes at newmarket  in prosperity i never gave ear to the sage whispers of prudence her cool advice was never felt but in the winter of adversity i was flush and resolved to go over to paris and glitter in all the splendour of an englishman this rapid resolution was as rapidly executed and in less than ten days after my success i found myself at the city of noise and frippery  i had too much spirit to murmur at the expense but i often wished for something more substantial than soup or fricasee after living at the gigantic table of sir stentor and feasting on roast beef and venison i found it difficult to swallow liquids and shadows but every other consideration was soon drowned in that of a young marchioness who never met my eyes without telling them such a tale of love that it was impossible not to understand it  i directed my valet la fosse to make every possible enquiry after her he brought me intelligence that she was the widow of a marquis and of a very noble family this was sufficient i instantly dispatched a messenger of love to her and ere another moon had gilded up her horns married her but i had cause to repent my expedition she was indeed the widow of a marquis but one of the poorest of that title in france his debts were great and his widow instead of discharging them had contracted more her noble family not being able to support her  i was soon rouzed from my dream of happiness and thrown into prison my fortune was insufficient to procure my liberty and there i should have perished had not an old rich farmergeneral taken my wife under his protection paid her debts generously set me free and presented me with a bill of two hundred pounds on condition i returned to england i did not choose to reject his offer and with that sort of pseudorepentance which generally waits on us when we are grown wise too late took my leave of france and prosperity  immediately on my return to england i waited on sir stentor but the knight knowing my genius in horseflesh was not willing to put me in a condition of rivalling him upon the turf  zounds hal whoy thou spendest every thing no no i duont want a top gamekeeper now here i will gi thee this bill of one hundred pounds and my bay gelding jockey go and see un he is as fine a beast as any i have in hand  i thought it not prudent to refuse the knights offer and making the best of a bad bargain accepted jockey and the bill and made the best of my way to london  here after a long deliberation i resolved to turn stockjobber and the first time i visited jonathans by propagating a report that jamaica was taken by the spaniards increased my small sum to two thousand pounds i was now in raptures and saw once again the visions of good fortune swimming before my sight i still continued improving my principal when an account from trieste reduced me to seven hundred and in a few days after another account from the same unfortunate place utterly ruined me and i waddled a lame duck out of the alley  what could i now do as to mechanic business i was utterly a stranger to it and my soul disdained the livery of a slave i had distracted myself with reflection till the last bill of ten pounds was mutilated when i thought of setting up for an author  as i did not doubt my invention and had vanity enough for the character i sat down to invoke the muses the first fruits of my pen were a political essay and a piece of poetry the first i carried to a patriotic bookseller who is in his own opinion of much consequence to the cause of liberty and the poetry was left with another of the same tribe who made bold to make it a means of puffing his magazine but refused any gratuity mr britannicus at first imagining the piece was not to be paid for was lavish of his praises and i might depend upon it it should do honor to his flaming patriotic paper but when he was told that i expected some recompense he assumed an air of criticism and begged my pardon he did not know that circumstance and really he did not think it good language or sound reasoning  i was not discouraged by the objections and criticisms of the bookselling tribe and as i know the art of curlism pretty well i make a tolerable hand of it but mr printer the late prosecution against the booksellers having frightened them all out of their patriotism i am necessitated either to write for the entertainment of the public or in defense of the ministry as i have some little remains of conscience the latter is not very agreeable political writing of either side of the question is of little service to the entertainment or instruction of the reader abuse and scurrillity are generally the chief figures in the language of party i am not of the opinion of those authors who deem every man in place a rascal and every man out of place a patriot  permit this then to appear in your universally admired magazine it may give some entertainment to your reader and a dinner to  your humble servant harry wildfire  to the printer of the town and country magazine sir lest your hunter of oddities should meet with me and cook up my singularity as a dish of diversion for the town i trouble you with a description of myself have you ever seen a portait by holbein or the figure of an old fellow in ancient tapestry i am a laughable counterpart to either of these curiosities i am heir to no inconsiderable estate which has but one encumbrance on it a plaguey longlived surly dog of a father  if i am not mistaken the romancatholics make longevity one of the peculiar gifts of heaven i confess i am so irreligious as to wish heaven had been less sparing of its gifts to my honored papa you will say i am an ungracious child perhaps but when you have got to the end of my epistle you will excuse me if absurdities and follies are the general attendants of age i cannot see with what justice greyhairs command veneration  my father has as well furnished a wardrobe as any knight in the shire but not an individual garment in it which has been made since the revolution  my father dresses in the uniform of a courtier in the reign of james i his hat is like a strawberrybasket with the handle thrust under his chin this piece of ornament belonged to robert carey who as he was a great man in his time and nearly related to our family must not be out of remembrance he wears also an enormous ruff once the property of sir venison goosepye lordmayor of london who though of a younger branch of the family established it on a more respectable footing than before by doubling its rentroll gratitude obliges my sire to wear this ruff though as full of holes as a lawyers conscience a flashed doublet with slit sleeves and a long cloak envelopes his trunk and a monstrous pair of trunkhose square shoes and large shoeroses conclude his bundle of ridiculous habiliments could i persuade him to be contented with making himself laughed at i should be happy in entertaining my friends with the oddity of his appearance but when i consider that mine is equally as laughable i sicken at the sight of his antiquated garb i am almost ashamed to describe myself but in hopes that he must soon set out on his journey to the other world i make a virtue of necessity and comply he absolutely threatens to disinherit me if i grumble at dressing for the memory of the departed and an estate of sixthousand per annum is not to be lost for the sake of a fulltrimmed suit and a gold button my hair is dressed in a very peculiar and risible manner it is cut close on the middle of the head and twisted like a horses mane on each side this my papa avers was the most polite fashion in the reign of queen elizabeth as appears by the portrait of his great uncle sir henry dainty this sir henry was the greatest beau of his time and is thought by a learned antiquary to be the identical person for whom shakespeare drew the character of ostrick in hamlet my hat is not quite so comical as my sires it inclines more to the shape of a closestoolpan pardon the simile you will find it in another author it is too delicate to be my own this ornament of the head once graced the caput of the profound dr technicus who had an universal nostrum which enabled him to ride in his chair and what do you think this nostrum was nothing but a cataplasm of masticated bread and butter my ruff is perfectly yellow but as it belonged to the reverend dr drouzy my father makes it a point of conscience to oblige me to wear it i have a large jutting coat and wide breeches the very tip of the mode in the days of henry vii mottled stocking red and green and shoes with monstrous pikes complete my ornamentals  this mr printer is a perfect representation of my externals do be so obliging as to give the old fellow a hint in your magazine that he acts very ridiculously he has already felt the bad effects of his antiquated wardrobe my sister was as laughable as myself she wore a hood of unconscionable thick velvet which projected on each side of her face like a horses blinds her ruff was enormous and betwixt that and her headgear there was nothing but the tip of her nose to be seen her stays reached down to her knees her stockings were yellow and her shoes squaretoed all these ornaments had in the days of their prosperity glittered on alice sevenoke a maid of honor to queen mary who was famous for making custards and giving eelpies an excellent relish my sister biddys gown was as heavy as a modern novel upon a moderate computation it had above three pounds of silver in its embroidery the colors indeed were faded but that defect was made up in the lenghth of the train which afforded the cat a five minutes play while miss biddy was turning the corner  a female must necessarily be worse qualified to bear this purgatory than a man and she having fifteen thousand pounds which an old aunt had left her to be paid at her marriage whipped off to scotland at the age of sixteen with a young fellow in the army would i could make my escape too from the tyranny of this tailor of antiquity i am sensible no character at cornelyss could make so ridiculous an appearance as i do  oh dear mr ham if you have any bowels of compassion address a line or two to the old prig show him how barbarous it is to deprive a young fellow of all the pleasures of life to indulge an unaccountable whim push the matter home to him and if you succeed you shall ever have the prayers of  your humble servant tony selwood  to the printer of the town and country magazine number i sir i think addison says in defining a complete fine gentleman that even dress should be attended to and indeed it has so great an influence in most situations of this life that a person who is entirely negligent of it will find himself either overlooked or despised in the usual intercourse of society  there are indeed some singular characters who pique themselves upon an utter contempt for dress but to the shame of men of letters be it said that these are generally pedants or such as value themselves upon an affected absence from the trivial pursuits of this world  dick flighty is a man of a very different cast from these dress he considers as the ultimate end of existence and he would be miserable for a year if lord m  or captain g  was to have a new fashoned cut from paris before him he was the first who introduced the tambour waistcoat he rode post from that metropolis with six horses to be here in time this he considered as a very capital stroke in establishing his fashionable character and which he looked upon as indispensable when sir james g  appeared in a silver silk flowered embroidery before he had recieved intelligence of the invention his disgrace upon this occasion was inexpressible and had he not retrieved himself in the violet birds eye velvet on the ensuing birthday the consequence might have been fatal  dick is possessed of about four thousand a year which he lays out in his opinion to the best advantage he neither games nor drinks which considering the licentiousness of the age is something extraordinary but then he keeps as elegant an equipage as any man in town which he constantly uses besides this he has a fine pack of hounds though he never hunts four racehorses though he never sports and keeps three mistresses whom he never visits  to be ingenuous dick may be fairly classed as the sovereign of petit maitres the prince of fops and the representativegeneral of coxcombs nevertheless dick is an arrant sloven whilst he is driving from one end of the town to the other in search of the most celebrated embroiderer to give him directions concerning a new invented sprig his chapeau de bras which he wears on his head would be a disgrace to a hair dresser and the back of his coat is more greasy than a butchers but then this is the ton dick holds it as an invariable maxim that a clean coat and a good hat in an undress would be a disgrace to a gentleman and bring him upon a level with a bourgeois  i am sir yours a hunter of oddities st jamess coffeehouse may  0 number ii sir finding you gave place to my odd man in your last i have sent you another to hand up in the group and as i shall let you have one every month we shall by the end of the year complete our collection  dick slender is now about his fortyfifth year six feet high without any encumbrance of flesh he is one of those people who saunter about town and call themselves gentlemen because they have nothing to do and are incapable of doing any thing  dick upon the death of his father became possessed of three thousand pounds in the funds he was destined to the bar and had been brought up in the temple but finding in himself very little disposition for the statutes at large or coke upon littleton he shut up his folios and resolved to be the man of pleasure  he soon discovered however that the interest of his money at three per cent would not support him in the line of life he had chalked out and therefore sunk the capital in the purchase of an annuity and caring for neither man woman or child eats drinks and dresses up to one hundred and eighty pounds per annum  dick is always the first night at a new play in the pit and though he never read aristotle or understands a syllable of horace he is one of the greatest critics of the age he has learnt a few setphrases at the bedford these he utters promiscuously upon all such occasions and he blends them in so curious a manner that they will do for any performance of every degree of merit he nevertheless has frequently a crowd about him at the coffeehouse and his decisions indecisive as they be are considered as the opinion of the town  his success in gallantry is not less conspicuous than his judgment in criticism if a number of letters constantly addressed to him in a female hand often sealed with a coronet can authenticate his intrigues or prove that half the women of fashion in england are enamoured with him but unfortunately he lately quarrelled with his washerwoman upon the loss of some silk stockings and she has revealed a secret that has banished him from georges for these three weeks she was the amanuensis the corresponding ladies and the deliverer of all these letters to the parties who brought them to this coffeehouse and she is resolved to keep the seal with the coronet for her trouble this she has revealed to several of her customers in the temple at the same time declaring that notwithstanding the many intrigues she had carried on with dick slender and though she had often been alone with him in private he had never once offered a rude thing to her yet jenny is but two and twenty has a very wanton eye and a good complexion  to illustrate dicks character still farther he is a politician he has read all juniuss letters and can make out every dash he is a member of the bill of rights harangues at the smyrna upon the middlesex election and proposes questions at the robinhood upon the legality of incapacitation it is true that all his political reading has been confined to the public and the gazetteer but no man understands the real nature of our constitution the essence of our rights and liberties the limits of the prerogative the extent of parliamentary privileges the nature of our foreign connections or the balance of power better or more profoundly than dick slender  by intuition  a hunter of oddities  number iii sir this metropolis abounds with so many oddities that i am sometimes at a loss to hit upon one for the month i have now in my collection about three dozen that will do either for winter or summer their peculiarities are of such a nature and they are such complete originals they never can be unseasonably hung up to public view but a truce with preface or else perhaps you will think me worthy a place in my own collection  eolus is as variable in his temper as the thirtytwo points of the compass but it must be acknowledged that a coach has to him all the magnetic qualities of the lodestone especially when the wind is in his chops but why confine his character in so small a compass eolus is every body and every thing at times he eats like quin drinks with rigby intrigues with a cumb  d and fights with every man that never existed he is a buckram hero and if i might be allowed a taylors pun you may twist him to what you please it is time however to bring forth our hero and let him speak for himself  enter eolus eolus here cook  at four precisely  let the venison be done to a turn and as to the turbot let it weigh exactly three pounds not an ounce more or less   cook yes sir you may depend upon your directions being punctually followed  nobody i think hits your honors taste so well as me  i study it day and night   eolus yes jack i must acknowledge you do make me eat a pound more since you came to the house than ever i did before i shall just take a turn in a hack round the new buildings grosvenorsquare and marybone by way of a whet and be here precisely at four   so short a dialogue dear ham cannot certainly disgust your readers but perhaps they may be curious to know how many he has to dine with him just as many as a certain r  l lover found when he awoke and met with nobody but himself  eolus seems to have followed quins rule which i shall exemplify said lady t  sh  d i mean the modest lady t  sh  d to quin i wonder mr quin that you do not marry take a house and keep an equipage why lookye my lady i like the sweets of matrimony without the bitters  i always carry my wife my coach and my cook in my pocket and when they displease me jolt me into a passion or spoil my appetite i turn them off  quin was so pregnant of good things that the very mention of him engenders a number but i shall take up your readers time with the relation of only one more which he said to the same lady upon a somewhat similar occasion pray mr quin said she did you ever make love no my lady replied sir john bruce i always buy it ready made  so much for quin now once more for eolus he is about five seet nothing as round as a hogshead owing to his eating immoderately rides in a hack all the morning to create an appetite rides in the same vehicle all the afternoon to promote digestion he has seven hundred a year of which he does not save a farthing which he disposes of chiefly to hackneycoachmen and vintners the ladies however ingross some part of his purse as well as his person but he is an oeconomist in love at least with regard to property which he transfers to them very sparingly  if after this any one should think eolus the mere puff of imagination he may be seen alive every day at four not a hundred yards from warwickcourt holborn  a hunter of oddities  number iv sir lounging the other day at slaughters coffeehouse i made acquaintance with a person who has turned out a proper candidate to be enrolled in your list of oddities  he had been reading the gazetteer for about twenty minutes in the course of which he had taken as many pinches of snuff when he started all at once and giving a fling to the paper overturned a dish of scalding coffee upon a gentlemans white silk stockings crying zounds there he is again  how he stinks then rising up without paying any attention to the mischief he had done or making the least apology to the gentleman whose legs he had scalded he walked three or four times up and down the room shaking his arm and fingers crying out keep off keep off  i did not know what to conclude from his behavior but as i was the nearest to him during his exclamation and this perambulation i thought it necessary to ask him whether he proposed insulting me  to which he made no reply but muttered the devil opened my curtains last night and he has been after me all day then shaking his hand more violently than ever there you are off at last after this curious soliloquy he began to grow a little calm seated himself upon another of the benches and ordered a pint of milk he then pulled out of his pocket several old pamphlets and read them very attentively but not without ejaculating now and thee off you villain off and shaking his hand and arm very violently  i enquired at the bar who this extraordinary person was and whether he was out of his mind when i was informed that he was mr ha  w  y brother to the commissioner of that name that he had frequented the house several years and that he was a very inoffensive goodnatured man  having received this intelligence i resolved to have a little conversation with him when i found him very rational upon every subject except the devil but the slightest hint about that infernal being made him shake his hand and arm and cry out off  off  it would be doing this gentleman a great piece of service if any of your ingenious correspondents could hit upon some probable scheme of exorcising this same devil out of poor ha  w  y who would then in every respect be an agreeable and worthy member of society  a hunter of oddities slaughters coffeehouse june    to the printer of the town and country magazine sir though i have much reason to think myself qualified for society i am to my great mortification confided in a boardingschool however i am not debarred the pleasure of reading i know all the real names of your tete a tetes and am very well skilled in decyphering an asterism or dash i have perused every novel published by lowndes or noble and could upon occasion compile a secret history as pathetic and moving as any other female author there is no modern play which i have not read from the bright sallies of foot to the dull dialogue of cumberland you see i am a judge of theatrical merit my knowledge of the drama is hereditary for my cousin ben who understands heraldry can prove himself and consequently me to be descended from ben jonsons grandmothers sister so much for internal merit the young foxhunters in the neighborhood swear i am a woundy pretty maid the politer sort protest before gad i am an angel and madame gouvernante tells me i am very fair very elegant and every way accomplished you will excuse this description of myself as it is a true though trite observation that few readers regard any history till they are minutely acquainted with the author my intention in writing was to ask your advice now you must know mr ham that i have ten thousand pounds at my own disposal a qualification which may in your opinion exceed all the others i value myself upon my father who is a plodding sort of a man and upon bristol exchange or rather in the street has the character of a rich merchant who knows how to live in the world designs to marry me to bob barter the hopeful son of his good friend hezekiah barter bob is in the polite language of bristol a devil of a buck you may see him in the morning sitting under a shed on the key registering the weight of sugars and in the evening shining at a ball he overturns a basket of oysters or beats a dog with a better grace than any youthful notary of bacchus in that elegant city the cream of politeness as madame gouvernante knows my fathers intentions she very readily permits his intrusions and takes every opportunity to leave us together the wretch has never read further than the gazette or tables of interest so that it is impossible to receive a compliment worth accepting from him he seems to look upon me as already married and treats me with a suitable indifference upon the exit of the gouvernante he claps on his hat takes a turn round the room very politely exposes his backside to the fire and remarks it is very cold or something of equal importance i never regard the wretch but if i am reading consider myself as alone and read on pray mr hamilton is such a contemptible being to be treated with more respect having told you i do not like this uncivilized bristolian you may imagine a tendresse for some other has made his faults more conspicuous you will not be far from the truth a young author who has read more than magliabechi and wrote more love letters than ovid is continually invoking the nine to describe me but he never pays a compliment to my person without a concomitant one to my understanding though i have ten thousand pounds he never mentions marriage and when it is forced into his discourse rails at it most religiously but he intrigues like a jesuit to be made happy with a tete a tete conversation or a walk in the wood but thank my stars i have always courageously denied he has sentiment in his common conversation and is reported to have ruined three young ladies of fortune pray mr hamilton what am i to do in this case nothing can be more disagreeable than this boardingschool if i am obliged to marry that insignificant wretch bob barter will the forced ceremony oblige me to hate my literary lover your advice will oblige  yours etc astrea brokage bristol jan      0 a song addressed to miss c  am of bristol as spring now approaches with all his gay train and scatters his beauties around the green plain come then my dear charmer all scruples remove accept of my passion allow me to love without the soft transports which love must inspire without the sweet torment of fear and desire our thoughts and ideas are never refined and nothing but winter can reign in the mind but love is the blossom the spring of the soul the frosts of our judgments may check not control in spite of each hindrance the spring will return and nature with transports refining will burn this passion celestial by heaven was designed the only fixed means of improving the mind when it beams on the senses they quickly display how great and prolific how pleasing the ray then come my dear charmer since love is a flame which polishes nature and angels your frame permit the soft passion to rise in your breast i leave your good nature to grant me the rest shall the beautiful flowerets all blossom around shall floras gay mantle enamel the ground shall the red blushing blossom be seen on the tree without the least pleasure or rapture for me and yet if my charmer should frown when i sing ah what are the beauties the glories of spring the flowers will be faded all happiness fly and clouds veil the azure of every bright sky c london may      0 to the printer of the town and country magazine sir i was some time since in company with a party who piqued themselves upon being men of wit and genius one of them however was nothing more than a pretender who after many ineffectual attempts at length set the table on a roar by a most execrable pun he joined in the laugh and fancied he had now been very successful when a gentleman turning to lord ch  d asked his lordship what was his opinion of punning in general to which his lordship replied i conceive punning has a doublefold advantage in company for a very good pun makes one laugh and a very bad one makes one laugh still more as was the case just now but said he an indifferent pun is the most indifferent of all indifferent things having neither salt enough to make one smile or stupidity enough to excite the risible muscles at the author and may therefore be styled the dregs of wit the sediment of humor and the caput mortuum of common sense  i am sir your constant reader and humble servant t b berkleysquare june       0 the unfortunate fathers mr sladon a merchant of bristol by industry and diligent application to business acquired a considerable fortune as he was an enemy to noise and pomp he neither set up his carriage nor endeavored to make a splended appearance his only care centered in maria his beautiful daughter he spared no costs to complete her education her genius requited his labor no instructions were lost on her and she excelled in every qualification which dignify her sex at the age of seventeen she was universally allowed to be a beauty the reader will excuse the writer from giving a description of her person let him cull from the volumes of poets and painters all his imagination counts beautiful and throw into it an inexpressible softness and he has maria  mr hinckley whose father was closely connected in trade with mr sladon struck with the uncommon luster of marias person and mind entreated his father to permit him to pay his addresses to her george said the priest of mammon i commend your choice miss sladon is a very good oeconomist and will have little less than a plumb to her fortune go and prosper young hinckley assured his father he had not the least mercenary view away replied the old man when you have been as often upon change as me you will know better  young hinckley had no cause to complain of his reception maria had never viewed him with eyes of indifference mr sladon rejoiced at the proposed alliance all was unity and love and before the expiration of two months george acquainted his father that he intended to request mr sladon to fix the day but was thunderstruck with his command that he should not go such lengths till he had further orders from him  mr sladon who was himself above deceit never suspected it in another his generous frankness laid him open to the vile arts of old hinckley after being connected together the space of a year he broke and ruined him  maria had by this time conceived the most tender passion for young hinckley it was allowable as she had always considered him as her future husband no words can describe hinckleys excess of love imagine what an effect this stroke must have upon both nothing but imagination can paint it  mr sladon was only affected for his daughter his noble soul rose superior to this revolution he triumphed in poverty over the wealthy wretch who caused his misfortunes old hinckley whose fortune was increased not dimished by this infamous action perceived with chagrin his sons madness for maria he endeavored to divert his attention to objects more rich and therefore in his opinion more deserving but he labored in vain nothing could abate his love mr sladon saw his passion he pitied him but could not think of uniting his daughter to a man whose superiority of circumstances was derived from his own ruin  old hinckley finding all remonstrances useless by some mercenary agents persuaded mr sladon that young hinckley was privy to and assisting in his ruin the circumstances made it plausible he believed it and forbade him his house maria would have credited it of any other man in this case it was dubious her love for him was partial but as she had looked upon the father formerly in the best light she doubted whether she might not be deceived in the son she was in this wavering opinion when the only servant mr sladon had brought her a letter from young hinckley she knew the hand she eagerly caught it she recollected and dropped it on the ground after a long struggle between duty and love she sent it back unopened when a person of good sense and strong natural parts has not the happiness of a religious education he is generally a deist or socinian this was the case with young hinckley his father endeavoring to qualify him for commerce neglected christianity to the most refined notions of honor and morality he united an absolute contempt for religion his passions were violent but as he was continually on his guard they seldom appeared when he heard that maria had returned his letter he raved to the utmost extravagance of madness then appearing calm he sat down and writing a letter sealed it and left it on the table having done this he went into his chamber and immediately shot himself  old hinckley hearing the explosion ran from his compter and ascending the stairs saw his son extended breathless he fainted and continued in that condition till his servants occasionally coming in recovered him  the letter which was directed to his father contained what follows  i shall not accuse your conduct for you are my father i shall only endeavor to vindicate the action i am about to perpetrate this will be easily done there is a principle in man a shadow of the divinity which constitutes him the image of god you may call it conscience grace inspiration the spirit or whatever name your education gives it if a man acts according to this regulator he is right if contrary to it he is wrong it is an approved truth that this principle varies in every rational being as i can reconcile suicide to this principle with me it is consequently no crime suicide is sometimes a noble insanity of the soul and often the result of a mature and deliberate approbation of the soul if ever a crime it is only so to society there indeed it always appears an irrational emotion but when our being becomes dissocial when we neither asist or are assisted by society we do not injure it by laying down our load of life it may seem a paradoxical assertion that we cannot do wrong to ourselves but it is certain we have power over our own existence such is my opinion and i have made use of such power  george hincley   this seeming philosophy was lost on old hinckley he was really affected with the loss of his son and did not survive him three months  maria the beauteous maria had a still shorter date she heard the fatal news and expired within a week  mr sladon loved his daughter too well to live without her he completed the tragedy and sunk to the grave resigned and contented amidst the chastisements of providence  elegy to the memory of mr thomas chatterton late of bristol how shall my pen make known the sad event how tell the loss
