the history of tom fool  more know tom fool than tom fool knows  vol ii  london printed for t waller opposite fetterlane fleet street  m dcc lx  the history of tom fool chap i the report of young fools marriage spread like a new fashion curiosity brought several of the neighboring gentry to stare at the wretch lady greensy had thrown herself away upon  sir martin fullmatt very wisely observed as he and his family were traveling to pay the wedding visit that there was something very dark in this match but matrimony though it may make the husband dimsighted always opens the wifes eyes therefore lady ferd declared she could see the scheme as plain as noonday but must beg to be excused from saying any more yet  it was time enough  let the longest liver take broom field  sir martin right my dear leave it to time  that is my way and i may say without vanity in all the affairs of consequence that have been on the carpet for    years i never once have been mistaken  i have always left them to time   lady i wish sir martin you would not put one in mind of time so  you know it vapors me and therefore choose to do it  lord if greensys husband should dare    sir martin how madam am i   lady patience dear sir martin i am not going to make any comparisons as to the fright she has married he must be some odd mortal a strange animal to be sure but her ladyship altered her opinion before she had been half an hour in mr fools company the moment he went out of the room she addressed his lady with  by my soul bella i dote upon your choice let me dye my dear creature if i dont honor your taste the young gentleman is immensely agreeable and it must be vastly odd indeed if you arnt vastly happy   lady fool indeed lady ferd i have no reason to complain  as to the censures of the word    lady ferd well now that is vastly high indeed what have people of fashion to do with the world the vulgar part of it i mean women of quality are not to be called to account for what they do so they have nothing to answer for  young fullmatt sir martins eldest swore he would not give a foxs brush for all that the world said of him one way or the other but yet if he sat in the house as his father did he would muzzle the mobs mouths though  they shoudnt babble about what their betters did  he wished he was whipperin toum that is all   sir martin child the observations made by inferiors are extrajudicial and politically    lady ferd dear sir martin for heavens sake no politics nor no parties   miss dear meem that is true i kent bear any party but one at kedrill and i beg we may have a pool will not that agreeable creater your spouse my lady make one with us   lady fool mr fool ladies never plays at cards   lady ferd my god  how do you do to kill time then when you dont see company i am sure sir martin and i should be the two dullest creatures existing if it waant for cards  for he is so apt to doze after dinner and i detest reading   young fullmatt i hope my lady with your leave to have the honor of introducing mr fool to our sporting club   lady fool i am obliged to you sir but i have heard him say he is not fond of horseracing indeed i believe his chiefest diversion is books   young fullmatt books books a diversion i am sure i didnt think them so while i was at um they are well enough indeed for parsons or those that deal in um but for a man of fashion to read  bar that throw however  let his chaplain what has he got else to do  but for gentlemen to throw away their time upon such nonsense  i would as soon go of my own messages  now here is a dog my lady better than ever a library in europe   miss lord now shall we be stunned with a fox chase i suppose   young fullmatt that is as good as a fools chase i suppose  my sisters never easy without she has half a score couple of beaux yelping about her  lady fool to prevent any farther altercation had the cardtables brought in immediately upon which all the good company came to order   chap ii past four oclock and a moonlight morning the company broke up and with the readers leave as indeed it is but goodmanners well see sir fullmatts family safe home  sir martin as he hobbled into the hall began by certain shooting symptoms to expect a severe attack in both feet therefore ordered his bed to be warmed immediately upon which his lady could not help observing she thought it was vastly odd that ever since sir martins gout had made them lie in separate apartments he was always hurrying to bed but i insist sir martin before you do go you shall let me know your opinion of greensys choice for my part though i detest scandal i wonder what some women are made of to brazen it out as she does well for effrontery she indeed does exceed any thing i ever saw  as to her husband as she calls him  my god  i am sick of wedlock  the fellow is really personal enough  but her telling us he was a gentleman  i shall never love gentility again  sir martin it is to me a matter of much wonder   lady ferd nay my dear why should you wonder at what some of our sex will do  why now you saw fine miss relt today  she is with child by the butler   miss now that to me is amazing if a lady did fall her pride should not  methinks her own spirit would hinder her from sinking if i did intrigue it should be with somebody of family however  that is what i blame my brother for to take up with such a coarse creature as our housemaid bett is  i wonder how he can touch her filthy flesh   young fullmatt was nettled to be reproached for his indelicacy of taste and replied to his sister rather too tartly she returned it the parents joined in the dispute and the quarrel might have been attended with bad consequences had not the delinquent mrs betty been called for and as soon as she entered my lady ordered her out of doors vowing she would not sleep under the same roof with a strumpet  the rest of the family then prepared for bed all but young fullmatt he was resolved to keep betty company in the hall porch till daylight  after he had every way endeavored to pacify the maid swearing the loss of her place should be no loss to her  the girl interrupted him sobbing  that is not it squire thank god i dont fear to get my living but to be called whore so  i dursnt say any thing before your father or else it was at my tongues end when madam called me strumpet so and spit in my face i could have told her ay and miss too if i am one i aant the only one in the family no that i aant for all she is your sister  young fullmatts curiosity was raised he pressed the girl very seriously to explain herself and whether it was owing to revenge or remorse or friendship every operation of female dispositions has not yet been mathematically ascertained but she led him like guy fox with a dark lanthorn in his hand into that part of the house which was thought by most of the family to be haunted there lay his mama along with the gardener and as fast asleep in an adjoining room the bedcloaths all tossed off outspread was miss fullmatt and his honors postillion  for some moments the esquire stood astound he rubbed his eyes looked on his sister stared at the maid then treading softly on tiptoe he took away his mothers sisters and their gallants apparel but left his own coat in the lads room then fastening all the other outlets he placed a light at the top of an entry leading down into the hall from their chambers and stood under the windows calling out fire fire  this alarmed the lovers  they started out of bed scrambled for their clothes seized the first things that came to hand  and helterskelter slipshod they came tumbling into the hall together  young fullmatt stood there in the dark like a decoy bird but when by their voices he found himself sure of his prey he called bett to bring candles  the first figure the light discovered was miss fullmatt with a horses hood on the postillion in her brothers laced frock lady ferd with the gardeners apron about her shoulders the gardener wrapped in a silk petticoat the esquire in a livery jacket and betty in her ladyships negligee  how they stard at the maid  or how young fullmatt looked at them is now impossible to describe for just as their portraits were going to be colored while shame sorrow and sundry other passions alternate flushed in their faces a footman whom the noise of fire had waked and who to save his linen always lay in buff bolted naked upon them  such a sight sent the women shrieking away the esquire turned the fellow to bed again bid bett see the ladies safe to their own rooms and went up stairs to quiet the baronet who lay roaring and swearing in a fit of the gout he should be burned in his bed  next morning the gardener and lad were discharged and the maid who but the night before was not suffered to sleep in the house took place of all her fellow servants by the title of my ladys woman  when sir martin heard of this he could not account for it  but as my lady permitted him to know only as much as she thought proper of domestic occurrences he satisfied himself with remarking  that there are sudden changes in private families as well as kingdoms beyond the ken of keenest politicians  chap iii among the many welldressd visitants mr fool on the account of his marriage had the honor of being gentleman usher to one lady as he offered her his hand with a sigh tenderly looking at him in a plaintive tone whispered what mr fool have you forgot me tom blushed bowed his heart beat quick with downcast look he replied no madam nor ever shall i and trembling he led her into the parlour  the reader may suppose this lady to be miss fash it was indeed  the late miss fash she had given her hand to the right honorable lord pillow  for lady dowager  but to preserve the unity of our drama we must beg leave to return to the  history of patchwork  in the conclusion of the chapter of ghosts mr israel wrapped up in the roquelaure barefooted limpd to his lodgings miss mask took post chaise that evening for london esquire singleten went to the christophers to drink away his misfortunes and junior and matilda saunterd to her sisters  batilda and her dutch merchant in three or four days set out for london and miss demirep with them unloverd such an universal dissipation then reigned at bath that a lady of her figure elegance wit and strong sensations was neglected for the more fascinating exercise of the e o table  junior and matilda who grew remarkably intimate staid at bath and esquire singleten with them this lastmentioned gentleman made strong professions of friendship to junior and behind his back was as eager in his protestations of love to matilda nay the esquire proffered to make her a very handsome settlement this she told junior who advised her by all means to accept of the conditions for as he observed constancy was no moneygetting virtue pleasure she might keep always in waiting  but  00 l a year was not an every day visitor as he spoke like a man of sense and one who knew the world and the best way to live in it she was ruled by him therefore with her consent he borrowed for his own use  00 pieces of the esquire then like a man of honor put the lady into the lenders hands as a security  with that sum junior intending to strike a bold stroke set up an equipage and as it was taste then to be waited on by foreign servants he hired a swiss or frenchman its all the fame in the greek for his valet junior called him a swiss indeed as england was then at war with france he would not be thought so antiantigallican as to cherish an enemy differently thought his servant he knew himself to be a subject and slave of the grand monarch that it was his duty to make reprisals upon his kings enemies taking the advantage of his masters coming home late one evening and very much in liquor he plundered him of all his cash watch ring etc and with the dexterity common to that nation eluded his pursuers this misfortune threw junior into prison where he met with tom fool as related in the first part as reference being had thereto will more fully appear  chap iv by the help of his faithful amy he gained his liberty but ingratefully contracted an acquaintance with a dutch jewess who formerly had been a celebrated woman of the town but of late years hawkd trinkets about at coffeehouses with this hebrew lady he sat forwards for turnbridge but as at the first baitingplace he met with a person it much behoved him to acknowledge we beg leave to journalize the particulars  one of the guests being rather too prolix in saying grace after dinner was questioned by another of the company  if he didnt think the meat would digest as well without so much ceremony hoot hoot ye tawk blosphomy mon  replied the preacher and snatching down his hat stroaked his hair up behind his ears and muttering some words to himself hurried out of the room  a gentlewoman in a vellumholed habit formerly new observed after taking a large pinch of snuff that there ought to be a distinction made between the sinful and the needful but as this is the lady we have given the reader the trouble to halt for whoever thou art o patient peruser of this performance  behold her picture as she sat to junior and which we beg all facepainters to take notice of both pen and pencil men  her countenance had not lost all its original brightness for her forehead and nose were abundantly enriched with purplecolourd pimples the lillies of her neck were sallowd by the immoderate use of snufftaking and the roses of her cheeks cracked crimsoned and peeled by the fiery exhalations of juniper her teeth like the remaining pillars at persepolis stood irregularly and seemed decaying the alabaster hue was sably sullied as if in mourning for their departed neighbors she wore by way of tete a bob wig once brown but by long use was tanned into a dingy red from underneath which some straggling gray hairs hung down her temples like icicles in dirty thatch  after recovering her hand from her snuff box she very emphatically insisted that whatever is is right because it was to be for predestination as she observed was one of the cardinal virtues  landlady indeed madam and so i have often told my husband it was to be for women are sometimes drove to do such things they can no more account for than why our beer is fine sometimes and sometimes muddy   doctors spouse in our sex madam there is an agitation of the senses which compels us to commit some things for which indeed we were preordaind   innkeeper but madam suppose i find a man in bed with my wife is that ordained too i have heard marriages were made in heaven but i dont believe whore and rogue were   doctors spouse the crime sir should never be laid at the ladys door for as mat prior says   if women chance to go astray  their stars are more in fault than they  the landlady clapped her hands together and cried out  so they are to be sure madam  ant please the lord i will drink the gentlemans health that said so pray maam waant he a bishop  a bishop  no he was too good for one of that sort  their spirituous court will punish a poor girl when a rogue gets her with child though as you say madam she was ordained to it  mr pattern the rider thrusting the points of the fork he had employed as a picktooth into the table observed that there was so much about bishops and religion nowadays the nations sick on it  doctor but if they would take my antiperpendicular catoptric syphilicon elixir it would bring great britain right again   pattern the nation was never so near being undone as now nor becoming a province to france neither  english liberty yes faith fine english liberty indeed here they have put down masquerades without having an act of parliament for it and here is a new tax upon cards and they talk of dogs paying duty to i have a couple of pointers and a leash of greyhounds that always in the season go my rounds with me now let me see any body make me pay excise for um that is all  any single man  dammee if it was jack broughton if i woudnt  a sudden outcry prevented him from finishing his harangue he sat with mouth open and eyes fixed and aghast the crowing of a cock will terrify a lion   junior run up the stairs to the place from whence the noise issued and the women followed him  the doctor rider and landlord kept their seats  the innkeeper indeed once said he would go up to take care of his wife  but the other two observing he was hanged who left his liquor behind him the motion was overruled  junior on bursting open the chamber door discovered the cookmaid bareheaded her dishevelled locks bristling about her ears in one hand she grasped a pewter chamber pot and in the other waved a piece of linen which seemed to be part of a shirt sleeve under the bed lay the longwindedgracesayer like a large turtle his hands and head only to be seen  the landlady sharply enquired into this confusion the girl with much blubbering declared it was all upon account of that scotch dog for that as how upon her honor he would have ravished her had not junior took the delinquents part they would have pulled the poor pedlar to pieces  but they were at last prevailed on to retire which they did along with the cookwench to hear every minute circumstance of the intended rape  after mr macdugle was enough recovered to return mr junior thanks thus he delivered himself as i have a sol tull be saved ise tall ye the hale truth gued sir sawton got possession of me this afternoon for ye ken uncowell sir how he gangs aboot like a roaring lion and i stud in his wa don na ye remamber how that wacked loon like tyke tawked blosphomy aboot prayer and grace oh it is aw oer wi us when grace gangs oot on us weel weel sir i gangd my gate and and speerd my prayerbuke than as beelzabub wood ha it this katchen whore stepped intull my room to clap her cap on her head  sawton as i tald ye before was are strong in me  and mad me hold a parle wi her  woe worth the time though yet ken me right it was no art nor part of mine ane twas aw the deels doing himsel he gangd intull me as he yance did intull the weeporkers when the swene were sank in the sea as the gospull talls us than sir i gi her a braw silk hankercher sike like this to ha my wull on her and the watch wud na let me lig her down she gat my gueds and wud na gi me a bawbee for um and as i tuke a hantle oher hair in my fist she seized my sark wi yae hond and wi tither clitter clatterd over my head wi the mamber mugg as if she war the deels drummer  on that instant the tarnishd jacket lady entered and reproached the north britain with indelicacy for attempting to force the wench for sir turning to junior women are not to be ravished we are free agents and compulsion is incompatible with our passions we may be won for as the duke of marlborough who was a relation of mine used to say if a town is open at top it may be taken  so may our sex we are open  we are to be taken but sir i should be pleased if you would retire with me from this scene of confusion for as i hear your name is junior there is something in that name which alarms my soul they withdrew and after interchanging a few questions she discovered herself to be the identical lady senior secreted among the gypsies  if junior was pleased at finding his parent the lady was no less rejoiced at meeting her son the whole house was rejoiced and the evening concluded with that exquisite essential to english happiness a general drinking rout  chap v next day after junior had informed his mother of the material incidents he had been engaged in she in return began her story as follows  to have you torn from my arms to be brought up as a gipsy shocked me so essentially i resolved to quit the horrid crew i found an assylum at an elderly gentlemans a bachelor his name was sear he had made a great figure formerly in the beau monde and had enjoyed as he often told me himself all the fine women of his age for he was a vast wit and it was not then as it is now impossible for a man to be a wit and a fine gentleman together he had been a perfect hero in his time he kept the very best company spent two great estates and was the terror of all the london watchmen his courage and generosity were immense and such a spirit  my god  why he would make nothing of betting  00 l at a horserace but such is the fate of all sublunary beings he who used to keep three or four coaches and six had now only a footwalk to keep him for when i began my connection with him he was only an exciseman but like desdemona i loved him for the dangers he had passed  i was indeed younger than i am now but i had not acquired that ease of figure i at present enjoy yet it seems the infancy of my bloom made an impression on his heart in this cohabitation i existed about half a year and by way of amusement i instructed an elderly ladys footboy in whom i discovered a vast genius to write and read  mr sear my spouse having notice that his friend and patron the collector would be down in a day or two informed me of it i was therefore more than ordinary assiduous about my appearance when i knew so great a man as the collector was to wait upon us for modern examples as well as ancient history had informed me a handsome wife was a husbands sheetanchor therefore for my spouses sake i practiced all my attractions but i had been given up beforehand  for the lad whom i observed to you i took under instructions disclosed a horrid plot to me it seems my present incumbent had agreed to part with me provided the collector liked me this proviso shocked me i was determined to disappoint them  was i not born free and should i be traffickd for nay left to a wretchs option no  had this gentleman or any other gentleman in a polite way made himself master of my honor either by surprising me from a mornings dream or stealing on me in an evenings solitude it was to be forgiven but to be offered like dead game as a gift nay to have the chance of a negative  no   pinch  0th perish me if my soul disdained not the motion  i left him  the lad and i took places in the wagon for london on my arrival there i applied for employment among the booksellers and really picked up a very pretty living by writing things against the government not child that i was disaffected  far from it  but we must eat  and any thing on the other side didnt sell so well  the young man whom i brought to london my adonis as i used to call him soon died of a gallopping consumption the foul fogs of london were too heavy for the delicacy of his frame i was inconsolable nay should certainly have followed him had not my landlady introduced a jew gentleman to my acquaintance he took lodgings for me at hachney and though i was under infinite obligation to him yet perish me  pinch  0th if i could ever aggregate my ideas to any complacency for him i was conscious he was an infidel nor junior could i ever have believed that any existence sprung from my womb would so grossly have debased the dignity of his specie as you have done by your cohesion with this jew woman  for me i would sooner go to bed to a christian supperless than be kept by the richest wretch in england that did not believe in the new testament  i soon retreated from such an irreligious acquaintance  a gentleman belonging to the law had lodgings in the same house we were in he was a great freethinker and talked to me concerning the eternity of matter of the souls materiality and divisibility and why reason and religion were incompatible i was fascinated with his discourse for his tongue dropped manna with him i came to london for he was a counselor and solicitor in sessions time at justice hall and while he followed the court i began to compile a treatise on the absurdity of faith without demonstration but my ideas not being sufficiently arranged the counselor my spouse brought me all the best authors such as masseys travels woolston against miracles christianity as old as the creation the infallibility of human judgment the oracles of reason and several more of the famous champions of the rational side of the question by their help i tickled up as pretty a piece of metaphysics as ever laid ax to the root of priestcraft but before it was published some enemies of my husbands pretending he had forged a seamans will and powers had him taken up and we wanting money at that time to do things as we should do in respect of evidence contrary to the laws of what should be right and wrong he suffered  but i will leave you to guess my dear son how much i was amazed when i came to comfort him the evening after he was cast to see the new testament in his hand  he  even he who had made so great a jest of revealed religion in his prosperity  i was frighted to hear him call out for mercy wringing his hands and crying what would become of him in the next world when he used by mathematical investigations formerly to prove to me the impossibility of there being one  after his decease the ordinary took me as his housekeeper i then suppressed my treatise of materialism and put forth a dissertation on the condition of stillborn infants in a future state and dedicated it to the hutchinsonians a romish gentleman who used sometimes to visit the prisoners under sentence came often to our house we had several logical disputes he fell in love with me and promised me to turn protestant if i would go with him  to save a soul i did so we went to york together where money being scarce he was obliged to leave england for trying to make more he left me big of my third child when i was up having had so much experience i practiced midwifery for my genius was always extensive but still i sighed for london conscious such a person as i had and such abilities should not be buried in the country therefore ireturnd to town and resumed my pen but the system of writing was altered  the town from politicians were turned electrifiers i soon made myself mistress of every atmospherical experiment in consequence of which i set about a system wherein i formed a process of extracting from the aetherial fluid an efficient quantity of pure inflamable rays of heat which when collected into concave speculums of different diameters placed at right angles would form a focus strong enough to destroy any enemys fleet in harbor  and i presented this project to the sunfire office for their inspection  i was prevented from putting my design in execution by the owners of saltpetre and gunpowder makers  they setting forth in their case that as they had with great cost and pains and solely for the good of their country prepared combustibles enough to destroy the whole world or any part thereof at a weeks warning therefore they remonstrated that if lightning was once brought into common use all their vast stocks of readymade destruction would lie dead upon their hands to the great loss of themselves and families  then i began a compendium of natural philosophy wherein i proved beyond contradiction that there never were such things as mermaids i showed demonstratively that vesuvius and mount hecla could have no communication i proved that the indian way of rubbing two sticks together to make fire was an antediluvian invention then i wrote a history of the fly called a blue bottle and a dissertation proving the antiquity of our marrowbones and cleaver music that they came from the pyrrhic dances of the greeks striking their spears and shields together and in a supplement i confuted mr swammerdam showing that the grubs in lapland are no ways related to the gnats in lincolnshire fens  this work which would have made six vol in folio i intended to have published with several copper plates but the graving coming dear i laid it by and resolved against any more being concerned in writings of consequence so just to kill time i abridged the works of the learned  my printers youngest prentice who used to bring me the proof of sheets had acted in several private plays and would often repeat speeches to me now you must know child i have a strong theatrical genius but not so much for acting as for writing plays  not but i believe if the managers and i could have agreed i should have exhibited in about half a score of cibbers or woffingtons or pritchards parts  but there happened at this time to be a dearth of dramatic writers therefore i undertook to manure and fertilize the theaters  dont imagine me vain child i was qualified for this undertaking i had read over aristotle and all the french critiques and would have suffered martyrdom sooner than wrote any thing in violation of the unities i am conscious shakespeares writings are crept into some estimation yet you see no dramatic writer now chooses to copy him  his flights are bold but very irregular to be sure indeed considering the time he lived in and his being unacquainted with the classics some of his pieces are pretty enough  but rude though  his clowns for instance  they are absolutely incongruous to the politesse of the french drama for it must be granted that every thing which is quite comic must be quite low therefore not fit for the delicacy of the boxes  so i turned the merry wives of windsor into a tragedy  got a great mans letter and it was put into rehearsal  the first thing i had then to do was to insert proper paragraphs in the papers for advertisements are as necessary to prepare the town as physic is before inoculation puffing for a thing is as essential as the thing itself  i have in my time puffed three or four players into very good salaries  i scorn to calumniate  but what did i ever get in return  not this pinch of strasbourg perish me  no matter  gratitude is not a concomitant characteristic in theatric breasts  her majestys death shutting up the houses my tragedy was postpond  but hold i am premature in my story i was mentioning about our printers prentice rehearsing several parts of plays with me one day by a fatality the greatest metaphysician never could account for as we were performing the couch scene of loveless and berinthia i granted him the last favor somewhat hung over me impelling me as it were and made such actions unavoidable his youth and eagerness made me forgive him his obedience and assiduity made me dote on him  as soon as he was out of his time we were lawfully married till unluckily taking lodgings for the air in moorfeilds he became acquainted with some of the tabernacle preachers there they thundered so much in his head about sin and such stuff i was forced to put him among the incurables i then found a friend in the gentleman with whom i am at present he is a physician  it is true indeed he travels  what then it is his humanity only that wakes him keep a stage people in every town press him to settle with them but as i and my husband tell them if he was confined to one spot what must become of the rest of england for country doctors and apothecaries are so ignorant  my god and yet to see the force of genius the doctor took it all himself he was not bred up to it his father is only a ticket porter  what then the parent of socrates made barbers blocks  chap vi the next day junior and his lady prepared to set forward but as mrs slymstraat was putting up her things she discovered the doctors wife and the merry andrew in a too familiar conversation  when junior heard of this he took his mother aside to expostulate with her but she interrupted him saying  child there is an essential distinction between voluntary sin and the necessity of acting as for what happened between me and robin it was no more than an accident of matter i was lost in reflection it was not criminal in me i was merely passive therefore not culpable because not intentionally guilty but as for that infidel to reproach me with want of taste me  no junior i love you as much as a mother ought but never see my face again unless you part from that unbeliever then instantly bridling herself up she stalked out of the room with the straddle toss and importance of an haymarket signiora after finishing a da capo  junior appeared at tunbridge to be quite the thing he dressed gay drank deeply played high swore elegantly and sung drolly he was master of arts in sentimentmaking had all odds ad unguem as for the pedigree of a plate horse he was a critical genealogist  he took care to make much parade of his honor therefore was thought to be one of very strict principle  for it was his maxim that according to the first impression which you make upon the company through that medium you will be afterward looked at  among the many personages who exhibited themselves at the wells that season there was a person who by his address seemed to be a gentleman he was allowed to be a very sensible man by an observation or two which he made at a picture sale the day he came down  he was allowed to be very rich too  yet so great an oddity he never went to the gaming table rarely to the tavern and then not a word of politics slipped from him  he seemed very fond of reading which made the very polite company there fancy he had cracked his brain by study  the inquisitive club had been very busy in enquiring after him  a club where scandal  but why should spleen fall from a poets pen  no it is proper some people should meddle with other peoples business it is the duty we owe our country a duty we owe our neighbors a duty we own ourselves to be assiduous in our questions not only concerning persons we dont know but more especially to examine into every report that is propagated of intrigue or malepractices in our friends and those we do know  junior whose scheme was to make all the acquaintance he could among moneyed men judged this gentleman well worth knowing and soon made the strangers temper his study  for like alcibiades jack could be any thing with any man  but what is tom fool doing all this while why must the history of a sharper  a dull copy of count fathom be retaild upon the reader is it judgment to suffer the principal character in this epic to be idle so long and let an episode in bulk exceed the grand history when tom fool was in goal nothing could be expected from him but now he is married every thing is expected  by various people thus has the editor been questioned all his reply was  patience  mr fool like other newmarried gentlemen is waiting in his white gloves master of the ceremonies at the ladies levee  well therefore let him alone until the visiting week is over and attend upon mr saltern that is the strange gentlemans name and junior who were thus conversing together  junior i have met with many disappointments sir   saltern disappointments are as incidental as colds and most persons are equally ready to prescribe for both  be judge sir how i have been disappointed   when i was a youth by the flattery of my tutors and dependants i was made to believe my own understanding superior to the rest of mankind therefore was resolved to spare no costs or pains till i had acquired that high and mighty selfsufficient title a man of universal knowledge  after i had pleased myself with reflecting on my plan as maidens do of matrimony i began to put it in execution having the good of my country at heart i intended to get a seat in parliament therefore immediately applied myself to the study of eloquence but tully in his treatise upon rhetoric doubting whether oratory was more an advantage or detriment to the state i became irresolute  nay soon relinquished it despairing to excel in what cicero was found fault with both by brutus and quintilian  yet bent to pursue the good of my country i attended borough jobbing but a change in the ministry forcing me to have all my work to do over again i grew tired of so precarious an employment went once more to my books and immersed myself in ancient philosophy  what a parcel of absurdities did i there meet with every fellow at that time of day with an overheated imagination or possessed of inveterate rancour set up for a systemmaker there required not much capital to begin with they opened their opinions and the world at once became their customers for although there is not any thing to be conceived more ridiculous than what the sectarists of all ages have in their turns asserted yet such is the weakness wilfulness and vanity of human kind they are sure to find followers believers and defenders  like a town lady on her first country visit i soon grew tired of my company shifted my quarters into the planetary system and found the study of astronomy very much to my satisfaction i lectured upon the orrery explained attraction settled the comets routs accounted for the winds and tides pervaded through the milky way assigned causes a priori and boldly and technically answered for all the motions of the universe  i grew very fond of the discoveries i made nightly in the moon for having steveliuss map of that planet by that and from what he had wrote upon it could by the help of my glasses see very plainly upon her surface rivers rocks towns trees and churches but afterward reading hugenius he contradicted all the moonland discoveries nay proves it is not possible for us to discover any objects on her disk i confess after weighing his arguments all my former pretty prospects vanished  i could not find one picture on the moons face i had formerly fancied there  away went my telescopes  then i became eager to study history but by their own accounts ancient authors are not much to be depended upon and moderns too often misled by the rage of party religious prejudices or partialities to their own country determined no more to depend on what others had said but resolved to search into the nature of things myself i erected a laboratory i was at first fond of galen  till meeting with the work of paracelsus  left off my first master  but i as soon grew sick of the second when i found even this paracelsus who ridicules galen so much and who promised himself vast riches and longevity from his rare secrets die insolvent between forty and fifty from him i turned to van helmont but reading his process upon the four porters  i threw all my chemical volumes into the furnace gave the whole furniture of my laboratory to the workhouse and turned my speculations to physic that i did not attend long disgusted at not being able to account for animal secretion  in vain i read and it was as much in vain for me to enquire they told me indeed that the stomach like the loadstone was possessed of occult qualities that i granted but was determined not to pursue a study where we could not come to a demonstration of its first and grand principle  to dissipate the chagreen which the insufficiency of these pursuits had occasioned i undertook music when i heard the compositions of the great masters they transported me i no longer wondered at the extravagant effects poets ascribed to the power of sounds i immediately became consort hunter  studied compositions and could relish no companions but those who understood the nature of unisons but was very much surpised to find that most musical performers looked with disdain on the professors of every art and science but their own yet except in their own they are the most incurious and unentertaining of any other artists nay even in the very branch they excel you must tire yourself with requesting before they will exhibit but when once they begin they know not how to stop but are as palling by doing too much as they were disgustful before by not doing any thing i bid adieu to the gamut least it should lead me into the same infatuation  my next attempt was extremely amusing  i studied painting and sculpture but was shocked at the unfriendly treatment several men of meritgave their contemporaries  i had like to have tumbled over head and ears into the tide of taste and become picturefancier auctionhunter and connoisseur but as i had studied without traveling my opinions were not of equal weight with those who had traveled without studying  the better to judge of sculpture and some parts of painting i found it necessary to apply myself to anatomy and as that in some measure is connected with both natural and experimental philosophy i soon gave myself up entirely to the investigations of nature i dragged the ditches for embryos committed burglary upon the habitations of halfformd insects stripped trees of their moss examined puffballs and searched for the heads of snake stones  i have seen sir the circulation of blood in a frogs toes spiders leg and a shrimps tail i have counted the number of blue animals a sloe has upon its surface and knew accurately what penfeathers there were in a butterflys wing  many curious observations have i made upon duckweed and dunghillwater and the several animalcula in each  i have impaled gnats upon pins to try how long they could live without eating have pressed woodlice and silkworms to death to discover their seminal animalcula and destroyed many colonies of ants to be certain whether they did or did not bite off the ends of the corn i have attended the microscopical dissections of bugs to resolve that grand debate among the learned whether they were or were not hermaphrodites i have also opened batts to authenticate what genius they should be classd under birds or beasts  junior do you think sir these studies benefit the understanding   saltern yes sir  just as much as making your fences in the chinese manner would improve your estate  yet so far is prejudice prevailing that were we to deride such pursuits all the minute philosophers would be alarmed and our treatment would be as severe as if at madrid we should reason against saintworshiping  i own i have been astonished at beholding millions of beings smaller than the smallest grain of sand skimming upon the water sailing along the air and circulating in our finest fluids i asked myself seriously what these could be for  that for was my gordian knot  i determined to find out a man of sense to whom i could communicate my doubts and by comparing our opinions we might come to know why and for what end these things were so  i related my design to the only surviving relation i have a prodigious humourist  when he had heard me out  he shook his head methinks i see him now and replied  oh nephew nephew before you endeavor to account for the deitys actions regulate your own dont begin the study of wisdom at the wrong end like some of our folks of fashion who are sent abroad before they see their own country  receive things as they are use them as they should be employ your talents in praiseworthy exercises but throw not away your time in vain speculations like the thirsty lunatic who when he arrived at a river instead of quenching his thirst lost himself in looking for the springhead  i made him a bow thanked him for his advice promised him to consider of it but left the room and my promise behind me  like a lover who requests his friends opinion though he is already determined  i set out upon my travels immediately to search for a man of sense  i knew nature not partial to birth therefore fancied understanding like beauty might be found among the meanest and began my enquiry among the shepherds and laborers  but found them as reasonless as the cattle they tended they possessed a low cunning which answered all their ends   junior poets indeed amuse us sir with fine stories about pastorial simplicity  innocence might go to market in arcadia but in englands country towns vice and folly are as well received as in any parish within the bills of mortality except that of playing at cards on a sunday though these country people jump run ring wrestle and play at football on the eve of the same day   saltern then i visited their masters  but i was still at fault  market day meetings rubbed off a little of their rusticities yet they were not thoroughly humanizd  one day every week they were drunk once in seven years mad and every year at law from them i took a turn to the country squires but they are only farmers with fine clothes on   all the distinction i could make between them was the man of  00 l per ann could kill game and they who paid him his rent were persecuted if they kept a gun in the house  i then paid my respects to the country gentlemen could i have been satisfied among the last i might have hung up my shield  but i wanted something more  like a nice lady of my acquaintance who resolved never to marry till she could meet a man without a fault lived single till    and then run away with her brothers humpbackd postillion  in the winter i came up to london and took lodgings in pall mall and as my search had hitherto been confined to my own sex i resolved now to dedicate some time to the ladies since i found myself in the neighborhood of so many beautiful assemblages scarcely had i formed a proper acquaintance among them before it almost determined me to give over my pursuit after a man of sense and fix on one of the many amiable women i had conversed with as a partner for life  but i was too irresolute  i saw too many and what was worse saw them too often i was weaned from my thoughts when i beheld the most elegant figures and the finest understandings sacrificed to the irregularities of fashion i began to think my uncle right and could not help confessing that although women and wisdom are the worthiest objects of our admirations yet too much speculation is ever attended with infelicity  i paid my attendance to the men in power but as the ladies gave up their merits to the mode  jealousy jaundicd the fair face of the great mens perfections  i removed into the city and directed my inquest among the men of business here i met many praiseworthy acquaintance the most of those i conversed with i found to be sensible knowing and sociable  yet few very few valued themselves upon what they were really excellent in or could be quiet while they were happy some i say who after accumulating large estates by incredible industry or as incredible good fortune were infected by the epidemic of taste and commenced connoisseurs others far gone in a fondness for quality either to be allied or even acquainted with nobility would lavish all their former gettings a third sort who had from among dangers hardships and hazards gathered a happy independance stung by the venom of party would squander it all to purchase a seat in parliament although there they never spoke nor were ever properly spoke to  resolving not to give over my search i associated with the men of repartee but their inattention to social duties shocked me they are such enthusiasts in rallery that like ben the sailor they must have their joke thof the ship was sinking friends as well as foes are sure to suffer if they come within the way of their wit like the drunken prizefighter who cut and slashed every one round him to show people how finely he could flourish  still resolute in my inquiry i determined to follow nature though she was eathed in a nightcellar i was introduced among the choice spirits as they call themselves  their spirits were choice indeed  they live the life of those insects who are bred brought to maturity and die within    hours for all that these singsong story telling mimic existences pretend to is but to eat drink and divert for the day necessity their ruling passion a tavern teat their summum bonum  yet among these sometimes you meet with the glimmerings of merit though soddend by the dregs of debauch  but it often thus happens that even real genius shall so far debase itself as to prostitute the bounties of nature like supperless streetwalkers to a set of people whose only qualifications are they can pay the reckoning  after laughing at these and the rest of mankind i began to look back on my past adventures by way of recrimination but i was not then so much pleased as i expected to be i found i had been a bubble to my own selfsufficiency that i had set out to seek an impossibility  expecting to meet with a man who should exceed me in understanding and yet as i was to be judge my own vanity would always prevent me from giving a true verdict upon reflection i found i had only taken man in the gross that they had all a sufficiency of understanding to answer the purposes they were intended for that i was not half the man of sense i imagined myself to be and that from a superficial knowledge of the world i had despised several persons who had a greater right to hold me in contempt  tomorrow mr junior i set out for an estate i have in south wales and if you are disengaged and will waste a month with me a hearty welcome shall supply the place of much ceremony in wales sir you will meet with persons i dare say worth your acquaintance for although they are not as much patronized as the people of neighboring principalities and their mountains indeed produce not peruvian treasure yet the hardy inhabitants inherit virtues that would lend a luster to the best birthday dress at the most brilliant court in christendom  junior accepted the invitation proposing to himself many opportunities for private play which he knew how to make beneficial but on the second afternoon of their traveling mr salterns horse threw him which obliged them to lay by for a day or two  chap vii junior after seeing his friend blooded and put to bed retired and according to the modern custom of solo travelers ordered a room and bid the drawer send in his master and a bottle of claret  as soon as they made their appearance junior ordering the landlord to be seated inquired if that gentlewoman in the bar was the innkeepers spouse who replied in the affirmative  junior she is a very fine woman landlord will not she take a glass with us   landlord i hope sir you will excuse her at present she is very busy but she shall wait upon you at supper sir   junior i insist then she shall pledge us where she is  waiter carry a bottle of claret with my compliments to your mistress   landlord i humbly thank your honor but why should she put your honor to so much charge though to be sure if she does love any liquor better than another it is claret if your honor had been bred and born with her as the song says you could not have pleased her better   junior how long have you been married landlord   landlord four years come lammas sir   junior a man must be vastly happy with such a wife   landlord happy sir i dont believe there is never a gentleman in a hundred miles lives happier with his wife than i do sir i give her her way in every thing only just in laying out a little money  we are apt to squabble about that now and then  but its soon over  i get out of the way for when once she begins scolding there is no stopping her  there will be words in all families sir so i let her tattle and i go and buy her some nicknack and that sweetens her and she is as pleasant as a cool tankard   junior she looks to be very fit for a barkeeper   landlord ay sir though i say it there would not be a better barkeeper in the world if she would but give her mind to it and so i tell her sometimes for when our house is full of company she will gallop ye twenty miles after a hare or a new fashion then we have a few words indeed or else we live as happily as the day is long   junior she seems to be a very handy woman   landlord i cannot say as to that sir she is very well in every thing else to be sure but as to stirring about her business she hates it she will jigg it after a fiddle for four and twenty hours together but tired to death if she puts out her hand only to fold up a table cloth   junior she looks to be very goodhumored   landlord her tempers a little uneven now and then that is all she is to blame for the servants seldom do any thing to please her nor i neither but there is nobody without their faults she would not have one in the world if she didnt sulk it so but she will sometimes go about the house for a week together taking the rust as the jockies say and then i say bett how can you bear ill will so long that is sure to bring her to her tongue for she hates to be called bett so then she begins to rate me  but i hark to cover faith lock myself into the cydercellar and there am snugg as an eathed fox and so sir my service to you   junior i fancy she is a very agreeable companion   landlord yes sir she can talk indeed and does talk to  only she is apt to talk a little too much and then she let us her tongue run about her own towns folks so  but this happens only when she gets a glass too much and yet i love to see her in company she never baulks her glass it is pity she lets it get the better of her so   junior i am afraid then that bottle will be too much for her   landlord no sir begging your honors pardon she has not such a weak head as that comes to neither if she would but be goodnatured when she is elevated but the devil on it is  a sudden uproar in the street stopped the conversation junior lifting up the sash saw a parish beadle driving before him a poor ragged figure with a child swathed to her back the fellow rudely thrusting his fist against the infant as he pushed the mother along the cries of the child hurried junior into the street and he enquired why the poor creature was used so   she is a vagrant replied the officer and she wanted to die in our bounds and she is a cheat and fainted away just now on purpose to leave her bastard upon us  perhaps replied junior she fainted through want indeed i did sir the poor sufferer replied very feebly and turning her head toward junior as she spoke he observed something of elegance in her face though it was pale her eye brows were regularly arched her eyes black and inexpressibly languishing he could not also help taking notice of the evenness and fine polish of her teeth and between the dishevelled partings of her hair he saw a neck of a most extraordinary whiteness  junior though not strictly a man of honor now and then had touches of those subordinate virtues generosity and compassion  he therefore determined to relieve her sent off the beadle and went with her himself to a motherly womans house called goody wen to whom he was recommended by the neighbors  the report of this piece of humanity reached the inn before juniors return mr saltern congratulated him upon it and on the conquest he had made for continued he i am certain by the manner in which my landlady related it to me she is fond of you women are more forward to admire or reward actions of generosity than our sex she is of a very sanguine complexion and you see what a wretch she has for a husband for want of something better to do i made her maid tell me her whole history  she was bred up in that old hall we were admiring when my horse threw me the housekeepers daughter but at seventeen having added one to the posterity of adam without asking leave legally for it she was discharged our landlord was butler he married her and the squire bought this house for them she is now but twentyfour and if i am not extravagant in my guesses junior she is your own she has been so full of your praises it must be so  at least i beg you will try if it be only to satisfy me how far i am right as to reading of womankind  when junior came down he found in the fore parlor his landlady with several towns folks  as he entered she rose up smiling and in a pretty lisping manner addressed him with  dear sir well to be sure you will go to heaven i wish all gentlemen were like you  lord sir to have so much charity upon such a forlorn creature  to be sure sir you are one of the best gentlemen that ever lived and yet to see some folks  that gentleman came to know the truth of it for you was told waant you doctor that the beggar woman was the gentlemans wife and how he had left her and plundered her of all she had and so she lighted on him by chance and so he gave her some gold for hushmoney  mr opifer replied he had heard so but the story was not properly digested for as the animal spirits are more heated in the secretory vessels of some people than of others they see things in different or adverse mediums now sir turning to junior i am always neutral in my judgment until i have analytically considered the ingredients of every report for it is an established postulalum with me and not only with me but with most of the great men of antiquity never to believe any thing till we can be assured of its credibility as hypocrates observes in his fortyninth aphorism  another of the company whose inkhorn dangling from his buttonhole denoted his profession rapping his knuckles hard against the table called out  now god forgive my sins if i didnt hear that this gentleman begging his pardon  but that the woman did pick his pockets to be sure  yes indeed of his watch and so he did seize her coming to town  mr illicit the attorney declared he had the case stated three or four different ways to him and with submission he could not tell what to decree in it  to be sure charity was not against the statutes but then to give away such a sum a five guineas merely out of compassion he must demur to that it was contrary to all law or equity but however sir your health  i have been in london myself and have had all the fine girls there ha landlord you have heard me say so before and they have all their ups and downs and so i rest my plea upon that  the gentleman has seen her before or else he looks to be a gentleman of too much sense to throw away such a sum as five guineas to encourage beggars notwithstanding so many laws to the contrary  as when all ermind and embossed glittering with foil stones and spun glass in sultana state the high salary actress is seated in the green room should some inferior allowanced lady dare to thwart her high mightiness with even a hint about equality of merit sudden her imperialness would arise and darting the scowltheatric at the pattinwearing rival majestically more out of the room like didos ghost silent and sullen  thus junior gave the lawyer the look contemptuous and desiring the landlady to bring him a bowl of rack up stairs ordered the waiter to show him into his own room  after he had slappd to the door the company sat staring at one another like a parcel of imperfect actors at last the landlady declared she was sure and sorry that the gentleman was so affronted and how do we know but he may be some nobleman in disguise of some great man perhaps belonging to the government  as sure as saint winifred and so he is replied the squire of the squareroot and one of our marys relations  mr illicit with a sneer enquired if marys relations were all great people  yes by gods blessing and good grace they are all so ay and have all coats of arms too as well as my family  unluckily the lawyer interrupted him by observing that some people pretended to coats of arms yet wanted arms to their coats flesh and blood could not bear this he flung his fist full upon mr illicits face the astonished lawyer started up like a cock that is chained and darting his arms out strait by way of keeping off blows he entangled his fingers in mr aprices hair aprice rushing forward drove mr illicit into a corner and there the excisemans head like a battering ram butted and rebutted against the lawyers chin the welchman springing upon his toes at every stroke mr illicits teeth gnashd lamentably and the hinder part of his skull striking against the wainscot sounded dismal  the apothecary mounted himself by a chairs help on a table at the other end of the room with two candles in his hands to see and show them fair play  the landlord stole away to call the excisemans wife and the landlady stood shrieking clasping her arms round a large china bowl she had snatched up  in the corner where the heat of battle roared happened to be a vessel which for delicacysake is named a lookingglass whether the combatants overset the vessel or the vessel overthrew them is yet undetermined certain it is they were all three rolling on the floor together but aprice soon got astride mr illicit forcibly his blows fell upon the lawyer when mrs aprice entering came suddenly behind her husband seized his arms and obtained in an instant a cessation of fists  the doctor who had all this while manfully maintained his post as candlebearer to the combatants now descended and proffered his service to mr illicit chirurgically  but the lawyer swore he would not join issue with any of um  but he would have revenge  he would let them see what it was to strike a sworn attorney for all his eyes were closed at present he was obliged to be led home wet bruised and blinded the landlady went out to obey mr juniors order and the gentleman of vulgar fractions remained master of the field of battle  the distributer of medicines then began to observe how wrongheaded mr illicit was in not suffering his bruises to be dressed hinting somewhat about inflammations tumefyd flesh fissures fevers and phlebotomy  now it was said that mr opifer and madam aprice had been naught together but that the doctor was inconstant having hopes to meet with a more agreeable patient in the landlady this mrs aprice had great suspicion of she had long time kept herself to herself but now was resolved to give vent to her indignation  her husband had from what sometimes his neighbors said great jealousies about his wife and mr opifer and he also was then determined to have it out the wifes blood was up the husbands blood was up and after some altercation they set mr opifers blood up  he hit madam in the teeth with some particulars which no man could be supposed to have known but her husband  she flew at him  he fled from her she seized the knots of his tie wig he left it in her hands as a bird escapes with the loss of his tailfeathers and run out of the room the husband and wife after him they overtook him in the entry the exciseman began to beat him unmercifully  mrs aprice seconded every blow of her husbands by hitting the wig in the doctors face who all the while was crying out murder murder for gods sake the ostler rescued him and he run home like a true tragedy ghost bareheaded with shirt bloody and mealy face  mr aprice and his mary went home arm in arm she comforting herself that though his best neckcloth was tore thank god her husband had behaved himself like a gentleman  chap viii now was tranquillity reinstated below stairs and the mistress of the house ascended to mr junior with a bowl of rack and began her apology for the peoples having made such an obstropulous noise  though for that matter i am glad sir mr illicit met his deserts for affronting such a good tempered gentleman as you are though to be sure our exciseman did thrash him vexatiously and yet i could not help being frightened sir  ones house being disturbed so and then to see them all bloody and my best china bowl had like to have been broke  and if i had not shrieked out sir and caught hold of it sir my best bowl would have tumbled all to smash sir  thus glib glided her speech she lispd she laughed her face was flushed her eyes glissend sure symptoms that she had been too busy with her best china bowl  junior observed it and resolved to try how far his friend was right he put the glass quick about he squeezed her hand he praised her face he kissed her lips he pressed her neck he sighed he strove  she begged he would be easy  she must go down  nay she vowed she would  that moment  what could such a fine gentleman see in her  nay sir  pray dont pull me  excuse  dear  what with a stranger too  if  sir  indeed  i will  there is the curtain rod down  o lord  the door  well  nay  sir  pray oh oh  dies  act ii next morning junior went to visit the person he had so lately relieved if in her wretchedness he discovered she was handsome now neatly habited he could not help loudly affirming upon oath she was the most striking figure he ever saw  fixing her eyes upon the floor and fetching a deep sigh she replied alas sir forgive my abruptness but if you will condescend to hear my story   junior bowed and seating himself by her thus she began  i hope sir you will excuse me if for the present i dont mention my name but few years are past since i was counted the toast and great heiress of the county my father represented in parliament as you know sir it is impossible for a young woman of fashion to complete her education but under a french governess i had one who soon gained me to think her the most polite friendly and sensible creature living she made me despise my own country and setting all those who came to pay their addresses to me in a contemptible light and every time she stood by me at my dressingtable lamented that such beauty as i was possessed of should be made a sacrifice to some rude coarse english savage  i sighed for france began to fancy myself choked with the foggy air of england for as mademoiselle told me if i was at paris it would be a very easy thing for me to make a conquest of one of the princes of the blood you must be certain my english lovers did not meet with much encouragement nay i disbanded them all but one whose name was soil he would take no denial he had the greatest estate in our neighborhood and the relations on each side desired it to be a match therefore they contrived it so that sometimes i was forced to suffer myself of sit with him but you would have smiled to have seen our tete a tete parties whenever he offered to speak i met his eyes with a full stare  he stammerd and blushed like a schoolboy  then i used to burst into a loud laugh and he would hang down his head turn round his dogs collar putting the buttend of his whip into his mouth as an infant does its coral played the lash of it against his boots at the same time i was pinching my apron or twirling my watch key  one day indeed he ventured so far to open his mind as to invite me to see him ride a sweepstakes  my reply was i detested horseracing  he looked as simple as a shepherd  i told him if i was ever again to be punished with his company i desired he would not bring any of his brother brutes with him  not but i assured him pointing to his greyhound i thought the dog a much more sensible animal than his master  he started up looked round the room as if he had lost something clapped his cap on smackd his whip whistled his dog out bounced the door after him and got on horsback cursing himself if he ever opened after me again  however resolving not to be thrown out as he said by a puss he determined to demand me in form and of myself too but preparing himself with rather too many bumpers to deliver so important a question he made his attack upon my woman in so boisterous a manner that i was forced to leave my dressing room to rescue her this story i related in all the places i visited with several embellishments placing him in so ridiculous a light that he was forced to leave the country vowing revenge against me  but that i thought so trifling to take notice of  my heart was set upon france and i soon persuaded my mama to spend the following winter with me in paris  one day when every thing was got ready for the intended tour mr recorders daughter a young lady about my age came to tell me what a wonder was come to town  a fine gentleman she said an outlandish one his servants had feathers in their hats and himself was all over gold lace  the mention of a foreigner alarmed me my heart beat impatient to make so important a conquest the very day of his arrival was our subscription assembly he danced with me  and i learned from his own mouth he was a french nobleman  how inimitable i thought was every thing he did so odd so out of the way so polite so easy all the young ladies were charmed with him as much as i was but i had the satisfaction of triumphing over them all for it was to me alone he paid his addresses he praised my figure my dancing my understanding i could have heard him for ever but when he waited on me home judge sir what such a giddyheaded girl as i must feel to see him kneel at my feet and hear him name the dames of the first quality and beauty in france and swear i was in point of person superior to them all  when he took his leave all in rapture i made my governess sit with me for two hours talking about him  while she  begged me not to be too credulous  nor fix my affections on a stranger it is true she said he had the air of nobility yet he might be a sharper for all that and begged i would not give him the least encouragement till she had enquired into the truth of what he was  i was charmed with this fresh assurance of what i thought the most sincere friendship but i replied her care was needless i was certain by his address he must be a man of fashion  that did not signify she answered several young ladies had been ruined by fortunehunters and it was her duty to take care of me and she would go that day and be convinced  when returned from her enquiry she congratulated me on the conquest i had made for she knew my lords gentleman in paris and he assured her his master was violently in love with me  that afternoon my lord drank tea with me i shall not trouble you with our courtship indeed there was not much but prompted by my governess i agreed to go off with him which in four days from our first acquaintance i did  i had a pretty considerable fortune independent when we arrived at london that i drew out of the bank put into my husbands hands and the next day set forward for france  you may easily guess sir the catastrophe of this amor  he plundered and left me informing me by a letter that he was sent down by mr soil on purpose to make his addresses to me and that after i had received his visits soil would come down and expose me by discovering my gallant that i had preferred to be only a waiter at whites  but this fellow who was really a frenchman was too cunning for us both and went off with my governess with whom i have since discovered he had concerted the plan when she went to enquire after him  that instant the beadle opening the door interrupted her narration saying that his worship muster chief constable must speak with them both this minute junior desiring the lady not to be uneasy went with the beadle but called of mr saltern by the way to inform him of the headboroughs message  mr saltern who happened to know the magistrate and his family begged junior to pay a particular regard to the chief constables sister  she was always present at all examinations and took vast state upon her  junior promised him he would and instantly went toward his worships yet he could not help wondering what the magistrate wanted with him  the reader perhaps may have the same curiosity  we will satisfy him  but it must be in the next chapter  chap ix mr illicits bruises not suffering him to sleep he lay ruminating how this beating might be made profitable he felt himself very sore and would have smartmoney  but in the midst of his pains he had the pleasure of thinking aprices wife and five children should come to the parish  but how to get money by all this  he recollected the fight began about a strange gentleman  therefore he decreed the strange gentleman was the aggressor ay and the strange gentleman should pay costs because if the strange gentleman had not been there the quarrel would not have happened  but how to prove damages  the woman junior relieved came into his head something may be made of that the thought pleased him he forgot his aches got up put on his banyan and without staying for his breakfast went to his brotherinlaws his worship aforementioned  mr oatley the magistrate had been a london chairman and plied at st jamess but marrying a publicans widow who kept a nightcellar they left off business being well to pass and came down into the country to settle near his brotherinlaws and being as he declared brought up at court which he took care to let every body know when he first came down in the country though not what character he acted was looked upon among his neighbors as a very extraordinary sort of a man and invited to a great many rich peoples houses for he could tell all about st jamess and the royal family knew to an hour how old my lord duke was to the tenth of an inch how high my lady janes shoes were what colored silk the dutchesss chair was lined with when such a countess cut her nails what snuff the prince used and how the kings shoemaker took measure of his majesty  mr oatly had not heard of the fray and was surprised to see his brothers eyes black his face swelled and lip with a patch on it  he began to wonder at such a sight and observed such things were never suffered at court  mr illicit look ye brother these things shall appear at court in a court of law too i had like to have been murdered by that rascal aprice and two or three more of them but i will do for that excise fellow i warrant him  but that aant all here are two sharpers come to town they put up at the crown one of um pretends to keep his bed by a fall and the other has picked up a mistress and there is some scheme in it   mr oatley like enough like enough i have met with such things at court very often   illicit now you must know brother i would have you send for this fellow and examine him and the woman too for he gave her five guineas yesterday and this is a case requires explaining   oatley nay this is extraordinary for when i was at court we used to observe where money was given there was always some mystery  therefore the chief dispatched his beadle for junior immediately  just as the messenger went out madam illicit entered and the moment she saw her brother and husband she points to her spouses face crying out here is a pretty figure for you  this is keeping company with strumpets  yes brother my husband is now always at the crown with that brazenface landlady and so i suppose some of her bullies beat him  the husband called for silence the brother called for silence but neither his worships authority nor the authority of mr illicit were equal in power to her voice she stamped she roared she scolded  they stood staring motionless as if unawares they had glanced on medusas head till her breath voice and spirits being exhausted she sunk like an expiring heroine mute into a chair  just then the beadle introduced junior saying that gentleman is his worship sir with one eye   junior sir i received a message to come before you but should be glad to know what right you have to send for me or any other gentleman as suspicious persons   madam illicit yes sir my brother has a right he is a magistrate   mr chief pray give me leave sister  hem  hem  sir  i have had the honor of belonging to court many years therefore do you see i know right and wrong sir   junior by all means sir but give me leave sir first to plead my excuse in not paying a proper respect to that lady who i am certain i have had the pleasure of seeing at st jamess for there is an air inseparable to true quality which country ladies may endeavor to imitate but never can come up to  madam illicit bridling up her head gave him a slow low curtesy winked upon her brother turned up her nose at her husband and with contracted mouth lispd out she was sorry her brother should send for so polite a gentleman so mellopropo  to be sure the town air was to be observed with half an eye both in ladies and gentlemen except it was by some people who had a look at mr illicit no taste and could prefer lowlift innkeepers wives to persons who had sucked in the court air with their milk  mr illicit who sat chewing the cud of resentment told his brother  you know you have a right of examination i say and insist on it that not only this person be asked to give an account of himself but    junior pray sir in which of the statutes    illicit pray what do you know of the statutes ha   mr chief hold brother as you say i have a right of examination why do you pretend to examine any body before me   illicit brother this is out of your way   mr chief what is out of my way ha you are a very pretty fellow indeed to say examination is out of my way ask my character at court    illict you dont understand me brother   mr chief i hope sir i have as much understanding as you and have kept better company  a note just then came from mr saltern directed to the chief constable the contents were as follows  mr oatley i would have you be extremely cautious concerning your proceeding against the gentleman at present before you  he is traveling in cog and is one of the lords of the bedchamber to his present majesty  i will bail him for twentythousand pounds  yours saltern   mrs illicit was leaning over the back of his worships chair to read the note when mr oatley rising hasty his head met her forehead it whiskd her round and down she sunk this the chief never minded but kept bowing and complimenting junior desiring him to take the armed chair  the attorney stard like a man just gorged with a large bumper  his brother turning about told him he was sorry to say it but he was a very impertinent fellow  for all youre my brother  and i hope my lord  you are a very impudent dog sirrah  i ask ten thousand pardons my lord  mr illicits spouse who had by this time recovered her senses from the blow and was rising up to reak her revenge  but hearing the word lord mentioned  she smoothed her cap  shook her petticoats  and sideling round simpering she asked his lordships pardon for her husbands illmannerdness and hoped his honor would accept of mr illicits asking his honors pardon  junior who grew tired of the farce insisted on no more mention to be made of it and took his leave the chief magistrate and madam the chief magistrates sister ushering him to the door with bows curtsies apologies prayers and praises  the attorney walking backwards and forwards all the time almost frantic like an outlawed smuggler just taken  there let them rest while we attend the more interesting scenes of this miscellany  chap x the head and the heart are distinct organs a writer therefore in his address to each should vary his manner and matter but as the editor acknowledges himself but indifferently provided with head he begs leave to continue this history in the same style it began and hopes the reader will accept of an unbellishd relation of what befell the lady after juniors departure  for some moments she sat silent her hands crossed upon her knees lost in thought  a loud wrap at the door roused her in burst a shoal of ladies ruralbred  no apology  for in the country familiarity is the grammar of good manners  they had all the morning flirted from house to house and snowball like gathered as they went forwards  all agog to hear what the two gentlemen were who the woman was and who fathered the child  after they had collected the whole troop of femaleinquisitors it was nem con agreed to pay goody wen a visit and ask her new lodger several questions they entered crowding giggling staring and curtsying all speaking together  i hope no london accomplished lady will be offended at my supposition that the female folks of country hamlets may be a little in taste  i have heard it asserted how true it is i know not but that in some country towns there are broad starers loud talkers scandal spreaders deep intriguers keen gamesters husband haters religion scoffers etc etc etc etc  indeed ye true townbred toasts as ye have not a patent for your several high qualifications  why should you wholly possess them  ye do not  they have found their way into the country as well as flouncd petticoats  just as they had addressed the strange lady junior returned and put an end to the scrutinizing party they looked a little silly or so begged pardon made several short curtsies like may day milkmaids huddled to the door each striving to be first out as if the house was on fire and tittering whispering pushing pinching and shrieking run into the street like schoolboys in breakingup time leaving the lady to continue her relation uninterrupted  continuation of the ladys story  at a place called chantilly was i left without a second necessary and but a single guinea in the whole world i acquainted the landlady with my misfortunes she endeavored to comfort me and the next morning came to let me know that there was an english gentleman who desired to be introduced to me  how did i rejoice to hear there was any of my own country there i who had so lately despised every person in it so true it is what in prosperity we most slight in adversity we first fly to for succor  as soon as i had sufficiently recovered myself the gentleman waited upon me offered me his sword his fortune to make me easy  let me know he was a man of fashion and begged leave he might have the honor of conducting me to england or where else i thought fit  there was something i thought so noble in his manner i accepted of his offers and he attended me to dover from thence i wrote to an elderly lady an aunt the only friend i could depend upon  for she had in her youth suffered for her fondness for your sex and was therefore most likely to pity my indiscretion  being obliged to wait for an answer the gentleman who came over with me begged leave to visit me while i staid there  i could not refuse him his behavior was most respectful his conversation very engaging his actions so disinterested and his expressions so very tender i esteemed him  ah when once a lady thinks highly of any of any of your sex it is the gallants fault if he does not receive the last proof of it  this sir was my case  out of gratitude i confessed to him he was not indifferent to me but he wanted immediately rudely to avail himself by that acknowledgment  thus mankind behave generally to eager or too insensible seldom knowing how to make a proper use of our concessions what i intended as a present to his disinterestedness he wanted to command by an act of power  he was deceived  he lost me by the scheme that he laid to possess me  i escaped  refused to see him and the next day he arrested me for money laid out for my use an answer to the letter which i had sent arrived that very day and seasonably relieved me unexpectedly for my creditor i paid his demands and set off without seeing him for my relations  lady veltry was one of those very good ladies who dedicate most part of their time to the making up and administering medicines to the poor and i had not any better amusement than like a pupil at the hospitals to attend upon her  this i soon grew fatigued with  then i used to weary myself with sauntering backwards and forwards under a long elmwalk rookery visiters we had none and as to books all that her ladyship would allow in her library treated upon drugs and diseases and the several symptoms of each distemper yet even these for want of employment i began to read over but the effects they had on me were terrible not a disease they mentioned but what i soon fancied i was attacked with  the first volume i turned over was a treatise upon cancers and the very next day i happened to have a pain in my breast which alarmed me a discourse upon consumptions cured me of my concer but then i dreaded an ulcer upon my lungs those prognostics were removed by an account of the gravel which made me expect a fit of the stone a volume of dropsical cases fell next into my hands they dissolved the stone indeed but fixed me in a very watery state  but a book concerning the eyes restored me to health though it gave me great reasons to fear a gutta serena  i was obliged to leave off reading for fear of its being prejudicial to my sight and just then lady veltrys only son arrived from italy as soon as i saw him i felt an uneasiness i could not account for at first i only imagined it to be a compassion for his youth  he had a delicacy of figure that i am certain would prejudice any of my sex that saw him in his favor i often pitied him in secret to think what dangers from the debaucheries of london a gentleman of his rank fortune and spirits was exposed to  but i soon was alarmed at my own condition involuntary sighs sudden flushings palpitations of the heart unaccountable anxiety and tremors days wasted without breaking my fast and nights without sleep the symptoms frightened me i flew to my physic books but could not find my case in any one author  a self examination proved i was in love i thought i had been so with that french impostor but found now that was only price i had never before suffered those tender sensations those uproars i then every day experienced i delighted in the discovery and indulged my distemper consulted my glass and was assured by that oracle i should succeed but i lost my time i despised both him and myself him for his insensibility me for my want of power  a few days after his arrival as we were sitting at breakfast the conversation happened to turn upon love and beauty he very carelessly declared he looked upon love only as a poetical rattle invented to amuse overgrown boys and girls with and as to beautiful women they were like dresden china pretty pieces of ornamental furniture i was choked could scarcely keep my seat but lady veltry not being so immediately concerned in the reflection as i was had power to go on desiring him to be explicit concerning matrimony hoping she told him to see him wed before she died to his and her wishes  he fixed his eyes full on her face shrugged up his shoulders starting from his seat and turning round with such a smile as some ladies express hate by he replied dear mem youre vastly good and i am immensely obliged to you it is become quite the thing to be sure for men of fashion to be hummed into one piece of folly or another i am not to be out of taste i find positively my lady i dote upon your advice and as i find marrying and keeping a pack of hounds are much practiced at present i believe i may mortify myself so far as to build a dogs kennel  but as to matrimony  no  i will not come into the buckbasket and turning upon his heel left the room singing part of a concerto  we looked upon one another like two travelers who had lost their way i began to entertain a mighty contempt for his understanding yet i admired his figure i was certain he was a fool yet i could not help loving him men of many words may reconcile this paradox all i can say is i felt it to be true  when i retired to my chamber i found a thousand excuses for his behavior i recollected an intimacy a very particular one between this gentleman and the person who passed for his valet they dressed much alike they were not unlike in figure the valet never sorted with the rest of the servants and several expressions his master made use of to him made me conclude that this servant was some young lady whom he had stole from a nunnery  i had often read of such things and that it was owing to this connection he seemed so averse to marriage  lovers sir although they may be mistaken in point of judgment are generally very quicksighted at least so we are apt to flatter ourselves as soon as i had made this discovery i enjoyed greatly my penetration i exulted on the sagacity i fansied myself possessed of i pitied the young lady wanted sadly to hear her story and resolved generously to make a sacrifice of my passion to my rival  with this noble disposition i went to sleep  pity indeed we cannot be so dispassionate or irresolute as we wish to be all my fine flights of disinterestedness vanished in the morning and as soon as i saw the valet i wished the creature out of the house  that very afternoon as i was in my dressing room i heard in an adjoining chamber lady veltrys son and his valet a division in the wainscot gave me an opportunity of seeing them without their discovering it i could not resist the temptation of looking through the crevice there i saw them embrace each other with vast fondness my conjectures were then past doubt but good god  in a few minutes after excuse me sir turning my face away i found the wretches to be both of the same sex shocked and trembling i hurried out of the room rushed down stairs and at the bottom i fell into a fainting fit one of our servants luckily crossing the hall at that moment recovered me too detestable is this subject to dwell upon i told what i had seen and the pair of catamites were seized when lady veltrys son came before her ladyship  so far from being daunted at the discovery he gloried in it pronounced it superb taste and pretended to vindicate himself by vast fashion and high examples  lady veltry would not hear him proceed ordered him out of her sight took to her bed immediately and in four days time without ever suffering her son to come near her died in my arms  but here the lady was interrupted by the following accident  chap xi after the departure of junior from the chief constables madam illicit whose penetration could never enough be admired discovered they had affronted a lord and that as how they might be all ruined supposing he had a mind to sue them for scrambulum matum  scandalum magnatum you mean my dear her spouse replied very good naturedly but sometimes it is unlucky to set folks right she began upon her husband saying it was all his doing by following of his whores and strumpets had not mr illicit very prudently left the room upon the first prognostic of the approaching tempest it might have been of fatal consequence fatal at least to every thing brittle about the room madam illicit being one of the best tempered women in the world but rather too hot and she would in her heat of passion throw any thing that came in her way  but then it was soon over and she was very sorry for it afterward as indeed all hasty people generally are her anger was ended the moment her spouse made his retreat she begged her brothers pardon for being in a passion  but vowed she would for her own familys sake go and wait upon my lords lady for fear worse should come on it  mr oatley approved her intention  but first she strictly enjoined her brother to secresy concerning the whole affair herein imitating some of the mighty men who make laws  not for themselves indeed they act ad libitum thus this lady though she positively insisted upon her brothers not opening his lips about it yet she could not help calling at three or four neighbors houses to let them know what a blunderbuss her husband had been and as how my lord knew her the moment she came into the room and that she was sent for to drink tea with his lordship and the lady and that she knew who the lady was and all about her  but thank god she was no blab and how if it had not been for her knowing my lord my lord would have ruined her brother and her husband for affronting his lordship but that my lord was her intimate acquaintance  just as madam illicit came to goo y wens door where junior was earnestly attending to the fair unfortunates narration she met mr seap one of the parish officers who was coming to pay the strange lady a visit but not out of an idle unwarrantable or impertinent curiosity no juniors liberality had been mentioned all over the town and according to ancient gossipping custom was increased by arithmetical progression  therefore mr seap having the good of his parish at heart came to wait upon the gentleman to know concerning the woman and the child not that he imagined they would increase the towns poorrates but accidents that might happen ought to be provided against besides as the gentleman was known to be so generous a gentleman it was doing his duty to try at least if by threatening the wench about security he could not get junior to make him a present for the benefit of the parish  seneca observes doing duty is duplex  there is a duty we owe our neighbors and a duty we owe ourselves  now to attempt one of these duties mr seap came invested with an authority to punish or protect as justice should find it right necessary equitable and best for justice  but here i must beg leave to observe that the symbols of justice and janus are quite wrong and that they should be shifted  for as every schoolboy knows the temple of janus was relative to war and peace janus should certainly be blindfolded to show that war is sometimes but a game of blindmansbuff and in peacemaking we should take care not to be hoodwinked  justice should wear two faces one to smile at her friends with the other to frown upon her enemies  the utility erudition and occasion of this digression will be a sufficient atonement for its introduction  as the superintendant of the workhouse was going to lift up the latch the lawyers lady seized him by the cuff of his coat and in a very hasty sort of a tone demanded to know what he wanted in that house  seap i come madam to look after some parish business   madam then i insist upon knowing what that parish business is for i and my husband should know because i and my husband do most of the parish business   seap but madam this is concerning a woman and a child and you can have no business   madam how sirrah do you think me past childbearing you rascal  i no business with children  junior was that instant opening the door to know what was the matter when at the very moment backwards mr seap fell into the house driven down by a violent blow on the nose given him by madam illicit for his imporence as she said to contradict her in so vulgar a manner   like a corpse ready for the coroners inquest mr seap lay all at his length on his back cross the brickfloor which his head had hit hard against but madam illicit regardless of his fate straddled athwart him unconcerned and addressed herself to junior and the lady with  i beg your honors pardon my lord and her ladyships honors pardon but this fellor was a coming to insult your honors and your ladyships honors child  she was going on impatient to express herself curtsying at every other word to show her breeding when poor seap in one of her sinkings seized her by the gowntail and cut short her compliments by pulling her bump upon his breast  he lay breathless for some time with the blow and she sat speechless for some time upon him staring wildly confounded at her disgrace but junior who new enough of her temper to judge what must become of the victim underneath her lifted her up and led her to her ladyship then assisted the parish officer and by the friendly interposition of the strange lady my lords authority mr seaps submission and three or four glasses of genuine coniac madam illicit returned home in good humor and mr seap with her leaving the lady at leisure to go on with her adventures  the story of the lady continued  i fear sir my tale is already grown tiresome the remainder of it i doubt you will think more so since i shall be obliged to mention several facts wherein the vanity and ingratitude of mankind are conspicuous  from what already i had known of your sex you must not suppose they could be much in my esteem and what afterward happened to me corroborated the contempt i entertained for them and was as i then thought a sufficient excuse for the manner in which afterward they were treated by me i wish what i have suffered might deter others from too much indulging the strong sallies of their imagination and by my example would remember that they who attempt to make others ridiculous always lay themselves open to revenge  all that lady veltry could leave from her son she gave me and after her decease in money bills and jewels i found myself worth upwards of five thousand pounds as soon as the funeral was over i sat out for london a wheel of my chaise giving way on the road i put up at noontime at an inn a single house upon the bench before the door i saw a very neat dressed young woman sit crying her arms had some black and blue marks on them and her cap and hat was in disorder i enquired of the bystanders what was the reason of her distress they told me her husband had been beating her and just at the instant he came back a black illlooking fellow i asked him mildly the reason of his using so prettya young creature so barbarously he replied surlily she was his wife and no body had any business with her but himself however i at last by giving him some money pacified him i took such a fancy to the young woman that i brought her to town and kept her with me she had been educated by her parents on purpose to go into place as an upper servant her father was a jailor where this fellow of here is had been committed for smuggling nay outlawed she tookpity of him helped him to make his escape and went off with him they had been rambling about the country for six months he was a tinker and she was very ingenious she made and sold artificial flowers at the gentlemen and farmers houses about the country but in the last town they came from a very rich man wanted to be rather too familiar with her she repulsed him but her lover would not give it over went to her husband and proffered him a sum of money to sell his wife  the fellow consented and the blows she had received were because she would not comply this relation i could not help entering in my account courant against your sex and yet i own sir i wished to meet with some incidents that would make me think better of mankind  in the afternoon a man on horseback called to my postillion to stop but just as he came up to the chaise his crape dropped from his face and i knew him to be one of lady veltrys servants who had been discharged about two months before i then thought there was some injustice in his dismission and i remember at his taking leave of me i put a moidore in his hand and to his gratitude i imputed my not being robbed by him the next morning my servant came to tell me that he was sure he saw the highwayman in the yard that stopped the chaise yesterday and asked my leave to have him taken up i was shocked at the news and ordered him on his peril not to say a word but sent my woman with him down stairs to find the poor wretch out and bid him get off  they did so and it gave me great ease when they told me of it for i dreaded if he was seized that i must have taken an oath in a court of justice upon life and death  that action i knew would sit heavy upon my mind as long as i lived  to be accessory in hanging any person even though they deserved it was what i could not reconcile to myself it may be looked on as a foolish womans prejudice but i can no more get over it than several of your sex can their tremblings at cats cheese and many other antipathies  that evening as i sat at supper i received a letter directed to me it surprised me how any person could send me a letter as i was upon a journey  but i could hardly fancy myself awake or in my right senses when i found it was from the wretch who but that morning i cautioned to make his escape  and that it was a loveletter too  i read it over so often it is not easy for me to forget it he began with hoping my honor was not frightened when he came up to the chaise for he wouldnt hurt a hair of my head for all the world hoped i would pardon his boldness in breaking his mind to me that to be sure he never could have had the boldness to think that so fine a lady as i was could have liked him so very much not but that his fellow servants used to say when he lived at lady veltrys that young madam meaning me took his part very much  but to be sure madam  thus the wretch went on when you put the moidore in my hand as i was leaving my place i thought you gave my hand a squeeze and you have run in my head ever since and when yesterday the young woman told me you advised me to get off i was pretty sure you had taken a fancy to me so was resolved to let you know it though i have wore a livery gentlewomen put up with that and as to my taking the road what can a man do that has been used to live well without working and there is cheating in all trades and every body allows the highway is as much a gentlemans profession as playing at cards  you may suppose sir the answer i sent him  i never saw my lover any more  but i kept his letter as a masterpiece of human vanity  as soon as i arrived in london i began to put my intended schemes in execution of making your sex my dupes i did so i used my lovers as some sportsmen do game lure hunt and toil them but   the waiter from the inn came just then to let the gentleman know mr saltern desired his company to dinner which was taking up and begged mr junior would bring the lady with him junior immediately went with the waiter the lady promised to follow after dinner was over during the meal jack let his friend into as much of the ladys history as he knew and then went to goody wens to escort her to the inn as soon as mr saltern saw her he could not help saying a beauty indeed  mr junior told the lady he had related to mr saltern all the preceding part of her history  upon which as there were only them three present she thus concluded her adventures  what a multitude of ridiculous actions i did occasion several very wise lovers to commit  i must say this in praise of understanding sapience knowledge or whatever other title learned folks know it by that i found those my greatest dupes who imagined themselves too mighty to be made fools of your real coxcombs dunces and impertinents i could do nothing with  fowlers might as well attempt to follow wild geese by their track yet let me do your sex so far justice ingratitude is not solely confined to the masculine gender  for my woman who had been my confident in all my schemes nay my agent in most whom i had rescued from the blows of that outlaw  she gentlemen revenged your sex  for when i grew to be tired of making mankind my may game she advised me to matrimony  i had often thought of it myself and upon her recommendation admitted a rich west india merchant just arrived from jamaica to pay his addresses to me  oh gentlemen they who will deceive ought to be deceived in their turns i was so and not to tire you with dull commonplace repetitions i was a second time trepanned  afterward but too late indeed i found out the villainy my woman had met in london her fellow whom i had rescued her from and he persuaded her to be concerned in this confederacy against me they dressed up one of their gang in a proper habit and introduced to me as a west indian sure villainy must severely suffer in the next world it meets with so much success in this we were married and on my husbands praising the island of jamaica to me and the vast profits that were made there by english merchandise he persuaded me to go with him draw my money out of the stocks and lay it out in trade we went over from parkgate to dublin where one of his ships lay as he told me indeed he carried me on board a very handsome ship where i was treated with the utmost civility and lay in the great cabin that night but gentlemen think what my surprise must be in the morning to find myself when i woke in the arms of a stranger after much struggling i sprung from him but i had no where to shelter myself the ship i found was under sail and i was sent for a slave to the plantations the captain of the vessel which was indeed a ship that carried such unhappy wretches over told me that i was represented to him as a common woman of the town that the gentleman i came on board with was to be married to a great fortune but i persecuted him so there was no way of making two families happy but by contriving to get me out of the way  i asked after my trunks he showed me a chest which was left for me  i had it broke open and instead of clothes it was filled with straw sticks and stones  this the captain told me opened his eyes and he believed that i was ill used  but as the wind was fair should he alter his course to set me upon shore his owners would ruin him but he would take care of me he swore and begged pardon for getting to bed to me  but since what was done could not be undone he supposed there was no harm he said if i and he stowed in the same birth together  what could i do gentlemen in these most wretched circumstances he added that when i came to the west indies i should live like a lady that he would bring me safe back again and that if it cost him all he was worth in the world he would find out the villains who had wronged me  for the remainder of the voyage we lived together and when the ship came into harbor he fulfilled his promise of behaving to me like a man  he sold me for a three years indented servant having persuaded me to sign a paper before he went ashore which he said was necessary for both our securities to his owners  you may wonder perhaps mr junior how i had a fortitude of mind sufficient to endure such shocks as these were indeed gentlemen i cannot boast of what your sex calls stoicism  i dont know whether i am right in the word or no but i mean that philosophic armor of indifference in which the famous men of former times are said to have given battle to the passions  yet our sex has a shield that is our sure defense when we please to make use of it it is spirit  and a ladys spirit like a kings prerogative is absolute we will do what we please with it  i was taken by a widow lady a tawnymoor to be her waiting woman i had an easy place of it only now and then i was a little puzzled about choosing ribbands to suit her complexion  you smile gentlemen upon my honor it is true though her face neck and arms were exactly a copper color she spent three hours every day at her dressingtable but these mulattos are much more affected than europeans at least i fancy if in england any illfavored persons should take pains to ornament their faces they would be stared at as prodigies of vanity vastly odd creatures and such as dont appear above once in a century  my mistress though very old as well as intolerably ugly was incredibly rich several persons even of the best families upon the island paid their addresses to her in this too i hope we differ from them  one afternoon as i was sitting by myself in the dining room a gentleman who was the greatest favorite my mistress had came behind me softly and before i was aware throwing his arms round my neck gave me three or four kisses the first and the last time he ever served me so the old lady entered that moment and took immediately such an antipathy to me that she was resolved to have me poisoned those things are often and very easily done there  had it not been for an englishman one of the overseers of her slaves i had died a victim to her jealousy by his means though it was attended with innumerable difficulties i made my escape off the island he took me with him to hispaniola from whence we sailed for england but on the cornish shore our ship was lost and though we saved several things of value out of the wreck the country people came down women as well as men and plundered us of them all  i wonder those things are suffered in such a kingdom as england is i am no politician but really believe our legislators know not that such things are practiced or if they have heard of them fansy them to be so much exaggerated they are not worth attending to  mr saltern i have heard that a clause concerning the preserving of properties in the case of shipwrecks is to be tacked to the bill for preservation of the game throughout england for at present it is not only on the coast of cornwall but on every county in this kingdom whose land lies open to the sea where a ship comes on shore the vessel is not only plundered but the sailors too often murdered   lady thus sir it was they served the person who came over with me as he strove to defend a chest of valuable effects which he had purchased abroad he received a blow on his head by a club from one of the barbarians of which fracture he died on the day of his death i was brought to bed of the child mr junior has so generously taken care of and with which infant i have wandered ever since in a most miserable condition   it is almost incredible what a womans pride can make her capable of either doing of suffering i dont speak gentlemen like a scholar by rote it is only from practice i draw my observations but when once it becomes acquainted with want it is sure to degenerate haughty minds will suffer any affliction but poverty at least it was so with me necessity beggared me of resolution and my spirit was sunk like a decayed prop crushed by the building it should support  chap xii it is needless i believe to observe that when a beautiful woman relates her distresses the audience especially if they be of the male kind seem to sympathize in all her sufferings each man pretends to pity because he admires and admiring he hopes to do as others have done  though from the fair relater he has already heard that mans unwarrantable pursuits occasioned every misfortune she had endured  oh ye high and mighty inhabitants of many acres why will you class beauty as a specie of game destroy them accordingly and boast of it afterward yearly are many beautiful innocents betrayed and beggared yet except at the old baily seldom is man brought to a sense of shame for it  nb no apology is made for the above piece of morality  it may not be altogether thought proper for the history although it is very proper for the historian did not we circulating library scribes imitators and plagiarists now and then thus inform the reader we had some morals they could not easily find it out by the rest of our writings  yet i hope to be allowed observing one thing in behalf of us putterstogetherof things for the amusement of the very indolent part of the public  that although our enemies say we have neither morals learning money nor manners  as to morals vide the first part of this chapter and our learning is elaborately shown by our quotations from the greek grammar the appropos french phrases we have selected from dictionaire royal and the many classical lines which with much trouble we have helped ourselves to out of what is called lillys sintaxis  thirdly as to our manners since mr heart has taken upon him to teach grown gentlemen to be sure we are much more polished than before we now and then receiving a genteel lesson for writing a proper advertisement  indeed as to money i have nothing to say to it in this ungrateful illiberal age we geniusses are no more minded than wornout women of the town nay not so much for they can turn bawds and keep the best company  but who the devil can we pimp for the muses are old maids and prudes and past childbearing and we are too shabby and shamefaced to say any thing to terrestial toasts  what an unrewarding era this is the world knows we have nothing to live by but our wits and they are resolved we shall have nothing more substantial to live upon i remember when a welltimed pamphlet against either party was bread and an attack upon the administration a suit of clothes certain but there is nothing read nowadays but such a general beats the french there and such an admiral takes the french here and this and that island surrenders to the english just like the old stories we heard at school about the grecians and romans conquering every body  these things are so common and englishmen are so uncharitable that if we were to waste the last drop of our ink in the cause of our country in what part of our country should we be taken care of for it or though we wore our pens to the stumps in praise of roast beef we should never get a bellyfull by it  for my own part let ignorance increase i resolve against publishing any more things i will have my bundle of manuscripts buried with me and say with scipio my ungrateful country shall have none of my remains  yet benign reader as i have a very capacious family and there are several outstanding chalk accounts in the neighborhood against me let me beg you will give this work a good word if it is only for the sake of the old maxim since you have been taken in to buy it lend your help to hum others or you may praise it upon the same humane principle as some masters and mistresses will give servants they discharge for male practices a good character not that the wretches deserve to be wellmentioned but what can the poor creatures do either authors or footmen if no body speaks for them  that you may have something to praise me for please reader to observe the elegant quaintness of style which is interspersed up and down in several peculiar phrases through this compilation many more hints sir have i to offer you but i believe by the help of this digressional appendage i have brought this chapter to a tolerable length at least it will be when i have added in order that i have the honor to be  friendly though unknown reader your most obliged most obedient and most sincere humble servant the transcriber  chapt xiii the ladys story with her manner of telling it made such an impression upon mr saltern he offered her himself and fortune so genteely she must have been guilty of the utmost illmanners not to have accepted of at least one of them  junior had left them to themselves all that evening being entirely taken up with pacifying the landlady mrs belcy her husband had struck her that day an action which as she said was horrid to think of and what he never before had ever dared to attempt but she would be revenged of him by all that was good  vowed never more to come between a pair of sheets with him nor live longer in the same house and letting junior see she had five hundred pounds in bank bills and cash he consented to go off with her the first opportunity for jack knew by experience fine women in the sporting way are better tools than false dice more money is got with them and without the fear of detection which sometimes cramps a finefingerd fellows dexterity  no sooner had aurora  no not so soon  days curtains had been sometime undrawn and the rosyfingerd ladyship had taken her pinch of snuff after breakfast before the two gentlemen and lady met at the teatable  mr saltern after making a proper apology informed mr junior he would postpone his intended welsh tour until his return from london for which city he intended instantly to set out and with this ladys consent set her down safe there and assist her to make an appearance worthy her family and breeding begged mr junior would meet him in town which jack promised without hesitation  when every thing was concluded off rattled the postchaise with messrs saltern and company and at the same instant into the yard came limping a brokenkneed hackney whose sides and shoulders looked like an illflead bullock upon his back sat sideling almost incrustated with dirt a tall thin figure meagrefacd whose whitepaperd curls hanging down his bloodless cheeks made him yet look more ghastly he pitched his voice in the proper key of understrapping authority and bawled about him ostler landlord cook drawer and tapster ordering some burned wine for himself warm stables for the horses and a fire in the best parlour for his honor  away burst the servants hurrying here and there like a parcel of disturbed ants when on a sudden they heard the horses trampling in high trot along the street and dexterously turning under the gateway up the yard prancing appeared a nice harnessed set of sleekcoated chestnut geldings rolling in their rear a french varnished vis a vis out of which nimbly skippd sir tasty flash lady dowager grotto followed him cautiously stepping down between landlord landlady three chambermaids two drawers and tapster regularly ranged at the door of the carriage as a ships side is manned for the entrance or exit of a great personage  junior was by his profession company for a man of fashion and being intimate with the baronet no wonder they were rejoiced to see each other  sir tasty had been down to take possession of an estate about fifty miles farther to the west the baronet introduced junior to lady grotto her ladyship received him with a politeness due to her sons recommendation declaring she should be proud to have the pleasure of cultivating an acquaintance  there was something in juniors figure not displeasing  but of this more hereafter  or perhaps not  but we must mention sir tasty fell in love at first sight with the landlady  could talk of nothing else all dinnertime  smoked the reason of juniors being there  desired jack to take a turn in the garden with him and the baronet then told him he would give  00 if he had her in london  a sudden scheme came into juniors head on hearing sir tastys offer  but the reader must excuse me if i dont discover it since as jack did not put it in execution it is not proper any one else should  alas what do we gain by publishing all we know i question if even the indefatigable patriot born ann dom      ever clears his advertisements  this age is not the age for merit to set up his equipage genius is paid by the day bounty turned electionhunter and reward fritterd away among   yet let me for the honor of these times observe  no let us rather observe sir tasty and junior  there they are close together the baronet leaning his elbow on a dial playing his brilliant in the sunbeams and junior with folded arms resting himself against the summer house  sir tasty look ye junior among friends i am fond of her she is quite the thing  i have seen something between you and her but mum you know my dear friend i know the world you have had her i like her and he who will not part from his woman to his friend has not a drop of social virtue about him   junior what makes you sir tasty imagine such a thing is practicable   sir tasty come come dont be queer dont hum neither did you ever know a woman that would not  that is all pon honor i will disburse here is a bill for fifty bring her up to london  i know youre an honest fellow hush here is our elders   enter lady dowager mr junior my lady has given me his honor he will now and then kill an hour this winter with us in london   lady if mr junior can find any thing there equal to his merit    sir tasty you will excuse me my lady  i believe we shall have more time to say fine things when we meet next  will i see is ready  so dr jack adieu as the ghost says in hamlet farewell remember me   junior began now to believe there was such a thing as being in luck and that he was the identical existence that fortune had fixed on for her favorite with the landlady under pretense of taking an airing he galloped off and after a few days crossing the country to avoid pursuit they arrived safe in london of which in about a week more he informed sir tasty not forgetting to enumerate the mighty difficulties and vast expenses which attended the undertaking  sir tasty all in rapture flew to him caressed him in the highest manner bid him command his fortune vowed an eternal friendship to him and introduced him as his most intimate at lady dowagers  chap xiv in the beginning of these memoirs or collection of paragraphs the editor promised a history of the human mind but never declared whether it was to be a male or female one if he intended to describe a ladys inclinations he flattered himself   for where is the scientific page that can lead us to unravel the whimsical workings of a fine womans fancy  yet they themselves can account for the greatest seeming inconsistencies of their own sexs behavior as easily as we form a cometary system nay i heard several of their opinions upon mrs belcy the landladys case who though she went away with mr junior as we may suppose for love yet if she did grant sir tasty a favor or so she was not so much to blame as people might imagine her to be this may indeed as the lady said seem odd to some strange mortals but they must be excessively ignorant and shockingly absurd in their ideas to fansy a fine woman could be constant besides as miss juliet the great actress observed sir tasty was a man of consequence and perhaps rich as peruvian mines and generous as womans warmest wishes  mr deputys lady presumed that junior might grow cold neglect her and not give madam belcy so much of his time as he ought and she did it to be even with him for as revenge is sweet this must be a very sweet revenge  or perhaps miss in her teens sighing remarked that sir tasty might take at first some unbecoming advantage and hinted something about a masquerade that terrible autodese to english chastities  harry hatzell an intimate of the editors hit off the true reason at once  saying the landlady thought that two friends like two heads would be better than one that emulation is vigours whetstone and a lady who has only one lover is as ill served as a town with but one tavern in it  to this opinion the transcriber signs for she wanted as many friends as she could get to secure her from her husbands resentment who presently after her elopement broke up housekeeping advertised her and was on his journey to london to search for her  the baronet though very vain had not yet talked of his mistress either at the star kingsarms or shakespeare whether out of regard to mrs belcy or fear of her husband is undetermined he had subtlety enough to have every thing transacted in juniors name and every thing was perfectly easy with jack as if he had been her husband indeed he came home but seldom he was eternally at my lady dowagers  he was her ladyships right hand  and he also became equally necessary to miss fash who was but just recovered out of a fit of sickness which tom fools banishment had occasioned  every day lady grotto was obliged to pay or return visits mr junior stayed at home to divert miss fash at piquet for since her last illness cards were ordered her by way of alterative  grief as mr vellum very slowly observes is twofold it is like cinnabar natural and factitious and sorrow is dry drink therefore is held by some as a wonderful panacea in catholic countries a cloister is the specific hanging drowning and shooting are used by the good people of england but as they are only quack experiments not slaying secundem artem the faculty have not admitted them into the dispensary  cardplaying is the best and most proper cure either for love or despair provided the patients are persons of condition miss fash therefore applied herself incessantly to so certain an absorbent  junior did not in every party with her act consistent with the character of a gentleman for when he wanted luck he made it n b this is a sort of a secret and like some phrases in free masonry only known to the fellow craft  by degrees her bad run of cards took all her ready money then she played upon honor next she pledged her jewels to him and to redeem the diamonds she was forced to leave her honor in his hands  thus we read of infatuated victims making compacts with the prince of pandemonium his sulphurous majesty and because he should allow them to appear in splendour at present give up to him for always the only precious thing or part belonging to them  o ye much reasoning literati why will ye not do something more than just tell us like guideposts the way we have to go  why will ye not budge yourselves do but once ye dispassionates hold in a dozen hands at hazard take off your own toast in a pint bumper or feel yourselves embraced in the dark hour of assignation then ye would judge more like men and women of the world and not expect we can become pure philosophers on this side fifty  by the vigilance of miss fashs mama this commerce was discovered lady grotto surprising junior and her daughter in what she called unlawful trafficking but she resolved to prevent the affair from being blown therefore took the gentleman to herself and ordered miss to prepare for her marriage with lord pillow  his lordship was very polite excessively goodnatured vastly complaisant and inestimably well bred if any thing rather too easy seldom speaking in company not but he was allowed to have a deal of sense only he had been often told nothing could be worse than to affect wit neither was he very curious because enquiries would have sometimes led him into societies below his birth and a man of fashion should never have any thing to say to the vulgar he was never guilty of any illmannered contradictions but entirely regulated by the advice of his friends relations and domestics what they told him to be taste he believed to be so was it either to build or pull down to clump or enclose to subscribe to furnish to bet to influence elections to buy pictures breed running horses or address a lady  in pursuance therefore of their councils he paid his attendance to lady dowagers daughter and miss fash not caring to disoblige her mama and as necessity not affection had occasioned the intrigue between her and junior she gave his lordship her hand the wedding was solemnized with all imaginable magnificence  chap xv a return to fool hall once more my good reader well met at the squires you see the company are drinking tea in the saloon we will not disturb them they will have done presently here is a fine green painted chinese backbench  excuse my boldness but pray be seated and permit me to ask you two or three questions  pray sir how do you like this history  reader so  so    author why so  so  be it then a deal of pains has been bestowed upon it   reader very likely but pray to what purpose would not your industry have answered much better had you employed it to improve yourself in that business whatever it was to which your parents bred you   author that it what i would have done o most friendly monitor has i been brought up to any we would no more scribble than poor strumpets would strole the streets had we any thing else to do   have you not seen children raise dams to stop a kennels filthy current have you not also observed some grown persons cut tables dressers and sticks to pieces  alas boys making mud walls men whittling wood and our patching up pamphlets are all from the same principle a simple inclination to do something  but as it is customary for sculptors to chizzle their names architects to make their marks and painters to portrait their own faces so is it proper authors in some parts of their works should give an account of themselves least like homer our patron and preceptor after our deaths seven or eight parishes may go to law or loggerheads about paying our burial dues  to begin then with my own account  my father  alas i had a father  but lady fools visitants are up ready to promenade round the garden i will postpone my own history and go on with theirs  this way gentle reader along that evergreen hedgerow  cross twixt those tulipbeds and we shall meet them in the musictemple  mr fool and junior are earnest in argument junior is lamenting the insincerity of mankind the depravity of taste decay of trade increase of taxes abuse of power and all the other trite topics with which this nation is now and then pamphletbubbled  mr fool excuse me mr junior but there are valetudinarians in the body politic as well as the body muscular and when the breath of rumor blows it puts them out of heart and they believe the nations constitution to be immediately incurable   then there are always too many anonymous writers who like quacks must starve for want of business had every individual understanding enough not to be imposed upon by their forgeries but they with specious pretense of public utility like a toad under sage spread their poison unsuspected  when ladies and gentlemen are upon a visit together in this kingdom the conversation is divided as it was at mr fools for while junior and the squire were deeply engaged in the business of the nation the ladies were as earnest in expatiating upon trolly garnet trimmings dresden figures servants carelessness and french varnish  lady pillow endeavored to ingratiate herself with lady fool and she succeeded to admiration the city lady was charmed to hear the late miss fash repeat the particularities of jamess parish and then such elegant notions as lady grotto had about fancying furniture and notableness in domestic management they were prevailed upon by lady fool to stay a month at foolhall and junior was included in the party  one morning after all this good company had been there about a week lady pillow left her lonely uneasy bed much sooner than is customary with the delicate her mind was horribly disturbed she fancied a walk in the garden would be of service there she happened to meet junior who like her had rose for the benefit of contemplation  her ladyship as they met declared she must needs speak with him immeciately they came close to a many pillard building generally called the pantheum they ascended the steps she threw herself into a cushioncovered windowseat and after three or four sighs which gave her animal spirits sufficient relief she was enabled to deliver intelligibly the following words  lady pillow mr junior i find that when a lady has made one false step she is liable to trip all her life after  you know the obligations you have to me i know the connections twixt you and mama  i must have mr fool   junior my lady    lady pillow i dont care what becomes of all the world  hear me out he cannot love this city creature he has married gratitude indeed he has a grateful spirit to all the world but me  he behaves to her like an angel  she loves him but indeed what lady would not  oh mr junior help me  mr fool shuns me  be but my friend in this all past actions shall be forgiven if not by heavens though i myself sink in the discovery all shall be known   junior will your ladyship permit me to hear how i may assist you   lady pillow you must commence an intrigue with lady fool   junior what madam when she loves her husband   lady pillow your sex are not always thus diffident of succeeding with ours  but that is no matter  she has not sense enough to love  no  i will assist you and let a woman alone to win a woman  i know her foible  she drinks mr junior  nay you must have perceived her since we have visited here to have been sometimes on the wrongside reason leave me to prepare the way and be you ready to improve the opportunity   junior vowed an implicit obedience and both well pleased returned into the breakfast parlour  there is a famous pantomimical entertainment called the contention between reason and will but though it is hourly performed by mankinds company of comedians yet the players are not so perfect in their parts as they ought to be the study being so very difficult  now on what is called the theater actors and actresses may keep up their consequences just as they please since they appear not in inferior casts but only now and then like eastern monarchs with all the pride pomp and circumstance of pageant finery  but we on lifes real and various stages cannot preserve the consequential part of our character because as we are obliged every day to make some part of an appearance it necessarily follows that we must sometimes act out of character  thus the once amiable miss fash became deceitful and the careful lady greensay is metamorphosed into a dramdrinker  once or twice in a century such things will happen in her husband the baronets time lady fool used to take a cordial for lowness of spirits and since french liquaeum became tiptop taste she grew fashionably fond of them and indeed looked sometimes as if she had but a confused notion of things  we dont say though her chaplain mr rector did that the day she would go out to look out for tom fool her ladyship had been sipping  chap xvi an opportunity soon offered which lady pillow did not neglect the two ladies had been one afternoon tete a tete conversing together for two or three hours when a walk to the indian pavillion at the bottom of the garden was proposed by lady grottos daughter  arm in arm they tripped along by chance junior was there just when they were seated lady pillow started up she had lost one of her brilliant drops begged to be excused and hurried out to hunt for it  now came on the fatal time for lady fool  always it is said against the death of noble personages the universe is unshipped creations anatomy dislocated and the wheels of the world put out of order monstrous births multiplication of suns showers of red ink dismal aerial yells and jackolanthorn dances are seen heard and wondered at  ancient authentic history abounds with omens and modern memorialists throw in a prodigy now and then just to grace their annals with decent horror  for as mr lee says when a great man falls i e one who has sacrificed about two millions of mankind just to make himself a great man yet at his death creation feels a loss and dame nature like a distracted parent tears herself to pieces  is it then to be doubted that at the death of lady fools honor the following portents were forthcoming  cross the silvery shining moon a broad black cloud spread like a mourning veil as it were in sorrow for the ladys loss behind the alcove a bittern with bill ingulphed deep in the reedy ditch sounded hoarse the whooping own forsook its ivytangled cell flittering bats fled forth blinking beetles doleful hummed their nightly droneing peal the housedog howled dreadful croaking toads crawled cross the smoothmown mead a noisome fog spread its unwholesome vapor growling thunder rumbled overhead the rustling wind whistled hollow through the rafters of an unroofed barn and a fast falling shower rattling pattered against the sashes  but in the very honeymoon of this intrigue  nay before even lady pillow could reap any advantage by it  it was destroyed lady dowager too well experienced not to take notice of the slightest neglect discovered that lady fool had clandestinely possessed herself of lady grottos property in mr junior this the dowager took care to inform mr fool of nay brought him to be evewitness of his own disgrace unperceived either by his lady or her paramour  tom fool burst into the room and in the heart of passion demanded satisfaction told junior he should wait for him by the old chapel and mounted his horse immediately  jack junior had a proper quantity of fashionable spirit which empowered him to back a bad action with a worse in a few minutes followed him out of the room where he was met on the landingplace by lady grotto who upbraided him with ingratitude for his wronging his host as for my part continued my lady your taking up with such a person after i have been weak enough to let you have any thing to say to me does not in the least pique me  not in the least i assure you mr junior it only shows me what your sex are that is all but i congratulate your taste to be sure sir  junior replied to her somewhat penitentially and there would have been it is believed a coalition of parties presently and indeed it was what her ladyship expected had not junior recollected that his honor lay at stake therefore he left her abruptly went down to the stables enquired which way mr fool went and hearing the squire had pistols with him junior borrowed a pair from the steward and set forward after the much injured mr fool  lady fool whom surprise had stupefied sat for four or five minutes after the antagonists had left the room like niobe just petrified or to make a more credible simily as when in the large mansion waiting the familys return a solasitting housewife pores over the melancholy page of glanvilles witches the history of hobgoblins or some other such daemonraising work as she reads on her blood more chilly circulates an anguish tremor agitates her muscles if then the wind chances to blow open her doors she seems fixed as if froze speechless all her powers cease from motion even her life indicating eye alters not its point  thus frightened and frightful wildly staring sat lady fool upon the bedside and as soon as she came to herself she rung the bell with the utmost vehemence  susan entered on the instant with a bottle of citron water in her hand judging that was what her ladyship was in such a hurry for the moment the maid entered her ladyship wringing her hands cried out oh susan what will become of me i am ruined susan i am ruined what shall i do  susan the lord forbid madam but pray my lady how   lady o susan here happened to be mr junior in my room i dont know how he came in but i was taken with a swimming in my head and he was lifting me from my bed just as my spouse opened the door and to be sure mr fool flew into such a jealous passion i dont know what may be the consequence if he should speak of it susan i am ruined crying my reputation my dear reputations gone for ever   susan dear my lady maid crying dont weep i am sure you will break my heart to see as how your ladyship grieves yourself  to be sure my lady my master his honor has too much sense   lady o susan my reputation i shall never    susan do pray my lady sip up this spoonful just to recover yourself to be sure my lady reputations very well among poor folks and we servants when out of place but you are a rich lady and a fine lady and great ladies should always be above minding trifles there is my lady grotto why now she would not take on so and yet mr junior and she are greater than they should be that i know   lady how susan are you sure of that   susan yes my lady i will take my corporal oath on it  i saw something yesterday between them made my flesh creep upon my bones  to be sure servants should hear see and say nothing so i resolved to do only thought it was my duty to tell your ladyship   lady the wickedness of this age my good god could i ever think lady grotto would have done so  what bring fellows for her filthy intrigues into my house if she had a mind to play the strumpet could not she do it at home   susan indeed my lady i never liked that laced coat fellur muster junior and if as his honor my master should come to any harm by him    lady o susan dont name it  i should never outlive it  he is the best of husbands  oh if my lady grottos fellow should kill him   susan dear my lady shall i go and see for his honor pray my lady dont cry do pray take this tea cupfull  there my lady i am sure twill do your ladyship good  crying spoils the eyes and such fine eyes too as your ladyship has for all the gentlemen that come to our house say mrs susan your lady has lovely eyes   lady lord how the wench runs on   susan indeed my lady grief bringson wrinkles the most fastest of any thing in the whole world and such pure white and red too as your ladyship has and all natural too  and that is more nor my lady grotto can say for all she looks so cherrycheekd   lady oh dont mention her susan but go for mr rector bring him to me immediately   susan pray my lady dont cry again i will go fetch the parson  pray my lady be composed  i will leave the bottle with your ladyship    exit susan now her ladyship is left alone her eyes fast fixed on the bottle like an infant looking upon a map her spirits were frustrated she would have reflected about herself mr fool lady grotto and junior but a sudden pain shot cross her stomach  she was obliged to have recourse to her cordial her imagination began to be abominably hurried crowds of complexd ideas disturbed her faltering disjointed syllables fell from her lips inverted shapes danced before her sight along the bed she sidelong sunk then heavy sleep seized on each dizzy sense and closed her coquerd eyes  as susan left her ladys room the maid was met by lady pillow to whom the communicative mrs susan related all lady fools distresses informing the astonished young lady that whereby his honor her master had found that fellur junior along with my lady somehow the squire took it ill and so they went out in a huff together and god forbid there comes no harm on it  to be sure as i told her ladyship servants shoudnt say much but i think my lady is but in a disparation way herself or else she would never have sent me for our chaplain to say his prayers by her  and away mrs susan hastened down the stairs leaving lady pillow to recover herself by degrees  and indeed we must do the same to attend upon the combatants  tom fool rode out determined upon revenge and junior as determined followed him mr fool hurried away by his passion spurred his horse on whipped leaped and galloped persons who are very uneasy do not choose to suffer any thing to be at rest they have power over  the place of appointment was about three miles off he soon arrived at it and while he was there amused his expectation by raising himself every now and then in his stirrups to look after his adversary  on the moral rectitude of duelling the reader may consult jacob behmen  we have now no time to do it being obliged as well as the squire to enquire after junior who to do him justice rode out with a resolution to give mr fool gentlemanlike satisfaction for gamblers like women of the town must have something of the people of fashion about them or they can never expect to be introduced into companies where they may make their market now as no man can be a man of honor that will not meet his man ergo  every man is a man of honor that will and for that sole accomplishment qualified to keep the best company  chap xvii to speak is something so selfpleasing that we are apt to talk until we forget what we had to say thus it has happened to the memorialist whose digression almost drove the history out of his head or else he would in the last chapter have informed the reader that after junior had got out of the parkgate mistaking the servants directions he turned to the left instead of the right and at a distance perceiving something upon a hill which he imagined to be the old chapel mr fool mentioned he galloped up to it forthwith  as he mounted the hill he observed it to be a large old stonebuilt barn and rode up in hopes of meeting some person to enquire his way of  he found a young woman sitting at the door of whom he asked his road but the informed him she was a stranger traveling toward london and begged he would bestow something upon her some persons when they are asked for charity will give their blessing but no money others are more ready to part with their persons than their cash junior was at this time in a loving disposition the girl looked wanton and wholesome and they went in to the barn together hanging his horse at the door as his girl desired him  that was what his very yielding mistress wished for she knew that behind the barn her man had hid himself and was ready as soon as the fond couple had retired to mount the gentlemans horse and gallop off with it according to the plan they had contrived as they saw junior mounting the hill her fellow had but just been cleared at york sizes for want of evidence and they were tramping it to london when juniors appearance gave them a hint to put in practice the scheme beforementioned it was executed with all imaginable success and jack obliged to walk in his boots above half a dozen miles before he could find an inn to put up at from whence he sent a letter to lady pillow to enquire how every thing was at the hall  all was distraction there mr fool had so endeared himself to every servant by his behavior that the whole house was in an uproar when it came to be known he went out with pistols to fight junior the men went of their own accord several ways to seek their master but before this mrs susan had reached the parsonage where she found mr rector deeply immersed in electrical experiments endeavoring to discover an universal nostrum  for the vicar after the loss of lady fool had given himself up entirely to the study of the sublime sciences saying like some other odd philosophers women were unworthy a wise mans notice as soon as mrs susan saw him she cried lord mr rector you must come to my lady immediately she is all out of sorts  mr rector if her ladyship is out of sorts she must be electrified  that attenuates that stimulates    mrs susan it may be so sir but our whole house is out of sorts   mr rector then the whole house must be electrified as we fumigate against any epidemical disease or as catholics in their exorcisms sprinkle with holy water   mrs susan i am sure water will not do her ladyship any good its too cold for her  so mr parson you must come and talk about your learning to her for she is but in a so and so way i can tell you   mr rector is she not  but i assure you mrs susan i can restore her  i have a specific  there it is pointing to the machine with this i will do such things that were the great boil alive he would say to me tu eris mihi magnus apollo   mrs susan but you mustnt follow you must go along with me and i will tell you what doctor bring that thing umbob with you  it is like a show it may make my lady laugh mayhap  mr rector not caring to trouble himself with explaining any thing to susan only thought fit silently to despise her for her ignorance and ordered his electrical apparatus to be brought after him to lady fools as mrs susan and the vicar crossed the closes the maid let him into some part of the history relating to mr fool and juniors going out together to fight   when the vicar with mrs susan entered her ladyships apartment lady fool was dozing  her woman too hastily waking her made her ladyship start up affrighted and her eyes opening upon mr rectors uncouth appearance added to her terror although he was a clergyman he had then nothing black about him but his face and hands they were crusted over by the smoke of his experiments and dust of his study a true philosophic bronze venerable as the rust upon medals  he was a man of too refined notions to mind externals superior to form and so much absorbed in sublime speculations could not consult dress though he was to wait upon a lady  must man prerogative possessing man classically and contemplatively dignified must he descend to think to act or wear clothes like everyday appearing mortals  no thus mr rector answered mrs susan who found fault with his having a coarse flannel nightcap on his head over which turbanlike a dirty neckcloth was tied and a muchworn red bays banyan covered the rest of this figure  lady fool struck with the sight holding up her outspread hands trembling uttered  my god what is that jesus i hope you dont come to rob me a more cool imagination than her ladyships might have been mistaken in the gentlemans profession but convinced by mrs susan of her mistake the lady asked his pardon and bursting into tears  with  oh mr rector i am frightened out of my wits  rector i opined indeed your ladyships understanding was insane from the incongruity of apprehension you just now was guilty of  but nemo mortalium    lady dear mr rector dont talk of mortality now i have been dreaming of deaths heads and plumes of feathers   rector give me leave a moment my lady to consult with myself upon your case  and immediately he threw himself into a meditating attitude he was like most of his booklearnd brethren of an unforgiving contemptuous spirit she had taken him for a felon  that he could not pass over  but resolved to let it rest for a while especially as he concluded her to be delirious therefore he determined to sooth her by soft persuasion until his experimental engine came then he designed to cure her by electrification and publish her case with all the concurrent circumstances and thus at once gratify the two most indulged the meanest of all the passions vanity and revenge setting one hand by his side and extending the other he made with it a sweep from his nose to his knees at the same time pawing forth his right leg and foot nodded his head his bow finished he stood erect again coughd hemmed and thus oratorized  st austin seneca cardan boethius plato and epictetus have discriminately my lady elucidated to us the prevention of grief and what tertullian tells us upon that head is worthy observation grief is in itself as st chrysostom says an antithesis to joy therefore the poets have defined sorrow to be joyless or abstracted from mirth hence by the constriction as well as construction of the glandulous valves stimulated by the diaphragmas suspiration the animal spirits are jaculated into the lachrymal ducts which occasions tears   lady no mr rector it is fear for my dear husbands fighting a duel occasions my tears   rector pity it is that duelling should be the men of modes nostrum when electrifying is so much a safer panacea i am my lady conscious of as much innate bravery as it is possible for any man to possess but must i put my life upon the impelled velocity of a bullet or suffer my heart to be a horizontal mark for the acute point of a rapier to perforate   lady oh mr rector how can you talk about killing when that dear creature my husband may a be murdering this moment   rector madam if his honor should be destroyed i shall be as much concerned for him as a philosopher ought to be  the man who kills him must be hanged and your ladyship must be electrified   word was brought him that his electrifying apparatus was come he bid it be brought up stairs and began to set it in order her ladyship who had never seen any of that sort before stared and asked him if he was going to conjure but before he could answer her susan bounced into the room over the machine she tumbled crash the glass globe fell to the ground poor susan rolling about among the pieces sprawling kicking and shrieking but up she soon scrambled and ran at mr rector openfisted crying curse your rattling trapsshe scratched she tore she bit him he calling out piteously all the while and at the same time my lady bawling herself black in the face with bidding susan leave off but nothing could stop her rage but an inability of breath as soon as she was out of wind the suffering vicar arose baldpated his band torn his nose bit in two places and his face and breast covered with blood that came from susans cut fingers which she had mangled among the bits of broken glass  my lady could not bear to look upon mr rector but begged he would go immediately to the surgeons for she vowed he looked horridly shocking and vastly frightful the chaplain at that moment casting his eyes upon the lookingglass gave a great groan and ran down stairs crying out a doctor a doctor for gods sake oh i shall bleed to death consider what the loss of me will be mine is no common loss the world will miss me o that i had but published my electrics then i should have existed to afterages with bacon newton and the rest of my brother geniusses like me britons like me philosophers but ah unlike me in fortune  what must i die ignoted die so  ay so  that is it  die scratched to death  what a death for a scholar  i feel the venom of her nails now in my nose the poison ascends to the olfactories the cellulae of my brain will be loaded and i shall be distracted yet bear witness neighbors i will not forgive her  more he would have said had not a surgeon been luckily at the hall under whose care we shall leave the vicar and wait upon her ladyship who was curious as the reader may be to know the reason of susans abrupt entrance  we have already taken notice of the confusion all the family was in at mr fools being missing and that the servants went several ways to seek him now the stewards happened to be at the very inn where junior came to  the faithful domestic had him seized and carried him before a justice for murdering mr fool and as he could not give a very satisfactory account about his horse nor himself he was committed to prison  this was the news susan brought in such a hurry which occasioned the electrical catastrophe above mentioned it may be wondered at by some readers that lady grotto came not at this time to comfort lady fool but the dowager was all this time employed much more agreeably at least as she thought being taken up with writing letters to every one of her acquaintance round the country in which the history of lady fools infidelity and disgrace was painted in a very plain and very particular manner  not so satisfactory was her daughter lady pillow amused the young lady after recovering herself from what susan had related was a sorrowful witness what trouble mr fools absence occasioned and retired to her chamber attended by that terrible tormentor selfaccusation  after some moments pause thus the unfortunate lady began  yes i am the wicked author of all this  he will murder that charming fellow  shoot him through the back   the villain that was base enough to take such an advantage of me will never give a man fair play  junior is an assassin oh my dear tom fool that i could but be by in any shape to assist thee  the arrival of her spouse lord pillow who had been about a month upon the mountains moor shooting put an end to her soliloquy with her mama she attended his lordship to tea lady fool sent her excuse being immensely out of order and not fit to see company  that lord pillow might not remain a stranger to lady fools illness lady dowager told his lordship that an odd accident happened here you know junior my lord my sons great favorite  lord pillow intimately my lady and i assure you he has very much of the man of fashion about him   lady grotto he has been one of our party here i cannot say it was any desire of mine it should be so for pon my onner the man is a disagreeable to me as a hackney coach however lady fool is mistress of her own house you know and she insisted on it i thought it was a little odd whimsical and so forth  but as i detest scandal i hate to be inquisitive  however love and murder as they say will out the affairs over and i am sorry to say her ladyships blown for young fool her spouse who was my sons under gamekeeper caught her and junior in bed together this morning i am sorry to break off all acqaintance with her ladyship so instantaneously but it cannot be avoided for how can i lord pillow ever look upon lady fool with friendly face again after she has so grossly forfeited her honor   lord pillow you are perfectly in the right indeed lady grotto but where is junior   lady pillow mr fool challenged him upon the spot and they are afraid junior is gone after to fight him   lord pillow by all means or i would never have spoke to junior henceforward nor would sir tasty i assure you   lady pillow my dear dear lord how can you talk so suppose now a thief    lord pillow no my dear you must pardon me there a robbery is one thing and an affair of this kind is another with a thief you consider loss of property or some other mercantile view but with respect to a challenge you are not to consider any thing   lady pillow no   lord pillow no  positively no except the challenge itself that like a playdebt must be paid upon honor   lady dowager however i insist upon going away tomorrow you lordship to be sure has a right idea what belongs to your sexs honor and i never yet i hope was deficient in what regarded me or mine therefore i beg your lordship will make it a point that we may go off in the morning for i cannot sleep with any tranquillity in a house the mistress of which has so lately polluted it with adultery   here we would say something about lady pillows sentiments upon this affair were we not this instant interrupted by the vicar who sending in his duty to the right honorable it was immediately granted and mr rector entered his band changed face and hands washed nose plaistered and chin fresh shaved in his best suit of canonicals with a fine flowing flaxen fullcurld perriwig crowned with a high foretop and fullpowderd  with a becoming reverence he made a roundabout obeisance then with humble submission began a petition to their ladyships addressing them with beseeching their graciousnesses that they would out of the benevolence of their dispositions condescend to beam forth a look of compassion on that poor lost sinner lady fool who was now in violent hysterics  the ladies immediately went to see her and his lordship ordering the chaplain to be seated entertained the attentive mr rector for the rest of the evening with his dextrous exploits upon heathcocks and country wenches  chap xviii it is now time to inform those who have determined to read these volumes through that after mr fool had waited some hours at the place appointed in vain he began to consider what could be the reason of juniors absence certain i am thus mr fool soliloquized he could not mistake the place if he had a mind to have met me he might have been here before now perhaps shame prevents him  it must be so  shall i search for him  no  home i am determined not to return and upon these words spurring on his horse he gallopped across the country  after he had hurried along about thirty miles he found night overtake him very fast as he entered upon a large moor he was quite ignorant of the country and as it grew dark tom fool laid the reins loose upon his horses neck and suffered the beast to go which way he pleased the horse kept without food for the whole day was seeking something to eat when his fore feet broke down the earth and he fell with his rider into a deep pit from whence stones and slates formerly were dug the beast died upon the spot and mr fool with much difficulty disengaging himself from the carcass too much bruised to get up without help was forced to remain below till morning when he was found and relieved by the greatest accident imaginable  one of the many elegant and innocent amusements which young ladies of fashion kill part of their morning time with is collecting and arranging curious shells and uncommon pebbles  to obey a ladys orders the morning after mr fools fall mr borlace had taken a walk to the quarry pebblehunting there he found tom fool and had him conveyed to a farmhouse the only dwelling for many miles round  this mansion stood in the midst of a large uncultivated common which was overspread with furze thistles fern rushes and turf pools for want of being properly enclosed for as it as divided into several lordships the persons possessed of its different manors were not unanimous about draining diking and improving it  sir selzy simkrimp would not come into it because as he told his spouse while he pointed his finger over the land surveyors plan only mind me my dear if i consent to this affair widow wail comes in for four acres and two perch more than i have  his curate took the liberty to hint that enclosing would be a means of employing a number of poor whose families were now starving that charity was of heavenly birth that he hoped the great the rich and powerful would now and then condescend to think that the poorest creatures are their fellow creatures made of the same materials quickened by the same spirit and supported by the same elements then sympathy nay even base selflove would dole out some superfluities to feed the hungry to cloth the naked  let us have none of your nonsense interrupted the baronet as to poor we have too many already and damned high assessments and if these wretches can get children now they are half starved what would they do if they had their bellies full i say they that stand up for the poor only encourage poachers and our game is thin enough already so i will not give my vote for it  and if i do i will be damned replied squire bitt it would destroy all my cover for hares  from this modern way of reasoning but one consequence could be supposed it was totally neglected except some acres round the house to which mr fool had been carried  the tenant of which habitation in her youth had been a celebrated lady of pleasure and dealt formerly with most of the gentlemen belonging to that county  when she according to the common custom of her profession fell to decay the neighboring gentlemen out of gratitude as they will sometimes maintain worn out hunters fitted up part of an old hall stocked some ground round it and gave it to her for life it was to this house tom fool was carried  about the same time that morning lady grotto with lord and lady pillow took their leaves of lady fool her ladyship immediately after retiring to her chamber overwhelmed with affliction  here  here  seems to be a stagnation of the story or the business of the story for the editor like a savageminded tragedy writer has maimed or made away with most of his dramatis personae except mr junior  no we have him left to keep attention awake like a dance between the acts for something must be done english people love to be busy themselves or see others so therefore as this will be the last time we shall have any occasion to mention mr seniors son and that his narration shall no more interrupt the thread of our chronicle we shall like a judicious historian although it is a little out of the order of time put all that is to come to hand of him in the following paragraphs which we would immediately lay before the reader but beg leave to refer him to the next chapter  chap xix the conclusion of the adventures of junior at first he made slight of being seized but lady fool to clear her reputation dispatched a messenger to the justice with a letter in which she insisted on it the villain should be made an example of for he had murdered the best of husbands  lady grotto gave up junior entirely she despised him for the absurdity of his taste to neglect her for a city lady and indeed wished he might be punished for his immense illmanners in so abruptly leaving her at the last interview lady pillow looked on him as an assassin and sir tasty declared pon onner he could have nothing to say to mr junior till he had cleared up his character  on his second examination several very creditable persons deposed that he always appeared to be very much of the gentleman he always laid his money very fair paid his play debts punctually no person wore better clothes or gave more money to servants on a visit but it is much more necessary for a man at some times to be really a gentleman than only to look like one in the eye of the law all those hi fine accomplishments were invalid mr fool was not yet found an order came for him in consequence of lady fools letter to be more closely confined  one misfortune seldom comes alone for junior found on his return to prison an action lodged against him by the innkeeper for criminal conversation  finding himself pressed by the law and deserted by his friends he thought that things were almost over with him however he was resolved not to fling up his cards while there seemed to be a probability of recovering the game therefore began to scheme accordingly  hunger will break through stone walls and money he knew to have that hungry quality the next evening as the jailer and he sat tete a tete over a large bowl of punch he after a little circumlocution proffered the prisonkeeper fifty guineas nay pulled the sum out to show it him to let him make his escape  the jailer replied he could not say any thing to it  junior turned off the discourse in an instant as he knew his man and chose as othello says he should chew upon it pretended to be sleepy and went early to bed  when the lockerup had turned into his own bed he could not close his eyes the guineas seemed still before them he began to grow very restless tumbling and tossing and turning his spouse whom he had not for some years before that night disturbed by his overwakefulness was scared at the oddness of the thing could not imagine what it was she a while lay still expecting what would come on it but finding him still continue insignificantly restless began to rate him for disturbing her in such a manner as he did  jailer why you must know my dear that the gentleman there our prisoner proffered me fifty guineas if i should let him out   wife has he got the money   jailer has he yes that he has twice as much i saw it but that aant the thing i dont know what to do in it if as how i should take the money and it should be blown why then lord help me   wife lord help you indeed you poor tony who should blow it indeed but your own self howsomdever let me alone i will find a time to talk to him about it sizes will not be these two months and we heed nor be in a hurry to get rid of him he is a special good customer and a power of the right sort come after him   jailer that is all true my dear   wife it is all a fools head of your own my dear as to the fifty guineas well get it and he shall not get away neither   jailer no   wife no   jailer lord if that could be   wife lord what a wonderment you make about it but come turn to me and i will tell ye i will make the bargain with him that one night when you are gone out of town you can make believe you know about going out of town that i will let him out  so now do you mind me you know the hosiers house which is next to ours you have the key of it and the frenchmens chamber where they broke through leads into that house and you know there are only some boards nailed against the hole   jailer i take you my dear   wife no but you dont so dont interrupt me  i will tell him as how i can let him into the empty house and give him the key to let himself out into the street provided that he will put the fifty guineas into my hands the moment i have let him out of prison into the empty house  this mun he will agree to at once so then only mind me   jailer so i do betty   wife the devil you do why youre going to sleep now you are   jailer no child i ant so you had no occasion to have given me such a punch in my side with your elbow   wife why then you should answer me as you should do for you know i abominatiously hate not to be minded so as i was saying  where was i got to   jailer to the fifty guineas my dear   wife oh ay so then he will gi me the fifty guineas into my hand so then i will give him the key and leave him to unlock the streetdoor where you must be waiting you know with some more help so you will seize him at once and bring him back again he cannot accuse you you know and i will go out of town to my uncles he has wanted me to come a monstrous while and so then i will not come home again till the gentleman is hanged or acquitted so then there is the money all snug and not a soul in the varsal world never the wiser   this scheme as it was really a very deep one the husband admired and they lay awake until morning considering how and in what way they should put out the fifty guineas  jack junior not having the second sighted gift remained a stranger to this plot observing the husband not to take any notice of it next day hinted it to him again but the jailer begged him for gods sake not to think of it for he wouldnt do such a thing for the world  perseverance is as much the property of a gamester as a lover  but it would not do  the man was still obstinate  junior changed his plan sounded the wife and found her very pliable she consented upon consideration of juniors giving her sixty guineas she had a mind to keep ten to herself she would let mr junior out of the goal into an empty house and give him the key of the street door and he might let himself out but he must stay till the nights were dark and her husband gone out of town  the long expected time came at last her husband was gone a journey or at least pretended in juniors hearing to do so junior then went up with the goalers wife into what was called the french chamber and there he told out before her face sixty guineas after she had taken up several and examined them they that were not filed or false he replaced them in the bag again tied up the mouth and held it in his hand ready to make her a present of it the moment she had conducted him past the prison walls she had a candle and lanthorn along with her when they parted he received the lanthorn and candle she the bag junior entered the one pair of stairs of the hosiers house she went to the goaldoor to let her husband know who was waiting there that the gentleman was coming and then she went to her bureau to lock up the money  the most cunning are frequently the greatest dupes thus it was with junior he had no suspicion of the intended ambush but merely by instinct and experience from former practices he sat the lanthorn down in a corner and softly opened a sash to look into the street and listen if any persons were passing at that instant mr mayors coach happened to be going home with his worship and family from a visit and a footman carrying a lighted flambeaux behind illuminated the whole street just as the coach passed along junior discovered underneath him several persons with watchmens bills standing round the door of the house he was in he had now need of all his fortitude without shutting down the sash softly on tiptoe he stepped back again took the lanthorn and hurried up stairs into the back garrets in search for a trapdoor or casement which opened upon the leads very luckily he found one quickly out he got and after a trial or two found the gutter would bear him along sideling he crept his hands upon the tiles until he was stopped by a ladder which lay standing in his way this he conjectured might have some communication with others lower and after some time feeling about for he had put out his light he found a bundle of scaffolding cords one end of which he made fast to the uppermost ladder and depending on that and in hopes of more ladders he began to descend what with sliding and scrambling he found himself at last safe landed in a narrow lane just then he heard the minster clock strike one guided by that sound he walked toward the churchyard where he expected to find waiting for him a friend and a couple of fleet horses  for unknown to the goalord lady after he had fixed the night and hour in which he was to leave his prison he ordered one in whom he could confide to be in the minsteryard with a brace of geldings when the clock struck twelve and stay till junior came jack rightly judging it was a place which at that time of night few people would walk through therefore his groom and cattle might secret themselves there and also junior could find the place more readily than any other  how did the person in waiting rejoice when he heard junior whistle the signal not that it was joy proceeding from a heartfelt satisfaction to hear his friend was at liberty  no  he was glad he had got company for mr juniors assistant though one of the boldest fellows living nay had actually fought a duel yet began to be very uneasy as he staid among the graves and tombstones a cold sweat bedewed his face and breast and he was at last so far pannicstruck that when the clock went twelve he would have left junior to get off alone as well as he could but had not strength to get from the tombstone on which he had laid himself at length upon his breast his hands cross his eyes  there is something so tremenduously gloomifical as mr  observes in a churchyard at midnight and only then as must appal the stoutest among men this was what the person declared to junior after they had got the town upon their backs saying look ye jack junior though as to religion to be sure i know it all to be priestcraft and as to parsons they are no more knowing than other men  how should they you know and every body else knows i ant afeard of nothing yet damme if ever i was so out of sorts as i was when i was among them tombstones and if i could have said the lords prayer by heart or any thing about the bible i believe i should have pattered nothing else all the time after the clock struck twelve for curse me jack junior though ive more sense than to believe a word what such fellurs as parsons jaw yet i will hold five pound to a shilling and i say done first that no man in the world can stay in a churchyard at midnight without sweating for it  here would we give you the answer his companion made him but they both began to gallop along so fast having found themselves on the turnpike road that they were too soon out of earshot for us to take down even in short hand the rest of their conversation  now to return to the prisonkeeper after he and his followers had waited themselves out of all patience he dispatched his wife back to go into the very place to which she had inducted junior and see what was become of him as soon as she had been all over the house she bawled out of the window jack had left open oh lord he is got out atop he has got out a top the empty house streetdoor they could not force open junior had the key in his pocket they were forced to go round through the goal and they soon discovered the trapdoor open but not one would venture out alleging they had families and whod maintain their poor babes if any thing misfortunable was to happen to themselves  the alarm by this time was spread through the neighborhood that the gentleman murderer had made his escape the mayor was informed of it and he sent immediately for the goalor to be ascertained of the truth of the report  when her spouse went to wait upon the mayor madam the goalors lady retired to her bedchamber opened her chest of drawers took out the bag junior had given her and united it to take care of the ten supernumerary pieces which as she had bargained for unknown to her husband she was unwilling he should come to hear of for fear he might be angry with her  out into her lap she pours the precious treasure  a  ha  oh my sweet jesus thus she shrieked out started up and down fell all the contents of the bag upon the floor and she upon them dashing her hands up and down among them for instead of sixty guineas good and lawful money of great britain there was nothing but small leads of sleeves thick pieces of glass ground round pieces of pewter and brass curtain rings there amidst the heap like the story of danae done by a signpost painter she lay in a violent fit not one struggle of it feigned after burning all the matches they could come at under her nose it was as much as her maid could do to keep her from relapsing  her spouse returned from mr mayors with a very discontented mind his worship threatened him to take the goalors place from him if the prisoner was not forthcoming all he comforted himself as he walked home was that let the worst come to the worst he had fifty guineas to begin the world with  when he came into the chamber where the maid was sat on the ground holding his wifes head in her lap and all the counterfeit pieces scattered about her he cried out what the devil and be damned to it is this  wife o husband it is no matter  oh  but we are ruined that is all  oh lord  then fell into another fit which after some trouble they brought her out of and she told her husband that instead of the fifty guineas the rascal had given her that stuff which lay about the floor   indeed some people are to be pitied for after he had listened with astonishment to her broken relation often interrupted with sobs and was convinced he was undone without making her any reply down stairs he went to look for his horsewhip and just as he had laid hand on that he was laid hands on by two of mr mayors officers and carried by his worships order to the black hole for aiding juniors escape who was then with his companion making the best of his way to london once more to cut a figure but whether in the sessionspaper as a felon or in the newspaper for marrying a great fortune time only can be the telltale  it is odds indeed but that he is rewarded for acting on the wrongside of equity sooner than punished for it which makes out what hamlet observes about there being more things in heaven and earth than are found out by philosophy if not we might account why visagewearing roguery shall dine upon turtle and opencountenancd honesty starve in forma pauperis  chap xx mr fool was very hospitably received at the mansion house to which by the order of mr borlace he was carried  with the lady who we have already mentioned to be in possession of this dewlling place there boarded a young gentlewoman to whom mr borlace was a great favorite  as soon as their guest mr fool was well enough recovered to see company they made him a visit at which time borlace observing all their endeavors to dissipate his melancholy were ineffectual first making a proper apology for his abruptness addressed mr fool as follows  sir your disorder does not seem entirely to arise from any bodily pains the mind is i am afraid concerned in your case i would not enquire into your story out of a weak or illtimed curiosity no sir i have been unhappy myself  very unhappy  this young lady has felt the severe grasp of calamity we have all known what it has been to suffer if you will give me leave sir well relate to you our past lives and you know sir what we are taught at school that it is a comfort to the sorrowful to have partners in affliction  tom fool i am indeed sir very much hurt in my mind yet should be grieved to find any one so unfortunate as i am   mr borlace that sir i leave you to judge my name sir is witwood borlace a name i believe once as well known in the gay life of london as fanny murrays i am a man of family and consequently a man of ambition but the mode of my mind was not constituted either for field sports at home or campaigns abroad all my wish joy and pride centered in being called a clever fellow   to be a man of wit and humor is a character eagerly sought after like the great prize in the lottery and the world will put in because each individual thinks he may pretend to it but that is not the thing every lady is not born to be a toast nor every man to be a genius  one thing that led me to aim at so pleasing a title was i had a prodigious share of spirits and from my induction at college to this present time they never failed me  i was forced indeed to leave the university sooner than i expected on account of the first piece of wit i ever attempted i put a piece of hot coal on my tutors shoe as the old fellow lay asleep it happened to lame him indeed but that was more than i intended  when i returned to my fathers i was ordered to prepare myself to make the grand tour but an aunt of mine objecting to him how weak it was in parents sending their sons abroad before they had seen their own country i had liberty allowed me to go with her to tunbridge  i was soon take notice of for my vast spirits and made principal in most parties of pleasure until the satirical talent which i possessed made me be thought too severe a companion and i was in consequence of that left out of several future invitations  this pleased me for i was fond of being dreaded i lampooned away and enjoyed the anxiety which it gave to several at the spaw who would have poisoned me if they dared i had imbibed the opinion from several ladies of fashion that to give pain was the greatest pleasure imaginable  my father had been some years a widower and just as i came of age dying left me a large unincumbered estate with some thousands in ready money then i began to execute my plan which was to be the tiptop fellow for fun frolic wit and humor upon the town  i gave over all thoughts of going abroad being conscious that my own country could furnish me with curiosities enough for entertainment however that i might not be disesteemed for a deficiency of taste i employed persons who understood those things to furnish me with a proper quantity of pictures etchings medals bronzes cameos intaglias antiques and petrifactions  while my house cabinets and curiosities were fitting up in london i went to an estate i had in cornwall with half a dozen excessive droll fellows to practice all the species of wit and humor i intended to be excellent in  after being absent a year i burst on the town a prodigy i was allowed to be the greatest genius that ever embellished an evenings conversation i could take off ryan and the blind man with his bladder and string i could play upon my coats skirt like a bagpipe and make an old womans face upon my hand i could make a fiddle go like a german flute and grunt with my mouth like an organ could do all the london cries and play a solo upon a broomstick sound a trumpet from the corner of my hat and play a voluntary by snapping my fingers i was the best hand in england upon the saltbox and nobody sung the welsh song like me then i could growl like quin and squint like parson whitfield and every body allowed at my own table i said as many good things as any man in england  there we was one thing very remarkable about me which was though i had an excessive share of spirits they never hurried me into any particular extravagancies i detested gaming as to tossing up for the reckoning now and then or buying a few lottery tickets just to make presents with those were trifles not worth talking of and what would not hurt any body but i was determined never to be taken in so though i have had all the tiptop women of the town they never had me they loved me as a clever fellow but i was too knowing to be a keeper i have indeed sometimes made one lady a present of a piece of plate and folded up a bankbill two or three times and flung it by way of frolic at another what then i was not scheemed out of it though i used to lie with them they never had a penny from me as to any thing else who the devil would deny giving a fine woman now and the forty or fifty guineas provided a man was not made their dupe which they honestly confessed to me i was not they could not finesse me  while i was amusing myself in this manner i received a little damage from a gentleman whose wife i had toasted as a demirep i retired into the country a little while to recruit both my constitution and circumstances for though i had not been very high above five years i had somehow or other run my estate a little out of breath  during my being rusticated i married an heiress with  000 l in her own hands which she put me in possession of on the day of marriage but had she not been one of the finest women in england as to person her money should never have made me trammel myself in the matrimonial tether i was always too full of spirits for a domestic sedentary life i could not bear confinement cooped up like a tame rabbit no i must run wild about the forest like a free bred buck or as lothario says like the birds great natures happy commoners  i brought my bride up to town to let the world bear witness to my happiness i showed her off at every public place she was not quite so fond of ostentation as she ought to have been i could perceive operas and routs not so infinitely agreeable to her as i could have wished them she was rather too rural in her taste for by all that is odd she whispered me in the ear only at the second masquerade we were at that she thought it very insipid superlatively simple you must suppose her to be not but now and then she was well enough in her opinion as far as an english author or as garricks acting any thing in the serious way pleased her well enough  there is something in that garricks execution excessively clever i can i believe without vanity do as many droll things as all the choice spirits put together but i dont know how it is i never could get at what he does as to the rest of the actors i was at home but he has got a sort of a knack that is past finding out and yet he seems so easy in what he does as if it was natural to him i believe in acting as well as free masonry there is a secret not to be divulged i beg pardon sir for this observation but theatrical knowledge is as useful for a man of fortune in london as classical knowledge is at the university  my wife after we had been in town about two months began though in the most tender manner to complain i absented myself too much from her wished to have a little more of my company begged me since i was so very entertaining abroad that i would indulge her now and then with my conversation at home it went against me i must confess to deny her but i had so many invitations and was so universally admired as a companion i could not help it as to pleasing ones wife or the pleasure a man can receive from her applause it was not forcible enough for one of my spirits yet i made a secret resolution although i was too much from her at present when i grew old she should have me all to herself  i have sometimes since thought that a man may have too great a quantity of spirits for i could not stay at home and i was fearful too if i had that the world would have given out i had drowned my faculties in the cawdlecup the ambition i had to be counted the cleverest fellow in england forced me to enter too much into the spirit of things i sat up too late drank too deep used rather too much ridicule and slighted the finest woman in england and all often against my inclination  but he who has a mind to gain a great name must sacrifice his private connections to the opinions of the public  my wife to wean me as she thought from what here country simplicity called dangerous habits told me that most of my friends though she would not particularize them were villains that they had at different times hinted love to her therefore begged me to be more at home if it was only to protect her from such insults for the future  but i saw through the scheme she was a good girl but a bad politician i smiled and told her politeness and sincerity were as incompatible as hudibras and algebra or common sense and much ceremony that the more men made love to my wife only proclaimed the more the goodness of my taste in fixing upon so inestimable a jewel i was conscious i told her she loved me bid her not be whimsical chucked her under the chin vowed i adored her ordered a chair and dined with lucy cooper  i must confess i believe the lady i married was not only one of the finest women in england but as good a one as ever lived i had not indeed an opportunity to discover all her good qualities but this was the character every body gave her i should not have been a stranger to her perfections had not an unlucky accident happened which deprived me from considering her in so amiable a light as i ought to have done but reflections are ridiculous few people know the value of an estate till they have made away with it  thus it happened with me sir i had not been married to her much above a twelvemonth before i lost her that was another joke carried a little too far too but a man at all times dont know where to stop when he is in high spirits  you must know sir on afternoon my wife then had just been brought to bed a week i had dined that day at tomkynss i was in high spirits and took three or four friends home with me to hum an old parson a relation of my wifes whom i had promised to spend the evening with i knew i should undergo a jobation from him but to stop his mouth sir grecian grigg and i began a sham fight in the old ones company  one of my wifes foolish maids run screaming to her mistress that i should be murdered among the drawn swords and in spite of her servants my wife was so headstrong that she would come down stairs only in her wrapper and slippers although she had not lain in above seven or eight days  we soon convinced her it was only a piece of wit and humor but to see how uneven the tempers of some ladies are though she trippd down stairs as nimble as a wench at a wake her spirits took such a turn that it was as much as all her maids could do to lift her up stairs again  she died in three days time i fancy she was piqued to be taken in so   however no man could be more afflicted at parting from his wife than i was i had lost one of the finest figures in england indeed i erected a fine monument for her and kept my room a whole week to compose her epitaph and without vanity i may say that no husband could give more unfeigned testimonies of his affection than i did in the care i took of having her memory celebrated  after her decease i found my richest and greatest friends discontinued their visits i was in repartee too severe for i never would sink my joke to save my friend no wonder then they absented themselves as they had the laugh so often against them especially now they knew the only person was gone who took their parts  i had then no other visitors but those whose circumstances made it worth their while to fill their bellies at my table though they were sure to be roasted for it i soon grew tired with those to whom i gave a dinner only because they wanted one their applauses were as insipid to me as the caresses of a wife three months after marriage i left off housekeeping took lodgings near arthurs and was balloted into the jockey club  here was a new field for game i cleared away a few acres of woodland just to make an exercising place run up a rubbing house bought a brace of brood mares got my compliment of colts and just till my own stud was risen four years old i purchased three or four capital plate horses for as i was determined to be distinguished i knew there was no doing those things by halves and to complete me for the turf i had several hints from pond how to lay my money  i began rather too late i believe for though no man ever had better horses than myself nor won more plates nor was oftener let into the secret yet damn it let them say what they will there is such a thing as uck ay and bad luck too for in about five years my estate my horses and grooms all gallopped away to the devil leaving me at a dead standstill in a spunginghouse though there i had the satisfaction to hear the baileys allow that they believed me to be one of the cleverest gentlemen in england  after i had recovered my liberty i entered into life as droll as ever i was not quite so rich though but what is money to a man of spirit i used to treat now i was treated tossed into the reckoning but i was welcome every where and every body admired my vast sprits  tom fool pray sir did not you begin to think   borlace no sir when a man of wit and humor begins to think he loses all pretensions to those titles as a beauty ceases to be a toast when she becomes a married woman besides i really lived so joyous i had no time for reflection i used to be engaged from party to party that i had no hours to myself nor indeed did i wish for any i was just like a new celebrated woman of pleasure every one wished to be in company with me   as to the woman of the town i visited all of them and knew every demirep and fresh face and as it was not in my power to be as generous to them as i had been i resolved to be useful in helping them to several rich bucks of my acquaintance who could not so conveniently have met together had i not contrived it i did it to serve my friends and looked upon it as a point of honor so did the girls for though prudes may say what they will those sort of women have more honor about them than people imagine they always received me with open arms but a man may be sick with sweetmeats i was at last in that sickly condition which the modest part of the female sex have no pity for  when i was tolerably well an old acquaintance of mine invited me down to his country seat for the summer this was a real piece of friendship i told him so when i consented to the proposal his answer was why look ye borlace you are a damned droll fellow to be sure and can keep it up as well as any man in england therefore you will be quite in character with me for as the general election is coming such a man as you among my friends is worth a thousand  away we went in tiptop spirits faith i shall not tire you with the tricks we played upon the road about our humming the parsons or frightening old women with telling them the french were landed and our fleets beat nor alarming the country towns at midnight with crying fire it was indeed one of the highest journies i ever traveled  after we had been some time keeping open house the country gentlemen came forty miles round to see and hear me i began to be so necessary to my friend for i could drink when he could not and sing he knew no songs and tell stories and he had no humor that at last he swore to me as we sat over the remains of a bowl of arrack every one else had left us it was about four oclock in the morning he swore he would settle two hundred pounds a year upon me for life and make a point of it he swore squeezing me heartily by the hand at the same time that i was the cleverest fellow in england and should live independantly  but i was out of luck for it was but next evening i gave judgment against my friend and patron that was to be about his holding a foul card he did hold it to be sure and i was half fuddled and said he did immediately he flung a bottle at my head and ordered his servants to turn me out of doors about four in the morning i was set adrift without a single penny in my pocket or knowing where to raise one  however i came to a resolution to earn the bread i should eat for the future and let it be ever so mean an employ i was resolved to seek for a livelihood there were several ways that i could maintain myself in for it is a very vulgar error to say a gentleman is not brought up to any thing  i was qualified as coachman or cockfeeder or a gamekeeper or a whipperin or a riding groom but i could not get business in any of those employments because those to whom i proffered myself objected to my being a gentleman and i had no body could give me a character at last after having put myself into a proper dress i got myself hired to make hay  in a weeks time i found a wonderful alteration in myself for the better in respect of health and quiet i fell asleep when night came without being obliged first to get drunk by way of opiate i waked next morning neither sick sorry nor ashamed by the bitter remembrance of how much like a madman i had behaved over night i soon lost a hoarseness which long had plagued me my legs fell into their proper shape my wind was mended my eyes ceased smarting my hands were steady at breakfast time my flesh grew firm and i wanted no wine and bitters to make me eat my dinner  thus i lived sir for a whole twelvemonth employed in one part or other of country business till providence conducted me to this house it was fitting up for this gentlewoman i was overseer of the workmen and since i am employed for her here we live retired we have every thing we wish for among ourselves we have seen the world and despise heartily despise its vices and follies and would not again be intoxicated with them for more than ever we were formerly worth no not all the pains and penalties of the inquisition could ever push me into the same path again  thus mr borlace entertained mr fool binding with several oaths his disapprobation of every irregularity and that it was impossible for him ever again to run into the same errors mr fool took mr borlace to be indeed reformed nay mr borlace believed himself to be so  who would not  but alas how can we pretend to know and read mankind when we are strangers to ourselves at least this was mr borlaces case for though he promised and vowed so ardently against late hours bad company and many bumpers it is not above seven to four or seven and a half to four at most but if he had the same opportunities abilities and temptations he would do the same things he had done  reader be not in wrath that our characters are not completely good either after marriage or repentance we endeavor to exhibit life not according to our wishes but observations and as we copy from nature must do as nature has done only let me beg of thee to observe the ingenious exhibitions of mr hogarth who is among painters what dean swift was among poets his performances must please thee according to the abilities thou have to be pleased  yet seldom does he present us with perfect beauties in his figures the reason is obvious like shakespeare he is one of natures agents and therefore must act according to her commissions  in the anatomical figures made by monsieur denoue which were not good enough for an english collection every part of nature is laid open he aimed not to flatter but instruct some things indeed might shock his pupils but they were truths they ought to be acquainted with  chap xxi after mr borlace had ended his story the youngest of the ladies turning to tom fool thus began here is  my father sir was a baronet his name sir philpot fool  we must leave it entirely to the readers imagination to form an ideal picture of her brothers astonishment he ran to her threw his arms about her neck and as well and fast as the joy of such a meeting would allow him to be articulate he discovered himself to her the rest of the day was spent in hearing every particular transaction of his life from his admittance into lady grottos house to his delivery from the stone pit  next morning the two ladies begged mr fools company into their dressing room as soon as they were all seated the eldest gentlewoman to prepare the brother to receive calmly a relation of his sisters distresses began by way of preamble to observe the vast force of passion how much inclination was stronger than reason and that womans will was like a whirlwind  then hinted about heat of blood prejudice of education hurry of youth deceit of mankind and all the other lamentable topics so copiously declaimed upon by those who do err and those who pretend to say they do not  tom fool interrupted the speaker by taking hold of his sisters hand and pressing it tenderly betwixt both his with the utmost affection in his face he replied my dear girl do not conceal the truth from your brother your brother is your friend my dear god forbid i should hold you hard in my esteem since i have been so culpable myself  miss ninny s history  the reason my dear brother that sir philpot took no notice of you after your being some time at school was owing to a great quarrel between him and my mama  a greyhound which was a great favorite of my papas killed her ladyships chinese pheasant my mama made the shepherds boy shoot the hound directly but the moment sir philpot heard of it he snatched her green parrot off his perch and with his own hands wrung the head off  my mama brother had a spirit becoming a woman of quality  a noble spirit indeed  she never would forgive an insult but her revenge she would have let the consequence be what it would and i own myself so much of her mind that although i have sometimes suffered for it i would show a proper resentment  ay and will though i was sure to lose my life by it  when her ladyship saw her parrot murdered she flew into the picture gallery and cut holes in all the fine paintings which when sir philpot saw he burst open her china closetdoor and broke every thing to smash in it this was a terrible stroke this my mama could not bear she fell into violent hysterics and on the instant she was able to crawl knowing you to be papas favorite she made an affidavit that you were a bastard  this action stupefied sir philpot for three or four days afterward he spoke to no body but sat in his own room like a man moped and on sunday morning it makes me shudder when i think on it papa shot himself through the head but what was the cruellest of all he carried his resentment beyond the grave for he sent a long letter to his particular friend about half an hour before he committed the fact wherein he gave his reasons for what he was about to do and begged the gentleman by their long intimacy and as he regarded the words of his dying friend that he would make that letter public and by that prove he was not lunatic when he killed himself so that his family should not inherit the estate  the gentleman to whom the letter was sent lived about twenty miles off and he and sir philpot had been schoolfellows together and no two were ever more intimate but the gentleman was generous enough to show this letter to my mama and me no body else he was a counselor at law and begged her ladyship not to be uneasy he would take care of every thing for her  how the affairs were managed i cant tell i suppose there are some particular methods in the law which when people know how to make use of they need not fear any thing at least i heard the counselor tell her ladyship so sir philpots letter instead of being published was burned and when the coroner came he was a mighty civil man and brought in a proper verdict by which we saved the estate  perhaps brother you may wonder that after my mama had got clear of those difficulties something was not done for you but really lady philpot at first would not hear a word of family affairs because as her ladyship observed they put her too much in mind of the late unhappy accident and as she was and you must remember brother a very fine woman she was surrounded with acquaintance and to dissipate her grief she was hurried into so much company that we had not a moment to ourselves or for ourselves  for really brother people of fashion have more fatiguing lives than the lower set of mortals would believe those persons of distinction i mean who are willing to appear as such for what with receiving and returning visits auction days dressing and undressing opera nights routs assemblies breakfastings plays airing in hydepark and vauxhall parties once or twice in the seasons i do assure you we are in a continual flutter of dissipations and it must therefore be expected that fine women instead of thinking about home are too much hurried to think about any thing  but now brother i am to claim the forgiveness you have promised me i shall faithfully relate matters of fact just as they happened i was barely sixteen when we appeared abroad again and lady philpot contrary to other parents was pleased to carry me every where with her but how unhappy are the young part of our sex who are shown into life unaccompanied with a proper guide our minds tainted insensibly by our intimates  i am sure however that mine was  after dinner when the ladies are withdrawn gentlemen as i have been told over their bottle often converse together very loosely our sex i assure you at sometimes are not much behind hand with yours as to the topics of their discourse only we are i fancy more delicate in our phrases  i had some very intimate acquaintances ladies who were rather older than myself but were full as sprightly and to use their own words hated prudery from them i was instructed in such things my god i have heard of people whose brains have been turned by pride one passion will intoxicate the understanding as much as another i was almost mad for enjoyment to such a pitch i had heightened my imagination  i could think talk or hear of nothing else and only the fear of being refused prevented me from asking the first man i met the question they had made me imagine it must be all elysium  a gentleman just at this time one of our neighbors in the country asked my mamas consent to pay his addresses to me upon his bare promise of marriage which i only took to save appearances i admitted him to stay all night with me in my bedchamber there i gave myself up to all those promised toys dying murmers and swimming ecstasies i had so long and so fondly fancied  but enjoyment answered not at all the idea which i had entertained of it next morning i honestly declared so to my lover  confessed to him that it was curiosity which had engaged me in intrigue that i expected to have met with more than i could express to him  but i found myself horridly disappointed it was to me the most momentary of all gratifications no sooner felt than fled  troublesome and indelicate but the pleasure of a dream in a moment vanished  my gallant seemed astonished and after he had recovered himself as brutal and gross enough to tell me in his reply i was the only woman who had ever found fault with his abilities had i been a man i could have felled him to my foot for the mean opinion he had of me i contented myself with cooly replying to him it was not the actor but the deed which i disliked and protested i never more would engage in any such affair from thenceforth for some time never thought any more about it except it was to despise those who extolled it as the ultimate of human happiness  still this gentleman persisted in my granting him the same favors as i had done i would not he grew ten times more importunate i was obliged at last to beg my mama would forbid him the house she did so and added it was done at my request this so far piqud him that he immediately related to her what had passed betwixt us and not contented with that went to the tavern and among all his acquaintance told all i had granted him  it is impossible for me to describe the rage i was in my passion was so violent it threw me into a fever but my hope of revenge contributed more than the physician to my recovery when i was just able to walk out a gentleman who lived in the next house to lady fools met me as i was taking the air he accosted me with the utmost respect spoke with much warmth against the villainies of the age we lived in particularisd the several follies his sex were guilty of and dwelt a long time on the wicked vanity of those coxcombs who as horatio said fancied raptures that they never knew and i was charmed to hear him he continued his discourse assuring me that he thought it the duty of every gentleman to vindicate injured beauty and begged my permission to be allowed my champion  by this time we had reached our house i begged he would alight and walk in with me i led him into sir philpots study and there i confessed to him that his manner of expression had wn me to think nobly of him that i was not so much irritated against the scandal as i was at the author of it this gentleman promised he would punish the villainous boaster in the most exemplary way nay he swore it upon the bible before me that evening and that evening to encourage him in his attempt i generously made him a present of my person  is it to be believed nay would it be believed that this my second possessor was an accomplice with the first but so it was this latter villain had it seems taken a fancy to me and with the help of the first laid this scheme to get me i was innocently aiding this piece of baseness every day expecting to hear of my first gallants return from london it had been agreed upon by me that his punishment should be on the very spot where he had propagated the report but he kept out of town on purpose till the other should be tired of me they carried on a strict correspondence together this i did not discover until i had been upwards of a month a slave to his desires i call it so it was so i am sure to me  mrs vielled the elderly gentlewoman  ay and so it is to most of us that i insist on  miss ninney a letter i happened to find in my room which dropped out of the confederates pocket opened the whole plot to me i was for a week almost ready for bedlam but my resolution to be revenged overcame my distraction just then mr borlace came up to acquaint mr fool there had been a horseman at the door who enquired for such a person as you are sir but continued witwoud though he described mr fool exactly and pretended to be one of his servants i have seen too much of the world ever to believe what a stranger says so i told him i knew nothing of you and he galloped away in a hurry   mr fool thanked borlace for his care yet wished he could have seen the fellow for then as he observed he must have known if he really belonged to him or was an imposter  why this it is replied borlace to overthink ones self i thought of every scheme but that and that as it happens was the only one i should have thought on but however reflection without the power of recall is like playing a game of whist at second hand  come ladies dinner is upon the table i hope mr fool will excuse this interruption  reader we hope thou will also excuse this interruption but a hackney writer as well as a hackney horse must bait now and then or he never will get to the end of his journey  chap xxii conclusion of miss ninnys history there came down at this time upon a party of pleasure with some more gentlemen a colonel of horse it was always customary for every stranger to be invited to lady fools for my mama was excessively fond of visitors this officer bore the best of characters and his behavior was so very engaging that every body courted his company lady philpot i found was very particular in her behavior to him and he seemed to tell me by eyes he had rather have half such civilities from me  both villains were now in town for the week following there was to be the races i could not sleep to think how basely i had been abused and had yet found no way to redress myself after some time deliberating i resolved to apply to the officer i just now mentioned i ingenuously related to him my whole story and begged his assistance  the two who had used me so basely were men of great fortune it was therefore not any way a lessening to his character for him to call them to an account he gave me his honor he would do it and the first day in the race week at the ordinary he forced my first lover to confess publicly that every thing which he had said of me was purely invention acknowledged himself to be a rascal and was ushered down stairs accordingly  my second gallant who had that morning in the cockpit exposed a cypress handkerchief which he took off my dressingtable but had told every body i had given it him was stealing away on tiptoe after he had been a witness to the disgrace of his friend but the colonel who had an eye upon him stepping betwixt him and the door stopped him saying at the same time to him calling him by his name and you sir who pretend to distinguish yourself by the title of a gentleman where is the trophy you have gloried in so this morning here here my dear captain replied the other and trembling held out the handkerchief to him and who says the colonel when he received it looking my gallant steadfastly in the face who gave you this favor do you say sir no no no body pon my soul colonel i found it in the assemblyroom last night that was his answer  a laugh echoed round the room and the colonel ordering the doorway to be cleared sent him out with the same orders his companion had received this news was brought home to me immediately and i hope my brother will not give me up entirely to censure if i confess i did not long hesitate how i should reward my hero i was always violent in what i resolved upon eager to indulge the resentment regardless of the future and what i once intended to gratify i was ever resolute to accomplish  mrs veilled i never knew it otherways with young persons who had passions but lord help me i have been a long while out of the world for i have lately heard a gentleman say that there are a set of very gaydressd figures of both sexes about the town now who seem entirely divested of all passions and yet they have all the marks of liveliness about them they look without expression they talk without meaning and listen without understanding they move mechanically mere machines like showimages for tailors and milliners to display their workmanship upon he called them expletives in society and compared them to weeds in blossom   miss ninny lady fool one day surpised the colonel along with me and from that time began to treat me with vast severity the counselor my mamas friend got all our estate into his hands by one means or other persuaded my mamma to sign first one parchment and then another on purpose as my lady thought to prevent me from having any share in it for it is incredible to how vast a height her hate was carried against me   the colonel was commanded into flanders where he was killed lady philpot soon after broke up housekeeping and went to the counsellors and i with a little pocketmoney went to board at my maids mothers lady philpot declared i must never presume to expect any assistance from her  i was at a small farmhouse where the good people who lived in it thought they never could do enough for me i had indeed always been very kind to their daughter so you see brother though gratitude is not to be found in fine houses it may sometimes be met with under a thatched roof i had not been in this retirement above a fortnight before their only son came to see them from london as soon as he had a sight of me he swore there was not such a fine figure upon the town i did not understand the meaning of his speech but i wished as he was a welllooking young man and talked much of the money he got and the fine company he kept my person could win so far upon him that he would make me his wife  there was nothing i hope wicked in the wish i was drove almost to despair and the only consolation i had was in now and then reflecting how justly the two villains had been punished who betrayed me after my maids brother had been in the country with us for three weeks he paid his addresses to me and proffered to marry me the time had been when such a proposal would have been answered by a horsepondducking but now what could i do oh brother if there is one state on earth more miserable than another it is that of a person of fashion fallen to decay we were lawfully married at the parish church and next week we went up to london  at first i was a little chagrind to find my spouse was only a waiter at a noted tavern in pall mall and all the noblemen he boasted of being so intimate with always when he spoke of them calling them by their christian names of dick harry tom will george and so on were his masters guests  however he hired me very genteel lodgings and took me to all public places and often urged me to dress in a more gaudy showey way than i had been used to insisting to me it was all mode but i who had really been brought up as a gentlewoman ought could soon see the difference between what was really elegant and the affectation of it continually was my spouse praising one man of title or another to me for their wealth and generosity and telling me as soon as they came to town he should bring them to see me this discourse at first i could not readily comprehend however at last i made shift to find out that he married me only to make a property of me and like the wine he bottled serve me up to some of his men of quality  in a few days he brought home a very gaydressd and very polite gentleman and left us together i am not very patient under a trifling injury but such an affront as this was much more than i could bear i burst into tears the gentleman my visitor seemed much surprised made me many apologies and took his leave of me very genteely promising me his protection  when my  i dont know what to call him came home there is not in language a name base enough to call him by who would sell his wife when he heard how coldly i had behaved to this his patron as he called him he beat me locked me into a garret fed me for a week upon only bread and water and threatened to have me confined in madhouse  but this behavior he found was lost upon me i inherited too much of my mamas temper to submit to such usage he then tried gentler methods with me at last let me live as i pleased only i was now and then obliged to bear a visit from the gentleman he first introduced to me i did neither fret inwardly or show any signs of dislike either by my behavior or conversation indeed i was determined to be revenged not only upon the wretch to whom i had given my hand but also upon this patron he i resolved should take a share in my resentment for this very person the man of great rank and consequently of great honor had been privy as i accidentally discovered to all the cruel treatment i had received from my barbarian they according to the gamesters phrase played into each others hands just to make a poor helpless woman their bubble was it not right then think you in me if i endeavored to turn the tables upon them  the person whom i have so often mentioned that professed himself so strenuously my admirer was a married man i went to his lady related my story to her and begged her protection whether in telling my story i made her or her husband look little i cannot tell but after having eyed me from head to foot before she spoke her face filled with disdain she replied that she wondered immensely at my impertinence how i dared to have the vanity to be so horribly absurd a to imagine her spouse a man of his taste would have any thing to say to such a fright to such a vulgar creature as i was and charged me never to dare to under her roof again upon pain of being committed to bridewell  how i got home i can hardly describe my limbs trembled with passion i was in such an agony my speech failed me  but luckily recollecting i had revenge in my power i soon came to myself my wretch was gone to his drawerships business i dispatched a card to the smyrna coffeehouse to the very gentleman i had just been complaining or to his lady he came immediately i told him that as he had often promised me his protection i had taken the liberty now to demand it he enquired in what manner he could best serve me i replied my husband was hateful to me as indeed he was and till i was released from such a wretch i would never let any man see my face but hide myself down in the country where it should be impossible to find me  the villain to whom i had been married was immediately sent for articles of separation were immediately drawn he was immediately obliged to sign them though he fell on his knees wrung his hands begged me for gods sake not to part from him had he behaved to me but like a man the world should not have parted us but i remembered the usage i had received from him resentment kept me silent and although it was but a mean revenge i confess i enjoyed the anxiety he endured and left him without so much as saying adieu and found myself once more a free woman in very elegantfurnishd lodgings at charing cross  i took care to let the lady who had so scornfully threatened me see by my dress and equipage that so vulgar a creature as me could be taken notice of i was resolved she should know also who it was that supported me in such splendour it was that on which i depended to complete my triumph over her as soon as she could be convinced i was maintained by her husband all her haughtiness vanished she sent her own brother to me with a proposition to this effect that if i would break off my connection with her spouse i should have an annuity of fifty pounds a year settled upon me and a hundred guineas down  the situation this gentleman described his sister to be in the happy life they had always lived before and the distractions which were like to ensue betwixt two noble families determined me to consent to a final separation nay i did more for by my means a thorough reconciliation was made between the gentleman who i had parted from and his spouse he has ever since been one of the most indulgent husbands and at his ladys desire as a testimony of her opinion of me has enlarged my annual pension to fourscore pounds a year  chap xxiii tom fool sat attentive to his sister while she related her distresses attentive as a sensible audience which follows mr garric through all the workings of lear hamlet etc etc the whole pit seem informed with one soul smile when he smiles weep when he mourns and like a fine instrument played upon by a skillful performer produces excellent harmony  thus was mr fool agitated during his sisters story after she had finished tenderly embracing her he thanked her for the good opinion she had of him in so ingenuously relating her misfortunes  than he began a fine discourse about the passions and reason and prudence and debauch at least if he did not say so the editor might do it for him but alas all selfdenial subjects are become so hacknied among mankind that those very topics which are so eloquently expatiated in the athenian porticos are at this day dismally groaned out in tottenhamcourt tabernacle  mute therefore be declamation and turn we to the dowager lady of the manor who had been silent almost all the time miss had been speaking yet like a person out out at the whisktable wishing the rubber was over  mrs veilleid bowing her head as mr fool was expressing his sentiments upon his sisters adventures begging pardon for interrupting him thus the elderly lady held forth the pleasures of life are much like the old proverb great cry and little wool i have seen many scenes of life and am sick of all i have seen unhappy women as your sister very well knows see hear and know more than most folks imagine and were we to declare all we have experienced mankind would be ashamed to look one another in the face  poets pester us with precedents of eve cleopatra and the ephesian matron we are frail very frail but what man can boast of infallibility except the pope and i dont think his opinion is held to be orthodox we are accused of ruining mankind of making men mad but i speak from experience they are mad before we have any thing to do with them mad to be with us mad while they are with us and as mad to leave us all their lives only contrary fits of madness  i once was mantaind by a person whom the world called a great man he seemed to be very fond of me but his desires were indelicate irregular and sometimes preposterous he was profuse in his expenses upon me and raving if i ever appeared what he called indifferent to his favors yet he had one of the best and one of the finest women in the world for his spouse and four as fine children all which he despised for the empty ostentation of being thought the possessor of a woman whom hundreds had had before him you see sir i am as ingenuous as your sister in my account of myself i despised him in my heart for the grossness of his taste in wasting time fortune and reputation upon me who was unworthy to be scullion to the lady he abandoned  however his money was of service to me and women of the town like any other tradespeople are not to quarrel with their best customers  i like a frontier town in time of war often changed my masters the next person who owned me was a being whom i could properly class under no character he called himself a jemmy had a very fine estate was very lavish of it in buying nicknacks altering his furniture harness post charriots and taverns jaunting with me from inn to inn leaving me no other society than the landlady or the melancholy amusement of looking through the sashes at the carriages and travelers that came in and out of the place where we happened to be he was always boasting of the many fine women he had enjoyed nor would he let a lady of quality escape him indeed he took care where he told his story it was only to the landlords family who like other dependants were obliged to be silent and seem to believe whatever their patron was pleased to tell them for my part i believe he was innocence itself for in the six months of our dawdling together i was a westal to him he conversed with me as guiltless as my brother but with his all vanity and throwing away his money he never would allow me sixpence in my pocket this i could not bear and only staid with him till i could fix upon a better chapman  i was recommended to a man of great taste that was the character given me of him very rich but very ugly as to his person women of our profession have no business to mind outsides kept mistresses have no more to do with real love than bailies have with compassion i lived with him in much splendour and great uneasiness foolishly fond of me in public and in private continually thwarting me  he was indeed as they said a man of taste but of a very odd one for as he confessed to me enjoyment was almost insipid to him all his pleasure was to be known to be well with some very celebrated lady of pleasure and has several times declared to me that he would not give sixpence to lay with the most exquisite beauty unless she was a noted prostitute he was all for public opinion but that opinion could not make me dote upon him it is true he was generous enough nay rather pressing me sometimes to take money for i am not the most mercenary of my sex but i could not like him and as he really said he proved too that enjoyment was very insipid with him nay rather fatiguing and disgustful  let those gentlemen who are pleased to make what remarks they think fit on our sex declare that a womans person is the best part of the pleasure if her mind or inclination is not at all concerned in the agreement the gallant whatever he may fancy of the feast has but an indifferent share on it i could not entirely divest myself while he lived of all acquaintance with him for after we parted at all public places he would haunt me like my shadow till i compromised affairs with him he was to allow me five guineas a weak upon condition i walked with him at ranelagh would let him drive me to epsom races call of him in a chair three mornings in the week at the smyrna slaughters and the bedford coffeehouses and once a week in the season sup with him in vauxhall gardens under the orchestra while the music played  this agreement i informed the gentleman of with whom i went next to live but he was too careless a creature i found to concern himself about our sex he told me that he kept me merely for an amusement he liked my figure and conversation but all he did for me was to please himself that a man of sense could not be jealous of a woman of the town as to my time i was very welcome to do what i would with it when he did not want me provided i was careful of my health  this strange negligence of his made a deeper impression on me than all the assiduities i had received from others could he now and then or would he now and then have behaved but commonly civil to me i should have doated on him but he was quite a hottentot he never had an amiable moment there is a time when tenderness takes place of riot and even savageness itself is softened but twas not so with him he was al hurlyburly when i have artlessly indeed expressed myself fondly something like love for a minute stealing over my senses he has interrupted my indulgence with pshah dont think to make a fool of me  hum boys and old men such as i am are not to be caught with chaff  i quitted him for a famous foxhunter the finest fellow in england so every body told me he was though a great lump of tobacco which swelled out his lower lip the first time he saluted me gave me no great opinion of his delicacy however i accepted of him and my acquaintance congratulated me upon my luck in having so accomplished a lover a man of such fine sense such he might have i believe when sober and a great many other princely qualities but i lived with him a month and he was continually fuddled i parted from himfearful of my constitution  the next day after i had left my last lover i chanced to get acquainted with one who was really a clever fellow but then he had not sixpence that i did not then mind i had enough and i resolved since for some time i had been a slave to mans various inclinations i would make one of that sex subject to mine and after so much labor resolved to have some holidays  for the first three or four days that i had this genius with me he was the most entertaining person i had ever kept company with but he soon grew out of temper he wanted to be in the wide world again not contented to be with me and have every thing elegant about him  no  he wanted a ramble regularity to him was a barbary slavery i found him too witty to have any sense there was no more fixing him than smoke yet i was so bigoted to him that i offered to sell my fine furniture retire into the country marry him and live honest i shall never forget his answer no madam he replied there is an act of parliament against monopolies you belong to the public and i have too great a regard to my country to pretend to keep that for my own use which like the new river has and ought to serve half the town besides should such a thing happen i must banish myself from my own sexs society since i never could meet too acquaintance but i must be very certain one of them at least had lain with my wife  i was mad with his refusal yet i own i admired his spirit we parted in a pett and although we both i believe wished to come together again neither of us would speak first i never after that had the least affection for mankind on the contrary they grew more and more disagreeable to me when a foolish fellow of fortune had me his behavior made me loath him when a jealous man was my master my furniture was always in danger a sot impaired my health a wit ruined me a gamester made a slave of me young fellows fretted me old men fatigued me and with a married man i was in continual alarms  i have in every stage of life found enough to make me miserable and there is not any set of beings so contradictorily titled as we are by those who call us women of pleasure like sailors we get our money in much danger and throw it away on just the same follies dresses midnight riotings hackney horses and spunging that is to say on gaudy landladies  chap xxiv that evening tom fool told his sifter the resolution he had made to leave england but this miss ninny vehemently opposed desiring her brother not to revenge himself upon himself that all rashness was ridiculous mrs veillied observed that the world was at such a pass at present that it was not worth any ones while to trouble their heads about it borlace swore that a gentleman of sense should never let passion get the better of his reason and that we ought well to weigh the consequence of every intention before we committed it to practice  this mr fool promised to do and gave his word and honor that he would not determine in a hurry on what he had to do however he observed as the next day would be sunday and as he found himself so well healed he would go to church in the morning to give thanks for his escape and recovery  mrs veilleid miss ninny and borlace looks upon one another as if they said we fear the gentlemans growing light headed they would not contradict him for fear of making him worse seemed to approve his design but hinted it was bedtime after they had seen mr fool to bed they returned to hold a consultation together they agreed nem con that his senses were not perfectly sound and yet replied mrs veilleid you see not one observation i made at supper escaped him he has certainly a deal of penetration and who could behave better than he did replied miss ninny when he commended me so for the manner in which i had related my story certainly says mr borlace mr fool is a very fine man yet he is not the first gentleman of extraordinary sense whose head has by sickness been turned awry besides consider he has only drank water tea and plain gruel ever since he came his blood must consequently be thin and poor and run cold and make him fancy strange megrims you see he began about church we must not contradict him but let him go i hope it will not make him worse though  it was unanimously agreed that witwoud though it was night should have a horse saddled immediately and set off to mr fools house and let lady fool know where her spouse was miss ninny wrote her ladyship a letter then the two gentlewomen retired to rest and botlace galloped away full of spirits  sunday morning  mr fool went into the church the instant the doors were opened he had therefore time enough to walk about according to custom and amuse himself by staring at one odd thing or another as indeed there is in most places of worship as he sauntred about he might gaze at the ceiling pore over the painted glass or read the goldletterd account of the several celebrated benefactors  imprimis how a squire left forty shillings per annum for a yearly sermon against drunkenness to be preached on the day the mayor was chose  item that his honor left thirtysix shillings per annum to the ringers for a peal to be rung on the first day of april  item how that the lady of the manor left fifty pounds to new fringe the pulpit cloth and line the family pew  item that the reverend vicar of the church left two hundred pounds to buy a new set of chased plate for the communion table and twenty pounds for two velvet cushions with gold tassels  item the same reverend gentleman left twelve shillings per annum to be divided among twentyfour poor housekeepers on christmas day  item dame ursula is wife left ten pounds per annum for ever to new gild yearly the iron rails round her tomb  there were several other benefactions equally as devout essential and charitable but mr fool took no notice of any of these things it was odd indeed but he did not so much as transcribe one epitaph to communicate it to the public for a curiosity either for the goodness of its puns or the badness of its spelling  while he was at church a religious awe filled his mind which made him solely intent upon the business he came about  oh resentful reader whether you are a polite person or a witty one despise not the hero of this history for being so horridly out of fashion as to be at church from a principle of unfeigned devotion  remember he is but a fool  thou and i and the rest of the joyous class of choice spirits have too much sense to suffer ourselves so to be imposed upon  when morningprayer was over for it was not this parishs turn to have a sermon every sunday although the living was worth above a hundred pounds per annum and held in commendam with three more pluralities by the reverend mr  prebend of  and chaplain to  yet the incumbent was so frugal in church affairs that he hired a cantab out of preferment at ten shillings per sabbath to do duty for him at all his inferior spiritualities so that the deputy was obliged to hurry over the job having no less than four more churches to read prayers and sermons at that very day  tom fool cheerfully walked through the churchyard with a mind filled with that heavenbestowd tranquillity which always accompany true devotion and as he looked on the lovely landscapes around him gratefully contemplated the wonders of creation  so much was he busied in mediation he mistook his road being a stranger to the country he walked until he came to four roads then looked round for the church he came from and resolved to make up to it again thinking from hence he could hit upon the right path but like many wiser men only took much pains to be more out of the way he grew tired and under a widebranching oak in the midst of a smoothmown grassplat he sat down the fatigue he had undergone made him drowzy and laying at his length gave himself up to the gentle indulgence of strengthrecruiting sleep fast as the aledrinking alderman who snores in his pew after dinner during sermontime  the lady of the manor had been walking that afternoon with her woman along the meadows her house was but two fields off from the spot where mr fool rested himself he could not discover it because a thick grove prevented on that side a footpassengers view when she came to the place where tom lay she was surpised her maid was dismally frightened and would have run home to call for help but she was ordered to stay curiousity just then giving the lady a twitch by the sleeve observing the sleepy person to be welldressd she walked up gently toward him and began softly to praise his figure  indeed mem as you say replied mrs pinner he is the most genteelest man i have seen out of london and yet you may see mem he as been walking a good way by the dust upon his shoes and stockings and mem what a white hand he has too and dresden ruffles on  as sure as god made the world he is a gentleman mem and mayhap misfortuneable in love for i thought as how he sighed  pray mem let me wake him for fear mayhap some vermin should bite him  her mistress was as willing as her woman to know what could bring a welldressd agreeablelooking man on foot there took a pinch of snuff and lightly let it fall upon his upper lip  he sneezd  waked  started up and beheld the lovely miss demirep standing before him  tom fool made an unaffected apology for his being there hoped he had committed no trespass told the lady he was a stranger who had lost his way and begged she would permit one of her servants to set him into the right road  mr fools countenance was open and florid the tone of his voice particularly sweet and plaintive his eyes were not broadstretchd into a rude stare but he now and then lift them up while he was speaking and his look was tender modest and sensible yet his whole deportment seemed to speak a mind in grief at least miss demirep thought so and the appearance of distress is sure to waken a delicate sympathy in female minds which to the shame of mighty man be it know all our reading cannot make us masters of nor all our writings properly describe  upon miss demireps invitation tom fool attended her to the hall where with a grace peculiar to fine women of fashion she requested he would let her know how she could give her leave to assure him that the laws of hospitality flourished under her roof  to be sure it might seem odd  but as she was above disguise herself flattered herself he was so too  perhaps she might be wrong  but she fancied he had lost something more than his way  tom fool was not so eager to relate his adventures as she was to hear them he told the lady he was a gentleman  had been hurt by false friendships and from thence took occasion to declaim on the falsehoods of mankind  miss demirep in whose heart compassion had a noble dewlling place viewed him with pity but twas a pity mixed with approbation she took part in all he said looked as he looked sighed as he sighed his mind she found was manly as his person his sentiments generous and tender his observations judicious yet without either flattery or rancour  tom who was amorous as ovid surveyed with attention the brilliancy of the ladys figure and discovered by conversing with her how elegant her mind was enriched thus by degrees the understanding the accomplishments each discovered in each raised a reciprocal esteem pleased with the entertainment they sat up together till morning and even then the day would have been unheeded by them though the sun darted his rays cross the room had not mrs pinner ventured in to beg leave to know when mem would please to have breakfast  next day mr fool sent one of miss demireps servants to his sisters to let her know where he was for tom seemed not in a hurry to quit his quarters he and the lovely miss demirep soon confessed to each other the praiseworthy opinions they had conceived as none but noble minds are capable of such undisguisd sentiments  so none but noble minds will believe this passage  but it was so  they owned a mutual  a  why should we be ashamed to relate it this performance is designed to be a history of nature of nature actuated by honest instinct  therefore with submission to all abstracted speculatists must acknowledge mr fools lovely hostess soon brought his own lady in less guilty or to come nearer common sense tom fool in the arms of miss demirep found an universal consolation  his lady indeed met with a momentary one on the arrival of mr borlace that gentleman as we have before mentioned set out in the night for foolhall as soon as he had reached it and discovered to mrs susan that he came from her master and that mr fool was in health and unhurt the whole house was overjoyed and borlace caressed in a very extraordinary manner as the messenger of glad tidings  lady fool who had until that time kept her room and whose health was visibly impaired ordered her postchariot to be got ready immediately and return with mr borlace to fling herself as she very afflictingly expressed herself at her dear husbands feet when she alighted at mars veillieds and missed of seeing her spouse she was almost distracted with the disappointment her ladyship imagining mr fool shunned her she returned home heavy at heart although miss ninny whom she took with her used every argument imaginable to comfort her  as soon as her ladyship returned home she sent for her attorney for as there was most part of the estate vested in her so as she could dispose of it without her husbands consent yet she made a will and left him whole and sole executor and it must be allowed she could not be too careful in an undertaking of such consequence for though the law is the grand elixir for englands constitution it is not amiss to be aware of counterfeits  chap xxv mr fool had been at the amiable miss demireps above a week before he had time to relate all his adventures he had often begun and often had she interrupted him either by tenderly sympathising with his distresses or bursting out into praises of his disinterestedness  at the conclusion of his story eagerly pressing him to her breast she sighed oh god what must that woman be who could wrong you  at that instant mrs pinner entering acquainted mr fool that there was a man came on horseback that had a letter which he will deliver into nobodys hands but your honors and indeed mem continued mrs pinner addressing herself to miss demirep as soon as mr fool left the room i believe as how it is from the gentlemans house for the man axt for his master  miss demirep do you mrs pinner see that the man is very well entertained but order all my servants not to ask the man any questions about the family he lives in upon any account   mrs pinner no to be sure mem   exit mrs pinner now my comates keen tenants of the upper story and fellow plagiarists here is the lovely miss demirep alone in a warm room on a soft settee her senses all in a flutter  see how she looks ay how that is the question for to be free and faithful to every good reader we secondhand copyers are seldom admitted tete a tete into a woman of fashions retiringroom we cannot therefore critically say how they look or what they converse about yet as some painters have copied madonas from their mistresses we journeymen journalizers often avail ourselves of ouracquaintance the women of the town and palm their figures dress bons mots and behavior upon the injudicious for illustrious originals  let the members of our penstumping society make as much parade as they please about high life and so forth we are as much unacquainted with it as we are with the heathen gods and goddesses that we jumble together in our jingling invocations  yet if any particular reader as some readers are very particular would be informed what color miss demireps eyes were whether her locks were fastened of fell loosely in flowing curls upon her shoulders whether she was in full dress or in dishabille if it was coffee or chocolate she had breakfasted upon how many shaking mandarins nodded upon her chimneypiece what sort of paper the room was lined with and how broad the turkey carpet was that covered the flooring they shall be informed immediately come spirit of minute description inspire me  but i am interrupted mr fool is returned with a brace of letters in his hand he very gracefully presents them to miss demirep reader we must be informed of the contents one way or other every body will satisfy their curiosity the lady has unfolded them i know it is not good manners  however well give a peep over her shoulder  letter the first dear brother we are all very much concerned at your not coming back to mrs weilleids that sunday however we are all rejoiced to hear you are well i am at present along with your spouse lady fool at your own house your lady is in a very declining way she having had two fits of apoplexy and her physicians declare that if she has another she is a dead woman therefore i beg as soon as you have read the enclosed you will set out which is all at present from your loving sister  n fool p s compliments to miss demirep     letter the second dear injured husband i conjure you to be so merciful as to return to me if it be only to close the dying eyes of your unhappy wife who was betrayed intoxicated and undone by villainy  yours till death h fool   after miss demirep had read those letters she returned them to mr fool but her hand she had not withdrawn from his in that position for some moments they stood silent tenderly looking at each other at length tom fool his eyes glissening with compassion thus addressed her  madam had not the hospitality miss demirep has shown to a poor wandering outcast bound him by the strictest ties of gratitude not to depart without first at least acknowledging the favors he had received i should not hesitate a moment obeying the purport of these advices but circumstanced as i am it is to you and you only i apply for advice what am i madam to do  miss demirep to go  to go this instant  i may be irregular but am not abandoned  i love mightly but not meanly  therefore go this instant go it is not my advice alone but my entreaty go and may your presence preserve your ladys health at the same time she spoke this checking a swelling sigh which passion in spite of reasons teeth was bursting out with then stepped forward to throw her arms about his neck and take a parting embrace  but recollecting that her caresses might detain him some minutes she checked herself and broke from him saying  no not a kiss of mine shall stop you a moment on a event like this  adieu  and immediately rushed up stairs into her dressing room   just as mr fool reached home his lady had another fit and as the faculty had fortold lived but two days after her husbands return leaving him in clear possession of full two thousand pounds per annum and several sums of ready money  as soon as the business of burial was over mr fool sent for mr borlace and with an ingenuousness peculiar to the nobleminded part of mankind told him  mr borlace providence has been pleased to favor me with a large independency therefore i look upon it as my duty to lay out the superfluity of my income in endeavoring to make those happy i think deserve it i will neither mantain racehorses to enrich grooms nor make sumptuous entertainments to cram flatterers or let my servants learn the way to profusion  no  i am beholding to that being to whom we all owe our beings and how can i testify my gratitude he stands not in need of any thing i have but i will endeavor to copy some small part of his goodness and be bountiful in my turn for rich men are or should be gods agents for him to the poor  i am not now to be told the disposition my sister and you entertain for each other  but her husband is living as soon as i can legally procure a divorce i will if i can make you happy together  as you left your affairs in london in disorder you will find in this pocketbook a sufficiency i believe to defray your creditors demands and this i would have you do immediately set out for town tomorrow morning you will excuse me mr borlace but as you have seen and suffered so much you are sufficiently weaned from the weakness of indiscretions  witwoud wanted to throw himself at mr fools feet called him his guardian angel and by several desperate oaths would have given bond for his good behavior but his friend prevented him however nothing could hinder borlace from swearing he despised debauchery coursing the madness of riot and execrating all the folly of extravagance and concluded with a very pathetic observation concerning misery and contempt  thus is the apothegm of aristotle made out man may know much of every thing in the world except himself for as it was impossible for him to be in london with money in his pocket and not be found out by his friends so it was for him when found out to avoid keeping company with them for that man of spirit would be stigmatized with the odious appellation of a damned sneaking fellow borlace therefore being a man of spirits willing to convince his friends whatever alterations he had undergone were all for the better kept it up indeed was quite the thing ad unguem as his honor and sir thomas told him shaking him heartily by the hand damn them if they would not back him for a thousand and take him against the field  as we have therefore brought him to london and left him in such good company we must return to look after our other passengers  it is time to bring this bundle of many sections to a tolerable conclusion and we will immediately to it according to the present practiced rules of memoirwriting we have taken them through pages sufficient to swell this work into two volumes and now we have nothing to do but marry them off like fleet parsons we must be expeditious in our vocation for we have many sweethearts in pairs who like countrydancing couples stand on tiptoe to be at it  in a little time after witwoud borlaces arrival in london miss ninny went up so see every thing was in proper order in the late lady fools townhouse the reader may easily guess who was shortly to be mistress of it and as soon as decency could allow it mr fool paid miss demirep a visit  ye delicate sensibilities whose minds are untainted by the insipidities of fashions multitude ye who nobly relish friendships feasts fancies flow and every beat of heart distended rapture form to yourselves the meeting betwixt such a pair as mr fool and the lovely miss demirep  all was embrace all was rapture all was admiration  when gently leading her to the lovereceiving settee he thus addressed the allattentive lady  behold me now madam possessed of an unincumberd estate of upwards of two thousand pounds a year i know the nobleness of your disposition too well not to be conscious wealth cannot win you yet such is the custom of the world i have no other way to show myself worthy of what i wish for dont be offended madam let me not by being too peremptory shock your delicacy kneeling forgive me if i too much presume  but thus i offer you my hand  to become your husband is all that i wish for to complete to fix me happy  the lady was too much astonished to bid him rise a thousand thoughts rushed by turns to her mind for above a minute she fat sat silent looking with wonder at him yet it was not an avaritious hesitation whether she should or should not take his offer  no  she was charmed  amazed  enraptured with her lovers behavior as soon as she found herself settled enough to reply this was her answer  thou pattern of true principle  i may justly glory of possessing what few ladies ever could boast of  a real lover but shall a man show such honor such gratitude to one of our sex and shall not that one return it  she will though to that honor she sacrifices happiness  i cannot sir i must not go with you to the altar  i am  i am unworthy  i love you beyond life  i would wander with you in want and bear the worlds contempt to call you mine but my own contempt i cannot endure had i only trangressd with you i could have excused it nay vindicated it to myself but to deliver my person to you in the sacred tie of wedlock when that person has been the property of others what shall i demean the man my soul doats on it would distract me to think for think i should that any man could dare to say of one so worthy as you  i have had his wife  as your mistress i will be faithful but not dishonor you as  heigh ho  perhaps i overstrain this point women like me think different from the rest of our sex we are apt to refine too much or be too regardless  this i feel now i have done never before did i look upon what the world calls innocence but as a weakness of understanding never could i have thought such anxiety would arise in the mind from only reflecting on lost reputation  dont think the worse of me sir for this confession  no lady ever gave up before me more than i  oh  god  what shall i say  i these are selfdenials well may those persons be proud who can put them in practice  tom fool but madam are we to live for the world or ourselves   miss hush for heavens sake dont be your own advocate against yourself it is a much as all my resolution can do to keep the field against inclination  and if you take its part  enter mrs pinner whose there   mrs pinner beg pardon mem  but your companys come mem and you always ordered me to let you know to a moment mem   the abrupt entrance of the domestic made this dialogue end very unsatisfactory mr fool took a turn upon the terrace and miss demirep retired for a moment into her dressing room to compose herself for the reception of her visitors  we shall name or announce them a better phrase in the manner they alighted  imprimis madam vander doit formerly the fine batilda for her dutch merchant had bought out mr israels property in her and by a license from doctorscommons made her entirely his own  secondly sir tasty handing lady pillow  third couple were young blood who ushered sir tastys lady whose maiden name was bonville and as it is mentioned in the former part of thie register the baronet was about to make her a settlement  he did so  but after some time they parted  it was just before lady grotto and sir tasty came down into the country and met junior at the inn as beforementioned  when the baronet and the innkeepers wife were in london together miss bonville hearing that sir tasty had a new mistress she threw herself in his way in a very advantageous situation appearing at ranelagh three or four times with a star and garter as her attendant squire and three or four more men of dignity crouding about her  love like a lease is often renewable and the baronet thought her tentimes more handsome than ever begged leave to wait on her inquired her address and all lace and feather next day at noontime he waited for her in her first floor  she entered the room stately as a schoolmistress he rose to salute her she drew back and gave him a look cold as a creditor he was disconcerted his face fell he saluted her hand she begged he would be seated the baronet quite amazed bowed squatted into a chair stammerd begged pardon pulled out his snuff box got up and sat down again then rose made a new apology shut up his snuff box looked through the sash wondered and slid into his chair again  miss bonville grave as a lady abbess at vespers talked about sin old age deathbeds and being virtuous sir tasty swore bit his nails quoted scraps of plays miss bonville burst out into tears  sir tasty madam by heavens you are mad and have turned methodist   miss bonville no sir you injure me but i have made a vow and that vow is registered in heaven never to hold trust or commerce more with man until those dealings are sanctified by matrimonial law   sir tasty do you expect that i should marry you child something high that faith   miss bonville no sir tasty but there is a silkmercer in fleet street to whom i have given my consent   sir tasty the devil you have so my tow hundred pounds a year is to furnish out a cits shop with silks and sattins is it  no  damme then  not to be hummd in that manner neither  i have a scheme to stop that   this scheme he put in execution the week following  it was only marrying the lady himself and that was saving his two hundred pounds a year her ladyship became in an instant a pattern of reformation  so chaste that at the very mention of a kept mistress she lifts up her hands and eyes and wonders how there can be such women  just as they were seated mr fool entd his being in mourning made him look more agreeable the assembly md to be surprised madam vander t in a whisper congratulated demrep lady tasty stared lady pillow sighed young blood swore he thought he knew the gentleman sir tasty declared  he should be loath to give offense but pon his onner he could be almost tempted to back his opinion two faces might be a like to be sure  but  he could like to have five hundred on it miss demirep to cure him of suspense i will not say she had any secret satisfaction in it undertook to be lady usher and introduced the young widower by name to all the good company  mr fool the next day received a letter from borlace that his presence was very necessary just then in london for the late lady fool had large concerns in the west indies left her by her first husband which indeed she had never much minded therefore witwoud in his advice to mr fool desired him to come up immediately observing that moneymatters in some of our colonies are not transacted by agents with that perspicuity as we could wish  his amiable hostess did not indeed press him to put off his journey she feared lady pillow who she observed had an unusual softness in her eyes just at this time and was for ever looking at tom fool his heart miss demirep had proved was all tenderness therefore she was alarmed least he might be inclined to pity at least and she knew by her own disposition wherever pity was taken in for a tenant love soon came to be a lodger there  soon after tom fool and miss demirep having handsomely acquitted herself of her visitants stepped into her postchaise for her london journey how often upon the road did she rail at tyrantcustom then curse our boasting sex then blame herself for her own delicacy  on the other side how would she sometimes congratulate herself upon her resignation her resolution her martyrdom as she termed it  he must love me for it i am conscious he must thus she pleased herself with reflecting he does he will  though i shall not have him for a husband yet as a husband he is mine he will be mine mine and only mine  but all is not gold that looks so  every reckoning is not always right  however we will so far reckon right as here to finish the chapter and the next we begin with joy the editor declares it to be  chap xxvi when tom fool came to london he found borlace had made a very had use of the sum he had been entrusted with witwoud also had been rather too premature in communicating to his companions the history of his good fortune with mr fool nay to his very great intimates he whispered that he had had miss fool and hinted something about patching up reputations and that matrimonys pill should be well sweetened  curse on that flippancy of tongue why will you ye maudlin declaimers why will ye form such midnight friendships ye mementos of indiscretion who persist spite of shame or sufferings like venombreathing serpents do discharge infection from your mouths  miss ninny had not conducted herself with the utmost circumspection during her abode in london her behavior at public places prejudiced the grave part of the world from entertaining a good opinion either of her morals or understanding it is not worth while to describe her dress or her manner at public places we see many fine ladies whose actions and appearance seem to say like the founder of the feast when dinners upon the table come gentlemen will not ye please to fall to  her brother very mildly expostulated with her and mentioned the word decency  she replied stuff but she spoke that word aside to herself he obeservd to her that no person should incur if they could help it the worlds censures  that she took very ill  did not answer him indeed but begged leave to retire and ready to burst with vexation hurried into her own apartment flung herself into an armed chair and with tears told her woman as the maid held out the lavender drops to her  hannah my brother is become a perfect tyrant that miss demirep has set him against me  but to witwoud borlace tom fool was more severe he reproved him very sharply nay was almost angry with him for so ridiculously squandring away a sum of money which as mr fool told him was the property of his creditors  witwoud who not only had a great share of spirits but had also a great spirit could ill brook to be told of his faults by one much younger than himself and who had not seen half so much of the world neither  he was mad in his mind  but had cunning enough to conceal it  he told tom fool a long story how he was made drunk he could not tell how and then indeed he did he could not tell what that he had a great many enemies and that they had raised a parcel for reports out of envy against him that for his part he was fuddled at first by the only method that could have made him so which was drinking bumpers to mr fools health  however he would not drink any more for he saw now it was a plant against him to get me sir out of your favor for i will be doubly damned before i would give so good a man as you a offense  but this concession only lasted before tom fool for the moment he left the parlour he flew to miss ninny and after giving vent to halfadozen fullmouthd oaths he declared her brother to be a meanspirited fellow what is his money to me or where would he have had any money if it had not been for me  damn it is such a man as i am to be schooled as if i was sent like a servant to market and so must give an account of every penny and twopence i tell you what ninny had he not been your brother i should have answered him in another way i assure you  miss minny indeed witwoud i am horribly chagreend my brother should behave so i cannot conceive what can make him so execrably in the wrong and must confess am undetermined how to behave in this affair   borlace but i am not and i will tell you the only thing we have to do in this affair if we dont put some stop to this your brother will always be calling us to an account for what we do and where we go now that i would not bear from the great mogul i know he loves you dearly and if you was to leave him a little it would bring him to a better way of thinking the only thing we have to do is this we must show a proper spirit of resentment   miss ninny by all means mr borlace   mr borlace very well therefore let you and i take a little journey together i can raise some money i know you shall leave a letter for him wherein you shall tell him the severity of his behavior to you has drove you away this will make him uneasy  he will do any thing to bring you back again he will send post for us but before we return well come into some agreement with him let me alone with him for that i know enough of the world to manage your brother i warrant you then we shall live just as we like and he will never find fault with us again for fear you should go away never to return   however ridiculous this scheme was miss fool whose whole life had been but a series of indiscreet attachments at once came into it nay she rejoiced to think she had an opportunity to be revenged of her brother for his scolding her on the evening that miss demirep came to town they two took post for chester  when mr fool received a card from miss demirep he was reading the mad epistle his sister had left behind her  he enclosed it in a letter to miss demirep and in which after he had related miss ninnys elopement he told her that folly and ingratitude had so much shocked his temper he was not in a condition fit for society that he was determined to retire for some time at least from the world and as he had several affairs to settle in jamaica he would go over to that island immediately  miss demirep as soon as she had read the contents flew to mr fool and made use of every argument to dissuade him from undertaking so dangerous a voyage  but as it sometimes happens when two persons of different religions dispute the argumentator who designs to make the proselyte becomes himself a convert thus mr fool brought miss demirep over to his opinion she attended him to bristol and saw him take shipping for port royal  the editor transcriber historian journalists etc etc begs leave to
