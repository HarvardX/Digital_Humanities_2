remarks on the uses of the definitive article in the greek text of the new testament  remarks on the uses of the definitive article in the greek text of the new testament containing many new proofs of

printed in the second fasciculus of the museum oxoniense a supplement to the remarks was at the same time promised to be published in the third fasciculus of the museum but as many learned friends concurred with the editor in thinking that the remarks contain a very valuable accession to the evidences of christs divinity he was unwilling to detain the supplement which exemplifies the rules of the remarks any longer from the public and has therefore prevailed on mr sharp to permit him to publish it with the remarks he earnestly recommends them both to mr wakefields most deliberate consideration  to mr sharps remarks and supplement he has subjoined a plain historical proof of the divinity of christ founded on christs own testimony of himself attested and interpreted by his living witnesses and enemies the jews  on the evidence of his trial and crucifixion and on the most explicit declarations of the apostles after the resurrection of christ what appeared to him to be a substantial and unanswerable argument he has in this little exercise on the subject endeavored to render an easy and popular proof of our saviors divinity it was printed separately for the use of the

0th june      dear sir when i look upon the date of your last obliging letter i am much ashamed that i have so long neglected to acknowledge the receipt of it the truth is i began a letter a few days afterward but recollecting that i had written on the same subject viz the use of the greek article  and copulative  to a very learned friend at a great distance in the country i was willing to wait for his answer lest it should oblige me to make any alterations in my rules and so indeed it  proved for he objected to my first rule as it was then stated and has cited several exceptions to it which  thought sufficient to set it entirely aside but this i am convinced is going too far and would be  injury to truth the use therefore which i have made of my friends objections has been to correct my rule and add to it such limitations as might include the several exceptions cited by my learned friend as well as others that are similar to them  the waiting for my friends answer and the necessary corrections in consequence of it together with a variety of other engagements has prevented me from complying with your request so soon as i could have wished but i shall now submit to your consideration and candor the rules in question and beg that you will be pleased to favor me with whatever examples may occur in the course of your reading either as exceptions to invalidate the first rule or as proofs to establish and confirm it the reasons of my recommending the first rule more particularly to your attention is because it is of much more consequence than any of the rest as it will enable us if the truth of it be admitted to correct the translation of several important texts in the present english version of the new testament in favor of a fundamental article of our church which has of late been much opposed and traduced i mean the belief that our lord jesus christ is truly god  rule i when the copulative  connects two nouns of the same case viz nouns either substantive or adjective or participles of personal description respecting office dignity affinity or connection and attributes properties or qualities good or ill if the article  or any of it is cases preceeds the first of the said nouns or participles and is not repeated before the second noun or participle the latter always relates to the same person that is expressed or described by the first noun or participle i e it denotes a further description of the first named person as   matt xii    and again    cor i   this last sentence contains two examples of the first rule see also in   cor xi     etc also in ephesians vi     also in heb iii    etc see also in   pet ii  0   etc and again in   pet iii     and again in   pet iii      also in philippians iv  0   etc in rev xvi      etc and in col ii     the distinction of persons mentioned in this sentence is praserved by the insertion of the article  before  which had been omitted before    etc and in   thef iii      this solemn ejaculation for the divine direction is addressed jointly to the god and father and to our lord jesus this text is clearly a supplication to christ for providential assistance and being addressed to him jointly with god the father most certainly amounts to supreme worship because the direction of providence belongs to god alone so that a prayer for it addressed to christ were he merely a minister or dispenser of gods providence and not also truly god would be utterly unlawful and more especially so if such an inferior dispenser of providence one that was not truly god was to be addressed jointly with the heavenly father for that would be blasphemous  so that here is good authority for offering up prayers to christ which some have lately opposed and the distinction of the persons is preserved as in the last example by again inserting the article  before  which had been omitted before  the apostle james also used the same mode of expression   etc james i    and there are at least a dozen other places viz romans xv    cor xv    gal i   ephesians v  0 col i   and    some copies have not the words  in this twelfth verse but only  in which last case this verse affords an example only of the second rule and iii      these i     these iii      these ii    james iii   rev i   wherein the god and father is mentioned exactly according to this rule and there is no exception or instance of the like mode of expression that i know of which necessarily requires a construction different from what is here laid down except the nouns be proper names or in the plural number in which cases there are many exceptions though there are not wanting examples even of plural nouns which are expressed exactly agreeable to this rule  as the examples which i have annexed to my first rule consist of texts wherein the sense is so plain that there can be no controversy concerning the particular persons to whom the several nouns are applicable it will be thought i hope that i have already cited a sufficient number of them to authenticate and justify the rule there are several other texts wherein the mode of expression is exactly similar and which therefore do necessarily require a construction agreeable to the same rule though the present english verson has unhappily rendered them in a different sense and has thereby concealed from the mere english reader many striking proofs concerning the godhead  col ii   of our lord and savior jesus christ the rules which follow are intended only to illustrate the particularity of the several sentences which fall under the first rule by showing in other sentences the different senses that are occasioned by adding omiting or repeating the article as well with the copulative as without it  rule ii a repetition of the article before the second noun if the copulative be omitted will have the same effect and power for it also denotes a further description of the same person property or thing that is expressed by the first noun as in the following examples    luke i      etc luke ii     john i     john iv      john v     john vi    this verse contains three examples  etc john xx      the apostle in this text expressly calls our lord jesus christ  the great shephard of the sheep  and the apostle peter entitles him the chief shepherd     pet v   which compare with psaim xxiii   jehovah is my shepherd and with isaiah xl    0    o zion that brings good tidings etc say unto the cities of judah behold your god behold the lord jehovah will come in mighty power and his arm shall rule for him behold his reward is with him and his work before him he i e the lord jehovah  shall feed his flock like a shepherd he shall gather the lambs with his arm etc etc to explain this still further the prophet ezekiel foretold that  all shall have one shepherd ezekiel xxxvii    and christ himself expressly acknowledged that eminent pastoral character saying i am the good shepherd  and i know my sheep and am known of mine john x    and a little further v    our lord mentions the true mark by which his flocks are known viz that of hearing his voice compare with   th psalm my sheep said our lord hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i give unto them eternal life etc which power of giving eternal life cannot be an attribute of any person that is not truly god and one with jehovah or the heavenly father as in the  0th verse he is expressly declared to be i and my father are one  we are one in which brief expression both the plurality and the unity of the two persons are unquestionably asserted  etc heb xiii  0 this sentence also contains three examples  general exception except when genitive cases depend on one another in succession as    cor iv   and again  etc colos ii    rule iii and the omission of the copulative between two or more nouns of the same case of personal description or application even without the article before the second noun will have the same effect viz will denote a further description of the same person property or thing that is expressed by the first noun as in the following examples   romans ii     0    in the modern printed editions the reading is  but in the complutensian and several of the oldest editions it is  as also in the alexandrian and other old mss as well as the ancient versions and the citations of the fathers for which see wetsteins testimony now compare this expression  with   pet ii     and also with   kings xvii    and    ye shall not fear rendered by the seventy  other gods but jehovah who brought you up out of the land of egypt etc him shall ye fear ephesians v  0    etc tit i    here the command of christ is mentioned jointly with the command of god himself which is a mode of expression never used concerning any other man but the man christ jesus our lord  by whom are all things   cor viii    hebrews i   john i   col i    and by whom all things consist col i       tim i    rule iv yet it is otherwise when the nouns are not of personal description or application for then they denote distinct things or qualities as    timothy i     timothy i   titus i   in all these three texts and in   john   there is a mannifest supplication made to christ jointly with god the father for grace mercy and peace all divine gifts the supplications therefore must necessarily be considered as acts of supreme worship to both see also   john     rule v and also when there is no article before the first noun the insertion of the copulative  before the next noun or name of the same case denotes a different person or thing from the first as in the following examples etc james i    ephesians iv    this last sentence contains four examples of the fifth rule    cor i     ephesians i   gal i   philem    ephesians vi    the supplications for grace and peace jointly from god the father and from the lord jesus christ in all these five texts last cited are so many unquestionable instances of prayer and supreme worship to christ as being a free disposer of those divine gifts jointly with his almighty father agreeable to what i have already remarked above on   thessalonians iii    and titus i     except the numerical adjective  precedes the first noun in which case the copulative  will have the same effect that it has between two nouns where only the first is preceded by the article agreeable to the first rule as  ephesians iv    rule vi and as the insertion of the copulative  between nouns of the same case without articles according to the fifth rule denotes that the second noun expresses a different person thing or quality from the preceding noun so likewise the same effect attends the copulative when each of the nouns are preceded by articles as in the following examples   john i     john ii      john xi     col ii       timothy i       pet iv     except distinct and different actions are intended to be attributed to one and the same person in which case if the sentence is not expressed agreeable to the three first rules but appears as an exception to this sixth rule or even to the fifth for this exception relates to both rules the context must explain or point out plainly the person to whom the two nouns relate as in   thessalonians iii    etc and also in john xx     if the two nouns viz  and  were the leading nominative substantives of a sentence they would express the descriptive qualities or dignities of two distinct persons according to the sixth rule but in this last text two distinct divine characters are applied to one person only for the context clearly expresses to whom the words were addressed by thomas which perspicuity in the address clearly proves likewise the futility of that gloss for which the arians and socinians contend viz that thomas could not mean that christ was his god but only uttered in his surprise a solemn exclamation or ejaculation to god the text however expressly relates that our lord first addressed himself to thomas  that is without doubt to jesus  so that both these distinct titles for they are plainly mentioned as distinct were manifestly addressed  to that one person jesus to whom thomas replied as the text expressly informs us the language is so plain when the whole context is considered that the socinian perversion of it is notorious see also   cor i      example of the exception to the fifth rule and acts ii    there are also other examples of this exception which equally prove that christ is god as  example of the exception to the sixth rule  example of the exception to the sixth rule rev i        these are the words of him whom john saw  with a two edged sword proceeding out of his mouth which was undoubtedly a representation of the  or word of god as this declaration alludes plainly to his death and resurrection  and again in the second chapter ver    example of the exception to the sixth rule and the same infallible mark of distinction is added to prove which of the divine persons is here to be understood  now though the explanation which grotius has given us of these titles  is certainly true when applied to christ yet it does not appear to be the whole truth or the full meaning that ought to be attributed to these titles either in the revelation or else where for they have a manifest reference to the supreme titles of the almighty in the first chapter and  th verse which also contains examples of this exception  and in the   d chapter   th verse where these titles  are manifestly by the context to be understood as the titles of christ we find them explained by these other titles  to which grotius has attributed a much inferior and less comprehensive meaning  and as i have shown in my tract on the law of nature etc p   0 and     that these titles  the first and the last are ancient titles of jehovah in the old testament to declare his eternal existence there can be no just reason for giving them an inferior sense when they are applied to christ who was truly jehovah as a variety of texts do demonstrate  law of nature p     to      another example of the exception to the fifth rule occurs in the rev xx     these are two different names or appellatives attributed by the explanatory words  to the same old serpent  the end of the rules the various uses of the article and copulative expressed in the five last rules and their exceptions must amply illustrate to every attentive reader the difference and particularity of those sentences which fall under the first and principal rule and therefore i may now proceed with more confidence to point out several important corrections that ought to be made in our common translation of the new testament if the several sentences which fall under the first rule be duly weighed and considered  corrections which may be fairly defended i apprehend by the authority of the several examples from which these rules were formed  examples of sentences which fall under the first rule and are improperly rendered in the english version  example i   pet i     as the article  is not repeated before the next descriptive noun  it is manifest that both the nouns are to be referred to one and the same person and therefore in order to turn it into an intelligible english phrase the proper name to which the two descriptive nouns refer ought to be placed first as by the righteousness of jesus christ our god and our savior among the various readings collected by curcellaeus it appears that in some copies the word  was not repeated after  and i have by me twenty different editions including those of erasmus stephens dr mill bengelius etc which follow that reading viz  in which case a literal rendering into english will sufficiently express the sense of the greek without transposing the proper name viz through the righteousness of our god and savior jesus christ the sense and purport however is exactly the same in both the readings and in the old english editions has generally been expressed in the terms required by my first rule viz in the righteousness that comes of our god and savior jesu christ fol edit       through the righteousness of our god and savior jesus christ   mo edit       by the righteousness of our god and savior jesus christ  to edit       the righteousness of jesus christ our god and savior margin of the folio edit      and even in the margin of our present version the proper reading is inserted of our god and savior manifestly referring both titles to one person the learned beza also remarks on the words of this text ista necesse est conjunctim legamus quia unicus est articulus ut copiosius diximus tit ii    itaque continet etiam hic locus manifestum divinitatis christi testimonium the two nouns are referred to christ also in the syriac version there seems therefore to be ample authority for my first rule  exam ii titus ii      in some few copies a comma is inserted between  and  but without authority the abovementioned note of beza upon this text is too long to be inserted here at ength and therefore i must refer you to the author himself he insists however that these two titles do not refer to two distinct persons because the article  omitted before the second in the present english version it is rendered the glorious appearing of the great god and our savior jesus christ but so great is the difference between the idiom of the greek tongue and that of the english that a literal translation will not always express the same sense without some little transposition in the order of the words and therefore though the pronoun  is placed after the two descriptive nouns that are applicable only to one person as they are expressed in the greek yet the rendering of the said pronoun in english ought to be prefixed to the said descriptive nouns in order to express the same sense in a proper english phrase as the glorious appearing of our great god and savior jesus christ this is the rendering of the learned hugh broughton according to a printed english bible corrected with a pen in my collection it might indeed be literally rendered without transposition of the pronoun viz the great god and savior of us instead of our great god and savior but the latter is more agreeable to the general mode of expressing that pronoun in english thus christ is not only entitled god but even the great god according to the plainest grammatical construction of the text and indeed if we duly weigh the evidence of his being really jehovah and one with the father  the plural verb   we are marking the plurality or distinction of more person than one as much as the noun  marks the unity of their existence he must necessarily be esteemed the great god as we believe that three persons exist in one and the same god we cannot believe any one of them to be less than god without denying the unity of the godhead and as each person is god it follows that each must be the great god theophylact bears an explicit testimony to this conclusion in his commentary on st pauls epistle to titus ii     says the learned and venerable commentator exultingly on the authority of this passage  now what becomes of their objections who degrade the dignity of the son not allowing him even the name of god let them learn from this passage that he is not only god but the great god he is called great not relatively by comparison with another inferior god but absolutely from his own native and essential greatness whitby in his note on the same passage of titus has given some very solid reasons for applying the terms  to our savior his words are here it deserves to be noted that it is highly probable that jesus christ is here styled the great god first because in the original the article is prefixed only before the great god and therefore seems to require this construction the appearance of jesus christ the great god and our savior secondly because as god the father is not said properly to appear so the word  never occurs in the new testament but when it is applied to jesus christ and some coming of his the places in which it is to be found being only these   thessalonians ii     timothy vi     tim i  0 and iv    thirdly because christ is emphatically styled our hope the hope of our glory col i     tim i   and lastly because not only all the ancient commentators on the place do so interpret this text but the antenicene fathers also hippolytus antichrist sect    speaking of the appearance of our god and savior jesus christ and clemens of alexandria ad gent p     proving christ to be both god and man our creator and the author of all our good things from these very words of st paul vid tract de vera christi deitate p       hammond also in his literal marginal version translates  thus the appearance of the glory of our great god and savior jesus christ editor  the remainder of this letter is lost the author had not ieisure to copy the original letter before he sent it to the gentleman to whom it was addressed and therefore he requested him to return it as soon as he had perused and considered it but the gentleman neglected this request and the author after several years solicitation obtained only a part of the letter as far as is here copied and the remainder which was written on a separate half sheet he has never yet been able to recover he had however a short memorandum of the several texts which were explained in the latter part of the letter and having since had favorable opportunities of examining the said texts and of copying them very accurately from the ancient alexandrian manuscript in the british museum he has been enabled to make some short remarks on the versions of all the said texts which may serve as a sufficient supplement to this imperfect letter some notes have been added to this printed copy which were not in the original letter  g s   because there is but one god g s  examples to the grammatical rules of construction etc example i acts xx      the warning of the apostle paul to the presbyters of the church of ephesus which is thus rendered in the common english version take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the holy ghost has made you overseers to feed the church of god which he has purchased with his own blood  in the alexandrian ms and a few other mss instead of  which is the most general reading the word  is substituted but many old mss have both words  whereby the text is brought within the construction of the  st rule and should be rendered  to feed the church of the lord even of god which he has purchased with his own blood  though there is no word in the greek to correspond with this word even so as that it might be deemed a literal rendering yet this english word is frequently used by our translators to express the identity of person when a copulative in the greek text joins a second substantive i e of personal description without an article to the former substantive preceded by an article agreeable to the first rule as in romans xv    and i cor xv     both of which are rendered  god even the father instead of the literal rendering the god and father that the identity of person may be the more obvious see also ii cor i    this sentence contains two successive examples of the first rule and is rendered blessed be god even the father of our lord jesus christ the father of mercies and the god of all comfort see also james iii    i these iii     ii these ii     besides these six examples wherein the word even in the english version expresses the the copulative there are also    viz   cor xi    gal i   ephesians i   and     and    0 philip iv  0 col i   and     and      i these i   and      james i      peter i   other examples of the first rule in the new testament i e altogether    examples respecting our heavenly father alone and therefore the   examples of the same mode of expression produced in this and the following pages respecting the son and holy spirit ought certainly to be rendered in a sense suitable to the same uniform rule of construction to express the identity of persons because the same mode of grammatical expression is used in them all  example no ii ephesians v      in the common english version the sentence is rendered no whoremonger etc has any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god as if two persons had been mentioned in the original text but as the part of the sentence above cited is the generally approved reading of the printed greek copies and as this reading is confirmed by the alexandrian ms and by all other greek mss of known authority it affords an unquestionable proof against the apostasy of the socinians in their denial of divine honor to our lord the christ or messiah who according to the idiom of the greek tongue is in this text expressly entitled  god though the proof does not appear in the english version let it be remarked that the two substantives of personal description  and  are joined by the copulative  and that the article  preceeds the first and that there is no article before the word  whereby according to the first rule both titles are necessarily to be applied to one and the same person and if literally rendered in english should be  has not inheritance in the kingof the christ and god but this literal rendering does not sufficiently express the necessary doctrine of the greek that the christ is also god and therefore to help the english idiom and to accommodate the rendering more strictly to the true meaning of the greek the name of jesu which is necessary to be understood might very fairly be inserted in italies or between hooks to supply the necessary sense of the greek  as in the kingdom of jesus the christ and god or else to be rendered  in the kingdom of christ even of god  as recommended in the first example  example iii philipians iii     this is rendered in our common version  for we are the circumcision which worship god in the spirit and rejoice in christ jesus and have no confidence in the flesh  in the london polyglott and many other valuable editions the reading is  but in the alexandrian ms it is  which seems to be the true reading because the other is so unusual an expression that the generality of translators have forced a construction which the context itself cannot fairly bear even if the dative case  was admitted to be the true reading unless another word the preposition  be also added to it before  as in john iv    and romans viii   where the sense which they have applied to this text was really intended but without this addition as we may fairly judge by those examples the literal rendering ought to be we are the circumcision who worship the spirit god whereas they have commonly rendered it as if the preposition  was really inserted in this text before the dative  as in the two examples before cited viz qui spiritu servimus dec or qui spiritu colimus deum or as in the syriac version qui deo servimus in spiritu fyr or as in the common english version which worship god in the spirit but there is no such preposition in the greek the difficulty therefore of rendering the common reading  without supposing this addition of en to be understood before  proves that the reading of the alexandrian ms in this text is really to be prefered  many other ancient and valuable greek mss as dr mill has restified have this reading  but augustine testified that in his time all or almost all greek copies and many latin had the reading spiritui dei plures enim codices etiam latini sic habent qui spiritui dei servimus graect autem omnes autpene omnes in nonnullis autem exemplaribus latinis invenimus non spiritui dei servimus sed spiritui deo servimus sed qui in hoc erravit et authoritati graviori cedere detrectavit etc  in wetsteins edition the word  is subjoined with this mark  to denote the preferable reading    who worship the spirit of god whereby the apostle and timothy as an example to the church at philippi assert their profession that they pay divine honor to the spirit of god and that they glory in christ  example iv    these i      this in the common english version is rendered very erroneously as if two distinct persons were mentioned viz according to the grace of our god and the lord jesus christ but if two distinct persons had really been intended to be expressed as by innumerable examples of the grammatical construction of sentences for the accurate distinction of persons peculiar to the greek tongue used in the greek testament from which the preceding rules were formed may be demonstrated the article would have been repeated according to the sixth rule after the copulative and before the second substantive  for it is manifest that the insertion of the comma in some greek copies after  is a modern interpolation because the expedient of breaking sentences into small divisions or particles by commas to preserve the necessary distinctions was not anciently used nor likely to have been used by the ancient writers of the greek tongue who were accustomed to much more accurate distinctions in their various peculiar modes of grammatical expression specified in the six preceding rules  whole sentences are indeed distinguished in the oldest greek mss by a single point placed at their end sometimes toward the top of the line sometimes in the middle and sometimes toward the bottom but apparently no distinction of time has been intended by any of these three different modes of placing the point for they are all placed indiscriminately to the most obvious and full termination of sentences and therefore we may be assured that in all these three different modes of placing them they were originally intended only as periods to conclude the sentences so that when we find them in the place of commas to distinguish merely the parts or particles of a sentence there is great reason to suspect that they have been the additions of later times  in the alexandrian ms the text before us is awkwardly divided by one of these points placed after the word  which point for the reason before given must necessarily be deemed a period and which did not exist in the original text of the sacred penman  the intention of the transcriber or interpolator by adding this point to the text for it cannot justly be attributed to the original writer has been probably to make a distinction of persons as if two persons had been named in the text instead of one in like manner as the comma is added after the word god in the english version without any authority  but the necessary grammatical construction of the whole sentence taken together detects the interpolator and demonstrates the absurdity of supposing that any such point ever existed in the original text because the words which are severed by the supposititious period cannot form a grammatical sentence according to the ordinary modes of expression used in the greek tongue by themselves alone so that the obvious sense of the context demonstrates their necessary connection with the preceding words in one entire sentence and demonstrates also at the same time the ignorance and fallacy of the interpolator who attempted to make two sentences of it by inserting a full period  if literally rendered it ought to be  according to the grace of the god and lord of us jesus christ but more in the idiom of our own language it might be justly rendered according to the grace of jesus christ our god and lord in either way the necessary doctrine of our lords divine nature manifestly intended to be expressed in the original is duly retained in the proposed version  example v   tim v     etc  this in the common english version is rendered  i charge thee before god and the lord jesus christ and the elect angels that thou observe these things etc  the word  is omitted in the alexandrian ms which however agrees in every other particular for no points whatever are inserted between the substantives so that we have the testimony even of this ms for a clear declaration that jesus is god as well as lord and after the next copulative which connects the mention of different persons according to the sixth rule the adverb  before though not expressly repeated is plainly to be understood as  i charge thee before the god and lord jesus or rather before jesus the god and lord and before the elect angels that thou observe these things thus far the testimony of the alexandrian ms but according to the commonly received text of the greek it ought to be rendered in the english idiom  i charge thee before jesus christ the god and lord and before the elect angels etc  example vi    tim iv    etc  in the common english version this is rendered i charge thee therefore before god and the lord jesus christ who shall judge the quick and the dead etc  in the greek of this text as it is commonly printed the article  is repeated before  which so far affords an excuse for the present english version in placing the comma after the word god to denote two distinct persons according to the sixth rule but in the alexandrian ms and several other old copies the article  is not repeated after the copulative before  so that the expression is exactly similar to the declaration of our lords divine nature by the same apostle in the preceding example viz i tim v    in some printed editions the word  is also omitted but in the geneva edition of    0 with scaligers notes the word  is inserted and the article  omitted whereby the title  god must necessarily be construed in such a manner that it may be clearly understood in all versions to be expressly applied to christ as it really is in the original the transcriber or interpolator of the alexandrian ms however being aware of this doctrine has endeavored to pervert it by adding a full period after the word  as  but this period is unquestionably supposititious because the words before and after the period are not two distinct sentences but obviously portions only of one entire sentence which must necessarily be construed together according to the ordinary rules of expression in the greek tongue as i have remarked on a preceding example whereby a second substantive of personal description without an article before it joined by a copulative to a preceding substantive of the like nature and in the same case with an article before it must necessarily denote a farther description of the same person expressed by the first substantive whenever there is an article before the first substantive and none before the second so that the insertion of the period in the alexandrian ms after  is utterly vain because the copulative sufficiently proves the connection of the two substantives in one clear sentence and the omission of the article before the second substantive induces the necessity of applying the same grammatical construction whereby alone the due distinction of persons is so peculiarly maintained in the greek tongue and not by points the text should therefore be rendered  i charge thee therefore before the god and lord jesus christ etc or rather to render the doctrine more obvious in the english idiom  i charge thee therefore before jesus christ the god and lord who shall judge the quick and the dead etc and thus the texts in the two last examples will perfectly accord as the uniform expressions of the same apostle asserting in both the divinity of his lord and savior by whom he had been personally summoned to bear his testimony to the gentiles as being an eye and ear witness of his glorious majesty  our socinian sadducees who have impiously entitled our lord a mere man and nothing but a man and simple human nature will not be able to digest this necessary doctrine until they humble themselves to receive instructions from the holy scriptures  example vii tit ii       the present version of these words in the english testament is  looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our savior jesus christ this text though the next in order according to the usual mode of arranging the books of the new testament has already been produced as the second example in the preceding letter i have since however examined the alexandrian ms and find that it agrees exactly with the above citation of this text except that a point has been added in the ms after the word  or  on which it is necessary to observe that the same remarks are obviously applicable to this superfluous and absurd addition of the point or period that i have made on the texts ii these i    and ii tim iv   in the fourth and sixth examples of this tract for as the proper effect and purposes of periods is to separate words into distinct sentences it is obvious that the words which follow the supposititious period in this text are incapable of a grammatical construction without reference to the preceding words connected by the copulative and therefore the note of separation a period cannot possibly have been intended by the inspired writer this testimony therefore of the sacred text in favor of the necessary doctrine of our lords divine nature ought not to be withheld from the mere english reader  i am persuaded that our modern socinians would not have made so much clamor about the necessity of a new translation had they been aware that a more close and literal rendering of the original text even in passages which had escaped their calumnious charges of corruption and their arrogant attempts at imaginary correction must necessarily cut up their favorite system by the roots  the text in question if the truth of the original be duly regarded must inevitably be rendered expecting the blessed hope and appearance of the glory of our great god and savior jesus christ  example viii ii pet i      which in the common english version is thus imperfectly rendered  through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ  this text though the eighth in order according to the proper order of the books was the first example cited in my letter and i have only to remark farther that the alexandrian ms perfectly agrees with the present common approved reading of the greek text in dr woides printed copy of the said ms there is a point inserted after the word  which is not in the ms but that is manifestly a merely accidental typographical error  the rev mr cruttwell has remarked in his useful edition of the english bible with bishop wilsons notes that the words rendered in our present version viz  of god and our savior jesus christ were rendered  of our god and savior jesus christ in the versions of wiclif coverdale mathews cranmer in the bishops bible the geneva the rhemish bibles and by doddridge westley scattergood and purver which is altogether a noble testimony of both ancient and modern times against the socinian impiety the english reader should undoubtedly be informed of the true meaning of these words in a proper english idiom as  through the righteousness of jesus christ our god and savior  which is agreeable to a literal rendering into latin by the late learned dr thomas mangey prebendary of durham viz  jesu christi dei et servatoris nostri  example ix jude iv    this in the common english version is imperfectly rendered  and denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ  i made a transcript of this text several years ago from the alexandrian ms which i copied or rather drew letter by letter in size and shape as exactly as the eye could discern in this transcript the word  is omitted as in the ms but i did not at that time perceive that there was any point or mark after the word  and i was therefore much surprised afterward in comparing the said transcript with the elegant edition of my late very worthy and respectable friend the rev dr woide who printed a copy of the new testament from the alexandrian ms with new types in imitation of the letters of the ms to find that he had inserted a point in his new edition after the word  i was very consident that i could not discern any such point when i examined the ms and yet as i entertained the highest respect and esteem for the veracity and accuracy of dr woide of which he was indeed truly worthy it was necessary to have this matter properly explained and i was rendered perfectly aware by dr velthusens account of his examining an ancient ms that the feint lines and marks in the very old mss are liable to bear different appearances according to the different degrees of light in which they are seen  i therefore took the first opportunity afterward of going once more to examine the ms and on a more close inspection i perceived indeed the feint mark which occasioned dr woides insertion of the period in his edition but being afterward assisted by the worthy librarian the rev mr harper in a still more attentive and accurate examination of the mark with a magnifying glass i was satisfied that it had not been intended for a period but only for a short line of connection because it is nearly three times as long as it is broad  but if any person from the authority of dr woides edition should be still inclined to suppose that it is really a point i must request them carefully to consider what i have before remarked on the fourth sixth and seventh examples in this tract respecting the addition of points in greek manuicripts and also concerning the more accurate modes of grammatical distinction in the greek tongue which rendered the smalier points or particles of time such as semicolons and commas absolutely unnecessary in the greek scripture and in addition thereto let him observe particularly on the text before us that a point in that place after  in the middle of the sentence between the accusative noun and verb is utterly inconsutent with grammar and common sense and though the word  has been omitted in the alexandrian ms perhaps for the same reason that some men would wish to prove the insertion of the point after  yet happily neither of these alterations would at all affect or injure the manifest testimony of the apostle jude to christs almighty power and divinity for  the only potentate and lord of us jesus christ is equivalent to a full declaration of christs divinity as well as of his almighty power and with respect to the insertion of the supposed point they must perceive if they duly consider the text that the words  and  cannot consistently with the necessary grammatical sense of the greek and the usual modes of expression or idiom of that language be separated either by points or construction so as to be applied to two different persons because the article is not repeated after the copulative before  so that christ alone was unquestionably that  only potentate or sovereign lord who was denied by the lascivious persons against whom the apostle jude bore testimony of their reprobacy and of their having denied the lord who had redeemed them dr hammonds rendering of the text before us may therefore be conscientiously maintained viz and our only master god and lord jesus christ making says he  those three the several attributes of jesus christ but as the doctor has been pleased to add that  this interpretation proceeds upon that way of punctuation which is ordinarily retained in our copies there being no comma after  i am obliged to protest against that reason for the other reasons already given and to insist that the grammatical construction of the greek text is of itself our sufficient and best warrant to justify that literal rendering  but the applying to christ this supreme title  the only potentate god and also in a former text the supreme title of  the great god may perhaps induce some persons to conceive that this grammatical system of construction if admitted as a rule for all texts in which the same mode of expression renders it applicable will sometimes prove rather too much and may be liable to favor a modern sect of unitarians who have adopted the sabellian notions of the late baron swedenborg and who assert that  jesus christ is the only god that is they understand this in so peculiar a sense that they do not seem properly to acknowledge the personality of the holy spirit any more than a very opposite sect of unitartans do the modern socinians who impiously assert in the opposite extreme to that the of swedenborgians that jesus christ was a mere man and nothing but a man according to one of their teachers and  simple human nature according to another and some of them have even presumed to charge the members of the church of england with idolatry this unjust charge of idolatry against the unquestionable principles of the ancient catholic church prosessed by the church of england affords a notable skreen to the latin church by indiscriminately confounding all the due distinctions whereby a charge of idolatry is applicable and this should teach us to be aware of what we should have to expect on the removal of all tests and restraints from such indiscriminate teachers and likewise from all other sectaries as much as from the pontifical hierarchy seated on the throne of the dragon who do not regulate their faith and practice by the plain doctrines of the holy scriptures for indeed no man is justly entitled to have a vote or share in the legislature of this or of any other christian nation unless he at least prosesses to regulate his principles of action by the two first foundations of english law viz natural and revealed religion to which as being two witnesses of god universal obedience is due so that no statute of parliament can be valid nor any other law custom or practice sufferable if it be at all inconsistent with either of these two indispensible foundations for without these men retain indeed the form but not the dignity of man because they are subject to the impulse of spirits immical to the nature of man and are thereby liable to be rendered in disposition and practice the most noxious of beasts even  a generation of vipers and therefore the knowledge of our own nature and of the principles of action in man what they are and what they ought to be which by the scriptures alone is revealed to us is the first and most essential branch of philosaphy whatsoever our modern skeptical philosophers may think to the contrary for how should men be on their guard against invisible enemies of whose very existence they are ignorant  but by the holy scriptures we are informed that  the prince of the power of the air works in the children of disobedience  and certainly wherever this satanical inspiration manifestly takes place among men their descriptive title cannot be more accurately expressed than in the terms which our lord himself as well as john the baptist before him applied to the haughty scepticks whom they opposed  a generation of vipers matthew xii    and  serpents matthew xxiii    expressly alluding thereby to the satanical inspiration by which they became the children or generation of the old serpent as our lord plainly warned them at another time  ye are of your father the devil  and the lusts of your father ye will do  he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth etc men therefore who will not be limited by the two first foundations of english law are unworthy to b admitted to an equal participation of civil rights in any free christian state whatever because true liberty cannot be maintained without that perfection of law which arises only from these indispensible rules of action  they are indispensible because we can have no hope that our constitutional establishment of natural and religious rights to the glory of god peace on earth and good will toward men can possibly be maintained if such persons are admitted to a share of legistative authority who do not acknowledge the only foundations on which alone that happy constitution is built   because they pay the divine honor that is due to their lord and savior and to the holy spirit their  other comforter  so that both these sects of prosessed unitarians as well as their unitarian brethern the mahometans are by mistaken notions of the divine unity seduced from perceiving and acknowledging the declarations throughout the holy scriptures of the unquestionable existence of three divine persons in one only divine nature or godhead the old arians though their sect was probably represented by that  fallen star which opened the  bottomess lpit for the emission of the armed locusts of the arabian heresy more strictly unitarians than themselves since i wrote the above remark respecting the mahometans and arians a more striking accomplishment of the prophecy respecting the fallen star that opened the bottomless pit has occurred to me in the character of nestorius archbishop of constantinople and metropolitan of the greek church whose doctrine was in effect still more unitarian than that of arius for the consequences of his denying the miraculous birth of our lord and asserting that  christ born of the virgin mary was not the son of god must necessarily be that he was  a mere man and  nothing but a man according to the openly declared notions of our modern socinians which in this point is strictly mohammedan with this false and antichristian doctrine the third part of the rivers and fountains of waters viz the sources of the nations and the people of the greek empire the third great monarchy was embittered and prepared for the scorpionlike scourge of mohammedan tyranny  on account of this blasphemous doctrine nestorius was deposed by the judgment of a great counsel of his peers the christian bishops from his dignity as archbishop of the greatest city at that time in christendom and from being metropolitan as it were of the greek empire the third great monarchy and therefore he might truly be said to have fallen from the highest elevation of ecclesiastical dignity so that no prophetical type could more amply prefigure this rejection than  the falling of a flar from heaven  the heaven or firmament of the then amply established episcopal authority throughout the roman empire and the unitarian doctrine of this fallen star i mean unitarian in the mohammedan and socinian sense of that term seems also to have been the very key whereby the bottomlels pit was opened to let out the noxious and diabolical vapor of mahometanism for it is really the leading and first inculcated tenet in all the public professions of that baneful heresy and it is remarkable that a nestorian monk sergius professing the same blasphemous doctrine this  key of the bottomless pit forged by nestorius should actually have been an assistant to mahomet in producing his pretended revelations and it is still more remarkable that all the scorpionlike scourges of the mohammedan conquest first lawless tyranny and the suppression of all popular rights secondly robbery and war notoriously sanctioned or authorized by this pretended religion against all nations and people that do not receive their doctrine and thirdly the fatal renewal of the old pagan oppressions of slaveholding and slavedealing such diabolical enormities may surely be compared to the dark exhalations of  the bottomless pit and therefore our english promoters of slaveholding and slavedealing who have carried these mohammedan oppressions to a greater excess even than the mahometans themselves have ample reason to dread the approaching time of divine retribution when god will  destroy the destroyers of the earth and shall cause those that now  lead into captivity and surely likewise all their abettors  to be led into captivity which had been happily extinguished by the general influence of christian benevolence should have completely pervaded all those eastern and southern regions of the third empire wherever the doctrines of nestorius had been previously adopted and had embittered the rivers and fountains of the waters to prepare them for this signal retribution justly due to such antichristian apostates who deny the true rock on which the catholic church is built viz that jesus is the christ the son of the living god or as st john has expressed the peculiar sonship or filiation of christ viz  the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father john i    compare with ver    and chap iii    and     all the arguments produced by the learned vitringa to prove that arius was the fallen star are certainly much more applicable to nestorius as being an archbishop and metropolitan of the empire and therefore more fitly prefigured by a star and that the smoke from  the bottomless pit which was let out by this fallen star was really the mist or diabolical darkness of mahometanism seems to have been very fairly proved by our learned countryman joseph mede    allowed indeed that christ was god yet they supposed him to be so in an inferior degree by which they unwarily acknowledged a superior god and an inferior god i e more gods than one contrary to the true unitarian doctrine of the primitive churches which always held and asserted the unity of god like the church of england to this day as much as they held it necessary to acknowledge the three divine persons both of which doctrines are inevitable and indispensible while we profess to regulate our faith by the testimonies of the holy scriptures as handed down to us without presuming to exercise the socinian expedient of lopping off or altering as a supposed corruption or interpolation every text of scripture that opposes the system or set of notions that we happen to have adopted and therefore the true unitarian christian who acknowledges but one god  one jehovah  one divine nature  or godhead and at the same time nevertheless is convinced that three divine persons are really revealed to us under the title of jehovah i need not here recite the proofs of these assertions because i have already produced a great variety of examples collected from the old as well as the new testament in my tract on the  law of nature and principles of action in man from p     to p  0  in the old testament and under the title of   or god in the new testament and that the supreme attributes of the divine nature are applied to each in both testaments will of course be aware also that each of these divine persons must necessarily be  the great god and  the only potentate as there is but  one god  one only supreme power or godhead  so that the effect of my grammatical rule when applied to the two particular texts before mentioned viz tit ii    and jude iv will not in the opinion of such true christians seem to exceed the truth especially when compared with the concurrent reasons and testimonies quoted in the note p  0 editor   though the apostle paul asserted to the colossians ii   concerning christ that  in him dwells all the fullness of the godhead  bodily    a term of indisputable personality yet surely this was without the least disparagement to the supreme divinity of the almighty father and of the holy spirit because they are also necessarily included in the same  or godhead as there is but one god and therefore as  it pleased all fuiness to dwell in the person of our lord jesus col i    we may more easily comprehend why he required  that all men should honor the son even as they honor the father that is undoubtedly with supreme honor  even as or according as  they honor the father and our lord said expressly  he that honors not the son that is according to the measure before declared  even as they honor or ought to honor the father honors not the father which has sent him john v    and he also claimed expressly to be glorified with the father himself  and now o father said he glorify thou me with thine owngelf with the glory which i had with thee before the world was john xvii   thereby asserting both his preexistence and supreme dignity christians therefore who humbly receive these and the many other revelations of christs divinity have the less difficulty in acknowledging the doctrines of the ancient catholic churches and the declarations of our creeds but let all other men likewise who profess to believe in the name of christ earnestly enquire in the first place as the first means of progress to the true faith whether they are really willing for this is given is the true proof of faith   to conform themselves to the will of god as revealed in all the most obvious declarations and injunctions of holy scripture and more particularly to the purity which is expressly called  the will of god viz the sanctification of their bodies for this is the will of god even your sanctification that ye should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor noth the lust of concupiscence even as the gentiles which known  god that no one should go beyond or defraud his brother etc i these iv     which cannot otherwise be capable of becoming  temples of the holy ghost an indispensible state both of body and mind for all christians to maintain for in that case they may assuredly rely on gods absolute promise through christ that  if any one shall be willing to do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak said our lord from myself john vii     deo soli gloria a plain matteroffact argument for the divinity of christ question for what end did christ come into the world  a christ was manifested in the flesh that is was made man  to die for the sins of mankind  to destroy the works of the devil  to redeem us from all iniquity and to purity unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works   cor xv      john iii    tit ii     q where was christ before he came into this world and was manifested in the flesh  a he was in heaven he came down from heaven he was with god his father before the world was before the foundation of the world he was in the bosom of his father and in his fathers glory john iii    vi       i   xvii       q how was his manifestation in the flesh made known to the world  a by the message of an angel to mary his mother to joseph and to certain shepherds  q under what name was be made known  a he was called jesus a savior the son of god the son of the highest  q who was the mother of jesus  a the virgin mary  q was any prophesy fulfilled by the birth of jesus christ  a yes all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us matt i       isaiah vii     q what was christ put to death for  a for blasphemy as the jews thought it in calling himself the son of god  q in what did the jews say the blasphemy consisted  a in this that he being as they supposed a mere man called god his own father thereby declaring himself to be equal with god and to be god john v    x     q what did christ ever say of himself which implied that he was god  a he said that he was one with god and partook of the glory of god before the world was that is from all eternity  catechist repeat the passage in which this is said  a and now o father glorify thou me with thine ownself with the glory which i had with thee before the world was john xvii    q what did christ ever say of himself which implied that he was equal with god  a he said that he and his father are one that the father has given all things into his power that what things soever the father does these also does the son likewise that the father has committed all judgment to the son that all men should honor the son even as they honor the father john x  0  iii     v     v     q who were the first witnesses in christs time in proof of christs divinity  a his enemies the unbelieving jews both the people and their rulers  q do you call the unbelieving jews prior witnesses to the apostles  a yes because this great truth the divinty of christ was hid from the apostles as well as the rest of their countrymen till after christs resurrection from the dead christ first asserted himself to be god by calling god his father and himself the son of god in a sense which implied that he was equal with god and was god for so even his unbelieving hearers understood it  the jews condemned him to death for it  the apostles preached it  q as christ knew that this was the sense in which the jews understood his testimony of himself when they first charged him with blasphemy for it did he at his trial attempt to deny the charge  a no he admitted the charge and confirmed it and died for it and appealed to the day of judgment as their future proof of it  catechist repeat the passage  a when the high priest asked him and said unto him art thou the christ the son of the blessed jesus said i am and as a proof of it ye shall at the last day see me the son of man fitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven mark xiv        q if christ had not been the messiah the son of god in the sense in which they understood him would he not have undeceived them  a if jesus christ had not been the messiah the son of god in the sense in which the jews understood him he would have undeceived them to save his own life and to free them from a very great delusion  q but jesus christ was put to death for calling himself the son of god what then do you conclude  a i conclude that jesus christ really was what they charged him with calling himself the son of god and in the sense in which they understood him that is that he was equal with god and was god  q you say that in the lifetime of christ the apostles appeared not to know that christ was god what was their opinion after he rose from the dead  a convinced by his resurrection from the dead according to his promise that he would raise himself from the dead they believed him to be their lord and there god  the word made flesh god manifested in the flesh in whom dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily emmanuel or god with us  the creator and upholder of all things who in the beginning of all things was with god and was god  the true god and eternal life and over all god blessed for ever john xx     john i      timothy iii    coi ii   matt i     john i   heb i   john i      john v  0 romans ix   whatever difficulty may be found in the various readings of any of these passages it must vanish like a mist in the full light of their united evidence to them we may confidently add the very important testimonies which in the preceding remarks and examples mr sharp has most happily recovered from the erroneous constructions of the common version   q now tell me in few words what you collect from christs testimony of himself as attested by the jews of his own time condemned by the rulers but universally propagated by the apostles  a the conclusion to be drawn from it is that christ the son of god is one with god and equal with god and is god christ asserted it the jews condemned him to die for it he sealed his testimony with his blood the apostles convinced by his resurrection from the dead believed it and preached it and died for it  catechist the jews then put christ to death as an impostor and blasphemer and yet christians have believed in him and worshipped him as the son of god for almost eighteen hundred years how do you account for this  a it was in the decrees of god that christ should die for the sins of mankind if the jews had believed him to be the son of god they would not have put him to death  if he had not been put to death as he was he would not have borne our sins in his own body on the cross that is he would not have died for our sins the end for which he came into the world  he would not have given that great and inestimable proof of the truth of scripture and of his own promises which he did by rising from the dead  and the apostles would not have given that sure evidence of their own belief in christ the ground and confirmation of ours which they did by dying for their crucified lord and master  finis
