the lucubrations of isaac bickerstaff esquire  revised and corrected by the author  vol i   homer london printed by john nutt and sold by john morphew near stationers hall mdccxii  to mr maynwaring sir the state of conversation and business in this town having been long perplexed with pretenders in both kinds in order to open mens eyes against such abuses it appeared no unprofitable undertaking to publish a paper which should observe upon the manners of the pleasurable as well as the busy part of mankind to make this generally read it seemed the most proper method to form it by way of a letter of intelligence consisting of such parts as might gratify the curiosity of persons of all conditions and of each sex but a work of this nature requiring time to grow into the notice of the world it happened very luckily that a little before i had resolved upon this design a gentleman had written predictions and two or three other pieces in my name which had rendered it famous through all parts of europe and by an inimitable spirit and humor raised it to as high a pitch of reputation as it could possibly arrive at  by this good fortune the name of isaac bickerstaff gained an audience of all who had any taste of wit and the addition of the ordinary occurrences of common journals of news brought in a multitude of other readers i could not i confess long keep up the opinion of the town that these lucubrations were written by the same hand with the first works which were published under my name but before i lost the participation of that authors fame i had already found the advantage of his authority to which i owe the sudden acceptance which my labors met with in the world  the general purpose of this paper is to expose the false arts of life to pull off the disguises of cunning vanity and affectation and to recommend a general simplicity in our dress our discourse and our behavior no man has a better judgment for the discovery or a nobler spirit for the contempt of all imposture than your self which qualities render you the most proper patron for the author of these essays in the general the design however executed has meet with so great success that there is hardly a name now eminent among us for power wit beauty valor or wisdom which is not subscribed for the encouragement of the two volumes in octavo on a royal or medium paper this is indeed an honor for which it is impossible to express a suitable gratitude and there is nothing could be an addition to the pleasure i take in it but the reflection that it gives me the most conspicuous occasion i can ever have of subscribing my self  sir your most obliged most obedient and most humble servant isaac bickerstaff  no   the tatler by isaac bickerstaff esquire quicquid agunt homines uostri farrago libelli  tuesday april      0  though the other papers which are published for the use of the good people of england have certainly very wholesome effects and are laudable in their particular kinds they do not seem to come up to the main design of such narrations which i humbly presume should be principally intended for the use of politic persons who are so publickspirited as to neglect their own affairs to look into transactions of state now these gentlemen for the most part being persons of strong zeal and weak intellects it is both a charitable and necessary work to offer something whereby such worthy and wellaffected members of the commonwealth may be instructed after their reading what to think which shall be the end and purpose of this my paper wherein i shall from time to time report and consider all matters of what kind soever that shall occur to me and publish such my advices and reflections every tuesday thursday and saturday in the week for the convenience of the post i resolved also to have something which may be of entertainment to the fair sex in honor of whom i have taken the title of this paper i therefore earnestly desire all persons without distinction to take it in for the present gratis and hereafter at the price of one penny forbidding all hawkers to take more for it at their peril and i desire all persons to consider that i am at a very great charge for proper materials for this work as well as that before i resolved upon it i had settled a correspondence in all parts of the known and knowing world and forasmuch as this globe is not trodden upon by mere drudges of business only but that men of spirit and genius are justly to be esteemed as considerable agents in it we shall not upon a dearth of news present you with musty foreign edicts or dull proclamations but shall divide our relation of the passages which occur in action or discourse throughout this town as well as elsewhere under such dates of places as may prepare you for the matter you are to expect in the following manner  all accounts of gallantry pleasure and entertainment shall be under the article of whites chocolatehouse poetry under that of wills coffeehouse learning under the title of grecian foreign and domestic news you will have from st jamess coffeehouse and what else i have to offer on any other subject shall be dated from my own apartment  i once more desire my reader to consider that as i cannot keep an ingenious man to go daily to wills under twopence each day mereby for his charges to whites under sixpence nor to the grecian without allowing him some plain spanish to be as able as others at the learned table and that a good observer cannot speak with even kidney at st jamess without clean linen i say these considerations will i hope make all persons willing to comply with my humble request when my gratis stock is exhausted of a penny apiece especially since they are sure of some proper amusement and that it is impossible for me to want means to entertain em having besides the force of my own parts the power of divination and that i can by casting a figure tell you all that will happen before it comes to pass  but this last faculty i shall use very sparingly and speak but of few things till they are passed for fear of divulging matters which may offend our superiors  whites chocolatehouse april   the deplorable condition of a very pretty gentleman who walks here at the hours when men of quality first appear is what is very much lamented his history is that on the  th of september   0  being in his one and twentieth year he was washing his teeth at a tavern window in pall mall when a fine equipage passed by and in it a young lady who looked up at him away goes the coach and the young gentleman pulled off his nightcap and instead of rubbing his gums as he ought to do out of the window till about four a clock sits him down and spoke not a word till twelve at night after which he began to enquire if any body knew the lady  the company asked what lady but he said no more till they broke up at six in the morning all the ensuing winter he went from church to church every sunday and from playhouse to playhouse every night in the week but could never find the original of the picture which dwelt in his bosom in a word his attention to any thing but his passion was utterly gone he has lost all the money he ever played for and been confuted in every argument he has entered upon since the moment he first saw her he is of a noble family has naturally a very good air and is of a frank honest temper but this passion has so extremely mauled him that his features are set and uninformed and his whole visage is deadend by a long absence of thought he never appears in any alacrity but when raised by wine at which time he is sure to come hither and throw away a great deal of wit on fellows who have no sense further than just to observe that our poor lover has most understanding when he is drunk and is least in his senses when he is sober  wills coffeehouse april   on thursday last was acted for the benefit of mr betterton the celebrated comedy called love for love those excellent players mrs barry mrs bracegirdle and mr dogget though not at present concerned in the house acted on that occasion there has not b en known so great a concourse of persons of distinction as at that time the stage it self was covered with gentlemen and ladies and when the curtain was drawn it discovered even there a very splendid audience this unusual encouragement which was given to a play for the advantage of so great an actor gives an undeniable instance that the true relish for manly entertainments and rational pleasures is not wholly lost all the parts were acted to perfection the actors were careful of their carriage and no one was guilty of the affection to insert witticisms of his own but a due respect was had to the audience for encouraging this accomplished player it is not now doubted but plays will revive and take their usual place in the opinion of persons of wit and merit notwithstanding their late apostasy in favor of dress and sound this place is very much altered since mr dryden frequented it where you used to see songs epigrams and satyrs in the hands of every man you met you have now only a pack of cards and instead of the cavils about the turn of the expression the elegance of the style and the like the learned now dispute only about the truth of the game but however the company is altered all have shown a great respect for mr betterton and the very gaming part of this house have been so much touched with a sense of the uncertainty of humane affairs which alter with themselves every moment that in this gentleman they pitied mark anthony of rome hamlet of denmark mithridatus of pontus theodosius of greece and henry the eighth of england it is well known he has been in the condition of each of those illustrious personages for several hours together and behaved himself in those high stations in all the changes of the scene with suitable dignity for these reasons we intend to repeat this favor to him on a proper occasion lest he who can instruct us so well in personating feigned sorrows should be lost to us by suffering under real ones the town is at present in very great expectation of seeing a comedy now in rehearsal which is the   th production of my honored friend mr thomas durfey who besides his great abilities in the dramatick has a peculiar talent in the lyrick way of writing and that with a manner wholly new and unknown to the ancient greeks and romans wherein he is but faintly imitated in the translations of the modern italian operas  st jamess coffeehouse april    letters from the hague of the   th say that major general cadogan was gone to brussels with orders to disperse proper instructions for assembling the whole force of the allies in flanders in the beginning of the next month the late offers concerning peace were made in the style of persons who think themselves upon equal terms but the allies have so just a sense of their present advantages that they will not admit of a treaty except france offers what is more suitable to her present condition at the same time we make preparations as if we were alarmed by a greater force than that which we are carrying into the field thus this point seems now to be argued sword in hand this was what a great general alluded to when being asked the names of those who were to be plenipotentiaries for the ensusuing peace answered with a serious air there are about an hundred thousand of us mr kidney who has the ear of the greatest politicians that come hither tells me there is a mail come in to day with letters dated hague april    n s which say a design of bringing part of our troops into the field at the latter end of this month is now altered to a resolution of marching toward the camp about the  0th of the next there happened the other day in the road of scheveling an engagement between a privateer of zealand and one of dunkirk the dunkirker carrying    pieces of cannon was taken and brought into the texel it is said the courier of monsieur rouille is returned to him from the court of france monsieur vendoe being reinstated in the favor of the duchess of burgundy is to command in flanders  mr kidney added that there were letters of the   th from ghent which give an account that the enemy had formed a design to surprise two battalions of the allies which lay at alost but those battalions received advice of their march and retired to dendermond lieutenant general wood appeared on this occasion at the head of  000 foot and  000 horse upon which the enemy withdrew without making any further attempt  from my own apartment i am sorry i am obliged to trouble the public with so much discourse upon a matter which i at the very first mentioned as a trifle viz the death of mr partridge under whose name there is an almanac come out for the year   0  in one page of which it is asserted by the said john partridge that he is still living and not only so but that he was also living some time before and even at the instant when i writ of his death i have in another place and in a paper by it self sufficiently convinced this man that he is dead and if he has any shame i dont doubt but that by this time he owns it to all his acquaintance for though the legs and arms and whole body of that man may still appear and perform their animal functions yet since as i have elsewhere observed his art is gone the man is gone i am as i said concerned that this little matter should make so much noise but since i am engaged i take my self obliged in honor to go on in my lucubrations and by the help of these arts of which i am master as well as my skill in astrological speculations i shall as i see occasion proceed to confute other dead men who pretend to be in being that they are actually deceased i therefore give all men fair warning to mend their manners for i shall from time to time print bills of mortality and i beg pardon of all such who shall be named therein if they who are good for nothing shall find themselves in the number of the deceased  the tatler no   from tuesd april    to thursd april      0  wills coffeehouse april    there has lain all this evening on the table the following poem the subject of it being matter very useful for families i thought it deserved to be considered and made more public the turn the poet gives it is very happy but the foundation is from a real accident which happened among my acquaintance a young gentleman of a great estate fell desperately in love with a great beauty of very high quality but as illnatured as long flattery and an habitual self will could make her however my young spark ventures upon her like a man of quality without being acquainted with her or having ever saluted her till it was a crime to kiss any woman else beauty is a thing which palls with possession and the charms of this lady soon wanted the support of good humor and complaisancy of manners upon this my spark flies to the bottle for relief from his satiety she disdains him for being tired with that for which all men envied him and he never came home but it was  was there no sot that would stay longer would any man living but you did i leave all the world for this usage to which he  madam split me you are very impertinent in a word this match was wedlock in its most terrible appearances she at last weary of railing to no purpose applies to a good uncle who gives her a bottle of water the virtue of this powerful liquor said he is such that if the woman you marry proves a scold which it seems my dear niece is your misfortune as it was your good mothers before you let her hold six spoonfuls in her mouth for a full half hour after you come home  but i find i am not in humor for telling a tale and nothing in nature is so ungrateful as storytelling against the grain therefore take it as the author has given it you  the medecin a tale  for the ladies miss molly a famed toast was fair and young had wealth and charms  but then she had a tongue from morn to night the eternal larum run which often lost those hearts her eyes had won sir john was smitten and confessed his flame sighed out the usual time then wed the dame possessed he thought of every joy of life but his dear molly proved a very wife excess of fondness did in time decline madam loved money and the knight loved wine from whence some petty discords would arise as youre a fool  and you are mighty wife though he and all the world allowed her wit her voice was shrill and rather loud than sweet when she began  for hat and sword he would call then after a faint kiss  cry by dear moll supper and friends expect me at the rose and what sir john you will get your usual dose go stink of smoke and guzzle nasty wine sure never virtuous love was used like mine often as the watchful bellman marched his round at a fresh bottle gay sir john he found by four the knight would get his business done and only then reeled off because alone full well he knew the dreadful storm to come but armed with bourdeaux he durst venture home my lady with her tongue was still prepared she rattled loud and he impatient heard it is a fine hour in a sweet pickle made and this sir john is every day the trade here i sit moping all the livelong night devoured with spleen and stranger to delight till morn sends staggring home a drunken beast resolved to break my heart as well as rest hey hoop do you hear my damned obstreprous spouse what cannot you find one bed about the house will that perpetual clack lie never still that rival to the softness of a mill some couch and distant room must be my choice where i may sleep uncursd with wife and noise long this uncomfortable life they led with snarling meals and each a separate bed to an old uncle often she would complain beg his advice and scarce from tears refrain old wisewood smoked the matter as it was cheer up cried he and i will remove the cause a wondrous spring within my garden flows of sovereign virtue chiefly to compose domestic jarrs and matrimonial strife the best elixir to appease man and wife strange are the effects the qualitles divine it is water called but worth its weight in wine if in his sullen airs sir john should come three spoonfuls take hold in your mouth  then mum smile and look pleased when he shall rage and scold still in your mouth the healing cordial hold one month this sympathetick medcin tried he will grow a lover you a happy bride but dearest niece keep this grand secret close or every pratling hussyll beg a dose a waterbottles brought for her relief not nants could sooner ease the ladys grief her busy thoughts are on the trial bent and femalelike impatient for the event the bonny knight reels home exceeding clear prepared for clamor and domestic war entering he cries  hey where is our thunder fled no hurricane bettys your lady dead madam aside an ample mouthful takes courtsys looks kind but not a word she speaks wondering he stard scarcely his eyes believed but found his ears agreeably deceived why how now molly what is the crotchet now she smiles and answers only with a bow then clasping her about  why let me die these nightclothes moll become thee mightily with that he sighed her hand began to press and betty calls her lady to undress nay kiss me molly  for i am much inclined her lace she cuts to take him in the mind thus the fond pair to bed enamored went the lady pleased and the good knight content for many days these fond endearments passed the reconciling bottle fails at last twas used and gone  then midnight storms arose and looks and words the union discompose her coach is ordered and posthaste she flies to beg her uncle for some fresh supplies transported does the strange effects relate her knights conversion and her happy state why niece says he  i prithee apprehend the waters water  be thy self thy friend such beauty would the coldest husband warm but your provoking tongue undoes the charm be silent and complying  you will soon find sir john without a medcin will be kind st jamess coffeehouse april    letters from venice say the disappointment of their expectation to see his danish majesty has very much disquieted the court of rome our last advices from germany inform us that the minister of hanover has urged the council at ratisbonne to exert themselves in behalf of the common cause and taken the liberty to say that the dignity the virtue the prudence of his electoral highness his master were called to the head of their affairs in vain if they thought fit to leave him naked of the proper means to make those excellencies useful for the honor and safety of the empire they write from berlin of the   th o s that the true design of general flemings visit to that court was to insinuate that it will be for the mutual interest of the king of prussia and king augustus to enter into a new alliance but that the ministers of prussia are not inclined to his sentiments we hear from vienna that his imperial majesty has expressed great satisfaction in their high mightinesses having communicated to him the whole that has passed in the affair of a peace though there have been practices used by the agents of france in all the courts of europe to break the good understanding of the allies they have had no other effect but to make all the members concerned in the alliance more doubtful of their safety from the great offers of the enemy the empire is rouzed by this alarm and the frontiers of all the french dominions are in danger of being insulted the ensuing campaign advices from all parts confirm that it is impossible for france to find a way to obtain so much credit as to gain any one potentate of the allies or conceive any hope for safety from other prospects  from my own apartment april    i find it of very great use now i am setting up for a writer of news that i am an adept in astrological speculations by which means i avoid speaking of things which may offend great persons but at the same time i must not prostitute the liberal sciences so far as not to utter the truth in cases which do not immediately concern the good of my native country i must therefore contradict what has been so assuredly reported by the newswriters of england that france is in the most deplorable condition and that their people die in great multitudes i will therefore let the world know that my correspondent by the way of brussels informs me upon his honor that the gentleman who writes the gazette of paris and ought to know as well as any man has told him that ever since the king has been past his   d year or grand climacterick there has not died one man of the french nation who was younger than his majesty except a very few who were taken suddenly near the village of hickstet in germany and some more who were straightened for lodging at a place called ramilies and died on the road to ghent and bruges there are also other things given out by the allies which are shifts below a conquering nation to make use of among others it is said there is a general murmuring among the people of france though at the same time all my letters agree that there is so good an understanding among them that there is not one morsel carried out of any market in the kingdom but what is delivered upon credit  the tatler no   from thursd april    to saturd april      0  wills coffeehouse april    this evening the comedy called the country wife was acted in drury lane for the benefit of mrs bignall the part which gives name to the play was performed by her self through the whole action she made a a very pretty figure and exactly entered into the nature of the part her husband in the drama is represented to be one of those debauchees who run through the vices of the town and believe when they think fit they can marry and settle at their ease his own knowledge of the iniquity of the age makes him choose a wife wholly ignorant of it and place his security in her want of skill how to abuse him the poet on many occasions where the propriety of the character will admit of it insinuates that there is no defense against vice but the contempt of it and has in the natural ideas of an untainted innocent shown the gradual steps to ruin and destruction which persons of condition run into without the help of a good education how to form their conduct the torment of a jealous coxcomb which arises from his own false maxims and the aggravation of his pain by the very words in which he sees her innocence makes a very pleasant and instructive satyr the character of horner and the design of it is a good representation of the age in which that comedy was written at which time love and wenching were the business of life and the gallant manner of pursuing women was the best recommendation at court to which only it is to be imputed that a gentleman of mr wicherlys character and sense condescends to represent the insults done to the honor of the bed without just reproof but to have drawn a man of probity with regard to such considerations had been a monster and a poet had at that time discovered his want of knowing the manners of the court he lived in by a virtuous character in his fine gentleman as he would show his ignorance by drawing a vicious one to please the present audience mrs bignall did her part very happily and had a certain grace in her rusticity which gave us hopes of seeing her a very skilful player and in some parts supply our loss of mrs verbruggen i cannot be of the same opinion with my friends and fellow laborers the reformers of manners in their severity toward plays but must allow that a good play acted before a wellbred audience must raise very proper incitements to good behavior and be the most quick and most prevailing method of giving young people a turn of sense and breeding but as i have set up for a weekly historian i resolve to be a faithful one and therefore take this public occasion to admonish a young nobleman who came flustered into the box last night and let him know how much all his friends were out of countenance for him the women sat in terror of hearing something that should shock their modesty and all the gentlemen in as much pain out of compassion to the ladies and perhaps resentment for the indignity which was offered in coming into their presence in so disrespectful a manner wine made him say nothing that was rude therefore he is forgiven upon condition he weill never hazard his offending more in this kind as i just now hinted i own my self of the society for reformation of manners we have lower instruments than those of the family of bickerstaff for punishing great crimes and exposing the abanddoned therefore as i disign to have notices from all public assemblies i shall take upon me only indecorums improprieties and negligences in such as should give us better examples after this declaration if a fine lady thinks fit to giggle at church or a great beau come in drunk to a play either shall be sure to hear of it in my ensuing paper for merely as a wellbred man i cannot bear these enormities  after the play we naturally stroll to this coffeehouse in hopes of meeting some new poem or other entertainment among the men of wit and pleasure where there is a dearth a present but it is wonderful there should be so few writers when the art is become merely mechanic and men may make themselves great that way by as certain and infallible rules as you may be a joiner or a mason there happens a good instance of this in what the hawker just now has offered to sale to wit instructions to vanderbank a sequel to the advice to the poets a poem occasioned by the glorious success of her majestys arms under the command of the duke of marlborought the last tear in flanders here you are to understand that the author finding the poets would not take his advice he troubles himself no more about em but has met with one vanderbank who works in arras and makes very good tapestry hangings therefore in order to celebrate the hero of the age he claps me together all that can be said of a man that makes hangings as then artist who do natures face express in silk and gold and scenes of action dress do figured arras animated leave spin a bright story or a passion weave by mingling threads can mingle shade and light delineate triumphs or describe a fight   well what shall this work man do why to show how great an hero the poet intends he provides him a very good horse champing his foam and bounding on the plain arch his high neck and graceful spread his mane   now as to the intrepidity the calm courage the constant application of the hero it is not necessary to take that upon your self you may in the lump bid him you employ raise him as high as he can and if he does it not let him answer for disobeying orders let fame and victory in inferior sky hover with balanced wings and smiling fly above his head etc   a whole poem of this kind may be ready against an ensuing campaign as well as a space left in the canvass of a piece of tapestry for the principal figure while the underparts are working so that in effect the adviser copies after the man he pretends to direct this method should methinks encourage young beginners for the invention is so fitted to all capacities that by the help of it a man may make a receipt for a poem a young man may observe that the gigg of the thing is as i said finding out all that can be said of his way you employ to set forth your worthy waller and denham had worn out the expedient of advice to a painter this author has transferred the work and sent his advice to the poets that is to say to the turners of verse as he calls em well that thought is worn out also therefore he directs his genius to the loom and will have a new set of hangings in honor of the last year in flanders i must own to you i approve extremely this invention and it might be improved for the benefit of manufactury as suppose an ingenious gentleman should write a poem of advice to a callicoprinter do you think there is a girl in england that would wear any thing but the taking of lisle or the battle of oudenarde they would certainly be all the fashion till the heroes abroad had cut out some more parterns i should fancy small skirmishes might do for underpetticoats provided they had a siege for the upper if our adviser were well imitated many industrious people might be put to work little mr dactile now in the room who formerly writ a song and a half is a week gone in a very pretty work upon this hint he is writing an epigram to a young virgin who knits very well it is a thousand pities he is a jacobite but his epigram is by way of advice to this damsel to knit all the actions of the pretender and the duke of burgundy last campaign in the clock of a stocking it were endless to enumerate the many hands and trades that may be employed by poets of so useful a turn as this advisers i shall think of it and in this time of taxes shall consult a great critic employed in the customhouse in order to propose what tax may be proper to put upon knives seals rings hangings wroughtbeds gowns and petticoats where any of those commodities bear mottos or are worked upon poetical grounds  st jamess coffeehouse april    letters from turin of the  d instant n s inform us that his royal highness employs all his address in alarming the enemy and perplexing their speculations concerning his real designs the ensuing campaign contracts are entered into with the merchants of milan for a great number of mules to transport his provisions and ammunition his royal highness has ordered the train of artillery to be conveyed to susa before the  0th of the next month in the mean time all accounts agree thas the enemy are very backward in their preparations and almost incapable of defending themselves against an invasion by reason of the general murmurs of their own people which they find are no way to be quieted but by giving them hopes of a speedy peace when these letters were dispatched the marshal de thesse was arrived at genoa where he has taken much pains to keep the correspondents of the merchants of france in hopes that measures will be found out to support the credit and commerce between that state and lions but the late declaration of the agents of monsieur bernard that they cannot discharge the demands made upon them has quite dispirited all those who are engaged in the remittances of france  from my own apartment april    it is a very natural passion in all good members of the commonwealth to take what care they can of their families therefore i hope the reader will forgive me that i desire he would go to the play called the stratagem this evening which is to be acted for the benefit of my near kinsman mr john bickerstaff i protest to you the gentleman has not spoken to me to desire this favor but i have a respect for him as well in regard to consanguinity as that he is an intimate friend of that famous and heroic actor mr george powell who formerly played alexander the great in all places though he is lately grown so reserved as to act it only on the stage  the tatler no   from saturd april    to tuesd april      0  it is usual with persons who mount the stage for the cure or information of the crowd about em to make solemn professions of their being wholly disinterested in the pains they take for the public good at the same time those very men who make harangues in plush doublets and extol their own abilities and generous inclinations tear their lungs in vending a drug and show no act of bounty except it be that they lower a demand of a crown to six nay to one penny we have a contempt for such paultry barterers and have therefore all along informed the public that we intend to give them our advices for our own sakes and are laboring to make our lucubrations come to some price in money for our more convenient support in the service of the public it is certain that many other schemes have been proposed to me as a friend offered to show me a treatise he had writ which he called the whole art of life or the introduction to great men illustrated in a pack of cards but being a novice at all manner of play i declined the offer another advised me for want of money to set up my coach and practice physic but having been bred a scholar i feared i should not succeed that way neither therefore resolved to go on in my present project but you are to understand that i shall not pretend to raise a credit to this work upon the weight of my politic news only but as my latin sentence in the title page informs you shall take any thing that offers for the subject of my discourse thus new persons as well as new things are to come under my consideration as when a toast or a wit is first pronounced such you shall have the freshest advice of their preferment from me with a description of the beautys manner and the wits style as also in whose places they are advanced for this town is never goodnatured enough to raise one without depressing another but it is my design to avoid saying any thing of any person which ought justly to displease but shall endeavor by the variety of the matter and style to give entertainment for men of pleasure without offense to those of business  whites chocolatehouse april    all hearts at present pant for two ladies only who have for some time engrossed the dominion of the town they are indeed both exceeding charming but differ very much in their excellencies the beauty of clarissa is soft that of chloe piercing when you look at clarissa you see the most exact harmony of feature complexion and shape you find in chloe nothing extraordinary in any one of those particulars but the whole woman irresistible clarissa looks languishing chloe killing clarissa never fails of gaining admiration chloe of moving desire the gazers at clarissa are at first unconcerned as if they were observing a fine picture they who behold chloe at the first glance discover transport as if they met their dearest friend these different perfections are suitably represented by the last great painter italy has sent us mr jervase clarissa is by that skilful hand placed in a manner that looks artless and innocent of the torments she gives chloe drawn with a liveliness that shows she is conscious but not affected of her perfections clarissa is a shepherdess chloe a country girl i must own the design of chloes picture shows to me great mastery in the painter for nothing could be better imagined than the dress he has given her of a strawhat and ribband to represent that sort of beauty which enters the heart with a certain familiarity and cheats it into a belief that it has received a lover as well as an object of love the force of their different beauties is seen also in the effects it makes on their lovers the admirers of chloe are eternally gay and wellpleased those of clarissa melancholy and thoughtful and as this passion always changes the natural man into a quite different creature from what he was before the love of chloe makes coxcombs that of clarissa madmen there were of each kind just now in this room here was one that whistles laughs sings and cuts capers for love of chloe another has just now writ three lines to clarissa then taken a turn in the garden then came back again then tore his fragment then called for some chocolate then went away without it  chloe has so many admirers in the house at present that there is too much noise to proceed in my narration so that the progress of the loves of clarissa and chloe together with the bottles that are drank each night for the one and the many sighs which are uttered and songs written on the other must be our subject on future occasions  wills coffeehouse april    letters from the haymarket inform us that on saturday night last the opera of pyrrhus and demetrius was performed with great applause this intelligence is not very acceptable to us friends of the theater for the stage being an entertainment of the reason and all our faculties this way of being pleased with the suspense of em for three hours together and being given up to the shallow satisfaction of the eyes and ears only seems to arise rather from the degeneracy of our understanding than an improvement of our diversions that the understanding has no part in the pleasure is evident from what these letters very positively assert to wit that a great part of the performance was done in italian and a great critic fell into fits in the gallery at

action love the passion is forgot this was long ago a witty authors lamentation but the evil still continues and if a man of any delicacy were to attend the discourses of the young fellows of this age they would believe there were none but prostitutes to make the objects of passion so true it is what the author of the above verses said a little before his death of the modern pretenders to gallantry

the park the play and murder the poor tits that drag her to public places and not a man turn pale at her appearance but such is the fallen state of love that if it were not for honest cynthio who is true to the cause we should hardly have a pattern left of the ancient worthies that way and indeed he has but very little encouragement to persevere but he has a devotion rather than love for his mistress and says only tell her that i love leave the rest to her and fate some kind planet from above may perhaps her passion move lovers on their stars must wait   but the stars i am so intimately

mentioned in my first narrative pleases himself with a vain imagination that with the language of his eyes now he has found who she is he shall conquer her though her eyes are intent upon one who looks from her which is ordinary with the sex it is certainly a mistake in the ancients to draw the little gentleman love as a blind boy for his real character is a little thief that squints for ask mrs meddle who is a confident or spy upon all the passions in town and she will tell you that the whole is a game of cross purposes the lover is generally pursuing one who is in pursuit of another and running from one that desires to meet him nay the nature of this passion is so justly represented in a squinting little thief who is always in a double action that do but observe clarissa next time you see her and you will find when her eyes have made their soft tour round the company she makes no stay on him they say she is to marry but rests two seconds of a minute on wildair who neither looks

as have done so have approved it it is written with the spirit of one who has seen the world enough to undervalue it with good breeding the author must certainly be a man of wisdom as well as piety and have spent much time in the exercise of both the real causes of the decay of the interest of religion are set forth in a clear and lively manner without unseasonable passions and the whole air of

that the marquis de pry upon the receipt of an express from the court of vienna went immediately to the palace of cardinal paulucci minister of state to his holiness and demanded in the name of his imperial majesty that king charles should be forthwith acknowledged king of spain by a solemn act of the congregation of cardinals appointed for that purpose he declared at the same time that if the least hesitation were made in this most important article of the late treaty he should not only be obliged to leave rome himself but also transmit his masters orders to the imperial troops to face about and return into the ecclesiastical dominions when the cardinal reported this message to the pope his holiness was struck with so sensible an affliction that he burst into tears his sorrow was aggravated by letters which immediately after arrived from the court of madrid wherein his nuncio acquainted him that upon the news of his accommodation with the emperor he had received a message to forbear coming to court and the people were so highly provoked that they could hardly be restrained from insulting his palace these letters add that the king of denmark was gone from florence to pisa and from pisa to leghorn where the governor paid his majesty all imaginable honors the king designed to go from thence to lucca where a magnificent tournament was prepared for his diversion an english man of war which came from port mahon to leghorn in   days brought advice that the fleet commanded by admiral whitaker was safely arrived at barcelona with the troops and ammunition which he had taken in at naples  general boneval governo of commacchio had summoned the magistrates of all the towns near that place to appear before him and take an oath of fidelity to his imperial majesty commanding also the gentry to pay him homage on pain of death and confiscation of goods advices from swisserland inform us that the bankers of geneva were utterly ruined by the failure of mr bernard they add that the deputies of the swiss cantons were returned from soleure where they were assembled at the instance of the french ambassador but were very much dissatisfied with the reception they had from that minister it is true he omitted no civilities or expressions of friendship from his master but he took no notice of their pensions and arrears what further provoked their indignation was that instead of    pistoles formerly allowed to each member for their charge in coming to the diet he had presented them with   only they write from dresden that king augustus was still busy in recruiting his cavalry and that the danish troops which lately served in hungary had orders to be in saxony in the middle of may and that his majesty of denmark was expected at dresden in the beginning of that month king augustus makes great preparations for his reception and has appointed sixty coaches each drawn by six horses for that purpose the interview of these princes affords great matter for speculation letters from paris of the   d of this month say that marshall harcourt and the duke of berwick were preparing to go into alsace and dauphine but that their troops were in want of all manner of necessaries the court of france had received advices from madrid that on the  th of this month the states of spain had with much magnificence acknowledged the prince of asturias presumptive heir of the crown this was performed at buen retiro the deputies took the oaths on that occasion from the hands of cardinal portocarrero these advices add that it was signified to the popes nuncio by

escaped public notice or have been misrepresented to the world provided that i am still within rules and trespass not as a tatler any further than in an incorrectness of style and writing in an air of common speech thus if any thing that is said even of old anchises or aeneas be set by me in a different light than has hitherto been hit upon in order to inspire the love and admiration of worthy actions you will gentle reader i hope accept of it for intelligence you had not before but i am going upon a narrative the matter of which i know to be true it is not only doing justice to the deceased merit of such persons as had they lived would not have had it in their power to thank me but also an instance of the greatness of spirit in the lowest of her majestys subjects take it as follows  at the siege of namur by the allies there were in the ranks of the company commanded by captain pincent in colonel frederick hamiltons regiment one unnion a corporal and one valentine a private sentinel there happened between these two men a dispute about a matter of love which upon some aggravations grew to an irreconcilable hatred unnion being the officer of valentine took all opportunities even to strike his rival and profess the spite and revenge which moved him to it the sentinel bore it without resistance but frequently said he would die to be revenged of that tyrant they had spent whole months thus one injuring the other complaining when in the midst of this rage toward each other they were commanded upon the attack of the castle where the corporal received a shot in the thigh and fell the french pressing on and he expecting to be trampled to death called out to his enemy ah valentine can you leave me here valentine immediately ran back and in the midst of a thick fire of the french took the corporal upon his back and brought him through all that danger as far as the abbey of salsine where a cannonball took off his head his body fell under his enemy whom he was carrying off unnion immediately forgot his wound rose up tearing his hair and then threw himself upon the bleeding carcass crying ah valentine was it for me who have so barbarously used thee that thou have died i will not live after thee he was not by any means to be forced from the body but was removed with it bleeding in his arms and attended with tears by all their comrades who knew their enmity when he was brought to a tent his wounds were dressed by force but the next day still calling upon valentine and lamenting his cruelties to him he died in the pangs of remorse and despair  it may be a question among men of noble sentiments whether of these unfortunate persons had the greater soul he that was so generous as to venture his life for his enemy or he who could not survive the man that died in laying upon him such an obligation  when we see spirits like these in a people to what heights may we not suppose their glory may arise but as it is excellently observed by sallust it is not only to the general bent of a nation that great revolutions are owing but to the extraordinary genios that lead em on which occasion he proceeds to say that the roman greatness was neither to be attributed to their superior poli y for in that the carthaginians excelled nor to their valor for in that the french were preferable but to particular men who were born for the good of their country and formed for great attempts this he says to introduce the characters of caesar and cato it would be entering into too weighty a discourse for this place if i attempted to show that our nation has produced as great and able men for public affairs as any other but i believe the reader outruns me and fixes his imagination upon the duke of marlborough it is methinks a pleasing reflection to consider the dispensations of providence in the fortune of this illustrious man who in the space of forty years has passed through all the gradations of humane life till he has ascended to the character of a prince and become the scourge of a tyrant who sat in one of the greatest thrones of europe before the man who was to have the greatest part in his downfall had made one step in the world but such elevations are the natural consequences of an exact prudence a calm courage a well governed temper a patient ambition and an affable behavior these arts as they are the steps to his

dances and can say and do whatever she pleases without the imputation of any thing that can injure her character for she is so well known to have no passion but selflove or folly but affectation that now upon any occasion they only cry it is her way and that is so like her without further reflection as i came into the room she cries oh mr bickerstaff i am utterly undone i have broke that pretty italian fan i showed you when you were here last wherein were so admirably drawn our first parents in paradise asleep in each others arms but there is such an affinity between painting and poetry that i have been improving the images which were raised by that picture by reading the same representation in two of our greatest poets look you here are the passages in milton and in dryden all miltons thoughts are wonderfully just and natural in this inimitable description which adam makes of himself in the eighth book of paradise lost but there is none of them finer than that contained in the following lines where he tells us his thoughts when he was falling asleep a little after his creation  while thus i called and strayed i know not whither from whence i first drew air and first beheld this happy light when answer none returned on a green shady bank profuse of flowers pensive i sat me down there gentle sleep first found me and with soft oppression seized my drowned sense untroubled though i thought i then was passing to my former state insensible and forthwith to dissolve but now i cannot forgive this odious thing this dryden who in his state of innocence has given my greatgrandmother eve the same apprehension of annihilation on a very different occasion as adam pronounces it of himself when he was seized with a pleasing kind of stupor and deadness eve fancies herself falling away and dissolving in the hurry of a rapture however the verses are very good and i dont know but it may be natural what she says i will read em  when your kind eyes looked languishing on mine and wreathing arms did soft embraces join a doubtful trembling seized me first all over then wishes and a warmth unknown before what followed was all ecstasy and trance immortal pleasures round my swimming eyes did dance and speechless joys in whose sweet tumults tossed i thought my breath and my new being lost she went on and said a thousand good things at random but so strangely mixed that you would be apt to say all her wit is mere good luck and not the effect of reason and judgment when i made my escape hither i found a gentleman playing the critic on two other great poets even virgil and homer he was observing that virgil is more judicious than the other in the epithets he gives his hero homers usual epithet said he is  or  and his indiscretion has been often rallied by the critics for mentioning the nimbleness of foot in achilles though he describes him standing sitting lying down fighting eating drinking or in any other circumstance however foreign or repugnant to speed and activity virgils common epithet to aeneas is pius or pater i have therefore considered said he what passage there is in any of his heros actions where either of these appellations would have been most improper to see if i could catch him at the same fault with homer and this i think is his meeting with dido in the cave where pius aeneas would have been absurd and pater aeneas a burlesque the poet has therefore wisely dropped em both for dux trojanus speluncam dido dux and trojanus candem deveniunt  which he has repeated twice in junos speech and his own narration for he very well knew a loose action might be consistent enough with the usual manners of a soldier though it became neither the chastity of a pious man nor the gravity of the father of a

which gives us new knowledge thus we are making a very pleasant entertainment to our selves in putting the actions of homers iliad into an exact journal  this poem is introduced by chryses king of chryseis and priest of apollo who comes to redemand his daughter who was carried off at the taking of that city and given to agamemnon for his part of the booty the refusal he received enrages apollo who for nine days showered down darts upon them which occasioned the pestilence  the  0th day achilles assembles the council and encourages calchas to speak for the surrender of chryseis to appease apollo agamemnon and achilles storm at one another notwithstanding which agamemnon will not release his prisoner unless he has briseis in her stead after long contestations wherein agamemnon gives a glorious character of achilless valor he determines to restore briseis to her father and sends two heralds to fetch away chryseis from achilles who abandons himself to sorrow and despair his mother thetis came to comfort him under his affliction and promises to represent his sorrowful lamentations to jupiter but he could not attend it for the evening before he had appointed to divert himself for two days beyond the seas with the harmless aethiopians  twas the   st day after chryseiss arrival to the camp that thetis went very early to demand an audience of jupiter the means he uses to satisfy her were to persuade the greeks to attack the trojans that so they might perceive the consequence of contemning achilles and the miseries they suffer if he does not head them the next night he orders agamemnon in a dream to attack them who was deceived with the hopes of obtaining a victory and also taking the city without sharing the honor with achilles  on the   d in the morning he assembles the council and having made a feint of raising the siege and retiring he declares to them his dream and together with nestor and ulysses resolves on an engagement  this was the   d day which is full of incidents and which continues from almost the beginning of the second canto to the eighth the armies being then drawn up in view of one another hector brings it about that menelaus and paris the two persons concerned in the quarrel should decide it by a single combat which tending to the advantage of menelaus was interrupted by a cowardice infused by minerva then both armies engage where the trojans have the disadvantage but being afterward animated by apollo they repulse the enemy yet they are once again forced to give ground but their affairs were retrieved by hector who has a single combat with ajax the gods threw themselves into the battle juno and minerva took the gracians part and apollo and mars the trojans but mars and venus are both wounded by diomedes  the truce for burying the slain ended the   d day after which the greeks threw up a great intrenchment to secure their navy from danger councils are held on both sides on the morning of the   th day the battle is renewed but in a very disadvantagious manner to the greeks who were beaten back to their retrenchments agamemnon being in despair at this ill success proposes to the counsel to quit the enterprise and retire from troy but by the advice of nestor he is persuaded to regain achilles by returning chryseis and sending him considerable presents hereupon ulysses and ajax are sent to that hero who continues inflexible in his anger ulysses at his return joins himself with diomedes and goes in the night to gain intelligence of the enemy they enter into their very camp where finding the sentinels asleep they made a great slaughter rhesus who was just then arrived with recruits from thrace for the trojans was killed in that action here ends the  0th canto the sequel of this journal will be inserted in the next article from this place  st jamess coffeehouse april    we hear from italy that notwithstanding the pope has received a letter from the duke of anjou demanding of him to explain himself upon the affair of acknowledging king charles his holiness has not yet thought fit to send any answer to that prince the court of rome appears very much mortified that they are not to see his majesty of denmark in that city having perhaps given themselves vain hopes from a visit made by a protestant prince to that see the pope has dispatched a gentleman to compliment his majesty and sent the king a present of all the curiosities and antiquities of rome represented in seventeen volumes very richly bound which were taken out of the vatican library letters from genoa of the   th instant say a felucca was arrived there in five days from marseilles with an account that the people of that city had made an insurrection by reason of the scarcity of provisions and that the intendant had ordered some companies of marines and the men belonging to the galleys to stand to their arms to protect him from violence but that he began to be in as much apprehension of his guards as those from whom they were to defend him when that vessel came away the soldiers murmured publicly for want of pay and it was generally believed they would pillage the magazines as the garrisons of grenoble and other towns of france had already done a vessel which lately came into leghorn brought advice that the british squadron was arrived at port mahon where they were taking in more troops in order to attempt the relief of alicant which still made a very vigorous defense it is said admiral bing will be at the head of that expedition the king of denmark was gone from leghorn toward lucca  they write from vienna that in case the allies should enter into a treaty of peace with france count zinzendorf will be appointed first plenipotentiary the count de goes the second and monsieur van konsbruch a third major general palms envoy extraordinary from her britannick majesty has been very urgent with that court to make their utmost efforts against france the ensuing campaign in order to oblige it to such a peace as may establish the tranquillity of europe for the future  we are also informed that the pope uses all imaginable shifts to elude the treaty concluded with the emperor and that he demanded the immediate restitution of commacchio insisting also that his imperial majesty should ask pardon and desire absolution for what has formerly passed before he would solemnly acknowledge king charles but this was utterly refused  they hear at vienna by letters from constantinople dated the   d of february last that on the   th of that month the grand signior took occasion at the celebration of the festivals of the musselmen to set all the christian slaves which were in the galleys at liberty  advices from swisserland import that the preachers of the county of tockenburg continue to create new jealousies of the protestants and some disturbances lately happened there on that account the protestants and papists in the town of hamman go to divine service one after another in the same church as is usual in many other parts of swisserland but on sunday the  0th instant the popish curate having ended his service attempted to hinder the protestants from entering into the church according to custom but the protestants briskly attacked him and his party and broke into it by force  last night between seven and eight his grace the duke of marlborough arrived at court  from my own apartment april    the present great captains of the age the duke of marlborough and prince eugene having been the subject of the discourse of the last company i was in it has naturally led me into a consideration of alexander and caesar the two greatest names which ever appeared before this century in order to enter into their characters there needs no more but examining their behavior in parallel circumstances it must be allowed that they had an equal greatness of soul but caesars was more corrected and allayed by a mixture of prudence and circumspection this is seen conspicuously in one particular in their histories wherein they seem to have shown exactly the difference of their tempers when alexander after a long course of victories would still have led his soldiers farther from home they unanimously refused to follow him we meet with the like behavior in caesars army in the midst of his march against ariovistus let us therefore observe the conduct of our two generals in so nice an affair and here we find alexander at the head of his army upbraiding them with their cowardice and meanness of spirit and in the end telling them plainly he would go forward himself though not a man followed him this showed indeed an excessive bravery but how would the commander have come off if the speech had not succeeded and the soldiers had taken him at his word the project seems of a piece with mr bayss in the rehearsal who to gain a clap in his prologue comes out with a terrible fellow in a furcap following him and tells his audience if they would not like his play he would lie down and have his head struck off if this gained a clap all was well but if not there was nothing left but for the executioner to do his office but caesar would not leave the success of his speech to such uncertain events he shows his men the unreasonableness of their fears in an obliging manner and concludes that if none else would march along with them he would go himself with the tenth legion for he was assured of their fidelity and valor though all the rest forsook him not but that in all probability they were as much against the march as the rest the result of all was very natural the tenth legion fired with the praises of their general send thanks to him for the just opinion he entertains of em and the rest ashamed to be outdone assure him that they are as ready to follow where he pleases to lead them as any other part of the army  the tatler no   from saturd april    to tuesd april      0  it is so just an observation that mocking is catching that i

otherwise you may be sure i would not have pretended to have given for news as i did last saturday a diary of the siege of troy but man is a creature very inconsistent with himself the greatest heroes are sometimes fearful the spriteliest wits at some hours dull and the greatest politicians on some occasions whimsical but i shall not pretend to palliate or excuse the matter for i find by a calculation of my own nativity that i cannot hold out with any tolerable wit longer than two minutes after twelve a clock at night between the   th and   th of the next month for which space of time you may still expect to hear from me but no longer except you will transmit to me the occurrences you meet with relating to your amors or any other subject within the rules by which i have proposed to

in colors as much to their advantage as those in which gervase has drawn the agreeable chloe but since without such assistance i frankly confess and am sensible that i have not a months wit more i think i ought while i am in my sound health and senses to make my will and testament which i do in manner and form following  imprimis i give to the stockjobbers about the exchange of london as a security for the trusts daily reposed in them all my real estate which i do hereby vest in the said body of worthy citizens for ever  item for as much as it is very hard to keep land in repair without ready cash i do out of my personal estate bestow the bearskin which i have frequently lent to several societies about this town to supply their necessities i say i give also the said bearskin as an immediate fund to the said citizens for ever  item i do hereby appoint a certain number of the said citizens to take all the customhouse or customary oaths concerning all goods imported by the whole city strictly directing that some select members and not the whole number of a body corporate should be perjured  item i forbid all n  s and persons of q  ty to watch bargains near and about the exchange to the diminution and wrong of the said stockjobbers  thus far in as brief and intelligible a manner as any will can appear till it is explained by the learned i have disposed of my real and personal estate but as i am an adept i have by birth an equal right to give also an indefeasible title to my endowments and qualifications which i do in the following manner  item i give my chastity to all virgins who have withstood their market  item i give my courage among all who are ashamed of their distressed friends all sneakers in assemblies and men who show valor in common conversation  item i give my wit as rich men give to the rich among such as think they have enough already and in case they shall not accept of the legacy i give it to bentivolio to defend his works from time to time as he shall think fit to publish em  item i bestow my learning upon the honourary members of the royal society  now for the disposal of this body  as these eyes must one day cease to gaze on teraminta and this heart shall one day pant no more for her indignation that is to say since this body must be earth i shall commit it to the dust in a manner suitable to my character therefore as there are those who dispute whether there is any such real person as isaac bickerstaff or not i shall excuse all persons who appear what they really are from coming to my funeral but all those who are in their way of life personae as the latins have it persons assumed and who appear what they really are not are hereby invited to that solemnity  the body shall be carried by six watchmen who are never seen in the day  item the pall shall be held up by the six most known pretenders to honesty wealth and power who are not possessed of any of them the two first an half lawyer a complete justice the two next a chemist a projector the third couple a treasury solicitor and a small courtier  to make my funeral what that solemnity when done to common men really is in it self a very farce and

whites chocolatehouse april    easter day being a time when you cannot well meet with any but humble adventures and there being such a thing as low gallantry as well as low comedy colonel ramble and my self went early this morning into the fields which were strewed with shepherds and shepherdesses but indeed of a different turn from the simplicity of those of arcadia every hedge was conscious of more than what the representations of enamoured swains admit of while we were surveying the crowd around us we saw at a distance a company coming toward pancraschurch but though there was not much disorder we thought we saw the figure of a man stuck through with a sword and at every step ready to fall if a woman by his side had not supported him the rest followed two and two when we came nearer this appearance who should it be but monsieur guardeloop mine and rambles french tailor attended by others leading one of madam depingles maids to the church in order to their espousals it was his sword rucked so high above his wast and the circumflex which persons of his profession take in their walking that made him appear at a distance wounded and falling but the morning being rainy methought the march to thi wedding was but too lively a picture of wedlock it self they seemed both to have  months mind to make the best of their wa single yet both tugged arm in arm an when they were in a dirty way he was bu deeper in the mire by endeavoring to pu out his companion and yet without helpin her the bridegrooms feathers in his hat  drooped one of his shoes had lost an he in short he was in his whole person and dress so extremely soused that there did not appear one inch or single thread about him unmarried pardon me that the melancholy object still dwells upon me so far as to reduce me to punning however we attended to the chapel where we stayed to hear the irrevocable words pronounced upon our old servant and made the best of our way to town i took a resolution to forbear all married persons or any in danger of being such for four and twenty hours at least therefore dressed and went to visit florimell the vainest thing in town where i knew would drop in colonel picket just come from the camp her professed admirer he is of that order of men who has much honor and merit but withal a coxcomb the other of that set of females who has innocence and wit but the first of coquets it is easy to believe these must be admirers of each other she says the colonel rides the best of any man in england the colonel says she talks the best of any woman at the same time he understands wit just as she does horsemanship you are to know these extraordinary persons see each other daily and they themselves as well as the town think it will be a match but it can never happen that they can come to the point for instead of addressing to each other they spend their whole time in reports of themselves he is satisfied if he can convince her he is a fine gentleman and a man of consequence and she in appearing to him an accomplished lady and a wit without further design thus he tells her of his manner of posting his men at such a pass with the numbers he commanded on that detachment she tells him how she was dressed on such a day at court and what offers were made her the week following she seems to hear the repetition of his mens names with admiration and waits only to answer him with as false a muster of lovers they talk to each other not to be informed but approved thus they are so like that they are to be ever distant and the parallel lines may run together for ever but never meet  wills coffeehouse april    this evening the comedy called epsomwells was acted for the benefit of mr bullock who though he is a person of much wit and ingenuity has a peculiar talent of looking like a fool and therefore excellently well qualified for the part of biscuit in this play i cannot indeed sufficiently admire his way of bearing a beating as he does in this drama and that with such a natural air and propriety of folly that one cannot help wishing the whip in ones own hand so richly does he seem to deserve his chastisement skilful actors think it a very peculiar happiness to play in a scene with such as top their parts therefore i cannot but say when the judgment of any good author directs him to write a beating for mr bullock from mr william penkethman or for mr william penkethman from mr bullock those excellent players seem to be in their most shining circumstances and please me more but with a different sort of delight than that which i receive from those grave scenes of brutus and cassius or anthony and ventidius the whole comedy is very just and the low part of humane life represented with much humor and wit  st jamess coffeehouse

extremely well diverted with that heap of vice and absurdity the indignation which eugenio who is a gentleman of a just taste has upon occasion of seeing humane nature fall so low in their delights made him i thought expatiate upon the mention of this play very agreeably of all men living said he i pity players who must be men of good understanding to be capable of being such that they are obliged to repeat and assume proper gestures for representing things of which their reason must be ashamed and which they must disdain their audience for approving the amendment of these low gratifications is only to be made by people of condition by encouraging the presentation of the noble characters drawn by shakespeare and others from whence it is impossible to return without strong impressions of honor and humanity on these occasions distress is laid before us with all its causes and consequences and our resentment placed according to the merit of the persons afflicted were dramas of this nature more acceptable to the taste of the town men who have genius would bend their studies to excel in em how forcible an effect this would have on our minds one needs no more than to observe how strongly we are touched by mere pictures who can see le bruns picture of the battle of porus without entering into the character of that fierce gallant man and being accordingly spurred to an emulation of his constancy and courage when he is falling with his wound the features are at the same time very terrible and languishing and there is such a stern faintness diffused through all his look as is apt to move a kind of horror as well as pity in the beholder this i say is an effect wrought by mere lights and shades consider also a representation made by words only as in an account given by a good writer catiline in sallust makes just such a figure as porus by le brun it is said of him catilina vero long a suis inter hostium cadavera repertus est paululum etiam spirans ferocitatemque animi quam vivus habuerat in vultu retinens  catiline was found killed far from his own men among the dead bodies of the enemy he seemed still to breath and still retained in his face the same fierceness he had when he was living you have in that one sentence a lively impression of his whole life and actions what i would insinuate from all this is that if the painter and the historian can do thus much in colors and language what may not be performed by an excellent poet when the character he draws is represented by the person the manner the look and the motion of an accomplished player if a thing painted or related can irresistibly enter our hearts what may not be brought to pass by seeing generous things performed before our eyes eugenio ended his discourse by

commerce with the french on that occasion  from my own apartment after the lassitude of a day spent in the strolling manner which is usual with men of pleasure in this town and with a head full of a million of impertinencies which had danced round it for ten hours together i came to my lodging and hastened to bed my valet de chamber knows my university trick of reading there and he being a good scholar for a gentleman ran over the names of horace tibullus ovid and others to know which i would have bring virgil said i and if i fall asleep take care of the candle i read the sixth book over with the most exquisite delight and had gone half through it a second time when the pleasing ideas of elysian fields deceased worthies walking in them sincere lovers enjoying their languishment without pain compassion for the unhappy spirits who had misspent their short daylight and were exiled from the seats of bliss for ever i say i was deep again in my reading when this mixture of images had taken place of all others in my imagination before and lulled me into a dream from which i am just awake to my great disadvantage the happy mansions of elysium by degrees seemed to be wafted from me and the very traces of my late walking thoughts began to fade away when i was cast by a sudden whirlwind upon an island encompassed with a roaring and troubled sea which shakd its very center and rocked its inhabitants as in a cradle the islanders lay on their faces without offering to look up or hope for preservation all her harbors were crowded with mariners and tall vessels of war lay in danger of being driven to pieces on her shores bless me said i why have i lived in such a manner that the convulsion of nature should be so terrible to me when i feel in my self that the better part of me is to survive it oh may that be in happiness a sudden shriek in which the whole people on their faces joined interrupted my soliloquy and turned my eyes and attention to the object which had given us that sudden start in the midst of an inconsolable and speechless affliction immediately the winds grew calm the waves subsided and the people stood up turning their faces upon a magnificent pile in the midst of the island there we beheld an hero of a comely and erect aspect but pale and languid sitting under a canopy of state by the faces and dumb sorrow of those who attended we thought him in the article of death at a distance sat a lady whose life seemed to hang upon the same thread with his she kept her eyes fixed upon him and seemed to smother ten thousand thousand nameless things which urged her tenderness to clasp him in her arms but her greatness of spirit overcame those sentiments and gave her power to forbear disturbing his last moment which immediately approached the hero looked up with an air of negligence and satiety of being rather than of pain to leave it and leaning back his head expired  when the heroine who sat at a distance saw his last instant come she threw her self at his feet and kneeling pressed his hand to her lips in which posture she continued under the agony of an unutterable sorrow till conducted from our sight by her attendants that commanding awe which accompanies the grief of great minds restrained the multitude while in her presence but as soon as she retired they gave way to their distraction and all the islanders called upon their deceased hero to him methought they cried out as to a guardian being and i gathered from their broken accents that it was he who had the empire over the ocean and its powers by which he had long protected the island from shipwreck and invasion they now give a loose to their moan and think themselves exposed without hopes of humane or divine assistance while the people ran wild and expressed all the different forms of lamentation methought a sable cloud overshadowed the whole land and covered its inhabitants with darkness no glimpse of light appeared except one ray from heaven upon the place in which the heroine now secluded her self from the world with her eyes fixed on those abodes to which her consort was ascended methought a long period of time had passed away in mourning and in darkness when a twilight began by degrees to enlighten the hemisphere and looking round me i saw a boat rowed toward the shore in which sat a personage adorned with warlike trophies bearing on his left arm a shield on which was engraven the image of victory and in his right hand a branch of olive his visage was at once so winning and so awful that the shield and the olive seemed equally suitable to his genius  when this illustrious about this time the d of m returned from holland with the preliminaries of a peace person touched on the shore he was received by the acclamations of the people and followed to the palace of the heroine no pleasure in the glory of her arms or the acclamations of her applauding subjects were ever capable to suspend her sorrow for one moment till she saw the olive branch in the hand of that auspicious messenger at that sight as heaven bestows its blessings on the wants and importunities of mortals out of its native bounty and not to increase its own power or honor in compassion to the world the celestial mourner was then first seen to turn her regard to things below and taking the branch out of the warriors hand looked at it with much satisfaction and spoke of the blessings of peace with a voice and accent such as that in which guardian spirits whisper to dying penitents assurances of happiness the air was hushed the multitude attentive and all nature in a pause while she was speaking but as soon as the messenger of peace had made some low reply in which methought i heard the word iberia the heroine assuming a more severe air but such as spoke resolution without rage returned him the olive and again veiled her face loud cries and clashing of arms immediately followed which forced me from my charming vision and drove me back to these mansions of care and sorrow  the tatler no   from thursd apr    to saturd apr  0   0  wills coffeehouse april    this evening we were entertained with the old bachelor a comedy of deserved reputation in the character which gives name to the play there is excellently represented the reluctance of a battered debauchee to come into the trammels of order and decency he neither languishes nor burns but frets for love the gentlemen of more regular behavior are drawn with much spirit and wit and the drama introduced by the dialogue of the first scens with uncommon yet natural conversation the part of fondlewife is a lively image of the unseasonable fondness of age and impotence but instead of such agreeable works as these the town has this half age been tormented with insects called easy writers whose abilities mr wicherly one day described excellently well in one word that said he among these fellows is called easy writing which any one may easily write such jantie scribblers are so justly laughed at for their sonnets on phillis and chloris and fantastical descriptions in em that an ingenious kinsman of mine of the family of the staffs mr humphrey wagstaff by name has to avoid their strain run into a way perfectly new and described things exactly as they happen he never forms fields or nymphs or groves where they are not but makes the incidents just as they really appear for an example of it i stole out of his manuscript the following lines they are a description of the morning but of the morning in town nay of the morning at this end of the town where my kinsman at present lodges  now hardly here and there an hackneycoach appearing showed the ruddy morns approach now betty from her masters bed had flown and softly stole to discompose her own the slipshod prentice from his masters door had pared the street and sprinkled round the floor now moll had whirled her mop with dextrous airs prepared to scrub the entry and the stairs the youth with broomy stumps began to trace the kennel edge where wheels had worn the place the smallcoal man was heard with cadence deep till drowned in shriller notes of chimney sweep duns at his lordships gate began to meet and brickdust moll had screamd through half a street the turnkey now his flock returning sees duly let out a nights to steal for fees the watchful bailiffs take their silent stands and schoolboys lag with satchels in their hands all that i apprehend is that dear numps will be angry i have published these lines not that he has any reason to be ashamed of them but for fear of those rogues the bane to all excellent performances the imitators therefore beforehand i bar all descriptions of the evening as a medley of verses signifying greypeas are now cried warm that wenches now begin to amble round the passages of the playhouse or of noon as that find ladies and great beaux are just yawning out of their beds and windows in pall mall and so forth i forewarn also all persons from encouraging any draughts after my cousin and foretell any man who shall go about to imitate him that he will be very insipid the family stock is embarked in this design and we will not admit of counterfeits dr anderson and his heirs enjoy his pills sir willium read has the cure of eyes and monsieur roselli can only cure the gout we pretend to none of these things but to examine who and who are together to tell any mistaken man he is not what he believes he is to distinguish merit and expose false pretenses to it is a liberty our family has by law in em from an intermarriage with a daughter of mr scoggin the famous droll of the last century this right i design to make use of but will not encroach upon the abovementioned adepts or any other at the same time i shall take all the privileges i may as an englishman and will lay hold of the late act of naturalization to introduce what i shall think fit from france the use of that law may i hope be extended to people the polite world with new characters as well as the kingdom it self with new subjects therefore an author of that nation called le bruyere i shall make bold with on such occasions the last person i read of in that writer was lord timon timon says my author is the most generous of all men but is so hurried away with that strong impulse of bestowing that he confers benefits without distinction and is munificent without laying obligations for all the unworthy who receive from him have so little sense of this noble infirmity that they look upon themselves rather as partners in a spoil than partakers of a bounty the other day coming into paris i met timon going out on horseback attended only by one servant it struck me with a sudden damp to see a man of so excellent a disposition and that understood making a figure so very well so much shortened in his retinue but passing by his house i saw his great coach break to pieces before his door and by a strange enchantment immediately turned into many different vehicles the first was a very pretty chariot into which stepped his lordships secretary the second was hung a little heavier into that strutted the fat steward in an instant followed a chaise which was entered by the butler the rest of the body and wheels were forthwith changed into gocarts and ran away with by the nurses and brats of the rest of the family what makes these misfortunes in the affairs of timon the more astonishing is that he has a better understanding than those who cheat him so that a man knows not which more to wonder at the indifference of the master or the impud nce of the servant  whites chocolatehouse april    it is a matter of much speculation among the beaus and oglers what it is that can have made so suddeu a change as has been of late observed in the whole behavior of pastorella who never sat still a moment till she was eighteen which she has now exceeded by two months her aunt who has the care of her has not been always so rigid as she is at this present date but has so good a sense of the frailty of woman and falsehood of man that she resolved on all manner of methods to keep pastorella if possible in safety against her self and all her admirers at the same time the good lady knew by long experience that a gay inclination curbed too rashly would but run to the greater excesses for that restraint therefore intended to watch her and take some opportunity of engaging her insensibly in her own interests without the anguish of an admonition you are to know then that miss with all her flirting and ogling had also naturally a strong curiosity in her and was the greatest evesdropper breathing parisatis for so her prudent aunt is called observed this humor and retires one day to her closet into which she knew pastorella would peep and listen to know how she was employed it happened accordingly and the young lady saw her good governante on her knees and after a mental behavior break into these words as for the dear child committed to my care let her sobriety of carriage and severity of behavior be such as may make that noble lord who is taken with her beauty turn his designs to such as are honorable here parisatis heard her niece nestle closer to the keyhole she then goes on make her the joyful mother of a numerous and wealthy offspring and let her carriage be such as may make this noble youth expect the blessings of an happy marriage from the singularity of her life in this loose and censorious age miss having heard enough sneaks off for fear of discovery and immediately at her glass alters the sitting of her head then pulls up her tucker and forms herself into the exact manner of lindamira in a word becomes a sincere convert to every thing that is commendable in a fine young lady and two or three such matches as her aunt feigned in her devotions are at this day in her choice this is the history and original cause of pastorellas conversion from coquettry the prudence in the management of this young ladys temper and good judgment of it is hardly to be exceeded i scarce remember a greater instance of forbearance of the usual peevish way with which the aged treat the young than this except that of our famous noy whose good nature went so far as to make him put off his admonitions to his son even till after his death and did not give him his thoughts of him till he came to read that memo able passage in his will all the rest of my estate says he i leave to my son edward who is executor to this my will to be squandred as he shall think fit i leave it him for that purpose and hope no better from him a generous disdain and reflection upon how little he deserved from so excellent a father reformed the young man and made edward from an errant rake become a fine gentleman  st jamess coffeehouse april    letters from portugal of the   th instant dated from estremos say that on the  th the earl of galway arrived at that place and had the satisfaction to see the

having a sudden occasion to go out of town ordered me to take upon me the dispatch of the next advices from home with liberty to speak it my own way not doubting the allowances which would be given to a writer of my sex you may be sure i undertook it with much satisfaction and i confess i am not a little pleased with the opportunity of running over all the papers in his closet which he has left open for my use on this occasion the first that i lay my hands on is a treatise concerning the empire of beauty and the effects it has had in all nations of the world upon the public and private actions of men with an appendix which he calls the batchelors scheme for governing his wife the first thing he makes this gentleman propose is that she shall be no woman for she is to have an aversion to balls to operas to visits she is to think his company sufficient to fill up all the hours of life with great satisfaction she is never to believe any other man wise learned or valiant or at least but in a second degree in the next place he intends she shall be a cuckold but expects that he himself must live in perfect security from that terror he dwells a great while on instructions for her discreet behavior in case of his falsehood i have not patience with these unreasonable expectations therefore turn back to the treatise it self here indeed my brother deduces all the revolutions among men from the passion of love and in his preface answers that usual observation against us that there is no quarrel without a woman in it with a gallant assertion that there is nothing else worth quarrelling for my brother is of a complexion truly amorous all his thoughts and actions carry in em a tincture of that obliging inclination and this turn has opened his eyes to see we are not the inconsiderable c eatures which unlucky pretenders to our favor would insinuate he observes that no man begins to make any tolerable figure till he sets out with he hopes of pleasing some one of us no sooner he takes that in hand but he pleases every one else by the by it has an immediate effect upon his behavior there is colonel ranter who never spoke without an oath till he saw the lady betty modish now never gives his man an order but it is pray tom do it the drawers where he drinks live in perfect happiness he asked will at the george the other day how he did where he used to say damn it is it so he now believes there is some mistake he must confess he is of another opinion but however he will not insist  every temper except downright insipid is to be animated and softened by the influence of beauty but of this untractable sort is a lifeless handsome fellow that visits us whom i have dressed at this twelvemonth but he is as insensible of all the arts i use as if he conversed all that time with his nurse he outdoes our whole sex in all the faults our enemies impute to us he has brought laziness into an opinion and makes his indolence his philosophy insomuch that no long r ago than yesterday in the evening he gave me this account of himself i am madam perfectly unmoved at all that passes among men and seldom gives my self the fatigue of going among em but when i do i always appear the same thing to those whom i converse with my hours of existence or being awake are from eleven in the morning to eleven at night half of which i live to my self in picking my teeth washing my hands paring my nails and looking in the glass the insignificancy of my manners to the rest of the world makes the laughers call me a quid nunc a phrase which i neither understand or shall ever enquire what they mean by it the last of me each night is at st james s coffeehouse where i converse yet never fall into a dispute on any occasion but leave the understanding i have passive of all that goes through it without entering into the business of life and thus madam have i arrived by laziness to what others pretended to by philosophy a perfect neglect of the world sure if our sex had the liberty of frequenting public houses and conversations we should put these rivals of our faults and follies out of countenance however we shall soon have the pleasure of being acquainted with em one way or other for my brother isaac designs for the use of our sex to give the exact characters of all the chief politicians who frequent any of the coffeehouses from st jamess to the change but designs to begin with that cluster of wise heads as they are found sitting every evening from the leftside of the fire at the smyrna to the door this will be of great service for us and i have authority to promise an exact journal of their deliberations the publication of which i am to be allowed for pinmoney in the mean time i cast my eye upon a new book which gave me a more pleasing entertainment being a sixth part of miscellany poems published by jacob tonson which i find by my brothers notes upon it no way inferior to the other volumes there are it seems in this a collection of the best pastorals that have hitherto appeared in england but among them none superior to that dialogue between sylvia and dorinda written by one of my own sex where all our little weaknesses are laid open in a manner more just and with truer raillery than ever man yet hit upon  only this i now discern from the things thoust have me learn that womankinds peculiar joys from past or present beauties rise but to reassume my first design there cannot be a greater instance of the command of females than in the prevailing charms of the heroine in the play which was acted this night called all for love or the world well lost the enamoured antony resigns glory and power to the force of the attractive cleopatra whose charms were the defense of her diadem against a people otherwise invincible it is so natural for women to talk of themselves that it is to be hoped all my own sex at least will pardon me that i could fall into no other discourse if we have their favor we give our selves very little anxiety for the rest of our readers i believe i see a sentence of latin in my brothers daybook of wit which seems applicable on this occasion and in contempt of the critics   tristitiam and metus tradam protectis in mare criticum portare ventis but i am interrupted by a packet from mr kidney from st jamess coffeehouse which i am obliged to insert in the very style and words which mr kidney uses in his letter  st jamess coffeehouse may   we are advised by letters from bern dated the  st instant n s that the duke of berwick arrived at lions the   th of the last month and continued his journey the next day to visit the passes of the mountains and other posts in dauphine and provence these letters also informed us that the miseries of the people in france are heightened to that degree that unless a peace be speedily concluded half of that kingdom would perish for want of bread on the   th the marshall de thesse passed through lions in his way to versailles and two battalions which were marching from alsace to reinforce the army of the duke of berwick passed also through that place those troops were to be followed by   battalions more  letters from naples of the   th of april say that the marquis de pries son was arrived there with instructions from his father to signify to the viceroy the necessity his imperial majesty was under of desiring an aid from that kingdom for carrying on the extraordinary expenses of the war on the   th of the same month they made a review of the spanish troops in that garrison and afterward of the marines one part of whom will embark with those designed for barcelona and the rest are to be sent on board the galleys appointed to convoy provisions to that place  we hear from rome by letters dated the  0th of april that the count de mellos envoy from the king of portugal had made his public entry into that city with much state and magnificence the pope has lately held two other consistories wherein he made a promotion of two cardinals but the acknowledgment of king charles is still deferred  letters from other parts of italy advise us that the doge of venice continues dangerously ill that the prince de carignan having relapsed into a violent fever died the   d of april in his  0th year  advices from vienna of the   th of april import that the archbishop of saltzburg is dead who is succeeded by count harrach formerly bishop of vienna and for these last three years coadjutor to the said archbishop and that prince maximilian of lichtenstein has likewise depa ted this life at his country seat called cromaw in moravia these advices add that the emperor has named count zinzendorf count goes and monsieur consbruck for his plenipotentiaries in an ensuing treaty of peace and they hear from hungary that the imperialists have had several successful skirmishes with the malcontents  letters from paris dated may the  th say that the marshall de thesse arrived there on the   th of the last month and that the chevalier de beuil was sent thither by don pedro rouquillo with advice that the confederate squadron appeared before alicant on the   th and having for some time cannonaded the city endeavored to land some troops for the relief of the castle but general stanhope finding the passes well guarded and the enterprise dangerous demanded to capitulate for the castle which being granted him the garrison consisting of  00 regular troops marched out with their arms and baggage the day following and being received on board they immediately set sail for barcelona these letters add that the march of the french and swiss regiments is further deferred for a few days and that the duke of nouilles was just ready to set out for roussillon as well as the count de bezons for catalonia  the same advices say bread was sold at paris for   d per pound and that there was not half enough even at that rate to supply the necessities of the people which reduced them to the utmost despair that  00 men had taken up arms and having plundered the market of the suburb of st germain pressed down by their multitude the kings guards who opposed them two of those mutineers were afterward seized and condemned to death but four others went to the magistrate who pronounced that sentence and told him he must expect to answer with his own life for those of their comrades all order and sense of government being thus lost among the enraged people to keep up a show of authority the captain of the guards who saw all their insolence pretended that he had represented to the king their deplorable condition and had obtained their pardon it is further reported that the dauphin and duchess of burgundy as they went to the opera were surrounded by crowds of people who upbraided them with their neglect of the general calamity in going to diversions when the whole people were ready to perish for want of bread edicts are daily published to suppress these riots and papers with menaces against the government as publicly thrown about among others these words were dropped in a court of justice france wants a ravilliac or a jesuit to deliver her besides this universal distress there is a contagious sickness which it is feared will end in a pestilence letters from bourdeaux bring accounts no less lamentable the peasants are driven by hunger from their abodes into that city and make lamentations in the streets without redress  we are advised by letters from the hague dated the  0th instant n s that on the  th the marquis de torcy arrived there from paris but the passport by which he came having been sent blank by monsieur rouille he was there two days before his quality was known that minister offered to communicate to mons heinsius the proposals which he had to make but the pensionary refused to see them and said he would signify it to the states who deputed some of their own body to acquaint him that they would enter into no negotiation till the arrival of his grace the d of marlborough and the other ministers of the alliance prince eugene was expected there the   th instant from brussels it is said that besides monsieur de torcy and monsieur pajot director general of the posts there are two or three persons at the hague whose names are not known but it is supposed that the duke dalba ambassador from the duke of anjou was one of them the states have sent letters to all the cities of the provinces desiring them to send their deputies to receive the propositions of peace made by the court of france  the tatler no    by isaac bickerstaff esquire from tuesday may   to thursday may     0  wills coffeehouse may   a kinsman has sent me a letter wherein he informs me he had lately resolved to write an heroic poem but by business has been interrupted and has only made one similitude which he should be afflicted to have wholly lost and begs of me to apply it to something being very desirous to see it well placed in the world i am so willing to help the distressed that i have taken it in but though his greater genius might very well distinguish his verses from mine i have marked where his begin his lines are a description of the sun in eclipse which i know nothing more like than a brave man in sorrow who bears it as he should without imploring the pity of his friends or being dejected with the contempt of his enemies as in the case of cato  when all the globe to caesars fortune bowed cato alone his empire disallowed with inborn strength alone opposed mankind with heaven in view to all below it blind regardless of his friends applause or moan alone triumphant since he falls alone  thus when the ruler of the genial day  behind some darkning planet forms his way  desponding mortals with officious care  the concave drum and magic brass prepare  implore him to sustain the important fight  and save depending worlds from endless night  fondly they hope their labor may avail  to ease his conflict and assist his toil  whilst he in beams of native splendour bright  though dark his orb appear to humane sight  shines to the gods with more diffusive light  to distant stars with equal glory burns  inflames their lamps and feeds their golden urns  sure to retain his known superior tract  and proves the more illustrious by defect this is a very lively image but i must take the liberty to say my kinsman drives the sun a little like phaeton he has all the warmth of phoebus but will not stay for his direction of it avail and toil defect and tract will never do for rhimes but however he has the true spirit in him for which reason i was willing to entertain any thing he pleased to send me the subject which he writes upon naturally raises great reflections in the soul and puts us in mind of the mixed condition which we mortals are to support which as it varies to good or bad adorns or defaces our actions to the beholders all which glory and shame must end in what we so much repine at death but doctrines on this occasion any other than that of living well are the most insignificant and most empty of all the labors of men none but a tragedian can die by rule and wait till he discovers a plot or says a fine thing upon his exit in real life this is a chimaera and by noble spirits it will be done decently without the ostentation of it we see men of all conditions and characters go through it with equal resolution and if we consider the speeches of the mighty philosophers heroes lawgivers and great captains they can produce no more in a discerning spirit than rules to make a man a fop on his deathbed commend me to that natural greatness of soul expressed by an innocent and consequently resolute country fellow who said in the pains of the cholick if i once get this breath out of my body you shall hang me before you put it in again honest ned and so he died  but it is to be supposed from this place you may expect an account of such a thing as a new play is not to be omitted that acted this night is the newest that ever was writ the author is my ingenious friend mr thomas d  y this drama is called the modern prophets and is a most unanswerable satyr against the late spirit of enthusiasm the writer had by long experience observed that in company very grave discourses have been followed by bawdry and therefore has turned the humor that way with great success and taken from his audience all manner of superstition by the agitations of pretty mrs bignall whom he has with great subtilty made a laysister as well as a prophetess by which means she carries on the affairs of both worlds with great success my friend designs to go on with another work against winter which he intends to call the modern poets a people no less mistaken in their opinions of being inspired than the other in order to this he has by him several songs besides many ambiguities which cannot be mistaken for any thing but what he means them mr d  y generally writes stateplays and is wonderfully useful to the world in such representations this method is the same that was used by the old athenians to laugh out of countenance or promote opinions among the people my friend has therefore against this play is acted for his own benefit made two dances which may be also of an universal benefit in the first he has represented absolute power in the person of a tall man with an hat and feather who gives his first minister that stands just before him an huge kick the minister gives the kick to the next before and so to the end of the stage in the moral and practical jest you are made to understand that there is in an absolute government no gratification but giving the kick you receive from one above you to one below you this is performed to a grave and melancholy air but on a sudden the tune moves quicker and the whole company fall into a circle and take hands then at a certain sharp note they move round and kick as kick can this latter performance he makes to be the representation of a free state where if you all mind your steps you may go round and round very jollily with a motion pleasant to your selves and those you dance with nay if you put your selves out at the worst you only kick and are kicked like friends and equals  from my own apartment may   of all the vanities under the sun i confess that of being proud of ones birth is the greatest at the same time since in this unreasonable age by the force of prevailing custom things in which men have no hand are imputed to them and that i am used by some people as if isaac bickerstaff though i write my self esquire was no body to set the world right in that particular i shall give you my genealogy as a kinsman of ours has sent it me from the heraldsoffice it is certain and observed by the wisest writers that there are women who are not nicely chaste and men not severely honest in all families therefore let those who may be apt to raise aspersions upon ours please to give us as impartial account of their own and we shall be satisfied the business of heralds is a matter of so great nicety that to avoid mistakes i shall give you my cousins letter verbatim without altering a syllable  dear cousin since you have been pleased to make your self so famous of late by your ingenious writings and some time ago by your learned predictions since partridge of immortal memory is dead and gone who poetical as he was could not understand his own poetry and philomathical as he was could not read his own destiny since the pope the king of france and great part of his court are either literally or metaphorically defunct since i say these things not foretold by any one but your self have come to pass after so surprising a manner it is with no small concern i see the original of the staffian race so little known in the world as it is at this time for which reason as you have employed your studies in astronomy and the occult sciences so i my mother being a welsh woman dedicated mine to genealogy particularly that of our own family which for its antiquity and number may challenge any in great britain the staffs are originally of staffordshire which took its name from them the first that i find of the staffs was one jacobstaff a famous and renowned astronomer who by dorothy his wife had issue seven sons viz bickerstaff longstaff wagstaff quarterstaff whitestaff falstaff and tipstaff he also had a younger brother who was twice married and had five sons viz distaff pikestaff mopstaff broomstaff and raggedstaff as for the branch from whence you spring i shall say very little of it only that it is the chief of the staffs and called bickerstaff quasi biggerstaff as much as to say the great staff or staff of staffs and that it has applied it self to astronomy with great success after the example of our aforesaid forefather the descendants from longstaff the second son were a rakish disorderly sort of people and rambled from one place to another till in harry iis time they settled in kent and were called longtails from the longtails which were sent them as a punishment for the murder of thomas a becket as the legends say they have been always seeked after by the ladies but whether it be to show their aversion to popery or their love to miracles i cannot say the wagstaffs are a merry thoughtless sort of people who have always been opinionated of their own wit they have turned themselves mostly to poetry this is the most numerous branch of our family and the poorest the quarterstaffs are most of them prizefighters or deerstealers there have been so many of them hanged lately that there are very few of that branch of our family left the whitestaffs are all courtiers and have had very considerable places there have been some of them of that strength and dexterity that five hundred of the ablest men in the kingdom have often tugged in vain to pull a staff out of their hands the falstaffs are strangely given to whoring and drinking there are abundance of them in and about london and one thing is very remarkable of this branch and that is there are just as many women as men in it there was a wicked stick of wood of this name in harry ivs time one sir john falstaff as for tipstaff the youngest son he was an honest fellow but his sons and his sons sons have all of them been the veriest rogues living it is this unlucky branch has stocked the nation with that swarm of lawyers attorneys sergeants and bailiffs with which the nation is overrun tipstaff being a seventh son used to cure the kings evil but his rascally descendants are so far from having that healing quality that by a touch upon the shoulder they give a man such an ill habit of body that he can never come abroad afterward this is all i know of the line of jacobstaff his younger brother isaacstaff as i told you before had five sons and was married twice his first wife was a staff for they did not stand upon false heraldry in those days by whom he had one son who in process of time being a schoolmaster and well read in the greek called himself distaff or twicestaff he was not very rich so he put his children out to trades and the distaffs have ever since been employed in the woollen and linen manufactures except my self who am a genealogist pikestaff the eldest son by the second venture was a man of business a downright plodding fellow and withal so plain that he became a proverb most of this family are at present in the army raggedstaff was an unlucky boy and used to tear his clothes a getting birds nests and was always playing with a tame bear his father kept mopstaff fell in love with one of his fathers maids and used to help her to clean the house broomstaff was a chimneysweeper the mopstaffs and broomstaffs are naturally as civil people as ever went out of doors but alas if they once get into ill hands they knock down all before them pilgrimstaff run away from his friends and went strolling about the country and pipestaff was a winecooper these two were the unlawful issue of longstaff  n b the canes the clubs the cudgels the wands the devil upon two sticks and one bread that goes by the name of staff of life are none of our relations  i am dear cousin your humble servant d distaff from the heralds office may    st jamess coffeehouse may   as politic news is not the principal subject on which we treat we are so happy as to have no occasion for that art of cookery which our brother newsmongers so much excel in as appears by their excellent and inimitable manner of dressing up a second time for your taste the same dish which they gave you the day before in case there come over no new pickles from holland therefore when we have nothing to say to you from courts and camps we hope still to give you somewhat new and curious from our selves the women of our house upon occasion being capable of carrying on the bufiness according to the laudable custom of the wives in holland but without further preface take what we have not mentioned in our former relations  letters from hanover of the  0th of the last month say that the prince royal of prussia arrived there on the   th and left that court on the second of this month in pursuit of his journey to flanders where he makes the ensuing campaign those advices add that the young prince nassau hereditary governor of friesland consummated on the   th of the last month his marriage with the beaureous princess of hessecassel with a pomp and magnificence suitable to their age and quality  letters from paris say his most christian majesty retired to marly on the first instant n s and our last advices from spain inform us that the prince of asturias had made his public entry into madrid in great splendour the duke of anjou has given don joseph hartado de amaraga the government of terrafirma de veragua and the presidency of panama in america they add that the forces commanded by the marquis de bay has been reinforced by six battalions of spanish and walloon guards letters from lisbon advise that the army of the king of portugal was at elvas on the   d of the last month and would decamp on the   th in order to march upon the enemy who lay at badajos  yesterday at four in the morning his grace the duke of marlborough set out for margate and embarked for holland at eight this morning  yesterday also sir george thorold was declared alderman of cordwainers ward in the room of his brother sir charles thorold deceased  the tatler no    from thursd may   to saturd may     0  may   when a man has engaged to keep a stagecoach he is obliged whether he has passengers or not to set out thus it fares with us weekly historians but indeed for my particular i hope i shall soon have little more to do in this work than to publish what is sent me from such as have leisure and capacity for giving delight and being pleased in an elegant manner the present grandeur of the british nation might make us expect that we should rise in our public diversions and manner of enjoying life in proportion to our advancement in glory and power instead of that take and survey this town and you will find rakes and debauchees are your men of pleasure thoughtless atheists and illiterate drunkards call themselves freethinkers and gamesters banterers biters swearers and twenty new born insects more are in their several species the modern men of wit hence it is that a man who has been out of town but one half year has lost the language and must have some friend to stand by him and keep him in countenance for talking common sense to day i saw a short interlude at whites of this nature which i took notes of and put together as well as i could in a public place the persons of the drama are pip the last gentleman that has been made so at cards trimmer a person half undone at them and is now between a cheat and a gentleman acorn an honest english man of good plain sense and meaning and mr friendly a reasonable man of the town  whites chocolatehouse may   enter pip trim and acorn ac what is the matter gentlemen what take no notice of an old friend   pip pox on it dont talk to me i am voweld by the count and cursedly out of humor   ac voweld prithee trimmer what does he mean by that   trim have a care harry speak softly dont show your ignorance  if you do they will bite you wherever they meet you they are such cursed curs  the present wits   ac bite me what do you mean   pip why dont you know what biting is nay you are in the right on it however one would learn it only to defend ones self against men of wit as one would know the tricks of play to be secure against the cheats but dont you hear acorn that report that some potentates of the alliance have taken care of themselves exclusive of us   ac how heaven forbid after all our glorious victories all this expense of blood and treasure   pip bite    ac bite how   trim nay he has bit you fairly enough that is certain   ac pox i dont feel it  how where  exit pip and trimmer laughing ac ho mr friendly your most humble servant you heard what passed between those fine gentlemen and me pip complained to me that he has been voweld and they tell me i am bit   friend you are to understand sir that simplicity of behavior which is the perfection of good breeding and good sense is utterly lost in the world and in the room of it there are started a thousand little inventions which men barren of better things take up in the place of it thus for every character in conversation that used to please there is an impostor put upon you him whom we allowed formerly for a certain pleasant subtilty and natural way of giving you an unexpected hit called a droll is now mimickd by a biter who is a dull fellow that tells you a lie with a grave face and laughs at you for knowing him no better than to believe him instead of that sort of companion who could rally you and keep his countenance till he made you fall into some little inconsistency of behavior at which you your self could laugh with him you have the sneerer who will keep you company from morning to night to gather your follies of the day which perhaps you commit out of confidence in him and expose you in the evening to all the scorners in town for your man of sense and free spirit whose set of thoughts were built upon learning reason and experience you have now an impudent creature made up of vice only who supports his ignorance by his courage and want of learning by contempt of it   ac dear sir hold what you have told me already of this change in conversation is too miserable to be heard with any delight but methinks as these new creatures appear in the world it might give an excellent field to writers for the stage to divert us with the representation of them there   friend no no as you say there might be some hopes of redress of these grievances if there were proper care taken of the theater but the history of that is yet more lamentable than that of the decay of conversation i gave you   ac pray sir a little i have not been in town these six years till within this fortnight   friend it is now some years since several revolutions in the gay world had made the empire of the stage subject to very fatal convulsions which were too dangerous to be cured by the skill of little king oberon who then sat in the throne of it the laziness of this prince threw him upon the choice of a person who was fit to spend his life in contentions an able and profound attorney to whom he mortgaged his whole empire this divite is the most skilful of all politicians he has a perfect art in being unintelligible in discourse and uncomeatable in business but he having no understanding in this polite way brought in upon us to get in his money ladderdancers ropedancers jugglers and mountebanks to strut in the place of shakespeares heroes and johnsons humourists when the seat of wit was thus mortgaged without equity of redemption an architect arose who has built the muse a new palace but secured her no retinue so that instead of action there we have been put off by song and dance this latter help of sound has also began to fail for want of voices therefore the palace has since been put into the hands of a surgeon who cuts any foreign fellow into an eunuch and passes him upon us for a singer of italy   ac i will go out of town to morrow   friend things are come to this pass and yet the world will not understand that the theater has much the same effect on the manners of the age as the bank on the credit of the nation wit and spirit humor and good sense can never be revived but under the government of those who are judges of such talents who know that whatever is put up in their stead is but a short and trifling expedient to support the appearance of them for a season it is possible a peace will give leisure to put these matters under new regulations but at present all the assistance we can see toward our recovery is as far from giving us help as a poultice is from performing what can be done only by the grand elixir   wills coffeehouse may   according to our late design in the applauded verses on the morning which you lately had from hence we proceed to improve that just intention and present you with other labors made proper to the place in which they were written the following poem comes from copenhagen and is as fine a winterpiece as we have ever had from any of the schools of the most learned painters such images as these give us a new pleasure in our sight and fix upon our minds traces of reflection which accompany us whenever the like objects occur in short excellent poetry and description dwell upon us so agreeably that all the readers of them are made to think if not write like men of wit but it would be injury to detain you longer from this excellent performance which is addressed to the earl of dorset by mr philips the author of several choice poems in mr tonsons new miscellany  copenhagen march     0  from frozen climes and endless tracks of snow from streams that northern winds forbid to flow what present shall the muse to dorset bring or how so near the pole attempt to sing the heary winter here conceals from sight all pleasing objects that to verse invite the hills and dales and the delightful woods the flowery plains and silver streaming floods by snow disguised in bright confusion lie and with one dazzling waste fatigue the eye no gentle breathing breeze prepares the spring no birds within the desert region sing the ships unmoved the boisterous winds defy while rattling chariots over the ocean fly the vast leviathan wants room to play and spout his waters in the face of day the starving wolves along the main sea prowl and to the moon in icy valleys howl for many a shining league the level main here spreads it self into a glassy plain there solid billows of enormous size alps of green ice in wild disorder rise and yet but lately have i seen even here the winter in a lovely dress appear eer yet the clouds lot fall the treasured snow or winds begun through hazy skies to blow at evening a keen eastern breeze arose and the descending rain unsullied freze soon as the silent shades of night withdrew the ruddy morn disclosed at once to view the face of nature in a rich disguise and brightened every object to my eyes for every shrub and every blade of grass and every pointed thorn seemed wrought in glass in pearls and rubies rich the hawthorns show while through the ice the crimson berries glow the thick sprung reeds the watery marshes yield seem polished lances in a hostile field the stag in limpid currents with surprise sees crystal branches on his forehead rise the spreading oak the beech and towering pine glazed over in the freezing ether shine the frighted birds the rattling branches shun that wave and glitter in the distant sun when if a sudden gust of wind arise the brittle forest into atoms flies the crackling wood beneath the tempest bends and in a spangled shower the prospect ends or if a southern gale the region warm and by degrees unbind the wintry charm the traveller a miry country sees and journeys sad beneath the dropping trees like some deluded peasant merlin leads through fragrant bowers and through delicious meads while here enchanted gardens to him rise and airy fabrics there attract his eyes his wandering feet the magic paths pursue and while he thinks the fair illusion true the trackless scenes disperse in fluid air and woods and wilds and thorny ways appear a tedious road the weary wretch returns and as he goes the transiens vision mourns from my own apartment may   there has a mail this day arrived from holland but the matter of the advices importing rather what gives us great expectations than any positive assurances i shall for this time decline giving you what i know and apply the following verses of mr dryden in the second part of almanzor to the present circumstances of things without discovering what my knowledge in astronomy suggests to me  when empire in its childhood first appears a watchful fate eersees its tender years till grown more strong it thrusts and stretches out and elbows all the kingdoms round about the place thus made for its first breathing free it moves again for ease and luxury till swelling by degrees it has possessed the greater space and now crowds up the rest when from behind there starts some petty state and pushes on its now unweildy fate then down the precipice of time it goes and sinks in minutes which in ages rose the tatler no    from saturd may   to tuesd may  0   0  from my own apartment may   much hurry and business had to day perplexed me into a mood too thoughtful for going into company for which reason in stead of the tavern i went into lincolns innwalks and having taken a round or two i sat down according to the allowed familiarity of these places on a bench at the other end of which sat a venerable gentleman who speaking with a very affable air mr bickerstaff said he i take it for a very great piece of good fortune that you have found me out sir said i i had never that i know of the honor of seeing you before that replied he is what i have often lamented but i assure you i have for many years done you good offices without being observed by you or else when you had any little glimpse of my being concerned in an affair you have fled from me and shunned me like an enemy but however the part i am to act in the world is such that i am to go on in doing good though i meet with never so many repulses even from those i oblige this thought i shows a great good nature but little judgment in the persons upon whom he confers his favors he immediately took notice to me that he observed by my countenance i thought him indiscreet in his beneficence and proceeded to tell me his quality in the following manner i know thee isaac to be so well versed in the occult sciences that i need not much preface or make long preparations to gain you faith that there are airy beings who are employed in the care and attendance of men as nurses are to infants till they come to an age in which they can actof themselves these beings are usually called amongst men guardian angels and mr bickerstaff i am to acquaint you that i am to be yours for some time to come it being our orders to vary our stations and sometimes to have me pationt under our protection and sometimes another with a power of assuming what shape we please to ensuare our words unto their own good i have of late been upon such hard duty and know you have so much work for me that i think fit to appear to you face to face to desire you would give me as little occasion for vigilance as you can sir said i it will be a great instruction to me in my behavior if you please to give me some account of your late employments and what hardships or satisfactions you have had in them that i may govern my self accordingly he answered to give you an example of the drudgery we go through i will entertain you only with my three last stations i was on the first of april last put to mortify a great beauty with whom i was a week from her i went to a common swearer and have been last with a gamester when i first came to my lady i found my great work was to guard well her eyes and ears but her flatterers were so numerous and the house after the modern way so full of lookingglasses that i seldom had her safe but in her sleep whenever we went abroad we were surrounded by an army of enemies when a wellmade man appeared he was sure to have a sideglance of observation if a disagreeable fellow he had a full face out of mere inclination to conquests but at the close of the evening on the sixth of the last month my ward was fitting on a couch reading ovids epistles and as she came to this line of helen to paris she half consents who silently denies entered philander who is the most skilful of all men in an address to women he is arrived at the perfection of that art which gains them which is to talk like a very miserable man but look like a very happy one i saw dictinna blush at his entrance which gave me the alarm but he immediately said something so agreeable on her being at study and the novelty of finding a lady employed in so grave a manner that he on a sudden became very familiarly a man of no consequence and in an instant laid all her suspicions of his skill asleep as he almost had done mine till i observed him very dangerously turn his discourse upon the elegance of her dress and her judgment in the choice of that very pretty mourning having had women before under my care i trembled at the apprehension of a man of sense who could talk upon trifles and resolved to stick to my post with all the circumspection imaginable in short i prepossessed her against all he could say to the advantage of her dress and person but he turned again the discourse where i found i had no power o ver her on the abusing her friends and acquaintance he allowed indeed that flora had a little beauty and a great deal of wit but then she was so ungainly in her behavior and such a laughing hoyden  pastorella had with him the allowance of being blameless but what was that toward being praiseworthy to be only innocent is not to be virtuous he afterward spoke so much against mrs dipples forehead mrs prims mouth mrs dentifrices teeth and mrs fidgets cheeks that she grew downright in love with him for it is always to be understood that a lady takes all you detract from the rest of her sex to be a gift to her in a word things went so far that i was dismissed and she will remember that evening nine months from the sixth of april by a very remarkable token the next as i said i went to was a common swearer never was a creature so puzzled as my self when i came first to view his brain half of it was worn out and filled up with mere expletives that had nothing to do with any other parts of the texture therefore when he called for his clothes in a morning he would cry john  john does not answer what a plague no body there what the devil and rot me john for a laxy dog as you are i knew no way to cure him but by writing down all he said one morning as he was dressing and laying it before him on the toilet when he came to pick his teeth the last recital i gave him of what he said for half an hour before was what a pox rot me where is the washball call the chairmen damn em i warrant they are at the alehouse already zounds and confound em when he came to the glass he takes up my note  ha this fellow is worse than me what does he swear with pen and ink but reading on he found them to be his own words the stratagem had so good an effect upon him that he grew immediately a new man and is learning to speak without an oath which makes him extremely short in his phrases for as i observed before a common swearer has a brain without any idea on the swearing side therefore my ward has yet mighty little to say and is forced to substitute some other vehicle of nonsense to supply the defect of his usual expletives when i left him he made use of odsbodikins oh me and never stir alive and so forth which gave me the hopes of his recovery so i went to the next i told you of the gamester when we first take our place about a man the receptacles of the pericranium are immediately searched in his i found no one ordinary trace of thinking but strong passion violent desires and a continued series of different changes had torn it to pieces there appeared no middle condition the triumph of a prince or the misery of a beggar were his alternate states i was with him no longer than one day which was yesterday in the morning at twelve we were worth four thousand pounds at three we were arrived at six thousand half an hour after we were reduced to one thousand at four of the clock we were down to two hundred at five to fifty at six to five at seven to one guinea the next bet to nothing this morning he borrowed half a crown of the maid who cleans his shoes and is now gaming in lincolnsinnfields among the boys for farthings and oranges till he has made up three pieces and then he returns to whites into the best company in town this ended our first discourse and it is hoped you will forgive me that i have picked so little out of my companion at our first interview in the next it is possible he may tell me more pleasing incidents for though he is a familiar he is not an evil spirit  st jamess coffeehouse may   we hear from the hague of the   th instant n s that monsieur de torcy has had frequent conferences with the grand pensioner and the other ministers who were heretofore commissioned to treat with monsieur rouille the preliminaries of a peace are almost settled and the proceedings wait only for the arrival of the duke of marlborough after whose approbation of the articles proposed it is not doubted but the methods of the treaty will be publicly known in the mean time the states have declared an abhorrence of making any step in this great affair but in concert with the court of great britain and other princes of the alliance the posture of affairs in franes does necessarily oblige that nation to be very much in earnest in their offers and monsieur de torcy has professed to the grand pensioner that he will avoid all occasions of giving him the least jealousy of his using any address in private conversations for accomplishing the ends of his embassy it is said that as soon as the preliminaries are adjusted that minister is to return to the french court the states of holland have resolved to make it an instruction to all their men of war and privateers to bring into their ports whatever neutral ships they shall meet with laden with corn and bound for france and to avoid all cause of complaint from the potentates to whom these ships shall belong their full demand for their freight shall be paid them there the french protestants residing in that country have applied themselves to their respective magistrates desiring that there may be an article in the treaty of peace which may give liberty of conscience to the protestants in france monsieur bosnage minister of the walloon church at rotterdam has been at the hague and has had some conferences with the deputies of the states on that subject it is reported there that all the french refugees in those dominions are to be naturalized that they may enjoy the same good effects of the treaty with the hollanders themselves in respect to france  letters from paris say the people conceiv great hopes of a sudden peace from monsieu torcys being employed in the negotiation h being a minister of too great weight in that court to be sent on any employment in which his master would not act in a manner wherein he might justly promise himself success the france advices add that there is an insurrection in poicton  000 men having taken up arms and beaten the troops which were appointed to disperse them three of the mutineers being taken were immediately executed and as many of the kings party were used after the same manner  our late act of naturalization has had so great an effect in foreign parts that some princes have prohibited the french refugees in their dominions to sell or transfer their estates to any other of their subjects and at the same time have granted them greater immunities than they hitherto enjoyed it has been also thought necessary to restrain their own subjects from leaving their native country on pain of death  the tatler no    from tuesd may  0 to thursd may      0  from my own apartment may  0 had it not been that my familiar had appeared to me as i told you in my last in person i had certainly been unable to have found even words without meaning to keep up my intelligence with the town but he has checked me severely for my despondence and ordered me to go on in my design of observing upon things and forbearing persons for said he the age you live in is such that a good picture of any vice or virtue will infallibly be misrepresented and though none will take the kind descriptions you make so much to themselves as to wish well to the author yet all will resent the ill characters you produce out of fear of their own turn in the license you must be obliged to take if you point at particular persons i took his admonition kindly and immediately promised him to beg pardon of the author of the advice to the poets for my raillery upon his work though i aimed at no more in that examination but to convince him and all men of genius of the folly of laying themselves out on such plans as are below their characters i hope too it was done without illbreeding and nothing spoken below what a civilian as it is allowed i am may utter to a physician after this preface all the world may be safe from my writings for if i can find nothing to commend i am silent and will forbear the subject for though i am a reformer i scorn to be an inquisitor  it would become all men as well as me to lay before em the noble character of verus the magistrate who always sat in triumph over and contempt of vice he never searched after it or spared it when it came before him at the same time he could see through the hypocrisy and disguise of those who have no pretense to virtue themselves but by their severity to the vicious this same verus was in times long past chief justice as we call it amongst us in faelicia he was a man of profound knowledge of the laws of his country and as just an observer of em in his own person he considered justice as a cardinal virtue not as a trade for maintenance wherever he was judge he never forgot that he was also council the criminal before him was always sure he stood before his country and in a sort a parent of it the prisoner knew that though his spirit was broken with guilt and incapable of language to defend it self all would be gathered from him which could conduce to his safety and that his judge would wrest no law to destroy him nor conceal any that could save him in his time there were a nest of pretenders to justice who happened to be employed to put things in a method for being examined before him at his usual sessions these animals were to verus as monkeys are to men so like that you can hardly disown them but so base that you are ashamed of their fraternity it grew a phrase who would do justice on the justices that certainly would verus i have seen an old trial where he sat judge on two of em one was called tricktrack the other tearshift one was a learned judge of sharpers the other the quickest of all men at finding out a wench tricktrack never spared a pickpocket but was a companion to cheats tearshift would make compliments to wenches of quality but certainly commit poor ones if a poor rogue wanted a lodging tricktrack sent him to gaol for a thief if a poor whore went only with one thin petticoat tearshift would imprison her for being loose in her dress these patriots infested the days of verus while they alternately committed and released each others prisoners but verus regarded them as criminals and always looked upon men as they stood in the eye of justice without respecting whether they sat on the bench or stood at the bar  wills coffeehouse may    yesterday we were entertained with the tragedy of the earl of essex in which there is not one good line and yet a play which was never seen without drawing tears from some part of the audience a remarkable instance that the soul is not to be moved by words but things for the incidents in this drama are laid together so happily that the spectator makes the play for himself by the force which the circumstance has upon his imagination thus in spite of the most dry discourses and expressions almost ridiculous with respect to propriety it is impossible for one unprejudiced to see it untouched with pity i must confess this effect is not wrought on such as examine why they are pleased but it never fails to appear on those who are not too learned in nature to be moved by her first suggestions it is certain the person and behavior of mr wilks has no small share in conducing to the popularity of the play and when an handsome fellow is going to a more course exit than beheading his shape and countenance makes every tender one reprieve him with all her heart without waiting till she hears his dying words  this evening the alchymist was played this comedy is an example of bens extensive genius and penerration into the passions and follies of mankind the scene in the fourth act where all the cheated people oppose the man that would open their eyes has something in it so inimitably excellent that it is certainly as great a masterpiece as has ever appeared by any hand the authors great address in showing covetousness the motive of the actions of the puritan the epicure the gamester and the trader that all their endeavors how differently soever they seem to tend center only in that one point of gain shows he had to a great perfection that discernment of spirit which constitutes a genius for comedy  whites chocolatehouse may    it is not to be imagined how far the violence of our desires will carry us toward our own deceit in the pursuit of what we wish for a gentleman here this evening was giving me an account of a dumb fortune tellers who outdoes mr partridge my self or the unborndoctor for predictions all his visitants come to him full of expectations and pay his own rate for the interpretations they put upon his shrugs and nods there is a fine rich citywidow stole thither the other day though it is not six weeks since her husbands departure from her company to rest and with her trusty maid demanded of him whether she should marry again by holding up two fingers like horns on her forehead the wizard held up both her hands forked the relict desired to know whether he meant by his holding up both hands to represent that she had one husband before and that she should have another or that he intimated she should have two more the cunning man looked a little sour upon which betty jogged her mistress who gave the other guinea and he made her understand she should positively have two more but shaked his head and hinted that they should not live long with her the widow sighed and gave him the other half guinea after this prepossession all that she had next to do was to make sallies to our end of the town and find out who it is her fate to have there are two who frequent this place whom she takes for men of vogue and of whom her imagination has given her the choice they are both the appearances of fine gentlemen to such as do not know when they see persons of that turn and indeed they are industrious enough to come at that character to deserve the reputation of being such but this town will not allow us to be the thing we seem to aim at and are too discerning to be fobbd off with pretenses one of these pretty fellows fails by his laborious exactness the other by his as much studied negligence frank careless as soon as his valet has helped on and adjusted his clothes goes to his glass sets his wig awry tumbles his cravat and in short undresses himself to go into company will nice is so little satisfied with his dress that all the time he is at a visit he is still mending it and is for that reason the more insufferable for he who studies carelessness has at least his work the sooner done of the two the widow is distracted whom to take for her first man for nice is every way so careful that she fears his length of days and frank is so loose that she has apprehensions for her own health with him i am puzzled how to give a just idea of them but in a word careless is a coxcomb and nice a fop both you will say very hopeful candidates for a gay woman just set at liberty but there is a whisper her maid will give her to tom terror the gamester this fellow has undone so many women that he will certainly succeed if he is introduced for nothing so much prevails with the vain part of that sex as the glory of deceiving them who have deceived others  desunt multa st jamess coffeehouse may    letters from berlin bearing date may    n s inform us that the birthday of her prussian majesty has been celebrated there with all possible magnificence and the king made her on that occasion a present of jewels to the value of thirty thousand crowns the marquis de quesne who has distinguished himself by his great zeal for the protestant interest was at the time of the dispatch of these letters at that court soliciting the king to take care that an article in behalf of the refugees admitting their return to france should be inserted in the treaty of peace they write from hanover of the   th that his electoral highness had received an express from count merci representing how necessary it was to the common cause that he would please to hasten to the rhine for that nothing but his presence could quicken the measures toward bringing the imperial army into the field there are very many speculations upon the intended interview of the king of denmark and king augustus the latter has made such preparations for the reception of the other

ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to the stategeneral was driven into the veer in zealand on thursday last from whence he came to the hague within few hours after the arrival of his grace the duke soon after his coming to the hague had a visit from the pensioner of holland all things relating to the peace were in suspense till this interview nor is it yet known what resolutions will be taken on that subject for the troops of the allies have fresh orders dispatched to them to move from their respective quarters and march with all expedition to the frontiers where the enemy are making their utmost efforts for the defense of their country these advices further inform us that the marquis de torcy had received an answer from the court of france to his letters which he had sent thither by an express on the friday before  mr bickerstaff has received letters from mr coltstaff mr whipstaff and mrs rebecca wagstaff all which relate chiefly to their being left out in the genealogy of the family lately published but my cousin being a clerk in the heralds office who writ that draught and being at present under the displeasure of the chapter it is feared if that matter should be touched upon at this time the young gentleman would lose his place for treason against the kings at arms  the tatler no    from thursd may    to saturd may      0  from my own apartment may    i have taken a resolution hereafter on any want of intelligence to carry my familiar abroad with me who has promised to give me very proper and just notices of persons and things to make up the history of the passing day he is wonderfully skilful in the knowledge of men and manners which has made me more than ordinary curious to know how he came to that perfection and i communicated to him that doubt mr pacolet said i i am mightily surpised to see you so good a judge of our nature and circumstances since you are a mere spirit and have no knowledge of the bodily parts of us he answered smiling you are mistaken i have been one of you and lived a month amongst you which gives me an exact sense of your condition you are to know that all who enter into humane life have a certain date or stamen given to their being which they only who die of age may be said to have arrived at but it is ordered sometimes by fate that such as die infants are after death to attend mankind to the end of that stamen of being in themselves which was broke off by sickness or any other disafter these are proper guardians to men as being insensible of the infirmity of their state you are philosopher enough to know that the difference of mens understanding proceeds only from the various dispositions of their organs so that he who dies at a month old is in the next life as knowing though more innocent as they who live to fifty and after death they have as perfect a memory and judgment of all that passed in their lifetime as i have of all the revolutions in that uneasy turbulent condition of yours and you would say i had enough of it in a month were i to tell you all my misfortunes a life of a month cannot have one would think much variety but pray said i let us have your story  then he proceeds in the following manner  it was one of the most wealthy families in great britain into which i was born and it was a very great happiness to me that it so happened otherwise i had still in all probability been living but i shall recount to you all the occurrences of my short and miserable existence just as by examining into the traces made in my brain they appeared to me at that time the first thing that ever struck my senses was a noise over my head of one shrieking after which methought i took a full jump and found my self in the hands of a sorceress who seemed as if she had been long waking and employed in some incantation i was thoroughly frightened and cried out but she immediately seemed to go on in some magical operation and anointed me from head to foot what they meant i could not imagine for there gathered a great crowd about me crying an heir an heir upon which i grew a little still and believed this was a ceremony to be used only to great persons and such as made them what they called heirs i lay very quiet but the witch for no manner of reason or provocation in the world takes me and binds my head as hard as possibly she could then ties up both my legs and makes me swallow down an horrid mixture i thought it an harsh entrance into life to begin with taking physic but i was forced to it or else must have taken down a great instrument in which she gave it me when i was thus dressed i was carried to a bedside where a fine young lady my mother i wot had like to have hugged me to death from her they faced me about and there was a thing with quite another look from the rest of the room to whom they talked about my nose he seemed wonderfully pleased to see me but i knew since my nose belonged to another family that into which i was born is one of the most numerous amongst you therefore crowds of relations came every day to congratulate my arrival among others my cousin betty the greatest romp in nature she whisks me such a height over her head that i cried out for fear of falling she pinched me and called me squealing chit and threw me into a girls arms that was taken in to tend me the girl was very proud of the womanly employment of a nurse and took upon her to strip and dress me anew because i made a noise to see what ailed me she did so and stuck a pin in every joint about me i still cried upon which she lays me on my face in her lap and to quiet me fell a nailing in all the pins by clapping me on the back and skreaming a lullaby but my pain made me exalt my voice above hers which brought up the nurse the witch i first saw and my grandmother the girl is turned down stairs and i stripped again as well to find what ailed me as to satisfy my granams further curiosity this good old womans visit was the cause of all my troubles you are to understand that i was hitherto bred by hand and any body that stood next gave me pap if i did but open my lips insomuch that i was grown so cunning as to pretend my self asleep when i was not to prevent my being crammed but my grandmother began a loud lecture upon the idleness of the wives of this age who for fear of their shapes forbear suckling their own offspring and ten nurses were immediately sent for one was whispered to have a wanton eye and would soon spoil her milk another was in a consumption the third had an ill voice and would frighten me instead of lulling me to sleep such exceptions were made against all but one country milchwench to whom i was committed and put to the breast this careless jade was eternally romping with the footmen and downright starved me insomuch that i daily pined away and should never have been relieved had it not been that on the thirtieth day of my life a fellow of the royal society who had writ upon cold baths came to visit me and solemnly protested i was utterly lost for want of that method upon which he sousd me head and ears into a pail of water where i had the good fortune to be drowned and so escaped being lashed into a linguist till sixteen running after wenches till twenty five and being married to an ill natured wife till sixty which had certainly been my fate had not the enchantment between body and soul been broke by this philosopher thus till the age i should have otherwise lived i am obliged to watch the steps of men and if you please shall accompany you in your present walks and get you intelligence from the aerial lacquey who is in waiting what are the thoughts and purposes of any whom you enquire for i accepted his kind offer and immediately took him with me in an hack to whites  whites chocolatehouse may    we got in hither and my companion threw a powder round us that made me as invisible as himself so that we could see and hear all others our selves unseen and unheard  the first thing we took notice of was a nobleman of a goodly and frank aspect with his generous birth and temper visible in it playing at cards with a creature of a black and horrid countenance wherein were plainly delineated the arts of his mind cousenage and falsehood they were marking their game with counters on which we could see inscriptions imperceptible to any but us my lord had scord with pieces of ivory on which were writ good fame glory riches honor and posterity the spectre over against him had on his counters the inscriptions of dishonor impudence poverty ignorance and want of shame bless me said i sure my lord does not see what he plays for as well as i do says pacolet he despises that fellow he plays with and scorns himself for making him his companion at the very instant he was speaking i saw the fellow who played with my lord hide two cards in the roll of his stocking pacolet immediately stole em from thence upon which the nobleman soon after won the game the little triumph he appeared in when he got such a triing stock of ready money though he had ventured so great sums with indifference increased my admiration but pacolet began to talk to me mr isaac this to you looks wonderful but not at all to us higher beings that noble has as many good qualities as any man of his order and seems to have no faults but what as i may say are excrescencies from virtues he is generous to a prodigality more affable than is consistent with his quality and courageous to a rashness yet after all this the source of his whole conduct is though he would hate himself if he knew it mere avarice the ready cash laid before the gamesters counters makes him venture as you see and lay distinction against infamy abundance against want in a word all that is desirable against all that is to be avoided however said i be sure you disappoint the sharpers to night and steal from em all the cards they hide pacolet obeyed me and my lord went home with their whole bank in his pocket  wills coffeehouse may    to night was acted a second time a comedy called the busy body this play is written by a lady in old times we used to sit upon a play here after it was acted but now the entertainment is turned another way not but there are considerable men appear in all ages who for some eminent quality or invention deserve the esteem and thanks of the public such a benefector is a gentleman of this house who is observed by the surgeons with much envy for he has invented an engine for the prevention of harms by loveadventures and by great care and application has made it an immodesty to name his name this act of selfdenial has gained this worthy member of the commonwealth a great reputation some lawgiver have departed from their abodes for ever an commanded the observation of their laws til their return others have used other artifice to fly the applause of their merit but this person shuns glory with greater address and has by giving his engine his own name made it obscene to speak of him more however he is ranked among and received by the modern wits as a great promoter of gallantry and pleasure but i fear pleasure is less understood in this age which so much pretends to it than in any since the creation twas admirably said of him who first took notice that res est severa voluptas there is a certain severity in pleasure without that all decency is banished and if reason is not to be present at our greatest satisfactions of all the races of creatures the humane is the most miserable it was not so of old when virgil describes a wit he always means a virtuous man and all his sentiments of men of genius are such as show persons distinguished from the common level of mankind such as placed happiness in the contempt of low fears and mean gratifications fears which we are subject to with the vulgar and pleasures which we have in common with beasts with these illustrious personages the wisest man was the greatest wit and none was thought worthy of that character unless he answered this excellent description of the poet  qui  metus omnes and inexorabile fatum subjecit pedibus strepitumque acherontis avari st jamess coffeehouse may    we had this morning advice that some english merchant ships convoyed by the bristol of    guns were met with by a part of mons du gui trouins squadron who engaged the convoy that ship defended it self till the english merchants got clear of the enemy but being disabled was her self taken within few hours after my lord dursley came up with part of his squadron and engaging the french retook the bristol which being very much shattered sunk and took the glorieux a ship of    guns as also a privateer of    before this action his lordship had taken two french merchant men and had at the dispatch of these advices brought the

what passes among the good company of that place and allowed me to transcribe one of them that seems to be writ by some of sir thomass particular acquaintance and is as follows  dear knight i desire you would give my humble service to all our friends which i speak of to you out of method in the very beginning of my epistle lest the present disorders by which this seat of gallantry and pleasure is torn to pieces should make me forget it you keep so good company that you know bath is stocked with such as come hither to be relieved from luxuriant health or imaginary sickness and consequently is always as well stowed with gallants as invalids who live together in a very good understanding but the season is so early that our fine company is not yet arrived and the warm bath which in heathen times was dedicated to venus is now used only by such as really want it for healths sake there are however a good many strangers among whom are two ambitious ladies who being both in the autumn of their life take the opportunity of placing themselves at the head of such as we are before the chloes clarissas and pastorellas come down one of these two is excessively in pain that the ugly being called time will make wrinkles in spite of the lead foreheadcloth and therefore hides with the gaiery of her air the volubility of her tongue and quickness of her motion the injuries which it has done her the other lady is but two years behind her in life and dreads as much being laid aside as the former and consequently has taken the necessary precautions to prevent her reign over us but she is very discreet and wonderfully turned for ambition being never apparently transported either with affectation or malice thus while florimel is talking in public and spreading her graces in assemblies to gain a popular dominion over our diversions prudentia visits very cunningly all the lame the splenatick and the superannuated who have their distinct classes of followers and friends among these she has found that some body has sent down printed certificates of florimels age which she has read and distributed to this unjoyful set of people who are always enemies to those in possession of the good opinion of the company this unprovoked injury done by prudentia was the first occasion of our fatal divisions here and a declaration of war between these rivals florimel has abundance of wit which she has lavished in decrying prudentia and giving defiance to her little arts for an instance of her superior power she bespoke the play of alexander the great to be acted by the company of strollers and desired us all to be there on thursday last when she spoke to me to come as you are said she a lover you will not fail the death of alexander the passion of love is wonderfully hit  statira oh that happy woman  to have a conqueror at her feet  but you will be sure to be there i and several others resolved to be of her party but see the irresistible strength of that unsuspected creature a silent woman prudentia had counterplotted us and had bespoke on the same evening the poppershow of the creation of the world she had engaged every body to be there and to turn our leader into ridicule had secretly let em know that the poppet eve was made the most like florimel that ever was seen on thursday morning the poppetdrummer adam and eve and several others who lived before the flood passed through the streets on horseback to invite us all to the pastime and the representation of such things as we all knew to be true and mr mayor was so wise as to prefer these innocent people the poppets who he said were to represent christians before the wicked players who were to show alexander an heathen philosopher to be short this prudentia had so laid it that at ten of the clock footmen were sent to take places at the poppetshow and all we of florimels party were to be out of fashion or desert her we chose the latter all the world crowded to prudentias house because it was given out no body could get in when we came to noahs flood in the show punch and his wife were introduced dancing in the ark an honest plain friend of florimels but a critic withal rose up in the midst of the representation and made many very good exceptions to the drama it self and told us that it was against all morality as well as rules of the stage that punch should be in jest in the deluge or indeed that he should appear at all this was certainly a just remark and i thought to second him but he was hissed by prudentias party upon which really sir thomas we who were his friends hissed him too old mrs petulent desired both her daughters to mind the moral then whispered mrs mayoress this is very proper for young people to see punch at the end of the play made madam prudentia a compliment and was very civil to the whole company making bows till his buttons touched the ground all was carried triumphantly against our party in the mean time florimel went to the tragedy dressed as fine as hands could make her in hopes to see prudentia pine away with envy instead of that she sat a full hour alone and at last was entertained with this whole relation from statira who wiped her eyes with her tragical cut handkerchief and lamented the ignorance of the quality florimel was stung with this affront and the next day bespoke the poppetshow prudentia insolent with power bespoke alexander the whole company came then to alexander madam petulant desired her daughters to mind the moral and believe no mans fair words for you will see children said she these soldiers are never to be depended upon they are sometimes here sometimes there  dont you see daughter betty colonel clod our next neighbor in the country pulls off his hat to you courtsie good child his estate is just by us florimel was now mortified down to prudentias humor and prudentia exalted into hers this was observed florimel invites us to the play a second time prudentia to the show see the uncertainty of humane affairs the beaux the wits the gamesters the prues the coquets the valitudinarians and gallants all now wait upon florimel such is the state of things at this present date and if there happens any new commotions you shall have immediate advice from  sir your affectionate friend and servant bath may      0   to castabella madam i have the honor of a letter from a friend of yours relating to an incivility done to you at the opera by one of your own sex but i who was an eyewitness of the accident can testify to you that though she pressed before you she lost her ends in that design for she was taken notice of for no other reason but her endeavors to hide a finer woman than her self but indeed i dare not go further in this matter than just this bare mention for though it was taking your place of right rather than place of precedence yet it is so tender a point and on which the very life of female ambition depends that it is of the last consequence to meddle in it all my hopes are from your beautiful sex and those bright eyes which are the bane of others are my only sunshine my writings are sacred to you and i hope i shall always have the good fortune to live under your protection therefore take this public opportunity to signify to all the world that i design to forbear any thing that may in the least tend to the diminution of your interest reputation or power you will therefore forgive me that i strive to conceal every wrong step made by any who have the honor to wear petticoats and shall at all times do what is in my power to make all mankind as much their slaves as my self if they would consider things as they ought there needs not much argument to convince em that it is their fate to be obedient to you and that your greatest rebels do only serve with a worse grace i am  madam your most obedient and most humble servant isaac bickerstaff may     st jamess coffeehouse may    letters from the hague bearing date the   st instant n s advise that his grace the duke of marlborough immediately after his arrival sent his secretary to the president and the pensionary to acquaint them therewith soon after these ministers visited the duke and made him compliments in the name of the states general after which they entered into a conference with him on the present posture of affairs and gave his grace assurances of the firm adherence of the states to the alliance at the same time acquainting him that all overtures of peace were rejected till they had an opportunity of acting in concert with their allies on that subject after this interview the pensionary and the president returned to the assembly of the states monsieur torcy has had a conference at the pensioners house with his grace the duke of marlborough prince eugene and his excellency the lord townshend the result of what was debated at that time is kept secret but there appears an air of satisfaction and good understanding between these ministers we are apt also to give our selves very hopeful prospects from monsieur torcys being employed in this negotiation who has been always remarkable for a particular way of thinking in his sense of the greatness of france which he has always said was to be promoted rather by the arts of peace than those of war his delivering himself freely on this subject has formerly appeared an unsuccessful way to power in that court but in its present circumstances those maxims are better received and it is thought a certain argument of the sincerity of the french kings intentions that this minister is at present made use of the marquis is

expectations of peace are increased by advices from paris of the   th instant which say the dauphin has altered his resolution of commanding in flanders the ensuing campaign the saxon and prussian

coffeehouse may    the discourse has happened to turn this evening upon the true nature of panegyric the perfection of which was asserted to consist in a certain artful way of conveying the applause in an indirect manner there was a gentleman gave us several instances of it among others he quoted from sir francis bacon in his advancement of learning a very great compliment made to tiberius as follows in a full debate upon public affairs in the senate one of the assembly rose up and with a very grave air said he thought it for the honor and dignity of the commonwealth that tiberius should be declared a god and have divine worship paid him the emperor was surprised at the proposal and demanded of him to declare whether he had made any application to incline him to that overture the senator answered with a bold and haughty tone sir in matters that concern the commonwealth i will be governed by no man another gentleman mentioned something of the same kind spoken by the late duke of b  m to the late earl of o  y my lord says the duke after his libertine way you will certainly be damned how my lord says the earl with some warmth nay says the duke there is no help for it for it is positively said cursed is he of whom all men speak well this is taking a man by surprise and being welcome when you have so surprised him the person flattered receives you into his closet at once and the sudden change in his heart from the expectation of an illwisher to find you his friend makes you in his full favor in a moment the spirits that were raised so suddenly against you are as suddenly for you there was another instance given of this kind at the table a gentleman who had a very great favor done him and an employment bestowed upon him without so much as being known to his benefactor waited upon the great man who was so generous and was beginning to say he was infinitely obliged not at all says the patron turning from him to another had i known a more deserving man in england he should not have had it  we should certainly have had more examples had not a gentleman produced a book which he thought an instance of this kind it was a pamphlet called the naked truth the idea any one would have of that work from the title was that there would be much plain dealing with people in power and that we should see things in their proper light stripped of the ornaments which are usually given to the actions of the great but the skill of this author is such that he has under that rugged appearance approved himself the finest gentleman and courtier that ever writ the language is extremely sublime and not at all to be understood by the vulgar the sentiments are such as would make no figure in ordinary words but such is the art of the expression and the thoughts are elevated to so high a degree that i question whether the discourse will sell much there was an illnatured fellow present who hates all panegyric mortally p  take him said he what the devil means his naked truth in speaking nothing but to the advantage of all whom he mentions this is just such a great action as that of the champions on a coronation day who challenges all mankind to dispute with him the right of the sovereign surrounded with his guards the gentleman who produced the treatise desired him to be cautious and said it was writ by an excellent soldier which made the company observe it more narrowly and as critics are the greatest conjurers at finding out a known truth one said he was sure it was writ by the hand of his swordarm i could not perceive much wit in that expression but it raised a laugh and i suppose was meant as a sneer upon valiant men the same man pretended to see in the style that it was an horseofficer but sure that is being too nice for though you may know officers of the cavalry by the turn of their feet i cannot imagine how you should discern their hands from those of other men but it is always thus with pedants they will ever be carping if a gentleman or a man of honor puts pen to paper i dont doubt but this author will find this assertion too true and that obloquy is not repulsed by the force of arms i will therefore set this excellent piece in a light too glaring for weak eyes and in imitation of the critic longinus shall as well as i can make my observations in a style like the authors of whom i treat which perhaps i am as capable of as another having an unbounded force of thinking as well as a most exquisite address extensively and wisely indulged to me by the supreme powers my author i will dare to assert shows the most universal knowledge of any writer who has appeared this century he is a poet and merchant which is seen in two masterwords credit blossoms he is a gammarian and a politician for he says the uniting the two kingdoms is the emphasis of the security to the protestants succession some would be apt to say he is a conjurer for he has found that a republic is not made up of every body of animals but is composed of men only and not of horses liberty and property have chosen their retreat within the emulation circle of an humane commonwealth he is a physician for he says i observe a constant equality in its pulse and a just quickness of its vigorous circulation and again i view the strength of our constitution plainly appear in the sanguine and ruddy complexion of a wellcontented city he is a divine for he says i cannot but bless my self and indeed this excellent treatise has had that good effect upon me who am far from being superstitious that i also cannot but bless my self  st jamess coffeehouse may    this day arrived a mail from lisbon with letters of the   th instant n s containing a particular account of the late action in portugal on the  th instant the army of portugal under the command of the marquis de frontera lay on the side of the caya and the army of the duke of anjou commanded by the marquis de bay on the other the latter commander having an ambition to ravage the country in a manner in sight of the portugueze made a motion with the whole body f his horse toward fort st christopher near the town of badajos the generals of the portugueze disdaining that such an insult should be offered to their arms took a resolution to pass the river and oppose the designs of the enemy the earl of galway epresented to them that the present postue of affairs wa such on the side of the allies that there needed no more to be done at present in that country but to carry on a defensive part but his arguments could not avail in the council of war upon which a great detachment of foot and the whole of the horse of the king of portugals army passed the river and with some pieces of cannon did good execution on the enemy upon observing this the marquis de bay advanced with his horse and attacked the right wing of the portugueze cavalry who faced about and fled without standing the first encounter but their foot repulsed the same body of horse in three successive charges with great order and resolution while this was transacting the british general commanded the brigade of pearce to keep the enemy in diversion by a new attack this was so well executed that the portugueze infantry had time to retire in good order and repass the river but that brigade which rescued em was it self surrounded by the enemy and major general sarkey brigadier pearce together with both their regiments and that of the lord galway lately raised were taken prisoners  during the engagement the earl of barrymore having advanced too far to give some necessary order was hemmed in by a squadron of the enemy but found means to gallop up to the brigade of pearce with which he remains also a prisoner my lord galway had his horse shot under him in this action and the conde de st juan a portugueze general was taken prisoner the same night the army encamped at aronches and on the  th moved to elvas where they lay when these dispatches came away colonel stanwixs regiment is also taken the whole of this affair has given the portugueze a great idea of the capacity and courage of my lord galway against whose advice they entered upon this unfortunate affair and by whose conduct they were rescued from it the prodigious constancy and resolution of that great man is hardly to be paralleled who under the oppression of a maimed body and the reflection of repeated ill fortune goes on with an unspeakable alacrity in the service of the common cause he has already put things in a very good posture after this ill accident and made the necessary dispositions for covering the country from any further attempt of the enemy who lie still in the camp they were in before the battle  letters from brussels dated the   th instant advise that notwithstanding the negotiations of a peace seem so far advanced that some do confidently report the preliminaries of a treaty to be actually agreed on yet the allies hasten their preparations for

so much employ their thoughts upon fine speculations that things useful to mankind are wholly neglected and they are busy in making emendations upon some encliticks in a greek author while obvious things that every man may have use for are wholly overlooked it would be an happy thing if such as have real capacities for public service were employed in works of general use but because a thing is every bodys business it is no bodys business this is for want of public spirit as for my part who am only a student and a man of no great interest i can only remark things and recommend the correction of em to higher powers there is an offense i have a thousand times lamented but fear i shall never see remedi d which is that in a nation where learning is so frequent as in great britain there should be so many gross errors as there are in the very directions of things wherein accuracy is necessary so the conduct of life this is notoriously observed by all men of letters when they first come to town at which time they are usually curious that way in the inscriptions on signposts i have cause to know this matter as well as any body for i have when i went to merchanttaylors school suffered stripes for spelling after the signs i observed in my way though at the same time i must confess staring at those inscriptions first gave me an idea and curiosity for medals in which i have since arrived at some knowledge many a man has lost his way and his dinner by this general want of skill in orthography for considering that the painters are usually so very bad that you cannot know the animal under whose sign you are to live that day how must the stranger be missed if it be wrong spelled as well as ill painted i have a cousin now in town who has answered under batchellor at queens

name of goodness let us make our learning of use to us or not was not this a shame that a philosopher should be thus directed by a cobbler i will be sworn if it were known how many have suffered in this kind by false speeling since the union this matter would not long lie thus what makes these evils the more insupportable is that they are so easily amended and nothing done in it but it is so far from that that the evil goes on in other arts as well as orthography places are confounded as well for want of proper distinctions as things for want of true characters had i not come by the other day very early in the morning there might have been mischief done for a worthy northbritain was swearing at stocksmarket that they would not let him in at his ludgings but i knowing the gentleman and

grant private men may distinguish their abodes as they please as one of my acquaintance who lives at marybone has put a good sentence of his own invention upon his dewlling place to find out where he

consequence if you are safe at the place it is no matter if you do not distinctly know where to say the place is but to return to the orthography of public places i propose that every tradesman in the

a mail arrived from holland by which there are advices from paris that the kingdom of france is in the utmost misery and distraction the merchants of lions have been at court to remonstrate their great sufferings by the failure of their public credit but have received no other satisfaction than promises of a sudden peace and that their debts will be made good by funds out of the revenue which will not answer but in case of the peace which is promised in the mean time the cries of the common people are loud for want of bread the gentry have lost all spirit and zeal for their country and the king himself seems to languish under the anxiety of the pressing calamities of the nation and retires from hearing those grievances which he has not power to redress instead of preparations for war and the defense of their country there is nothing to be seen but evident marks of a general despair processions fastings public mournings and humiliations are become the sole employments of a people who were lately the most vain and gay of any in the universe  the pope has written to the french king on the subject of a peace and his majesty has answered in the lowliest terms that he entirely submits his affairs to divine providence and shall soon show the world that he prefers the tranquillity of his people to the glory of his arms and extent of his conquests  letters from the hague of

of going but still continues here the army of the allies is to assemble on the  th of the next month at helchin though it is generally believed that the preliminar es to a treaty are fully adjusted  the approech of a peace strikes a pannick through ou armies though that of a battle could never do it and they almost repent of their bravery that made such have to humble themselves and the french king the duke of marlborough though otherwise the greatest general of the age has plainly shown himself unacquainted with the arts of husbanding a war he might have grown as old as the duke of alva or prince waldeck in the low countries and yet have got reputation enough every year for any reasonable man for the command of general in flanders has been ever looked upon as a provision for life for my

company but as for that says this worthy knight i am in no great pain we shall find shirts on every heage there is another sort of gentlemen whom i am much more concerned for and that is the ingenious fraternity of which i have the honor to be an unworthy member i mean th newswriters of great britain whether postmen or postboys or by what other name or title soever dignified or distinguished the case of these gentlemen is i think more hard than that of the soldiers considering that they have taken more towns and fought more battles they have been upon parties and skirmishes when our armies have lain still and given the general assault to many a place when the besiegers were quiet in their trenches they have made us masters of several strong towns many weeks before our generals could do it and completed victories when our greatest captains have been glad to come off with a drawn battle where prince eugene has slain his thousands boyer has slain his ten thousands this gentleman can indeed be never enough commended for his courage and intrepidity during this whole war he has laid about him with an inexpressible fury and like the offended marius of ancient rome made such havoc among his countrymen as must be the work of two or three ages to repair it must be confessed the redoubted mr buckley has shed as much blood as the former but i cannot forbear saying and i hope it will not look like envy that we regard our brother buckley as a kind of drawcansir who spares neither friend or foe but generally kills as many of his own side as the enemys it is impossible for this ingenious sort of men to subsist after a peace every one remembers the shifts they were driven to in the reign of king charles the second when they could not furnish out a single paper of news without lighting up a comet in germany or a fire in moscow there scarce appeared a letter without a paragraph on an earthquake prodigies were grown so familiar that they had lost their name as a great poet of that age has it i remember mr dyer who is justly looked upon by all the foxhunters in the nation as the greatest statesman our country has produced was particularly famous for dealing in whales insomuch that in five months time for i had the curiosity to examine his letters on that occasion he brought three into the mouth of the river thames besides two porpusses and a sturgeon the judicious and wary mr i dawks has all along been the rival of this great writer and got himself a reputation from plagues and famines by which in those days he destroyed as great multirudes as he has lately done by the sword in every dearth of news grand cairo was sure to be unpeopled  it being therefore visible that our society will be greater sufferers by the peace than the soldiery it self insomuch that the daily courant is in danger of being broken my friend dyer of being reformed and the very best of the whole band of being reduced to halfpay might i presume to offer any thing in the behalf of my distressed brethren i would humbly move that an appendix of proper apartments furnished with pen ink and paper and other necessaries of life should be added to the hospital of chelsea for the relief of such decayed newswriters as have served their country in the wars and that for their exercise they should compile the annals of their brother veterans who have been engaged in the same service and are still obliged to do duty after the same manner  i cannot be thought to speak this out of an eye to any private interest for as my chief scenes of action are coffeehouses play houses and my own apartment i am in no need of camps fortifications and fields of battle to support me i dont call out for heroes and generals to my assistance though the officers are broken and the armies disbanded i shall still be safe as long as there are men or women or politicians or lovers or poets or nymphs or swains or cits or courtiers in being  the tatler no    from saturd may    to tuesd may      0  from my own apartment may    there is nothing can give a man of any consideration greater pain than to see order and distinction laid aside amongst men especially when the rank of which he himself is a member is intruded upon by such as have no pretense to that honor the appellation of esquire is the most notoriously abused in this kind of any class amongst men insomuch that it is become almost the subject of derision but i will be bold to say this behavior toward it proceeds from the ignorance of the people in its true origin i shall therefore as briefly as possible do my self and all true esquires the justice to look into antiquity upon this subject  in the first ages of the world before the invention of jointures and settlements when the noble passion of love had possession of the hearts of men and the fair sex were not yet cultivated into the merciful disposition which they have showed in latter centuries it was natural for great and heroic spirits to retire to rivulets woods and caves to lament their destiny and the cruelty of the fair persons who were deaf to their lamentations the hero in this distress was generally in armor and in a readiness to fight any man he met with especially if distinguished by any extraordinary qualifications it being the nature of heroic love to hate all merit lest it should come within the observation of the cruel one by whom its own perfections are neglected a lover of this kind had always about him a person of a second value and subordinate to him who could hear his afflictions carry an enchantment for his wounds hold his helmet when he was eating if ever he did eat or in his absence when he was retired to his apartment in any kings palace tell the prince himself or perhaps his daughter the birth parentage and adventures of his valiant master this trusty companion was styled his esquire and was always fit for any offices about him was as gentle and chaste as a gentleman usher quick and active as an equerry smooth and eloquent as a master of the ceremonies a man thus qualified was the first as the ancients affirm who was called an esquire and none without these accomplishments ought to assume our order but to the utter disgrace and confusion of the heralds every pretender is admitted into this fraternity even persons the most foreign to this courteous institution i have taken an inventory of all within this city and looked over every letter in the post office for my better information there are of the middle temple including all in the butterybooks and in the lists of the house  000 in the inner  000 in the kings bench walks the whole buildings are inhabited by esquires only the adjacent street of essex from morriss coffeehouse and the turning toward the grecian you cannot meet one who is not an esquire till you take water every house in norfolk and arundel streets is gove ned also by a squire or his lady sohosquare bloomsburysquare and all other places where the floors rise above nine foot are so many universities where you enter your selves and become of our order however if this were the worst of the evil it were to be supported because they are generally men of some figure and use though i know no pretense they have to an honor which had its rise from chivalry but if you travel into the counties of great britain we are still more imposed upon by innovation we are indeed derived from the field but shall that give title to all that ride mad after foxes that holloo when they see an hare or venture their necks full speed after an hawk immediately to commence esquires no our order is temperate cleanly sober and chaste but these rural esquires commit immodesties upon haycocks wear shirts half a week and are drunk twice a day these men are also to the last degree excessive in their food an esquire of norfolk eats two pounds of dumplin every meal as if obliged to it by our order an esquire in hampshire is as ravenous in devouring hogsflesh one of essex has as little mercy on calves but i must take the liberty to protest against them and acquaint those persons that it is not the quantity they eat but the manner of eating that shows a squire but above all i am most offended at small quill men and transcribing clerks who are all come into our order for no reason that i know of but that they can easily flourish it at the end of their name i will undertake that if you read the superscriptions to all the offices in the kingdom you will not find three letters directed to any but esquires i have my self a couple of clerks and the rogues make nothing of leaving messages upon each others desk one directs to degory goosequill esquire to which the other replies by a note to nehemiah dashwell esquire with respect in a word it is now populus armigerorum a people of esquires and i dont know but by the late act of naturalization foreigners will assume that title as part of the immunity of being englishmen all these improprieties flow from the negligence of the heraldsoffice those gentlemen in partycolored habits do not so rightly as they ought understand themselves though they are dressed capape in hieroglyphics they are inwardly but ignorant men i asked an acquaintance of mine who is a man of wit but of no fortune and is forced to appear as jackpudding on the stage to a mountebank prithee jack why is your coat of so many colors he replied i act a fool and this spotted dress is to signify that every man living has a weak place about him for i am knight of the shire and represent you all i wish the heralds would know as well as this man does in his way that they are to act for us in the case of our arms and appellations we should not then be jumbled together in so promiscuous and absurd a man i design to take this matter into fu there consideration and no man shall be received as an esquire who cannot bring a certificate that he has conquered some ladys obdurate heart that he can lead up a country dance or carry a message between her and her lover with address secrecy and diligence a squire is properly born for the service of the sex and his credentials shall be signed by three toasts and one prude before his title shall received in my office  wills coffeehouse may    on saturday last was presented the busy body a comedy written as i have heretofore remarked by a woman the plot and incidents of the play are laid with that subtilty of spirit which is peculiar to females of wit and is very seldom well performed by those of the other sex in whom craft in love is an act of invention and not as with women the effect of nature and instinct  to morrow will be acted a play called the trip to the jubilee this performance is the greatest instance that we can have of the irresistble force of proper action the dialogue in it self has something too low to bear a criticism upon it but mr wilks enters into the part with so much skill that the gallantry the youth and gaiety of a young man of a plentiful fortune is looked upon with as much indulgence on the stage as in real life without any of those intermixtures of wit and humor which usually prepossess us in favor of such characters in other plays  st jamess coffeehouse may    letters from the hague of the   d instant n s say mr walpole who is since arrived was going with all expedition to great britain whither they doubted not but he carried with him the preliminaries to a treaty of peace the french minister monsieur torcy has been observed in this whole negotiation to turn his discourse upon the calamities sent down by heaven upon france and imputed the necessities they were under to the immediate hand of providence in inflicting a general scarcity of provision rather than the superior genius of the generals or the bravery of the armies against them it would be impious not to acknowledge the indulgence of heaven to us but at the same time as we are to love our enemies we are glad to see em mortified enough to mix christianity with their politics an authentic letter from madam maintenon to monsieur torcy has been stolen by a person about him who has communicated a copy of it to some of the dependants of a minister of the allies that epistle is writ in the most pathetick manner imaginable and in a style which shows her genius that has so long engrossed the heart of this great monarch  sir i received yours and am sensible of the address and capacity with which you have hitherto transacted the great affair under your management you well observe that our wants here are not to be concealed and that it is vanity to use artifices with the knowing men with whom you are to deal let me beg you therefore in the representation of our circumstances to lay aside art which ceases to be such when it is seen and make use of all your skill to gain us what advantages you can from the enemys jealousy of each others greatness which is the place where only you have room for any dexterity if you have any passion for your unhappy country or any affection for your distressed master come home with peace oh heaven do i live to talk of lewis the great as the object of ity the king shows a great uneasiness to be informed of all that passes but at the same time is fearful of every one who appears in his presence lest he should bring an account of some new calamity i know not in what terms to represent my thoughts to you when i speak of the king with relation to his bodily health figure to your self that immortal man who stood in our public places represented with trophies armor and terrors on his pedestal consider the invincible the great the good the pious the mighty which were the usual epithets we gave him both in our language and thoughts i say consider him whom you knew the most glorious and great of monarchs and now think you see the same man an unhappy lazar in the lowest circumstances of humane nature it self without regard to the state from whence he is fallen i write from his bedside he is at present in a slumber i have many many things to add but my tears flow too fast and my sorrow is too big for utterance  i am etc   there is such a veneration due from all men to the persons of princes that it were a sort of dishonesty to represent further the condition which the king is in but it is certain that soon after the receipt of these advices monsieur torcy waited upon his grace the duke of marlborough and the lord townshend and in that conference gave up many points which he had before said were such as he must return to france before he could answer  the tatler no  0 from tuesd may

following narration is a sufficient testimony of the truth of this observation  i had the honor the other day of a visit from a gentlewoman a stranger to me who seemed to be about thirty her complexion is brown but the air of her face has an agreeableness which surpasses the beauties of the fairest women there appeared in her look and mien a sprightly health and her eyes had too much vivacity to become the language of complaint which she began to enter into she seemed sensible of it and therefore with downcast looks said she mr bickerstaff you see before you the unhappiest of women and therefore as you are esteemed by all the world both a great civilian as well as an astrologer i must desire your advice and assistance in putting me in a method of obtaining a divorce from a marriage which i know the law will pronounce void madam said i your grievance is of such a nature that you must be very ingenuous in representing the causes of your complaint or i cannot give you the satisfaction you desire sir she answers i believed there would be no need of half your skill in the art of divination to guess why a woman would part from her husband it is true said i but suspicions or guesses at what you mean nay certainty of it except you plainly speak it are no foundation for a formal suit she clapped her fan before her face my husband said she is no more an husband here she burst into tears than one of the italian singers  madam said i the affliction you complain of is to be redressed by law but at the same time consider what mortifications you are to go through in bringing it into open court how you will be able to bear the impertinent whispers of the people present at the trial the licentious reflections of the pleaders and the interpretations that will in general be put upon your conduct by all the world how little will they say could that lady command her passions besides consider that curbing our desires is the greatest glory we can arrive at in this world and will be most rewarded in the next she answered like a prudent matron sir if you please to remember the office of matrimony the first cause of its institution is that of having posterity therefore as to the curbing desires i am willing to undergo any abstinence from food as you please to enjoin me but i cannot with any quiet of mind live in the neglect of a necessary duty and an express commandment increase and multiply observing she was learned and knew so well the duties of life i turned my arguments rather to dehort her from this public procedure by examples than precepts do but consider madam what crowds of beauteous women live in nunneries secluded for ever from the sight and conversation of men with all the alacrity of spirit imaginable they spend their time in heavenly raptures in constant and frequent devotion and at proper hours in agreeable conversations sir said she hastily tell not me of papists or any of their idolatries well then madam consider how many fine ladies live innocently in the eye of the world and this gay town in the midst of temptation there is the witty mrs w  is a virgin of    mrs t  s is    mrs l  ce    yet you see they laugh and are gay at the park at the playhouse at balls and at visits and so much at ease that all this seems hardly a selfdenial mr bickerstaff said she with some emotion you are an excellent casuist but the last word destroyed your whole argument if it is not selfdenial it is no virtue i presented you with an halfguinea in hopes not only to have my conscience eased but my fortune told yet  well madam said i pray of what age is your husband he is replied my injured client fifty and i have been his wife fifteen years how happened it you never communicated your distress in all this time to your friends and relations she answered he has been thus but a fortnight i am the most serious man in the world to look at and yet could not forbear laughing out why madam in case of infirmity which proceeds only from age the law gives no remedy sir said she i find you have no more learning that dr case and i am told of a young man not five and twenty just come from oxford to whom i will communicate this whole matter and doubt not but he will appear to have seven times more useful and satisfactory knowledge than you and all your boasted family thus i have entirely lost my client but if this tedious narrative preserves pastorella from the intended marriage with one twenty years her senior  to save a fine lady i am contented to have my learning decryd and my predictions bound up with poor robins almanacks  wills coffeehouse may    this evening was acted the recruiting officer in which mr estcourts proper sense and observation is what supports the play there is not in my humble opinion the humor hit in sergeant kite but it is admirably supplied by his action if i have skill to judge that man is an excellent actor but the crowd of the audience are fitter for representations at mayfair than a theater royal yet that fair is now broke as well as the theater is breaking but it is allowed still to sell animals there therefore if any lady or gentleman have occasion for a tame elephant let them enquire of mr penkethman who has one to dispose of at a reasonable rate the downfall of mayfair has quite sunk the price of this noble creature as well as of many other curiosities of nature a tiger will sell almost as cheap as an ox and i am credibly informed a man may purchase a cat with three legs for very near the value of one with four i hear likewise that

mrs sarabrand so famous for her ingenious puppetshow has set up a shop in the exchange where she sells her little troop under the term of jointedbabies i could not but be solicitous to know of her how she had disposed of that rakehell punch whose lewd life and conversation had given so much scandal and did not a little contribute to the ruin of the fair she told me with a sigh that despairing of ever reclaiming him she would not offer to place him in a civil family but got him in a post upon a stall in wapping where he may be seen from sunrising to sunsetting with a glass in one hand and a pipe in the other as centry to a brandyshop the great revolutions of this nature bring to my mind the distresses of the unfortunate camilla who has had the ill luck to break before her voice and to disappear at a time when her beauty was in the height of its bloom this lady entered so thoroughly into the great characters she acted that when she had finished her part she could not think of retrenching her equipage but would appear in her own lodgings with the same magnificence that she did upon the stage this greatness of soul has reduced that unhappy princess to an involuntary retirement where she now passes her time among the woods and forests thinking on the crowns and scepters she has lost and often humming over in her solitude i was born of royal race yet must wander in disgrace etc   but for fear of being overheard and he quality known she usually sings it in italian naqui al regno naqui al trono e pur sono iventurata pastorella    since i have touched upon this subject i shall communicate to my reader part of a letter  have received from an ingenious friend at amsterdam where there is a very noble theatre though the manner of furnishing it with actors is something peculiar to that place and gives us occasion to admire both the politeness and frugality of the people  my friends have kept me here a week longer than ordinary to see one of their plays which was performed last night with great applause the actors are all of them tradesmen who after their days work is over earn about a gilder a night by personating kings and generals the here of the tragedy i saw was a journeyman tailor und his first minister of state a coffeeman the empress made me think of parthenope in the rehearsal for her mother keeps an alehouse in the suburbs of amsterdam when the tragedy was over they entertained us with a short farce in which the cobbler did his part to a miracle but upon enquiry i found he had really been working at his own trade and representing on the stage what he acted every day in his shop the profits of the theater maintain an hospital for as here they do not think the profession of an actor the only trade that a man ought to exercise so they will not allow any body to grow rich on a profession that in their opinion so little conduce to the good of the commonwealth if i am no mistaken your play houses in england have done the same thing for unless i am misinformed the hospital at dulledge was erected and endowed by mr allen a player and it is also said a famous shetragedian has settled her estate after her death for the maintenance of decayed wits who are to be takeu in as soon as they grow dull at whatever time of their life that shall happen st jamess coffeehouse may    letters from the hague of the   st instant n

has writ to me out of the country a very civil letter and said things which i suppress with great violence to my vanity there are many terms in my narratives which he complains want explaining and has therefore desired that for the benefit of my country readers i would let him know what i mean by a gentleman a prettyfellow a toast a coquet a critic a wit and all other appellations of those in the gayer world who are in possession of these several characters together with an account of those who unfortunately pretend to em i shall begin with him we usually call a gentleman or man of conversation  it is generally thought that warmth of imagination quick relish of pleasure and a manner of becoming it are the most essential qualities for forming this sort of man but any one that is much in company will observe that the height of good breeding is shown rather in never giving offense than in doing obliging things thus he that never shocks you though he is seldom entertaining is more likely to keep your favor than he who often entertains and sometimes displeases you the most necessary talent therefore in a man of conversation which is what we ordinarily intend by a fine gentleman is a good judgment he that has this in perfection is master of his companion without letting him see it and has the same advantage over men of any other qualifications whatsoever as one that can see would have over a blind man of ten times his strength  this is what makes sophronius the darling of all who converse with him and the most powerful with his acquaintance of any man in town by the light of this faculty he acts with great ease and freedom among the men of pleasure and acquits himself with skill and dispatch among the men of business all which he performs with such success that with as much discretion in life as any man ever had he neither is nor appears cunning but as he does a good office if he ever does it with readiness and alacrity so he denies what he does not care to engage in in a manner that convinces you that you ought not to have asked it his judgment is so good and unerring and accompanied with so cheerful a spirit that his conversation is a continual feast at which he helps some and is helped by others in such a manner that the equality of society is perfectly kept up and every man obliges as much as he is obliged for it is the greatest and justest skill in a man of superior understanding to know how to be on a level with his companions this sweet disposition runs through all the actions of sophronius and make his company desired by women without being envied by men sophronius would be as just as he is if there were no law and would be as discreet as he is if there were no such thing as calumny  in imitation of this agreeable being is made that animal we call a pretty fellow who being just able to find out that what makes sophronius acceptable is a natural behavior in order to the same reputation makes his own an artificial one jack dimple is his perfect mimick whereby he is of course the most unlike him of all men living sophronius just now passed into the inner room directly forward jack comes as fast after as he can for the right and left lookingglass in which he had but just approved himself by a nod at each and marched on he will meditate within for half an hour till he thinks he is not careless enough in his air and come back to the mirror to recollect his forgetfulness  wills coffeehouse may    this night was acted the comedy called the fox but i wonder the modern writers do not use their interest in the house to suppress such representations a man that has been at this will ha dly like any other play during the season therefore i humbly move that the writings as well as dresses of the last age should give way to the present fashion we are come into a good method enough if we were not interrupted in our mith by such an apparition as a play of johnsons to be entertained at more ease both to the spectator and the writer than in the days of old it is no difficulty to get hats and swords and wigs and shoes and every thing else from the shops in town and make a man show himself by his habit without more ado to be a counselor a fop a courtier or a citizen and not be obliged to make those characters talk in different dialects to be distinguished from each other this is certainly the surest and best way of writing but such a play as this makes a man for a month after overrun with criticism and enquire what every man on the stage said what had such a one to do to meddle with such a thing how came the other who was bred after this or that manner to speak so like a man conversant among a different people these questions rob us of all our pleasure for at this rate no sentence in a play should be spoken by any one character which could possibly enter into the head of any other man represented in it but every sentiment should be peculiar to him only who utters it laborious bens works will bear this sort of inquisition but if the present writers were thus examined and the offenses against this rule cut out few plays would be long enough for the whole evenings entertainment  but i dont know how they did in those old times this same ben johnson has made every ones passion in this play be toward money and yet not one of them expresses that desire or endeavor to obtain it any way but what is peculiar to him only one sacrifices his wife another his profession another his posterity from the same motive but their characters are kept so skilfully apart that it seems prodigious their discourses should rise from the intention of the same author  but the poets are a nest of hornets and i will drive these thoughts no farther but must mention some hard treatment i am like to meet with from my brother writers i am credibly informed that the author of a play called love in a hollow tree has made some remarks upon my late discourse on the naked truth i cannot blame a gentleman for writing against any error it is for the good of the learned world but i would have the thing fairly left between us two and not under the protection of patrons but my intelligence is that he has dedicated his treatise to the honorable mr edw  d h  rd  from my own apartment may    to isaac bickerstaff esquire york may      0  sir being convinced as the whole world is how infallible your predictions are and having the honor to be your near relation of the staffian family i was under great concern at one of your predictions relating to your self wherein you foretold your own death would happen on the   th instant unless it were prevented by the assistance of welldisposed people i have therefore prevailed on my own modesty to send you a piece of news which may serve instead of goddards drops to keep you alive for two days till nature be able to recover it self or till you meet with some beteer help from other hands therefore without further ceremony i will go on to relate a singular adventure just happened in the place where i am writing wherein it may be highly useful for the public to be informed  three young ladies of our town were on saturday last indicted for witchcraft the witnesses against the first deposed upon oath before justice bindover that she kept spirits locked up in vessels which sometimes appeared in flames of blue fire that she used magical herbs with some of which she drew in hundreds of men daily to her who went out from her presence all inflamed their mouths parched and a hot steam issuing from them attended with a grievous stench that many of the said men were by the force of that herb metamorphosed into swine and lay wallowing in the kennels for twenty four hours before they could reassume their shapes or their senses  it was proved against the second that she cut off by night the limbs from dead bodies that were hanged and were seen to dig holes in the ground to mutter some conjuring words and bury pieces of the flesh after the usual manner of witches  the third was accused for a notorious piece of sorcery long practiced by hags of moulding up pieces of dough into the shapes of men women and children then heating them at a gentle fire which had a sympathetick power to torment the bowels of those in the neighborhood  this was the sum of what was objected against the three ladies who indeed had nothing to say in their own defense but downright denying the facts which is like to avail very little when they come upon their trials  but the parson of our parish a strange refractory man will believe nothing of all this so that the whole town cries out shame that one of his coat should be such an atheist and design to complain of him to the bishop he goes about very odly to solve the matter he supposes that the first of these ladies keeping a brandy and tobacco shop the fellows went out smoking and got drunk toward evening and made themselves beasts he says the second is a butchers daughter and sometimes brings a quarter of mutton from the slaughterhouse over night against a market day and once buried a bit of beef in the ground as a known receipt to cure warts on her hands the parson affirms that the third sells gingerbread which to please the children she is forced to stamp with images before it is baked and if it burns their guts it is because they eat too much or do not drink after it  these are the answers he gives to solve these wonderful phenomenon upon which i shall not animaavert but leave it among philosophers and so wishing you all success in your undertakings for the amendment of the world i remain  dear cousin your most affectionate kinsman and humble servant ephraim bedstaff   p s those who were condemned to death among the athenians were obliged to take a dose of poison which made them die upwards seizing first upon their feet making them cold and insensible and so ascending gradually till it reached the vital parts i believe your death which you foretold would happen on the   th instant will fall out the same way and that your distemper has already seized on you and makes progress daily the lower part of you that is the advertisements is dead and these have risen for these ten days last past so that they now take up almost a whole paragraph pray sir do your endeavor to drive this distemper as much as possible to the extreme parts and keep it there as wise folks do the gout for if it once gets into your stomach it will soon fly up into your head and you are a dead man  st jamess coffeehouse may    we hear from

hither this evening to see fashions and who should i first encounter but my old friend cynthio encompassed by a crowd of young fellows dictating on the passion of love with the gayest air imaginable well says he as to what i know of the matter there is nothing but ogling with skill carries a woman but indeed it is not every fool that is capable of this art you will find twenty can speak eloquently fifty can fight manfully and a thousand that can dress genteely at a mistress where there is one that can gaze skilfully this requires an exquisite judgment to take the language of her eyes to yours exactly and not let yours talk too fast for hers as at a play between the acts when beau frisk stands upon a bench full in lindamiras face and her dear eyes are searching round to avoid that flaring open fool she meets the watchful glance of her true lover and sees his heart attentive on her charms and waiting for a second twincle of her eye for its next motion here the good company sneerd but he goes on nor is this attendance a slavery when a man meets encouragement and her eye comes often in his way for after an evening so spent and the repetition of four or five significant looks at him the happy man goes home to his lodging full of ten thousand pleasing images his brain is dilated and gives him all the ideas and prospects which it ever lets in to its seat of pleasure thus a kind look from lindamira revives in his imagination all the beauteous launs green fields woods forests rivers and solitudes which he had ever before seen in picture description or real life and all with this addition that he now sees em with the eyes of an happy lover as before only with those of a common man you laugh gentlemen but consider your selves you common people that were never in love and compare your selves in good humor with your selves out of humor and you will then acknowledge that all external objects affect you according to the disposition you are in to receive their impressions and not as those objects are in their own nature how much more shall all that passes within his view and observation touch with delight a man who is prepossessed with successful love which is an assemblage of soft affections gay desires and hopeful resolutions  poor cynthio went on at this rate to the crowd about him without any purpose in his talk but to vent an heart overflowing with sense of success i wondered what could exalt him from the distress in which he had long appeared to so much alacrity but my familiar has given me the state of his affairs it seems then that lately coming out of the playhouse his mistress who knows he is in her livery as the manner of insolent beauties is resolved to keep him still so and gave him so much wages as to complain to him of the crowd she was to pass through he had his wits and resolution enough about him to take her hand and say he would attend her to her coach all the way thither my good young man stammerd at every word and stumbled at every step his mistress wonderfully pleased with her triumph put him to a thousand questions to make a man of his natural wit speak with hesitation and let drop her fan to see him recover it aukwardly this is the whole foundation of cynthios recovery to the sprightly air he appears with at present  i grew mighty curious to know something more of that ladys affairs as being amazed how she could dally with an offer of one of his merit and fortune i sent pacolet to her lodgings who immediately brought me back the following letter to her friend and confident amanda in the country wherein she has opened her heart and all its folds  dear amanda the town grows so empty that you must expect my letter so too except you will allow me to talk of my self instead of others you cannot imagine what pain it is after a whole day spent in public to want your company and the ease which friendship allows in being vain to each other and speaking all our minds an account of the slaughter which these unhappy eyes have made within ten days last past would make me appear too great a tyrant to be allowed in a christian country i shall therefore confine my self to my principal conquests which are the hearts of beau frisk and jack freeland besides cynthio who you know wore my fetters before you went out of town shall i tell you my weakness i begin to love frisk it is the best humoured impertinent thing in the world he is always too in waiting and will certainly carry me off one time or other freelands father and mine have been upon treaty without consulting me and cynthio has been eternally watching my eyes without approaching me my friends my maid or any one about me he hopes to get me i believe as they say the rattle snake does the squirrel by staring at me till i drop into his mouth freeland demands me for a jointure which he thinks deserves me cynthio thinks nothing high enough to be my value freeland therefore will take it for no obligation to have me and cynthios idea of me is what will vanish by knowing me better familiarity will equally turn the veneration of the one and the indifference of the other into contempt i will stick therefore to my old maxim to have that sort of man who can have no greater views than what are in my power to give him possession of the utmost of my dear frisks ambition is to be thought a man of fashion and therefore has been so much in mode as to resolve upon me because the whole town likes me thus i choose rather a man who loves me because others do than one who approves me on his own judgment he that judges for himself in love will often change his opinion but he that follows the sense of others must be constant as long as a woman can make advances the visits i make the entertainments i give and the addresses i receive will be all arguments for me with a man of frisks secondhand genius but would be so many bars to my happiness with any other man however since frisk can wait i shall enjoy a summer or two longer and remain a single woman in the sublime pleasure of being followed and admired which nothing can equal except that of being beloved by you  i am etc   wills coffeehouse may  0 my chief business here this evening was to speak to my friends in behalf of honest cave underhill who has been a comic for three generations my father admired him extremely when he was a boy there is certainly nature excellently represented in his manner of action in which he ever avoided that general fault in players of doing too much it must be confessed he has not the merit of some ingenious persons now on the stage of adding to his authors for the actors were so dull in the last age that many of them have gone out of the world without having ever spoke one word of their own in the theater poor cave is so mortified that he quibbles and tells you he pretends only to act a part fit for a man who has one foot in the grave viz a gravedigger all admirers of true comedy it is hoped will have the gratitude to be present on the last day of his acting who if he does not happen to please them will have it even then to say that it is his first offense  but there is a gentleman here who says he has it from good hands that there is actually a subscription made by many persons of wit and quality for the encouragement of new comedies this design will very much contribute to the improvement and diversion of the town but as every man is most concerned for himself i who am of a saturnine and melancholy complexion cannot but murmur that there is not an equal invitation to write tragedies having by me in my book of common places enough to enable me to finish a very sad one by the fifth of the next month i have the farewell of a general with a truncheon in his hand dying for love in six lines i have the principles of a politician who does all the mischief in the play together with his declaration on the vanity of ambition in his last moments expressed in a page and an half i have all my oaths ready and my similies want nothing but application i will not pretend to give you an account of the plot it being the same design upon which all tragedies have been writ for several years last past and from the beginning of the first scene the frequenters of the house may know as well as the author when the battle is to be fought the lady to yield and the hero proceed to his wedding and coronation besides these advantages which i have in readiness i have an eminent tragedian very much my friend who shall come in and go through the whole five acts without troubling me for one sentence whether he is to kill or be killed love or be loved win battles or lose them or whatever other tragical performance i shall please to assign him  from my own apartment may  0 i have this day received a letter subscribed fidelia that gives me an account of an enchantment under which a young lady suffers and desires my help to exorcise her from the power of the sorcerer her lover is a rake of sixty the lady a virtuous woman of twenty five her relations are to the last degree afflicted and amazed at this irregular passion their sorrow i know not how to remove but can their astonishment for there is no spirit in woman half so prevalent as that of contradiction which is the sole cause of her perseverance let the whole family go dressed in a body and call the bride to morrow morning to her nuptials and i will undertake the inconstant will forget her lover in the midst of all his aches but if this expedient does not succeed i must be so just to the young ladys distinguishing sense as to applaud her choice a fine young woman at last is but what is due from fate to an honest fellow who has suffered so unmercifully by the sex and i think we cannot enough celebrate her heroic virtue who like the patriot that ended a pestilence by plunging himself into a gulf gives her self up to gorge that dragon which has devoured so many virgins before her  a letter directed to isaac bickerstaff

being the science the worldings have most need of i pretended when i first set up to astrology only but i am told i have deep skill also in medecin i am applied to now by a gentleman for my advice in behalf of his wife who upon the least matrimonial difficulty is excessively troubled with fits and can bear no manner of passion without falling into immediate convulsions i must confess it is a case i have known before and remember the party was recovered by certain words pronounced in the midst of the fit by the learned doctor who performed the cure these ails have usually their beginning from the affections of the mind therefore you must have patience to let me give you an instance whereby you may discern the cause of the distemper and then proceed in the cure as follows  a fine town lady was married to a gentleman of ancient descent in one of the counties of great britain who had good humor to a weakness and was that sort of person of whom it is usually said he is no mans enemy but his own one who had too much tenderness of soul to have any authority with his wife and she too little sense to give him authority for that reason his kind wife observed this temper in him and made proper use of it but knowing it was below a gentlewoman to wrangle she resolved upon an expedient to save decorum and wear her dear to her point at the same time she therefore took upon her to govern him by falling into fits whenever she was repulsed in a request or contradicted in a discourse it was a fishday when in the midst of her husbands good humor at table she bethought her self to try her project she made signs that she had swallowed a bone the man grew pale as ashes and ran to her assistance calling for drink no my dear said she recovering it is down dont be frightened this accident betrayed his softness enough the next day she complained a ladys chariot whose husband had not half his estate had a craneneck and hung with twice the air that hers did he answered madam you know my income you know i have lost two coachhorses this spring  down she fell  hartshorn betty susan alice throw water in her face with much care and pains she was at last brought to her self and the vehicle

disconsolate soon pitched upon a very agreeable successor whom she very prudently designed to  by the same method this man knew her little arts and resolved to break through all tenderness and be absolute master as soon as occasion offered one day it happened that a discourse arose about furniture he was very glad of the occasion and fell into an invective against china protesting he would never let five pounds more of his money be laid out that way as long as he breathed she immediately fainted  he starts up as amazed and calls for help  the maids ran to the closet  he chafes her face bends her forwards and beats the palms of her hands her convulsions increase and down she tumbles on the floor where she lies quite dead in spite of what the whole family from the nursery to the kitchen could do for her relief  while every servant was thus helping or lamenting their mistress he fixing his cheek to hers seemed to be following her in a trance of sorrow but secretly whispers her my dear this will never do what is within my power and fortune you may always command but none of your artifices you are quite in other hands than those you passed these pretty passions upon this made her almost in the condition she pretended her convulsions now come thicker nor was she to be held down the kind man doubles his care helps the servants to throw water in her face by full quarts and when the sinking part of the fit came again well my dear said he i applaud your action but i must take my leave of you till you are more sincere with me farewell for ever you shall always know where to hear of me and want for nothing with that he ordered the maids to keep plying her with hartshorn while he went for a physician he was scarce at the stairhead when she followed and pulling him into

place were immediately altered and the necessary orders were transmitted to the troops which lay most remote from thence to move toward the place of rendezvous with all expedition the enemy seem also

difficulty is the business of spain on which particular his ministers seemed only to say during the treaty that it was not so immediately under their masters direction as that he could engage for its being relinquished by the duke of anjou but now he positively answers that he cannot comply with what his minister has promised in his behalf even in such points as are wholly in himself to act in or not this has had no other effect than to give the alliance fresh arguments for being diffident of engagements entered into by france the pensioner made a report of all which this minister had declared

britain to lewis the fourteenth of france the surprising news which arrived this day of your majestys having refused to sign the treaty your ministers have in a manner sued for is what gives ground to this application to your majesty from one whose name perhaps is too obscure to have ever reached your territories but one who with all the european world is affected with your determinations therefore as it is mine and the common cause of mankind i presume to expostulate with you on this occasion it will i doubt not appear to the vulgar extravagant that the actions of a mighty prince should be balanced by the censure of a private man whose approbation or dislike are equally contemptible in their eyes when they regard the thrones of sovereigns but your majesty has shown through the whole course of your reign too great a value for liberal arts to be insensible that true fame lies only in the hands of learned men by whom it is to be transmitted to futurity with marks of honor or reproach to the end of time the date of humane life is too short to recompense the cares which attend the most private condition therefore it is that our souls are made as it were too big for it and extend themselves in the prospect of a longer existence in a good fame and memory of worthy actions after our decease the whole race of men have this passion in some degree implanted in their bosoms which is the strongest and noblest incitation to honest attempts but the base use of the arts of peace eloquence poetry and all the parts of learning have been possessed by souls so unworthy those faculties that the names and appellations of things have been confounded by the labors and writings of prostituted men who have stamped a reputation upon such actions as are in themselves the objects of contempt and disgrace this is that which has misled your majesty in the conduct of your reign and made that life which might have been the most imitable the most to be avoided to this it is that the great and excellent qualities of which your majesty is master are lost in their application and your majesty has been carrying on for many years the most cruel tyranny with all the noble methods which are used to support a just reign thus it is that it avails nothing that you are a bountiful master that you are so generous as to reward even the unsuccessful with honor and riches that no laudable action passes unrewarded in your kingdoms that you have searched all nations for obscure merit in a word that you are in your private character endowed with every princely quality when all this is subjected to unjust and illtaught ambition which to the injury of the world is gilded by those endowments however if your majesty will condescend to look into your own soul and consider all its faculties and weaknesses with impartiality if you will but be convinced that life is supported in you by the ordinary methods of food rest and sleep you would think it impossible that you could ever be so much imposed on as to have been wrought into a belief that so many thousands of the same make with your self were formed by providence for no other end but by the hazard of their very being to extend the conquests and glory of an individual of their own species a very little reflection will convince your majesty that such cannot be the intent of the creator and if not what horror must it give your majesty to think of the vast devastations your ambition has made among your fellow creatures while the warmth of youth the flattery of crowds and a continual series of success and triumph indulged your majesty in this allusion of mind it was less to be wondered at that you proceeded in this mistaken pursuit of grandeur but when age disappointments public calamities personal distempers and the reverse of all that makes men forget their true being are fallen upon you heavens is it possible you can live without remorse can the wretched man be a tyrant can grief study torments can sorrow be cruel   your majesty will observe i do not bring against you a railing accusation but as you are a strict professor of religion i beseech your majesty to stop the effusion of blood by receiving the opportunity which presents it self for the preservation of your distressed people be no longer so infatuated as to hope for renown from murder and violence but consider that the great day will come in which this world and all its glory shall change in a moment when nature shall sicken and the earth and sea give up the bodies committed to them to appear before the last tribunal will it then oh king be an answer for the lives of millions who have fallen by the sword they perished for my glory that day will come on and one like it is immediately approaching injured nations advance toward thy habitation vengeance has began its march which is to be diverted only by the penitence of the oppressor awake o monarch from thy lethargy disdain the abuses thou have received pull down the statue which calls thee immortal be truly great tear thy purple and put on sackcloth i am  thy generous enemy isaac bickerstaff   the tatler no    from thursd june   to saturd june     0  whites chocolatehouse june   in my paper of the   th of the last month i mentioned several characters which want explanation to the generality of readers among others i spoke of a pretty fellow i have since received a kind admonition in a letter to take care that i do not omit to show also what is meant by a very pretty fellow which is to be allowed as a character by it self and a person exalted above the other by a peculiar sprightliness as one who by a distinguishing vigor outstrips his companions and has thereby deserved and obtained a particular appellation or nickname of familiarity some have this distinction from the fair sex who are so generous as to take into their protection such as are laughed at by the men and place them for that reason in degrees of favor  the chief of this sort is colonel brunett who is a man of fashion because he will be so and practices a very janty way of behavior because he is too careless to know when he offends and too sanguine to be mortified if he did know it thus the colonel has met with a town ready to receive him and cannot possibly see why he should not make use of their favor and set himself in the first degree of conversation therefore he is very successfully loud among the wits familiar among the ladies and dissolute among the rakes thus he is admitted in one place because he is so in another and every man treats brunett well not out of his particular esteem for him but in respect to the opinion of others it is to me a solid pleasure to see the world thus mistaken on the goodnatured side for it is ten to one but the colonel mounts into a general officer marries a fine lady and is master of a good estate before they come to explain upon him what gives most delight to me in this observation is that all this arises from pure nature and the colonel can account for his success no more than those by whom he succeeds for these causes and considerations i pronounce him a true womans man and in the first degree a very pretty fellow  the next to a man of this universal genius is one who is peculiarly formed for the service of the ladies and his merit chiefly is to be of no consequence i am indeed a little in doubt whether he ought not rather to be called a very happy than a very pretty fellow for he is admitted at all hours all he says or does which would offend in another are passed over in him and all actions and speeches which please doubly please if they come from him no one wonders or takes notice when he is wrong but all admire him when he is in the right  by the way it is fit to remark that there are people of better sense than these who endeavor at this character but they are out of nature and though with some industry they get the characters of fools they cannot arrive to be very seldom to be merely pretty fellows but where nature has formed a person for this station amongst men he is gifted with a peculiar genius for success and his very errors and absurdities contribute to it this felicity attending him to his lifes end for it being in a manner necessary that he should be of no consequence he is as well in old age as youth and i know a man whose son has been some years a pretty fellow who is himself at this hour a very pretty fellow  one must move tenderly in this place for we are now in the ladies lodgings and speaking of such as are supported by their influence and favor against which there is not neither ought there to be any dispute or observation but when we come into more free air one may talk a little more at large  give me leave then to mention three whom i do not doubt but we shall see make considerable figures and these are such as for their bacchanalian performances must be admitted into this order they are three brothers lately landed from holland as yet indeed they have not made their public entry but lodge and converse at wapping they have merited already on the waterside particular titles the first is called hogshead the second culverin and the third musket this fraternity is preparing for our end of the town by their ability in the exercises of bacchus and measure their time and merit by liquid weight and power of drinking hogshead is a prettier fellow than culverin by two quarts and culverin than musket by a full pint it is to be feared hogshead is so often too full and culverin overloaded that musket will be the only lasting very pretty fellow of the three  a third sort of this denomination are such as by very daring adventures in love have purchased to themselves renown and new names as jo carry for his excessive strength and vigor tom drybones for his generous loss of youth and health and cancrum for his meritorious rottenness  these great and leading spirits are proposed to all such of our british youth as would arrive at perfection in these different kinds and if their parts and accomplishments were well imitated it is not doubted but that our nation would soon excel all others it wit and arts as they already do in arms   n b the gentleman who stole betty pepin may own it for he is allowed to be a very pretty fellow  but we must proceed to the explanation of other terms in our writings  to know what a toast is in the country gives as much perplexity as she her self does in town and indeed the learned differ very much upon the original of this word and the acceptance of it among the moderns however it is by all agreed to have a joyous and cheerful import a toast in a cold morning heightened by nutmeg and sweetened with sugar has for many ages been given to our rural dispensers of justice before they entered upon causes and has been of great and politic use to take off the severity of their sentences but has indeed been remarkable for one ill effect that it inclines those who use it immoderately to speak latin to the admiration rather than information of an audience this application of a toast makes it very obvious that the word may without a metaphor be understood as an apt name for a thing which raises us in the most sovereign degree but many of the wits of the last age will assert that the word in its present sense was known among them in their youth and had its rise from an accident at the town of bath in the reign of king charles the second  it happened that on a public day a celebrated beauty of those times was in the cross bath and one of the crowd of her admirers took a glass of the water in which the fair one stood and drank her health to the company there was in the place a gay fellow half fuddled who offered to jump in and swore though he liked not the liquor he would have the toast he was opposed in his resolution yet this whim gave foundation to the present honor which is done to the lady we mention in our liquors who has ever since been called a toast  though this institution had so trivial a beginning it is now elevated into a formal order and that happy virgin who is received and drank to at their meetings has no more to do in this life but to judge and accept of the first good offer the manner of her inauguration is much like that of the choice of a doge in venice it is performed by ballotting and when she is so chosen she reigns indisputably for that ensuing year but must be elected anew to prolong her empire a moment beyond it when she is regularly chosen her name is written with a diamond on a drinkingglass the hieroglyphick of the diamond is to show her that her value is imaginary and that of the glass to acquaint her that her condition is frail and depends on the hand which holds her this wise design admonishes her neither to overrate or depreciate her charms as well considering and applying that it is perfectly according to the humor and taste of the company whether the toast is eaten or left as an offal  the foremost of the whole rank of toasts and the most undisputed in their present empire are mrs gatty and mrs frontlet the first an agreeable the second an awful beauty these ladies are perfect friends out of a knowledge that their perfections are too different to stand in competition he that likes gatty can have no relish for so solemn a creature as frontlet and an admirer of frontlet will call gatty a maypole girl gatty for ever smiles upon you and frontlet disdains to see you smile gattys love is a shining quick flame frontlets a slow wasting fire gatty likes the man that diverts her frontlet him who adores her gatty always improves the soil in which she travels frontlet lays waste the country gatty does not only smile but laughs at her lover frontlet not only looks serious but frowns at him all the men of wit and coxcombs their followers are professed servants of gatty the politicians and pretenders give solemn worship to frontlet their reign will be best judged of by its duration frontlet will never be chosen more and gatty is a toast for life  st jamess coffeehouse june   letters from hamburgh of the  th instant n s inform us that no art or cost is omitted to make the stay of his danish majesty at dresden agreeable but there are various speculations upon the interview between king angustus and that prince many putting politic constructions upon his danish majestys arrival at a time when his troops are marching out of hungary with orders to pass through saxony where it is given out that they are to be recruited it is said also that several polish senators have invited k augustus to return into poland his majesty of sweden according to the same advices has passed the nieper without any opposition from the muscovites and advances with all possible expedition toward volhinia where he

letters from the hague dated the   th instant n s advise that monsieur rouille having acquainted the ministers of the allies that his manner had refused to ratify the preliminaries of a treaty adjusted with monsieur torcy set out for paris on sunday morning the same day the foreign ministers met a committee of the states general where monsieur van hessen opened the business upon which they were assembled and in a very warm discourse laid before them the conduct of france in the late negotiations representing the abject manner in which she had laid open her own distresses that reduced her to a compliance with the demands of all the allies and her meannesses in receding from those points to which monsieur torcy had consented the respective minister of each potentate of the alliance severally expressed their resentment of the faithless behavior of the french and gave each other mutual assurances of the constancy and resolution of their principals to proceed with the utmost vigor

yesterday morning sir john norris with the squadron under his command sailed from the downs for holland  from my own apartment june   i have the honor of the following letter from a gentleman whom i receive into my family and order the heralds at arms to enroll him accordingly  mr bickerstaff though you have excluded me the honor of your family yet i have ventured to correspond with the same great persons as your self and have wrote this post to the king of france though i am in a manner unknown in his country and have not been seen there these many months  to lewis le grand though in your country i am unknown yet sir i must advise you of late so poor and mean youre grown that all the world despise you here vermin eat your majesty there meagre subjects stand unfed what surer signs of poverty than many lice and little bread then sir the present minute choose our armies are advanced those terms you at the hague refuse at paris will not be granted consider this and dunkirk raze and annas title own send one pretender out to graze and call the other home your humble servant bread the staff of life   the tatler no    from saturday june   to tuesd june     0  whites chocolate house june   a letter from a young lady written in the most passionate terms wherein she laments the misfortune of a gentleman her lover who was lately wounded in a duel has turned my thoughts to that subject and inclined me to examine into the causes which precipitate men into so fatal a folly and as it has been proposed to treat of subjects of gallantry in the article from hence and no one point in nature is more proper to be considered by the company who frequent this place than that of duels it is worth our consideration to examine into this chimaerical groundless humor and to lay every other thought aside till we have stripped it of all its false pretenses to credit and reputation amongst men  but i must confess when i consider what i am going about and run over in my imagination all the endless crowd of men of honor who will be offended at such a discourse i am undertaking methinks a work worthy an invulnerable hero in romance rather than a private gentleman with a single rapier but as i am pretty well acquainted by great opportunities with the nature of man and know of a truth that all men fight against their will the danger vanishes and resolution rises upon this subject for this reason i shall talk very freely on a custom which all men wish exploded though no man has courage enough to resist it  but there is one unintelligible word which i fear will extremely perplex my dissertation and i confess to you i find very hard to explain which is the term satisfaction an honest country gentleman had the misfortune to fall into company with two or three modern men of honor where he happened to be very ill treated and one of the company being conscious of his offense sends a note to him in the morning and tells him he was ready to give him satisfaction this is fine doing says the plain fellow last night he sent me away cursedly out of humor and this morning he fancies it would be a satisfaction to be run through the body  as the matter at present stands it is not to do handsome actions denominates a man of honor it is enough if he dares to defend ill ones thus you often see a common sharper in competition with a gentleman of the first rank though all mankind is convinced that a fighting gamester is only a pickpocket with the courage of an highwayman one cannot with any patience reflect on the unaccountable jumble of persons and things in this town and nation which occasions very frequently that a brave man falls by a hand below that of the common hangman and yet his executioner escapes the clutches of the hangman for doing it i shall therefore hereafter consider how the bravest men in other ages and nations have behaved themselves upon such incidents as we decide by combat and show from their practice that this resentment neither has its foundation from true reason or solid fame but is an imposture made up of cowardice falsehood and want of understanding for this work a good history of quarrels would be very edifying to the public and i apply my self to the town for particulars and circumstances within their knowledge which may serve to embellish the dissertation with proper cuts most of the quarrels i have ever known have proceeded from some valiant coxcombs persisting in the wrong to defend some prevailing folly and preserve himself from the ingenuity of owning a mistake  by this means it is called giving a man satisfaction to urge your offense against him with your sword which puts me in mind of peters order to the keeper in the tale of a tub if you neglect to do all this damn you and your generation for ever and so we bid you heartily farewell if the contradiction in the very terms of one of our challenges were as well explained and turned into downright english would it not run after this manner  sir your extraordinary behavior last night and the liberty you were pleased to take with me makes me this morning give you this to tell you because you are an illbred puppy i will meet you in hidepark an hour hence and because you want both breeding and humanity i desire you would come with a pistol in your hand on horseback and endeavor to shoot me through the head to teach you more manners if you fail of doing me this pleasure i shall say you are a rascal on every post in town and so sir if you will not injure me more i shall never forgive what you have done already pray sir do not fail of getting every thing ready and you will infinitely oblige  sir your most obedient humble servant etc   from my own apartment june   among the many employments i am necessarily put upon by my friends that of giving advice is the most unwelcome to me and indeed i am forced to use a little art in the matter for some people will ask counsel of you when they have already acted what they tell you is still under deliberation i had almost lost a very good friend the other day who came to know how i liked his design to marry such a lady i answered by no means and i must be positive against it for very solid reasous which are not proper to communicate not proper to communicate said he with a grave air i will know the bottom of this i saw him moved and knew from thence he was already determined therefore evaded it by saying to tell you the truth dear frank of all women living i would have her my self isaac said he thou art too late for we have been both one these two months  i learned this caution by a gentlemans consulting me formerly about his son he railed at his damned extravagance and told me in a very little time he would beggar him by the exorbitant bills which came from oxford every quarter make the rogue bite upon the bridle said i pay none of his bills it will but encourage him to further trespasses he looked plaguey sour at me his son soon after sent up a paper of verses forsooth in print on the last public occasion upon which he is convinced the boy has parts and a lad of spirit is not to be too much cramped in his maintenance lest he take ill courses neither father nor son can ever since endure the sight of me  these sort of people ask opinions only out of the fullness of their heart on the subject of their perplexity and not from a desire of information  there is nothing so easy as to find out which opinion the person in doubt has a mind to therefore the sure way is to tell him that is certainly to be chosen then you are to be very clear and positive leave no handle for scruple bless me sir there is no room for a question this rivets you into his heart for you at once applaud his wisdom and gratify his inclination however i had too much bowels to be insincere to a man who came yesterday to know of me with which of two eminent men in the city he should place his son their names are paulo and avaro this gave me much debate with my self because not only the fortune of the youth but his virtue also depended upon this choice the men are equally wealthy but they differ in the use and application of their riches which you immediately see upon entering their doors  the habitation of paulo has at once the air of a nobleman and a merchant you see the servants act with affection to their master and satisfaction in themselves the master meets you with an open countenance full of benevolence and integrity your business is dispatched with that confidence and welcome which always accompanies honest minds his table is the image of plenty and generosity supported by justice and frugality after we had dined here our affair was to visit avaro out comes an awkward fellow with a careful countenance sir would you speak with my master may i crave your name after the first preambles he leads us into a noble solitude a great house that seemed uninhabited but from the end of the spacious hall moves toward us avaro with a suspicious aspect as if he believed us thieves and as for my part i approached him as if i knew him a cutpurse we fell into discourse of his noble dwelling and the great estate all the world knew he had to enjoy in it and i to plague him fell a commending paulos way of living paulo answered avaro is a very good man but we who have smaller estates must cut our coat according to our cloth nay says i every man knows his own circumstance best you are in the right if you have not wherewithal he looked very sour for it is you must know the utmost vanity of a meanspirited rich man to be contradicted when he calls himself poor but i was resolved to vex him by consenting to all he said the main design of which was that he would have us find out he was one of the wealthiest men in london and lived like a beggar we left him and took a turn on the change my friend was ravished with avaro this said he is certainly a sure man i contradicted him with much warmth and summed up their different characters as well as i could this paulo said i grows wealthy by being a common good avaro by being a general evil paulo has the art avaro the craft of trade when paulo gains all men he deals with are the better whenever avaro profits another certainly loses in a word paulo is a citizen and avaro a cit i convinced my friend and carried the young gentleman the next day to paulo where he will learn the way both to gain and enjoy a good fortune and though i cannot say i have by keeping him from avaro saved him from the gallows i have prevented his deserving it every day he lives for with paulo he will be an honest man without being so for fear of the law as with avaro he would have been a villain within the protection of it  st jamess coffeehouse june   we hear from vienna of the  st instant that baron imoff who attended her catholic majesty with the character of envoy from the duke of wolfembuttel was returned thither that minister brought an account that major general stanhope with the troops which embarked at naples was returned to barcelona we hear from berlin by advices of the  th instant that his prussian majesty had received intelligence from his minister at dresden that the king of denmark desired to meet his majesty at magdeburg the king of prussia has sent answer that his present indisposition will not admit of so great a journey but has sent the king a very pressing invitation to come to berlin or potsdam these advices say that the minister of the king of sweden has produced a letter from his master to the king of poland dated from batitzan the  0th of march o s wherein he acquaints him that he has been successful against the muscovites in all the occasions which have happened since his march into their country great numbers have revolted to the swedes since general mazeppa went over to that side and as many as have done so have taken solemn oaths to adhere to the interests of his swedish majesty  advices from the hague of the   th instant n s say that all things tended to a vigorous and active campaign the allies having strong resentments against the late behavior of the court of france and the french using all possible endeavors to animate their men to defend their country against a victorious and exasperated enemy monsieur rouille had passed through brussels without visiting either the duke of marlborough or prince eugene who were both there at that time the states have met and publicly declared their satisfaction in the conduct of their deputies during the whole treaty letters from france say that the court is resolved to put all to the issue of the ensuing campaign in the mean time they have ordered the preliminary treaty to be published with observation upon each article in order to quiet the minds of the people and persuade them that it has not been in the power of the king to procure a peace but to the diminution of his majestys glory and the hazard of his dominions his grace the duke of marlborough and prince eugene arrived at ghent on wednesday last where at an assembly of all the general officers it was thought proper by reason of the great rains which have lately fallen to defer forming a camp or bringing the troops together but as soon as the weather would permit to march upon the enemy with all expedition  the tatler no    from tuesday june   to thursd june     0  from my own apartment june   i have read the following letter with delight and approbation and i hereby order mr kidney at st jamess and sir thomas at whites who are my clerks for enrolling all men in their distant classes before they presume to drink tea or chocolate in those places to take care that the persons within the descriptions in the letter be admitted and excluded according to my friends remonstrance  june     0  sir your paper of saturday has raised up in me a noble emulation to be recorded in the foremost rank of worthies therein mentioned and if any regard be had to merit or industry i may hope to succeed in the promotion for i have omitted no toil or expense to be a proficient and if my friends do not flatter they assure me i have not lost my time since i came to town to enumerate but a few particulars there is hardly a coachman i meet with but desires to be excused taking me because he has had me before i have compounded two or three rapes and let out to hire as many bastards to beggars i never saw above the first act of a play and as to my courage it is well known i have more than once had sufficient witnesses of my drawing my sword both in tavern and playhouse dr wall is my particular friend and if it were any service to the public to compose the difference between martin and sintilaer the pearldriller i dont know a judge of more experience than my self for in that i may say with the poet quae regio in villa nostri non plena laboris   i omit other less particulars the necessary consequences of greater actions but my reason for troubling you at this present is to put a stop if it may be to an insinuating increasing set of people who sticking to the letter of your treatise and not to the spirit of it do assume the name of pretty fellows nay and even get new names as you very well hint some of them i have heard calling to one another as i have sat at whites and st jamess by the names of betty nelly and so forth you see them accost each other with effeminate airs they have their signs and tokens like freemasons they rail at womenkind receive visits on their beds in gowns and do a thousand other unintelligible prettinesses that i cannot tell what to make of i therefore heartily desire you would exclude all this sort of animals  there is another matter i am foreseeing an ill consequence from but may be timely prevented by prudence which is that for the last fortnight prodigious shoals of volunteers have gone over to bully the french upon hearing the peace was just signing and this is so true that i can assure you all engrossing work about the temple is risen above   s in the pound for want of hands now as it is possible some little alteration of affairs may have broken their measures and that they will post back again i am under the last apprehension that these will at their return all set up for pretty fellows and thereby confound all merit and service and impose on us some new alteration in our nightcapwigs and pockets unless you can provide a particular class for them i cannot apply my self better than to you and i am sure i speak the mind of a very great number as deserving as my self   the pretensions of this correspondent are worthy a particular distinction he cannot indeed be admitted as a pretty but is what we most justly call a smart fellow never to pay at the playhouse is an act of frugality that lets you into his character and his expedient in sending his children a begging before they can go are characteristical instances that he belongs to this class i never saw the gentleman but i know by his letter he hangs his cane on his button and by some lines of it he should wear redheeld shoes which are essential parts of the habit belonging to the order of smart fellows  my familiar is returned with the following letter from the french king  versailles june      0  lewis the fourteenth to isaac bickerstaff esquire sir i have your epistle and must take the liberty to say that there has been a time when there were generous spirits in great britain who would not have suffered my name to be treated with the familiarity you think fit to use i thought liberal men would not be such timeservers as to fall upon a man because his friends are not in power but having some concern for what you may transmit to posterity concerning me i am willing to keep terms with you and make a request to you which is that you would give my service to the nineteenth century if ever you or yours reach to them and tell them that i have settled all matters between them and me by monsieur boileau i should be glad to see you here   it is very odd this prince should offer to invite me into his dominions or believe i should accept the invitation no no i remember too well how he served an ingenious gentleman a friend of mine whom he locked up in the bastile for no reason in the world but because he was a wit and feared he might mention him with justice in some of his writings his way is that all men of sense are preferred banished or imprisoned he has indeed a sort of justice in him like that of the gamesters for if a standerby sees one at play cheat he has a right to come in for shares as knowing the mysteries of the game  this is a very wise and just maxim and if i have not left at mr morphews directed to me bank bills for  00 l on or before this day sevennight i shall tell how tom cash got his estate i expect three hundred pounds of mr soilett for concealing all the money he has lent to himself and his landed friend bound with him at thirty per cent at his scriveners absolute princes make people pay what they please in deference to their power i do not know why i should not do the same out of fear or respect to my knowledge i always preserve decorums and civilities to the fair sex therefore if a certain lady who left her coach at the new exchange door in the strand and whipped down durhamyard into a boat with a young gentleman for foxhall i say if she will send me word that i may give the fan which she dropped and i found to my sister jenny there shall be no more said of it i expect hushmoney to be regularly sent for every folly or vice any one commits in this whole town and hope i may pretend to deserve it better than a chambermaid or valet de chamber they only whisper it to the little set of their companions but i can tell it to all men living or who are to live therefore i desire all my readers to pay their fines or mend their lives  whites chocolatehouse june   my familiar being come from france with an answer to my letter to lewis of that kingdom instead of going on in a discourse of what he had seen in that court he put on the immediate concern of a guardian and fell to enquiring into my thoughts and adventures since his journey as short as his stay had been i confessed i had had many occasions for his assistance in my conduct but communicated to him my thoughts of putting all my force against the horrid and senseless custom of duels if it were possible said he to laugh at things in themselves so deeply tragical as the impertinent profusion of humane life i think i could divert you with a figure i saw just after my death when the philosopher threw me as i told you some days ago into the pail of water  you are to know that when men leave the body there are receptacles for them as soon as they depart according to the manner in which they lived and died at the very instant that i was killed there came away with me a spirit which had lost its body in a duel we were both examined me the whole assembly looked at with kindness and pity but at the same time with an air of welcome and consolation they pronounced me very happy who had died in innocence and told me a quite different place was allotted to me than that which was appointed for my companion there being a great distance from the mansions of fools and innocents though at the same time said one of the ghosts there is a great affinity between an idiot who has been so for long life and a child who departs before maturity but this gentleman who has arrived with you is a fool of his own making is ignorant out of choice and will fare accordingly the assembly began to flock about him and one said to him sir i observed you came into the gate of persons murdered and i desire to know what brought you to your untimely end he said he had been a second socrates who may be said to have been murdered by the commonwealth of athens stood by and began to draw near him in order after his manner to lead him into a sense of his error by concessions in his own discourse sir said that divine and amicable spirit what was the quarrel he answered we shall know very suddenly when the principal in the business comes for he was desperately wounded before i fell sir said the sage had you an estate yes sir the new guest answered i have left it in a very good condition and made my will the night before this occasion did you read it before you signed it yes sure sir said the new comer socrates replies could a man that would not give his estate without reading the instrument dispose of his life without asking a question that illustrious shade turned from him and a crowd of impertinent goblins who had been droles and parasites in their lifetime and were knocked on the head for their sawciness came about my fellowtraveller and made themselves very merry with questions about the words cart and terce and other terms of fencers but his thoughts began to settle into reflection upon the adventure which had robbed him of his late being and with a wretched sigh said he how terrible are conviction and guilt when they come too late for penitence pacolet was going on in this strain but he recovered from it and told me it was too soon to give my discourse on this subject so serious a turn you have chiefly to do with that part of mankind which must be led into reflection by degrees and you must treat this custom with humor and raillery to get an audience before you come to pronounce sentence upon it there is foundation enough for raising such entertainments from the practice on this occasion dont you know that often a man is called out of bed to follow implicitly a coxcomb with whom he would not keep company on any other occasion to ruin and death  then a good list of such as are qualified by the laws of these uncourteous men of chivalry to enter into combat who are often persons of honor without common honesty these i say ranged and drawn up in their proper order would give an aversion to doing any thing in common with such as men laugh at and contemn but to go through this work you must not let your thoughts vary or make excursions from your theme consider at the same time that the matter has been often treated by the ablest and greatest writers yet that must not disencourage you for the properest person to handle it is one who has roved into mixed conversations and must have opportunities which i shall give you of seeing these sort of men in their pleasures and gratifications among which they pretend to reckon fighting it was pleasantly enough said of a bully in france when duels first began to be punished the king has taken away gaming and stageplaying and now fighting too how does he expect gentlemen shall divert themselves  the tatler no    from thursd june   to saturd june      0  whites chocolatehouse june   pacolet being gone a strolling among the men of the sword in order to find out the secret causes of the frequent disputes we meet with and furnish me with materials for my treatise on duelling i have room left to go on in my information to my country readers whereby they may understand the bright people whose memoirs i have taken upon me to write but in my discourse of the   th of the last month i omitted to mention the most agreeable of all bad characters and that is a rake  a rake is a man always to be pitied and if he lives is one day certainly reclaimed for his faults proceed not from choice or inclination but from strong passions and appetites which are in youth too violent for the club of reason good sense good manners and good nature all which he must have by nature and education before he can be allowed to be or have been of this order he is a poor unweildy wretch that commits faults out of the redundance of his good qualities his pity and compassion makes him sometimes a bubble to all his fellows let em be never so much below him in understanding his desires run away with him through the strength and force of a lively imagination which hurries him on to unlawful pleasures before reason has power to come in to his rescue thus with all the good intentions in the world to amendment this creature sins on against heaven himself his friends and his country who all call for a better use of his talents there is not a being under the sun so miserable as this he goes on in a pursuit he himself disapproves and has no enjoyment but what is followed by remorse no relief from remorse but the repetition of his crime it is possible i may talk of this person with too much indulgence but i must repeat it that i think this a character which is the most the object of pity of any in the world the man in the pangs of the stone gout or any acute distempers is not in so deplorable a condition in the eye of right sense as he that errs and repents and repents and errs on the fellow with broken limbs justly deserves your alms for his impotent condition but he that cannot use his own reason is in a much worse state for you see him in miserable circumstances with his remedy at the same time in his own possession if he would or could use it this is the cause that of all ill characters the rake has the best quarter in the world for when he is himself and unruffled with intemperance you see his natural faculties exert themselves and attract an eye of favor toward his infirmities  but if we look round us here how many dull rogues are there that would fain be what this poor man hates himself for all the noise toward six in the evening is caused by his mimicks and imitators how ought men of sense to be careful of their actions if it were merely from the indignation of seeing themselves ill drawn by such little pretenders not to say he that leads is guilty of all the actions of his followers and a rake has imitators whom you would never expect should prove sosecondhand vice sure of all is the most nauseous there is hardly a folly more absurd or which seems less to be accounted for though it is what we see every day than that grave and honest natures give into this way and at the same time have good sense if they thought fit to use it but the fatality under which most men labor of desiring to be what they are not makes em go out of a method in which they might be received with applause and would certainly excel into one wherein they will all their life have the air of strangers to what they aim at  for this reason i have not lamented the metamorphosis of any one i know so much as of nobilis who was born with sweetness of temper just apprehension and every thing else that might make him a man fit for his order but instead of the pursuit of sober studies and applications in which he would certainly be capable of making a considerable figure in the noblest assembly of men in the world i say in spite of that good nature which is his proper bent he will say illnatured things aloud put such as he was and still should be out of countenance and drown all the natural good in him to receive an artificial ill character in which he will never succeed for nobilis is no rake he may guzzle as much wine as he pleases talk bawdy if he thinks fit but he may as well drink water gruel and go twice a day to church for it will never do i pronounce it again nobilis is no rake to be of that order he must be vicious against his will and not so by study or application all pretty fellows are also excluded to a man as well as all inamaratoes or persons of the epicene gender who gaze at one another in the presence of ladies this class of which i am giving you an account is pretended to also by men of strong abilities in drinking though they are such whom the liquor not the conversation keeps together but blockheads may roar fight and stab and be never the nearer their labor is also lost they want sense they are no rakes  as a rake among men is the man who lives in the constant abuse of his reason so a coquet among women is one who lives in continual misapplication of her beauty the chief of all whom i have the honor to be acquainted with is pretty mrs toss she is ever in practice of something which disfigures her and takes from her charms though all she does tends to a contrary effect she has naturally a very agreeable voice and utterance which she has changed for the prettiest lisp imaginable she sees what she has a mind to see at half a mile distance but poring with her eyes half shut at every one she passes by she believes much more becoming the cupid on her fan and she have their eyes full on each other all the time in which they are not both in motion whenever her eye is turned from that dear object you may have a glance and your bow if she is in humor returned as civilly as you make it but that must not be in the presence of a man of greater quality for mrs toss is so thoroughly well bred that the chief person present has all her regards and she who giggles at divine service and laughs at her very mother can compose her self at the approach of a man of a good estate  wills coffeehouse june   a fine lady showed a gentleman of this company for an eternal answer to all his addresses a paper of verses with which she is so captivated that she professed the author should be the happy man in spite of all other pretenders it is ordinary for love to make men poetical and it had that effect on this enamored man but he was resolved to try his vein upon some of her confidents or retinue before he ventured upon so high a theme as her self to do otherwise than so would be like making an heroic poem a mans first attempt among the favorites to the fair one he found her parrat not to be in the last degree he saw poll had her ear when his sighs were neglected to write against him had been a fruitless labor therefore he resolved to flatter him into his interests in the following manner  to a lady on her parrat when nymphs were coy and love could not prevail the gods disguised were seldom known to fail leda was chaste but yet a feathered jove surpised the fair and taught her how to love there is no celestial but his heaven woud quit for any form which might to thee admit see how the wanton bird at every glance swells his glad plumes and feels an amorous trunce the queen of beauty has forsook the dove henceforth the parrat be the bird of love it is indeed a very just proposition to give that honor rather to the parrat than the other volatile the parrat represents us in the state of making love the dove in the possession of the object beloved but instead of turning the dove off i fancy it would be better if the chaise of venus had hereafter a parrat added as we see sometimes a third horse to a coach which might intimate that to be a parrat is the only way to succeed and to be a dove to preserve your conquests if the swain would go on successfully he must imitate the bird he writes upon for he who would be loved by women must never be silent before the favor or open his lips after it  from my own apartment june  0 i have so many messages from young gentlemen who expect preferment and distinction that i am wholly at a loss in what manner to acquit my self the writer of the following letter tells me in a postscript he cannot go out of town till i have taken some notice of him and is very urgent to be some body in it before he returns to his commons at the university but take it from himself  to isaac bickerstaff esquire monitor general of great britain sheerlane june   sir i have been above   months from the university of age these   months and so long in town i was recommended to one charles bubbleboy near the temple who has supplied me with all the furniture he says a gentleman ought to have i desired a certificate thereof from him which he said would require some time to consider of and when i went yesterday morning for it he tells me upon due consideration i still want some few odd things more to the value of threescore or fourscore pounds to make me complete i have bespoke them and the favor i beg of you is to know when i am equipped in what part or class of men in this town you will place me pray send me word what i am and you shall find me  sir your most humble servant jeffry nicknack   i am very willing to encourage young beginners but am extremely in the dark how to dispose of this gentleman i cannot see either his person or habit in this letter but i will call at charless and know the shape of his snuff box by which i can settle his character though indeed to know his full capacity i ought to be informed whether he takes spanish or musty  st jamess coffeehouse june  0 letters from the low countries of the   th instant say that the duke of marlborough and the prince of

lieutenant general dompre with a body of eight thousand men is posted at alost in order to cover ghont and brussels the marshal de villars was still on the plains of lenz and it is said the duke of

powerful opposition  the tatler no    from saturd june    to tuesd june      0  whites chocolatehouse june    i had suspended the business of duelling to a distant time but that i am called upon to declare my self on a point proposed in the following letter  june   at night sir i desire the favor of you to decide this question whether calling a gentleman a smart fellow is an affront or not a youth entering a certain coffeehouse with his cane tied at his button wearing redheeld shoes i thought of your description and could not forbear telling a friend of mine next to me there enters a smart fellow the gentleman hearing it had immediately a mind to pick a quarrel with me and desired satisfaction at which i was more puzzled than at the other remembering what mention your familiar makes of those that had lost their lives on such occasions the thing is referred to your judgment and i expect you to be my second since you have been the cause of our quarrel i am  sir your friend and humble servant   i absolutely pronounce that there is no occasion of offense given in this expression for a smart fellow is always an appellation of praise and is a man of double capacity the true cast or mould in which you may be sure to know him is when his livelihood or education is in the civil list and you see him express a vivacity or mettle above the way he is in by a little jerk in his motion short trip in his steps wellfancied lining of his coat or any other indications which may be given in a vigorous dress now what possible insinuation can there be that it is a cause of quarrel for a man to say he allows a gentleman really to be what he his tailor his hosier and his millener have conspired to make him i confess if this person who appeals to me had said he was not a smart fellow there had been cause for resentment but if he stands to it that he is one he leaves no manner of ground for a misunderstanding indeed it is a most lamentable thing that there should be a dispure raised upon a mans saying another is what he plainly takes pains to be thought  but this point connot be so well adjusted as by enquiring what are the sentiments of wise nations and communities of the use of the sword and from thence conclude whether it is honorable to draw it so frequently or not an illustrious commonwealth of italy has preserved it self for many ages without letting one of their subjects handle this destructive instrument always leaving that work to such of mankind as understand the use of a whole skin so little as to make a profession of exposing it to cuts and scars  but what need we run to such foreign instances our most ancient and wellgoverned cities are conspicuous exemples to all mankind in their regulation of military achievements the chief citizens like the noble italians hire mercenaries to carry arms in their stead and you shall have a fellow of a desperate fortune for the gain of one halfcrown go through all the dangers of tuttlefields or the artilleryground clap his right jaw within two inches of the touchhole of a musket fire it off and huzza with as little concern as he tears a pullet thus you see to what scorn of danger these mercenaries arrive out of a mere love of sordid gain but methinks it should take off the strong prepossession men have in favor of bold actions when they see upon what low motives men aspire to em do but observe the common practice in the government of those heroic bodies our militia and lieutenancies the most ancient corpse of soldiers perhaps in the universe i question whether there is one instance of an animosity between any two of these illustrious sons of mars since their institution which was decided by combat i remember indeed to have read the chronicle of an accident which had like to have occasiond bloodshed in the very field before all the general officers though most of them were justices of the peace captain crabtree of birchinglane haberdasher had drawn a bill upon major general maggot cheesemonger in thames street crabtree draws this upon mr william maggot and company a country lad received this bill and not understanding the word company used in drawing bills on men in partnership carried it to mr jeffrey stitch of crookedlane lieutenant of the majorgenerals company whom he had the day before seen march by the door in all the pomp of his commission the lieutenant accepts it for the honor of the company since it had come to him but repayment being asked from the major general he absolutely refuses upon this the lieutenant thinks of nothing less than to bring this to a rupture and takes for his second tobias armstrong of the counter and sends him with a challenge in a scrip of parchment wherein was written stitch contra maggot and all the fury vanished in a moment the major general gives satisfaction to the second and all was well  hence it is that the bold spirits of our city are kept in such subjection to the civil power otherwise where would our liberties soon be if wealth and valor were suffered to exert themselves with their utmost force if such officers as are employed in the terrible bands abovementioned were to draw bills as well as swords these dangerous captains who could victual an army as well as lead it would be too powerful for the state but the point of honor justly gives way to that of gain and by long and wise regulation the richest is the bravest man i have known a captain rise to a colonel in two days by the fall of stocks and a major my good friend near the monument ascended to that honor by the fall of the price of spirits and the rising of right nantz by this true sense of honor that body of warriors are ever in good order and discipline with their colors and coats all whole as in other battalions where their principles of action are less solid you see the men of service look like specter with long sides and lank cheeks in this army you may measure a mans services by his waste and the most prominent belly is certainly the man who has been most upon action besides all this there is another excellent remark to be made in the discipline of these troops it being of absolute necessity that the people of england should see what they have for their money and be eyewitnesses of the advantages they gain by it all battles which are fought abroad are represented here but since one side must be beaten and the other conquer which might create disputes the eldest company is always to make the other run and the younger retreats according to the last news and best intelligence i have my self seen prince eugene make catinat fly from the backside of graysinnlane to hockley in the hole and not give over the pursuit till obliged to leave the beargarden on the right to avoid being borne down by fencers wild bulls and monsters too terrible for the encounter of any heroes but such whose lives are their livelihood  we have here seen that wise nations do not admit of fighting even in the defense of their country as a laudable action and they live within the walls of our own city in great honor and reputation without it it would be very necessary to understand by what force of the climate food education or employment one mans sense is brought to differ so essentially from that of another that one is ridiculous and contemptible for forbearing a thing which makes for his safety and another applauded for consulting his ruin and destruction  it will therefore be necessary for us to show our traveling to examine this subject fully and tell you how it comes to pass that a man of honor in spain though you offend him never so gallantly stabs you basely in england though you offend never so basely challenges fairly the former kills you out of revenge the latter out of good breeding but to probe the heart of man in this particular to its utmost thoughts and recesses i must wait for the return of pacelet who is now attending a gentleman lately in a duel and sometimes visits the person by whose hand he received his wounds  st jamess coffeehouse june    letters from vienna of the  th instant say there has been a journal of the marches and actions of the king of sweden from the beginning of january to the   th of april n s communicated by the swedish ministers to that court these advices inform that his swedish majesty entered the territories of muscovy in february last with the main body of his army in order to oblige the enemy to a general engagement but that the muscovites declining a battle and an universal thaw having rendered the rivers unpassable the king returned into ukrania there are mentioned several rencounters between considerable detachments of the swedish and russian armies marshal heister intended to take his leave of the court on the day after the date of these letters and put himself at the head of the army in hungary the malcontents had attempted to send in a supply of provisions into newhausel but their design was disappointed by the germans  advices from berlin of the   th instant n s say that his danish majesty having received an invitation from the king of prussia to an interview designed to come to potsdam within few days and that king augustus resolved to accompany him thither to avoid all difficulties in ceremony the three kings and all the company who shall have the honor to sit with them at table are to draw lots and take precedence accordingly  they write from hamburgh of the   th instant n s that some particular letters from dantzick speak of a late action between the swedes and muscovites near jeroslaw but that engagement being mentioned from no other place there is not much credit given to this intelligence  we hear from brussels by letters dated the  0th that on the   th in the evening the duke of marlborough and prince eugene arrived at courtray with a design to proceed the day following to list in the neighborhood of which city the confederate army was to rendezvous the same day advices from paris inform us that the marshal de bezons is appointed to command in dauphine and that the duke of berwick is set out for spain with a design to follow the fortunes of the duke of anjou in case the french king should comply with the late demands of the allies  the court of france has sent a circular letter to all the governors of the provinces to recommend to their consideration his majestys late conduct in the affair of peace it is thought fit in that epistle to condescend to a certain appeal to the people whether it is consistent with the dignity of the crown or the french name to submit to the preliminaties demanded by the confederates that letter dwells upon the unreasonableness of the allies in requiring his majestys assistance in dethroning his grandson and treats this particular in language more suitable to it as it is a topic of oratory than a real circumstance on which the interests of nations and reasons of state which affect all europe are concerned  the close of this memorial seems to prepare the people to expect all events attributing the confidence of the enemy to the goodness of their troops but acknowledging that his sole dependence is upon the intervention of providence  the tatler no    from tuesd june    to thursd june      0  whites chocolatehouse june    having a very solid respect for humane nature however it is distorted from its natural make by affectation humor custom misfortune or vice i do apply my self to my friends to help me in raising arguments for preserving it in all its individuals as long as it is permitted to one of my letters on this subject i have received the following answer  sir in answer to your question why men of sense virtue and experience are seen still to comply with that ridiculous custom of duelling i must desire you to reflect that custom has disbd up in ruffs the wisest heads of our ancestors and put the best of the present age into huge falbala periwigs men of sense would not impose such encumbrances on themselves but be glad they might show their faces decently in public upon easier terms if then such men appar reasonably slaves to the fashion in what regads the figure of their persons me ought not to wonder that they are at least so in what seems to touch their reputations besides you cannot be ignorant that dress and chivalry have been always encouraged by the ladies as the two principal branches of gallantry it is to avoid being sneerd at for his singularity and from a desire to appear more agreeable to his mistress that a wise experienced and polite man accomplices with the dress commonly received and is prevailed upon to violate his reason and principles in hazarding his life and estate by a tilt as well as suffering his pleasures to be constrained and sowred by the constant apprehension of a quarrel this is the more surprising because men of the most delicate sense and principles have naturally in other cases a particular repugnance in accommodating themselves to the maxims of the world but one may easily distinguish the man that is affected with beauetry and the reputation of a tilt from him who complies with both merely as they are imposed upon him by custom for in the former you will remark an air of vanity and triumph whereas when the latter appears in a long duvillier full of powder or has decided a quarrel by the sword you may perceive in his face that he appeals to custom for an excuse i think it may not be improper to enquire into the genealogy of this chimerical monster called a duel which i take to be an illegitimate species of the ancient knighterrantry by the laws of this whim your heroic person or man of gallantry was indispensibly obliged to starve in armor a certain number of years in the chase of monsters encounter them at the peril of his life and suffer great hardships in order to gain the affection of the fair lady and qualify himself for assuming the blleair that is of a pretty fellow or man of honor according to the fashion but since the publishing of don quixot and extinction of the race of dragons which suetonius says happened in that of wantley the gallant and heroic spirits of these latter times have been under the necessity of creating new chimerical monsters to entertain themselves with by way of single combat as the only proofs they are able to give their own sex and the ladies that they are in all poins men of nice honor but to do justice to the ancient and real monsters i must observe that they never molested those who were not of a humor to hunt for them in the woods and deserts whereas on the contrary our modern monsters are so familiarly admitted and entertained in all the courts and cities of europe except france that one can scarce be in the most humanizd society without risquing ones life the people of the best sort and the fine gentlemen of the age being so fond of em that they seldom appear in any public place without one i have some further considerations upon this subject which as you encourage me shall be communicated to you by sir a cousin but once removed from the best family of the staffs namely  sir your humble servant kinsman and friend tim switch   it is certain mr switch has hit upon the true source of this evil and that it proceeds only from the force of custom that we contradict our selves in half the particulars and occurrences of life but such a tyranny in love which the fair impose upon us is a little too severe that we must demonstrate our affection for em by no certain proof but hatred to one another or come at them only as one does to an estate by survivorship this way of application to gain a ladys heart is taking her as we do towns and castles by distressing the place and letting none come near em without our pass were such a lover once to write the truth of his heart and let her know his whole thoughts he would appear indeed to have a passion for her but it would hardly be called love the billetdeux would run to this purpose  madam i have so tender a regard for you and your interests that i will knock any man in the head whom i observe to be of my mind and like you mr truman the other day looked at you in so languishing a manner that i am resolved to run him through to morrow morning this i think he deserves for his guilt in admiring you than which i cannot have a greater reason for murdering him except it be that you also approve him whoever says he dies for you i will make his words good for i will kill him i am  madam your most obedient most humble servant   from my own apartment june    i am just come hither at ten at night and have ever since six been in the most celebrated though most nauseous company in town the two leaders of the society were a critic and a wit these two gentlemen are great opponents upon all occasions not discerning that they are the nearest each other in temper and talents of any two classes of men in the world for to profess judgment and to profess wit both arise from the same failure which is want of judgment the poverty of the critic this way proceeds from the abuse of his faculty that of the wit from the neglect of it it is a particular observation i have always made that of all morrals a critic is the silliest for by inuring himself to examine all things whether they are of consequence or not he never looks upon any thing but with a design of passing sentence upon it by which means he is never a companion but always a censor this makes him earnest upon trifles and dispute on the most indifferent occasions with vehemence if he offers to speak or write that talent which should approve the work of the other faculties prevents their operation he comes upon action in armor but without weapons he stands in safety but can gain no glory the wit on the other hand has been hurried so long away by imagination only that judgment seems not to have ever been one of his natural faculties this gentleman takes himself to be as much obliged to be merry as the other to be grave a thorough critic is a sort of puritan in the polite world as an enthusiast in religion stumbles at the ordinary occurrences of life if he cannot quote scripture examples on the occasion so the critic is never safe in his speech or writing without he has among the celebrated writers an authority for the truth of his sentence you will believe we had a very good time with these brethren who were so far out of the dress of their native country and so lost to its dialect that they were as much strangers to themselves as to their relation to each other they took up the whole discourse sometimes the critic grew passionate and when reprimanded by the wit for any trip or hesitation in his voice he would answer mr dryden makes such a character on such an occasion break off in the same manner so that the stop was according to nature and as a man in a passion should do the wit who is as far gone in letters as himself seems to be at a loss to answer such an apology and concludes only that though his anger is justly vented it wants fire in the utterance if wit is to be measured by the circumstances of time and place there is no man has generally so little of that talent as he who is a wit by profession what he says instead of arising from the occasion has an occasion invented to bring it in thus he is new for no other reason but that he talks like no body else but has taken up a method of his own without commerce or dialogue with other people the lively jasper dactyle is one of this character he seems to have made a vow to be witty to his lifes end when you meet him what do you think says he i have been entertaining my self with then out comes a premeditated turn to which it is to no purpose to answer for he goes on in the same strain of thought he designed without your speaking therefore i have a general answer to all he can say as sure there never was any creature had so much fire spondee who is a critic is seldom out of this fine mans company they have no manner of affection for each other but keep together like novell and oldfox in the plaindealer because they show each other i know several of sense who can be diverted with this couple but i see no curiosity in the thing except it be that spondee is dull and seems dull but dactyle is heavy with a brisk face it must be owned also that dactyle has almost vigor enough to be a coxcomb but spondee by the lowness of his constitution is only a blockhead  st jamess coffeehouse june    we have no particulars of moment since our last except it be that the copy of the following original letter came by the way of ostend it is said to have been found in the closet of monsieur chamillard the late secretary of state of france since his disgrace it was signed by two brothers of the famous cavalier who led the cevennois and had a personal interview with the king as well as a capitulation to lay down his arms and leave the dominions of france there are many other names to it among whom is the chief of the family of the marquis guiscard it is not yet known whether monsieur chamillard had any real design to favor the protestant interest or only thought to place himself at the head of that people to make himself considerable enough to oppose his enemies at court and reinstate himself in power there  sir we have read your majestys soon after the conclusion of the late treaty of peace the french king dispersed a letter through his dominions wherein he shows the reasons why he could not ratify the preliminaries vide the public newspapers of this date letter to the governors of your provinces with instructions what sentiments to insinuate into the minds of your people but as you have always acted upon the maxim that we were made for you and not you for us we must take leave to assure your majesty that we are exactly of the contrary opinion and must desire you to send for your grandson home and acquaint him that you now know by experience absolute power is only a vertigo in the brain of princes which for a time may quicken their motion and double in their diseased sight the instances of power above em but must end in their fall and destruction your memorial speaks a good father of your family but a very ill one of your people your majesty is reduced to hear truth when you are obliged to speak it there is no governing any but savages by other methods than their own consent which you seem to acknowledge in appealing to us for our opinion of your conduct in treating of peace had your people been always of your council the king of france had never been reduced so low as to acknowledge his arms were fallen into contempt but since it is thus we must ask how is any man of france but they of the house of bourbon the better that philip is king of spain we have outgrown that folly of placing our happiness in your majestys being called the great therefore as you and we are all alike nb mons bernard and the chief banker of france became bankrupts about this time bankrupts and undone let us not deceive our selves but compound with our adversaries and not talk like their equals your majesty must forgive us that we cannot wish you success or lend you help for if you lose one battle more we may have an hand in the peace you make and doubt not but your majestys faith in treaties will require the ratification of the states of your kingdoms so we bid you heartily farewell till we have the honor to meet you assembled in parliament this happy expectation makes us willing to wait the event of another campaign from whence we hope to be raised from the mise y of slaves to the privileges of subjects we are  your majestys truly faithful and loyal subjects etc   the tatler no  0 from thursd june    to saturd june      0  from my own apartment june    the vigilance the anxiety the tenderness which i have for the good people of england i am persuaded will in time be much commended but i doubt whether they will ever be rewarded however i must go on cheerfully in my work of reformation that being my great design i am studious to prevent my labors increasing upon me therefore am particularly observant of the temper and inclinations of childhood and youth that we may not give vice and folly supplies from the growing generation it is hardly to be imagined how useful this study is and what great evils or benefits arise from putting us in our tender years to what we are fit or unfit therefore on tuesday last with a design to sound their inclinations i took three lads who are under my guardianship a rambling in a hackneycoach to show them the town as the lions the tombs bedlam and the other places which are entertainments to raw minds because they strike forcibly on the fancy the boys are brothers one of sixteen the other of fourteen the other of twelve the first was his fathers darling the second his mothers and the third is mine who am their uncle mr william is a lad of true genius but being at the upper end of a great school and having all the boys below him his arrogance is insupportable if i begin to show a little of my latin he immediately interrupts uncle under favor that which you say is not understood in that manner brother says my boy jack you do not show your manners much in contradicting my uncle isaac you queer cur says mr william do you think my uncle takes any notice of such a dull rogue as you are mr william goes on he is the most stupid of all my mothers children he knows nothing of his book when he should mind that he is hiding or hoarding his taws and marbles or laying up farthings his way of thinking is four and twenty farthings make sixpence and two sixpences a shilling two shillings and sixpence half a crown and two halfcrowns five shillings so within these two months the close hunks has scraped up twenty shillings and well make him spend it all before he comes home jack immediately claps his hands into both pockets and turns as pale as ashes there is nothing touches a parent and such i am to jack so nearly as a provident conduct this lad has in him the true temper for a good husband a kind father and an honest executor all the great people you see make considerable figures on the change in court and sometimes in senates are such as in reality have no greater faculty than what may be called humane instinct which is a natural tendency to their own preservation and that of their friends without being capable of striking out of the road for adventures there is sir william scrip was of this sort of capacity from his childhood he has bought the country round him and makes a bargain better than sir harry wildfire with all his wit and humor sir harry never wants money but he comes to scrip laughs at him half an hour and then gives bond for the other thousand the close men are incapable of placing merit any where but in their pence and therefore gain it while others who have larger capacities are diverted from the pursuit by enjoyments which can be supported only by that cash which they despise and therefore are in the end slaves to their inferiors both in fortune and understanding i once heard a man of excellent sense observe that more affairs in the world failed by being in the hands of men of too large capacities for their business than by being in the conduct of such as wanted abilities to execute them jack therefore being of a plodding make shall be a citizen and i design him to be the refuge of the family in their distress as well as their jest in prosperity his brother will shall go to oxford with all speed where if he does not arrive at being a man of sense he will soon be informed wherein he is a coxcomb there is in that place such a true spirit of raillery and humor that if they cannot make you a wise man they will certainly let you know you are a fool which is all my cousin wants to cease to be so thus having taken these two out of the way i have leisure to look at my third lad i observe in the young rogue a natural subtilty of mind which discovers it self rather in forbearing to declare his thoughts on any occasion than in any visible way of exerting himself in discourse for which reason i will place him where if he commits no faults he may go further than those in other stations though they excel in virtues the boy is well fashioned and will easily fall into a graceful manner wherefore i have a design to make him a page to a great lady of my acquaintance by which means he will be well skilled in the common modes of life and make a greater progress in the world by that knowledge than with the greatest qualities without it a good mien in a court will carry a man greater lengths than a good understanding in any other place we see a world of pains taken and the best years of life spent in collecting a set of thoughts in a college for the conduct of life and after all the man so qualified shall hesitate in his speech to a good suit of clothes and want common sense before an agreeable woman hence it is that wisdom valor justice and learning cannot keep a man in countenance that is possessed with these excellencies if he wants that inferior art of life and behavior called good breeding a man endowed with great perfections without this is like one who has his pockets full of gold but always wants change for his ordinary occasions  will courtly is a living instance of this truth and has had the same education which i am giving my nephew he never spoke a thing but what was said before and yet can converse with the wittiest men without being ridiculous among the learned he does not appear ignorant nor with the wise indiscreet living in conversation from his infancy makes him no where at a loss and a long familiarity with the persons of men is in a manner of the same service to him as if he knew their arts as ceremony is the invention of wise men to keep fools at a distance so good breeding is an expedient to make fools and wise men equals  wills coffeehouse june    the suspension of the playhouse has made me have nothing to send you from hence but calling here this evening i found the party i usually sit with upon the business of writing and examining what was the handsomest style in which to address women and write letters of gallantry many were the opinions which were immediately declared on this subject some were for a certain softness some for i know not what delicacy others for something inexpressibly tender when it came to me i said there was no rule in the world to be made for writing letters but that of being as near what you speak face to face as you can which is so great a truth that i am of opinion writing has lost more mistresses than any one mistake in the whole legend of love for when you write to a lady for whom you have a solid and honorable passion the great idea you have of her joined to a quick sense of her absence fills your mind with a sort of tenderness that gives your language too much the air of complaint which is seldom successful for a man may flatter himself as he pleases but he will find that the women have more understanding in their own affairs than we have and women of spirit are not to be won by mourners he that can keep handsomely within rules and support the carriage of a companion to his mistress is much more likely to prevail than he who lets her see the whole relish of his life depends upon her if possible therefore divert your mistress rather than sigh to her the pleasant man she will desire for her own sake but the languishing lover has nothing to hope from but her pity to show the difference i produced two letters  lady gave me which had been writ by two gentlemen who pretended to her but were bot killed the next day after the date at the batt of almonza one of them was a mercurial ga humored man the other a man of a serious b a great and gallant spirit poor jack careles this is his letter you see how it is folded t air of it is so negligent one might have re half of it by peeping into it without breaking  open he had no exactness  madam it is a very pleasant circumstance i am in that while i should be thinking of the good company we are to meet within a day or two where we shall go to loggerheads my thoughts are running upon a fair enemy in england i was in hopes i had left you there but you follow the camp though i have endeavored to make some of our leaguer ladies drive you out of the field all my comfort is you are more troublesome to my colonel than my self i permit you to visit me only now and then but he downright keeps you i laugh at his honor as far as his gravity will allow me but i know him to be a man of too much merit to succeed with a woman therefore defend your heart as well as you can i shall come home this winter irresistibly dressed and with quite a new foreign air and so i had like to say i rest but alas i remain  madam your most obedient most humble servant john careless   now for colonel constants epistle you see it is folded and directed with the utmost care  madam i do my self the honor to write to you this evening because i believe to morrow will be a day of battle and something forebodes in my breast that i shall fall in it if it proves so i hope you will hear i have done nothing below a man who had the love of his country quickened by a passion for a woman of honor if there be any thing noble in going to a certain death if there be any merit that i meet it with pleasure by promising my self a place in your esteem if your applause when i am no more is preferable to the most glorious life without you i say madam if any of these considerations can have weight with you you will give me a kind place in your memory which i prefer to the glory of caesar i hope this will be read as it is writ with tears   the beloved lady is a woman of a sensible mind but she has confessed to me that after all her true and solid value for constant she had much more concern for the loss of careless those noble and serious spirits have something equal to the adversities they meet with and consequently lessen the objects of pity great accidents seem not cut out so much for men of familiar characters which makes them more easily pitied and soon after beloved add to this that the sort of love which generally succeeds is a stranger to awe and distance i asked romana whether of the two she should have chosen had they survived she said she knew she ought to have taken constant but believed she should have chosen careless  st jamess coffeehouse june    letters from lisbon of the  th instant n s say that the enemys army having blocked up olivenza was posted on the guadiana the portuguese are very apprehensive that the garrison of that place though it consists of five of the best regiments of their army will be obliged to surrender if not timely relieved they not being supplied with provisions for more than six weeks hereupon their generals held a council of war on the  th instant wherein it was concluded to advance toward badajos with this design the army decamped on the  th from jerumena and marched to cancaon it is hoped that if the enemy follow their motions they may have opportunity to put a sufficient quantity of provision and ammunition into olivenza  mr bickerstaff gives notice to all persons that dress themselves as they please without regard to decorum as with blue and red stockings in mourning tucked cravats and nightcap wigs before people of the first quality that he has yet received no fine for indulging them in that liberty and that he expects their compliance with this demand or that they go home immediately and shift themselves this is further to acquaint the town that the report of the hosiers toymen and milleners having compounded with mr bickerstaff for tolerating such enormities is utterly false and scandalous  the tatler no    from saturday june    to tuesd june      0  grecian coffeehouse june    in my dissertation against the custom of single combat it has been objected that there is not learning or much reading shown therein which is the very life and soul of all treatises for which reason being always easy to receive admonitions and reform my errors i thought fit to consult this learned board on the subject upon proposing some doubts and desiring their assistance a very hopeful young gentleman my relation who is to be called to the bar within a year and an half at farthest told me that he had ever since i first mentioned duelling turned his head that way and that he was principally moved thereto because he designed to follow the circuits in the north of england and the south of scotland and to reside mostly at his own estate at landbadernawz in cardiganshire the northern britains and the southern scots are a warm people and the welsh a nation of gentlemen so that it behooved him to understand well the science of quarrelling the young gentleman proceeded admirably well and gave the board an account that he had read fitzherberts grand abridgment and had found that duelling is a very ancient part of the law for when a man is sued be it for his life or his land the person that joins the issue whether plaintiff or defendant may put the trial upon the duel further he argued under favor of the court that when the issue is joined by the duel in treason or other capital crimes the parties accused and accuser must fight in their own proper persons but if the dispute be for lands you may hire a champion at hockley in the hole or any where else this part of the law we had from the saxons and they had it as also the trial by ordeal from the laplanders it is indeed agreed said he the southern and eastern nations never knew any thing of it for though the ancient romans would scold and call names filthily yet there is not an example of a challenge that ever passed amongst them  his quoting the eastern nations put another gentleman in mind of an account he had from a boatswain of an east india man which was that a chinese had tricked and bubbled him and that when he came to demand satisfaction the next morning and like a true tar of honor called him son of a whore liar dog and other rough appellatives used by persons conversant with winds and waves the chinese with great tranquillity desired him not to come abroad fasting nor put himself in a heat for it would prejudice his health thus the east knows nothing of this gallantry  there sat at the left of the table a person of a venerable aspect who asserted that half the impositions which are put upon these ages have been transmitted by writers who have given too great pomp and magnificence to the exploits of the ancient beargarden and made their gladiators by fabulous tradition greater than gorman and others of great britain he informed the company that he had searched authorities for what he said and that a learned antiquary humphrey scarecrow esquire of hockley in the hole recorder to the beargarden was then writing a discourse on the subject it appears by the best accounts says this gentleman that the high names which are used among us with so great veneration were no other than stagefighters and worthies of the ancient beargarden the renowned hercules always carried a quarterstaff and was from thence called claviger a learned chronologist is about proving what wood this staff was made of whether oak ash or crabtree the first trial of skill he ever performed was with one cacus a deerstealer the next was with typhonus a giant of forty foot four inches indeed it was unhappily recorded that meeting at last with a sailors wife she made his staff of prowess serve her own use and dwindle away to a distaff she clapped him on an old tarjacket of her husbands so that this great hero drooped like a scabbed sheep him his contemporary theseus succeeded in the beargarden which honor he held for many years this grand duellist went to hell and was the only one of that sort that ever came back again as for achilles and hector as the ballads of those times mention they were pretty smart fellows they fought at sword and buckler but the former had much the better of it his mother who was an oysterwoman having got a blacksmith of lemnos to make her sons weapons there is a pair of trusty trojans in a song of virgils that were famous for handling their gauntlets dares and entellus and indeed it does appear they fought no sham prize what arms the great alexander used is uncertain however the historian mentions when he attacked thalestris it was only at single rapier but the weapon soon failed for it was always observed that the amazons had a sort of enchantment about them which made the blade of the weapon though never of so good metal at every home push lose its edge and grow feeble  the roman beargarden was abundantly more magnificent than any thing greece could boast of it flourished most under those delights of mankind nero and domitian at one time it is recorded  00 senators entered the list and thought it an honor to be cudgelled and quarterstaffed i observe the lanistae were the people chiefly employed which makes me imagine our beargarden copied much after this the butchers being the greatest men in it  thus far the glory and honor of the beargarden stood secure till fate that irresistible ruler of sublunary things in that universal ruin of arts and politer learning by those savage people the goths and vandals destroyed and levelled it to the ground then fell the grandeur and bravery of the roman state till at last the warlike genius but accompanied with more courtesy revived in the christian world under those puissant champions st george st dennis and other dignified heroes one killed his dragon another his lion and were all afterward canonized for it having red letters before them to illustrate their martial temper the spanish nation it must be owned were devoted to gallantry and chivalry above the rest of the world what a great figure does that great name don quixot make in history how shines this glorious star in the western world o renowned hero o mirror of knighthood thy branishd winyard all the world defies and kills as sure as del tobosas eyes i am forced to break off abruptly being sent for in haste with my rule to measure the degree of an affront before the two gentlemen who are now in their breeches and pumps ready to engage behind mountaguehouse have made a pass  from my own apartment june    it is an unreasonable objection i find against my labors that my stock is not all my own and therefore the kind reception i have met with is not so deserved as it ought to be but i hope though it be never so true that i am obliged to my friends for laying their cash in my hands since i give it them again when they please and leave them at their liberty to call it home it will not hurt me with my gentle readers ask all the merchants who act upon consignments where is the necessity if they answer readily what their correspondents draw of their being wealthy themselves ask the greatest bankers if all the men they deal with were to draw at once what would be the consequence but indeed a country friend has writ me a letter which gives me great mortification wherein i find i am so far from expecting a supply from thence that some have not heard of me and the rest do not understand me his epistle is as follows  dear cousin i thought when i left the town to have raised your fame here and helped you to support it by intelligence from hence but alas they had never heard of the tatler till i brought down a set i lent them from house to house but they asked we what they meant i began to enlighten them by telling who and who were supposed to be intended by the characters drawn i said for instance chloe and clarissa are two eminent toasts a gentleman who keeps his greyhound and gun and one would think might know better told me he supposed they were papishes for their names were not english then said he why do you call live people toasts i answered that was a new name found out by the wits to make a lady have the same effect as burridge in the glass when a man is drinking but says i sir i perceive this is to you all bamboozling why you look as if you were don diegod to the tune of a thousand pounds all this good language was lost upon him he only stared though he is as good a scholar as any layman in the town except the barber thus cousin you must be content with london for the center of your wealth and fame we have no relish for you wit must describe its proper circumference and not go beyond it lest like little boys when they straggle out of their own parish it may wander to places where it is not known and be lost since it is so you must excuse me that i am forced at a visit to sit silent and only lay up what excellent things pass at such conversations  this evening i was with a couple of young ladies one of them has the character of the prettiest company yet really i thought her but silly the other who talked a great deal less i observed to have understanding the lady who is reckoned such a companion among her acquaintance has only with a very brisk air a knack of saying the commonest things the other with a sly serious one says home things enough the first mistress giddy is very quick but the second mrs slim fell into giddys own style and was as good company as she giddy happens to drop her glove slim reaches it to her madam says giddy i hope you will have a better office upon which slim immediately repartees and sits in her lap and cries are you not sorry for my heaviness this sly wench pleased me to see how she hit her height of understanding so well we sat down to supper says giddy mighty prettily two hands in a dish and one in a purse says slim ay madam the more the merrier but the fewer the better cheer i quickly took the hint and was as witty and talkative as they says i he that will not when he may when he will he shall have nay and so helped my self giddy turns about what have you found your tongue yes says i it is manners to speak when i am spoken to but your greatest talkers are the least doers and the still sow eats up all the broth ha ha says giddy one would think he had nothing in him and do you hear how he talks when he pleases i grew immediately roguish and pleasant to a degree in the same strain slim who knew how good company we had been cries you will certainly print this bright conversation   it is so and hereby you may see how small an appearance the prettiest things said in company make when in print  st jamess coffeehouse june  0

an answer to the following letter being absolutely necessary to be dispatched with all expedition i must trespass upon all that come with horary questions into my antichamber to give the gentleman my opinion  to isaac bickerstaff esquire june      0  sir i know not whether you ought to pity or laugh at me for i am fallen desperately in love with a professed platonne the most unaccountable creature of her sex to hear her talk seraphicks and run over norris and moor and milton and the whole set of intellectual triflers torments me heartily for to a lover who understands metaphors all this pretty prattle of ideas gives very fine views of pleasure which only the dear declaimer prevents by understanding them literally why should she wish to be a cherubim when it is flesh and blood that makes her adorable if i speak to her that is a high breach of the idea of intuition if i offer at her hand or lip she shrinks from the touch like a sensitive plant and would contract her self into mere spirit she calls her chariot vehicle her furbelowd scarf pinnions her blue mant and petticoat is her azure dress and her footman goes by the name of oberon it is my misfortune to be six foot and a half high two full spans between the shoulders thirteen inches diameter in the calves and before i was in love i had a noble stomach and usually went to bed sober with two bottles i am not quite six and twenty and my nose is marked truly aquiline for these reasons i am in a very particular manner her aversion what shall i do impudence it self cannot reclaim her if i write miserable she reckons me among the children of perdition and discards me her region if i assume the gross and substantial she plays the real ghost with me and vaniandshes in a moment i had hopes in the hypocrisy of her sex but perseverance makes it as bad as fixed aversion i desire your opinion whether i may not lawfully play the inquisition upon her make use of a little force and put her to the rack and the torture only to convince her she has really fine limbs without spoiling or distorting them i expect your directions ere i proceed to dwindle and fall away with despair which at present i dont think advisable because if she should recant she may then hate me perhaps in the other extreme for my tenuity i am with impatience  your most humble servant charles sturdy   my patient has put his case with very much warmth and represented it in so lively a manner that i see both his torment and tormenter with great perspicuity this order of platonic ladies are to be dealt with in a peculiar manner from all the rest of the sex flattery is the general way and the way in this case but it is not to be done grossly every man that has wit and humor and raillery can make a good flatterer for woman in general but a platoune is not to be touched with panegyric she will tell you it is a sensuality in the soul to be delighted that way you are not therefore to commend but silently consent to all she does and says you are to consider in her the scorn of you is not humor but opinion  there were some years since a set of these ladies who were of quality and gave out that virginity was to be their state of life during this mortal condition and therefore resolved to join their fortunes and erect a nunnery the place of residence was pitched upon and a pretty situation full of natural falls and risings of waters with shady coverts and flowery arbours was approved by seven of the founders there were as many of our sex who took the liberty to visit those mansions of intended severity among others a famous rake of that time who had the grave way to an excellence he came in first but upon seeing a servant coming toward him with a design to tell him this was no place for him or his companions up goes my grave impudence to the maid young woman said he if any of the ladies are in the way on this side of the house pray carry us on the other side toward the gardens we are you must know gentlemen that are traveling england after which we shall go into foreign parts where some of us have already been here he bows in the most humble manner and kissed the girl who knew not how to behave to such a sort of carriage he goes on now you must know we have an ambition to have it to say that we have a protestant nunnery in england but pray mrs betty  sir she replied my name is susan at your service then i heartily beg your pardon  no offense in the least says she for i have a cousingerman whose name is betty indeed said he i protest to you that was more than i knew i spoke at random but since it happens that i was near in the right give me leave to present this gentleman to the favor of a civil salute his friend advances and so on till that they had all saluted her by this means the poor girl was in the middle of the crowd of these fellows at a loss what to do without courage to pass through em and the platonicks at several peepholes pale trembling and fretting rake perceived they were observed and therefore took care to keep suky in chat with questions concerning their way of life when appeared at last madonella a lady who had writ a fine book concerning the recluse life and was the projectrix of the foundation she approaches into the hall and rake knowing the dignity of his own mien and aspect goes deputy from his company she begins sir i am obliged to follow the servant who was sent out to know what affair could make strangers press upon a solitude which we who are to inhabit this place have devoted to heaven and our own thoughts madam replies rake with an air of great distance mixed with a certain indifference by which he could dissemble dissimulation your great intention has made more noise in the world than you design it should and we travelers who have seen many foreign institutions of this kind have a curiosity to see in its first rudiments this seat of primitive piety for such it must be called by future ages to the eternal honor of the founders i have read madonellas excellent and seraphick discourse on this subject the lady immediately answers if what i have said could have contributed to raise any thoughts in you that may make for the advancement of intellectual and divine conversation i should think my self extremely happy he immediately fell back with the profoundest veneration then advancing are you then that admired lady if i may approach lips which have uttered things so sacred  he salutes her his friends followed his example the devoted within stood in amazement where this would end to see madonella receive their address and their company but rake goes on  we would not transgress rules but if we may take the liberty to see the place you have thought fit to choose for ever we would go into such parts of the gardens as is consistent with the severitics you have imposed on your selves to be short madonella permitted rake to lead her into the assembly of nuns followed by his friends and each took his fair one by the hand after due explanation to walk round the gardens the conversation turned upon the lillies the flowers the arbors and the growing vegetables and rake had the solemn impudence when the whole company stood round him to say that he sincerely wished men might rise out of the earth like plants and that our minds were not of necessity to be sullied with carnivorous appetites for the generation as well as support of our species this was spoke with so easy and fixed an assurance that madonella answered sir under the notion of a pious thought you deceive your self in wishing an institution foreign to that of providence these desires were implanted in us for reverend purposes in preserving the race of men and giving opportunities for making our chastity more heroic the conference was continued in this celestial strain and carried on so well by the managers on both sides that it created a second and a second interview and without entering into further particulars there was hardly one of them but was a mother or father that day twelvemonth  any unnatural part is long taking up and as long laying aside therefore mr sturdy may assure himself platonica will fly for ever from a forward behavior but if he approaches her according to this model she will fall in with the necessities of mortal life and condescend to look with pity upon an unhappy man imprisoned in so much body and urged by such violent desires  from my own apartment june    the evils of this town increase upon me to so great a degree that i am half afraid i shall not leave the world much better than i found it several worthy gentlemen and critics have applied to me to give my censure of an enormity which has been revived after being long oppressed and is called punning i have several arguments ready to prove that he cannot be a man of honor who is guilty of this abuse of humane society but the way to expose it is like the expedient of curing drunkenness showing a man in that condition therefore i must give my reader warning to expect a collection of these offenses without which preparation i thought it too adventurous to introduce the very mention of it in good company and hope i shall be understood to do it as a divine mentions oaths and curses only for their condemnation i shall dedicate this discourse to a gentleman my very good friend who is the janus of our times and whom by his years and wit you would take to be of the last age but by his dress and morals of this  st jamess coffeehouse june    last night arrived two mails from holland which bring letters from the hague of the   th instant n s with advice that the enemy lay encamped behind a strong retrenchment with the marsh of remieres on their right and left extending it self as far as bethune la bassee is in their front lens in their rear and their camp is strengthened by another line from lens to douay the duke of marlborough caused an exact observation to be made of their ground and the works by which they were covered which appeared so strong that it was not thought proper to attack them in their present posture however the duke thought fit to make a feint as if he designed it his grace accordingly marching from the abbey at looze as did prince eugene from lampret and advanced with all possible diligence toward the enemy to favor the appearance of an intended assault the ways were made and orders distributed in such a manner that none in either camp could have thoughts of any thing but charging the enemy by break of day the next morning but soon after the fall of the night of the   th the whole army faced toward tournay which place they invested early in the morning of the   th the marshall villars was so confident that we designed to attack him that he had drawn great part of the garrison of the place which is now invested into the field for which reason it is presumed it must submit within a small time which the enemy cannot prevent but by coming out of their present camp and hazarding a general engagement these advices add that the garrison of mons had marched out under the command of marshall d arco which with the bavarians walloons and the troops of cologne have joined the grand army of the enemy  the tatler no    by mrs jenny distaff halfsister to mr bickerstaff from thursd june    to saturd june      0  from my own apartment june    my brother has made an excursion into the country and the work against saturday lies upon me i am very glad i have got pen and ink in my hand for i have for some time longed for his absence to give a right idea of things which i thought he put in a very odd light and some of them to the disadvantage of my own sex it is much to be lamented that it is necessary to make discourses and publish treatises to keep the horrid creatures the men within the rules of common decency turning over the papers of memorials or hints for the ensuing discourses i find a letter subscribed by mr truman  sir i am lately come to town and have read your works with much pleasure you make wit subservient to good principles and good manners yet because i design to buy the tatlers for my daughters to read i take the freedom to desire you for the future to say nothing about any combat between alexander and thalestris   this offense gives me occasion to express my self with the resentment i ought on people who take liberties of speech before that sex of whom the honored names of mother daughter and sister are a part i had like to have named wife in the number but the senseless world are so mistaken in their sentiments of pleasure that the most amiable term in humane life is become the derision of fools and scorners my brother and i have at least fifty times quarreled upon this topic i ever argue that the frailties of women are to be imputed to the false ornaments which men of wit put upon our folly and coquetry he lays all the vices of men upon womens secret approbation of libertine characters in them i did not care to give up a point but now he is out of the way i cannot but own i believe there is very much in what he asserted for if you will believe your eyes and own that the wickedest and the wittiest of them all marry one day or other is it possible to believe that if a man thought he should be for ever incapable of being received by a woman of merit and honor he would persist in an abandoned way and deny himself the possibility of enjoying the happiness of wellgoverned desires orderly satisfactions and honorable methods of life if our sex were wise a lover should have a certificate from the last woman he served how he was turned away before he was received into the service of another but at present any vagabond is welcome provided he promises to enter into our livery it is wonderful that we will not take a footman without credentials from his last master and in the greatest concern of life we make no scruple of falling into a treaty with the most notorious offender in his behavior against others but this breach of commerce between the sexes proceeds from an unaccountable prevalence of custom by which a woman is to the last degree reproachable for being deceived and a man suffers no loss of credit for being a deceiver  since this tyrant humor has gained place why are we represented in the writings of men in ill figures for artifice in our carriage when we have to do with a professed impostor when oaths imprecations vows and adorations are made use of as words of course what arts are not necessary to defend us from such as glory in the breach of em as for my part i am resolved to hear all and believe none of em and therefore solemnly declare no vow shall deceive me but that of marriage for i am turned of twenty and being of a small fortune some wit and if i can believe my lovers and my glass handsome i have heard all that can be said toward my undoing and shall therefore for warningsake give an account of the offers that have been made me my manner of rejecting em and my assistances to keep my resolution  in the sixteenth year of my life i fell into the acquaintance of a lady extremely well known in this town for the quick advancement of her husband and the honors and distinctions which her industry has procured him and all who belong to her this excellent body sat next to me for some months at church and took the liberty which she said her years and the zeal she had for my welfare gave her claim to to assure me that she observed some parts of my behavior which would lead me into errors and give encouragement to some to entertain hopes i did not think of what made you said she look through your fan at that lord when your eyes should have been turned upward or closed in attention upon better objects i blushed and pretended fifty odd excuses  but confounded my self the more she wanted nothing but to see that confusion and goes on nay child do not be troubled that i take notice of it my value for you made me speak it for though he is my kinsman i have a nearer regard to virtue than any other consideration she had hardly done speaking when this noble lord came up to us and lead her to her coach  my head ran all that day and night on the exemplary carriage of this woman who could be so virtuously impertinent as to admonish one she was hardly acquainted with however it struck upon the vanity of a girl that it may possibly be his thoughts might have been as favorable of me as mine were amorous of him and as unlikely things as that have happened if he should make me his wife she never mentioned this more to me but i still in all public places stole looks at this man who easily observed my passion for him it is so hard a thing to check the return of agreeable thoughts that he became my dream my vision my food my wish my torment  that minister of darkness the lady semphronia perceived too well the temper i was in and would one day after evening service needs take me to the park when we were there my lord passes by i flushed into a flame mrs distaff said she you may very well remember the concern i was in upon the first notice i took of your regard to that lord and forgive me who had a tender friendship for your mother now in her grave that i am vigilant of your conduct she went on with much severity and after great solicitation prevailed on me to go with her into the country and there spend the ensuing summer out of the way of a man she saw i loved and one whom she perceived meditated my ruin by frequently desiring her to introduce him to me which she absolutely refused except he would give his honor that he had no other design but to marry me to her country house a week or two after we went there was at the farther end of her garden a kind of wilderness in the middle of which ran a soft rivulet by an arbor of jessamin in this place i usually passed my retired hours and read some romantic or poetical tale till the close of the evening it was near that time in the heat of summer when gentle winds soft murmurs of water and notes of nightingals had given my mind an indolence which added to that repose of soul twilight and the end of a warm day naturally throws upon the spirits it was at such an hour and in such a state of tranquillity i sat when to my unexpressible amazement i saw my lord walking toward me whom i knew not till that moment to have been in the country i could observe in his approach the perplexity which attends a man big with design and i had while he was coming forward time to reflect that i was betrayed the sense of which gave me a resentment suitable to such a baseness but when he entered into the bower where i was my heart flew toward him and i confess a certain joy came into my mind with an hope that he might then make a declaration of honor and passion this threw my eye upon him with such tenderness as gave him power with a broken accent to begin madam  you will wonder  for it is certain you must have observed  though i fear you will misinterpret the motives  but by heaven and all that is sacred if you could  here he made a full stand and i recovered power to say the consternation i am in you will not i hope believe  an helpless innocent maid  besides that the place  he saw me in as great confusion as himself which attributing to the same causes he had the audaciousness to throw himself at my feet talk of the stilness of the evening and then ran into deifications of my person pure flames constant love eternal raptures and a thousand other phrases drawn from the images we have of heaven which ill men use for the service of hell were run over with uncommon vehemence after which he seized me in his arms his design was too evident in my utmost distress i fell upon my knees  my lord pity me on my knees  on my knees in the cause of virtue as you were lately in that of wickedness can you think of destroying the labor of a whole life the purpose of a long education for the base service of a sudden appetite to throw one that loves you that doats on you out of the company and road of all that is virtuous and praiseworthy have i taken in all the instructions of piety religion and reason for no other end but to be the sacrifice of lust and abandoned to scorn assume your self my lord and do not attempt to vitiate a temple sacred to innocence honor and religion if i have injured you stab this bosom and let me die but not be ruined by the hand i love the ardency of my passion made me incapable of uttering more and i saw my lover astonished and reformed by my behavior when rushed in semphronia ha faithful base man could you then steal out of town and lurk like a robber about my house for such brutish purposes  my lord was by this time recovered and fell into a violent laughter at the turn which semphronia designed to give her villainy he bowed to me with the utmost respect mrs distaff said he be careful hereafter of your company and so retired the friend semphronia congratulated my deliverance with a flood of tears  this nobleman has since very frequently made his addresses to me with honor but i have as often refused them as well knowing that familiarity and marriage will make him on some illnatured occasion call all i said in the arbor a theatrical action besides that i glory in contemning a man who had thoughts to my dishonor if this method were the imitation of the whole sex innocence would be the only dress of beauty and all affectation by any other arts to please the eyes of men would be banished to the stews for ever the conquest of passion gives ten times more happiness than we can reap from the gratification of it and she that has got over such a one as mine will stand among beaux and pretty fellows with as much safety as in a summers day among grasshoppers and butterflies  p s i have ten millions of things more against men if i ever get the pen again  st jamess coffeehouse june    our last advices from the hague dated the   th

on the arms of the allies this ensuing campaign letters from dresden are very particular in the account of the gallantry and magnificence in which that court has appeared since the arrival of the king of denmark no day has passed in which public shows have not been exhibited for his entertainment and diversion the last of that kind which is mentioned is a carousal wherein many of the youth of the first quality dressed in the most splendid manner ran for the prize his danish majesty condescended to the same but having observed that there was a design laid to throw it in his way passed by without attempting to gain it the court of dresden was preparing to accompany his danish majesty to potsdam where the expectation of an interview of three kings had drawn together such multitudes of

    0  whites chocolatehouse june    having taken upon me to cure all the distempers which proceed from affections of the mind i have labored since i first kept this public stage to do all the good i could and have perfected many cures at my own lodgings carefully avoiding the common method of mountebanks to do their most eminent operations in sight of the people but must be so just to my patients as to declare they have testified under their hands their sense of my poor abilities and the good i have done them which i publish for the benefit of the world and not out of any thoughts of private advantage  i have cured fine mrs spy of a great imperfection in her eyes which made her eternally rolling them from one coxcomb to another in public places in so languishing a manner that it at once lessened her own power and her beholders vanity twenty drops of my ink placed in certain letters on which she attentively looked for half an hour have restored her to the true use of her sight which is to guide and not mislead us ever since she took this liquor which i call bickerstaffs circumspectionwater she looks right forward and can bear being looked at for half a day without returning one glance this water has a peculiar virtue in it which makes it the only true cosmetick or beautywash in the world the nature of it is such that if you go to a glass with a design to admire your face it immediately changes it into downright deformity if you consult it only to look with a better countenance upon your friends it immediately gives an alacrity to the visage and new grace to the whole person there is indeed a great deal owing to the constitution of the person to whom it is applied it is in vain to give it when the patient is in the rage of the distemper a bride in her first month a lady soon after her husbands being knighted or any person of either sex who has lately obtained any new good fortune or preferment must be prepared some time before they use it it has an effect upon others as well as the patient when it is taken in due form lady petulant has by the use of it cured her husband of jealousy and lady gad her whole neighborhood of detraction  the fame of these things added to my being an old fellow makes me extremely acceptable to the fair sex you would hardly believe me when i tell you there is not a man in town so much their delight as my self they make no more of visiting me than going to madam depingles there were two of them namely damia and clidamira i assure you women of distinction who came to see me this morning in their way to prayers and being in a very diverting humor as innocence always makes people chea full they would needs have me according to the distinction of pretty and very pretty fellows inform them if i thought either of them had a title to the very pretty among those of their own sex and if i did which was the more deserving of the two  to put them to the trial look ye said i i must not rashly give my judgment in matters or this importance pray let me see you dance i play upon the kit they immediately fell back to the lower end of the room you may be sure they curtsyd low enough to me and began never were two in the world so equally matched and both sars to my namesake isaac never was man in so dange ous a condition as my se f when they began to expand their charms oh ladies ladies cried i not half that air you will fire the house both smiled for by the by there is no carrying a metaphor too far when a ladys charms are spoke of some body i think has called a fine woman dancing a brandished torch of beauty these rivals moved with such an agreeable freedom that you would believe their gesture was the necessary effect of the music and not the product of skill and practice now clidamira came on with a crowd of graces and demanded my judgment with so sweet an air  and she had no sooner carried it but damia made her utterly forgot by a gentle sinking and a rigadoon step the contest held a full half hour and i protest i saw no manner of difference in their perfections till they came up together and expected  sentence look ye ladies said i i see no preference in the least in your performance but you clidamira seem to be so well satisfied that i shall determine for you that i must give it to damia who stands with so much diffidence and fear after showing an equal merit to what she pretends to therefore clidamira you are a pretty but damia you are a very pretty lady for said i beauty loses its force if not accompanied with modesty she that has an humble opinion of her self will have every bodys applause because she does not expect it while the vain creature loses approbation through too great a sense of deserving it  from my own apartment june    being of a very spare and hective constitution i am forced to make frequent journies of a mile or two for fresh air and indeed by this last which was no further than the village of chelsea i am further convinced of the necessity of traveling to know the world for as it is usual with young voyagers as soon as they land upon a shore to begin their accounts of the nature of the people their soil their government their inclinations and their passions so really i fancied i could give you an immediate description of this village from the five fields where the robbers lie in wait to the coffeehouse where the literari sit in council a great ancestor of ours by the mothers side mr justice overdo whose history is written by ben johnson met with more enormities by walking incog than he was capable of correcting and found great mortifications in observing also persons of eminence whom he before knew nothing of thus it fared with me even in a place so near the town as this when i came into the coffeehouse i had not time to salute the company before my eye was diverted by ten thousand gimcracks round the room and on the sieling when my first astonishment was over comes to me a sage of a thin and meagre countenance which aspect made me doubt whether reading or fretting had made it so philosophic but i very soon perceived him to be of that sect which the ancients call gingivistae in our language toothdrawers i immediately had a respect for the man for these practical philosophers go upon a very rational hypothesis not to cure but take away the part affected my love of mankind made me very benevolent to mr salter for such is the name of this eminent barber and antiquary men are usually but unjustly distinguished rather by their fortunes than their talents otherwise this personage would make a great figure in that class of men which i distinguish under the title of odd fellows but it is the misfortune of persons of great genius to have their faculties dissipated by attention to too many things at once mr salter is an instance of this if he would wholly give himself up to the string instead of playing twenty beginnings to tunes he might before he dies play roger de caubly quite out i heard him go through his whole round and indeed i think he does play the merry christchurch bells pretty justly but he confessed to me he did that rather to show he was orthodox than that he valued himself upon the music it self or if he did proceed in his anatomy why might not he hope in time to cut off legs as well as draw teeth the particularity of this man put me into a deep thought whence it should proceed that of all the lower order barbers should go further in hitting the ridicul us than any other set of men watermen brawl cobblers sing but why must a barber be for ever a politician a musician an anatomist a poet and a physician the learned vossius says his barber used to comb his head in iambicks and indeed in all ages one of this useful profession this order of cosmetick philosophers has been celebrated by the most eminent hands you see the barber in don quixot is one of the principal characters in the history which gave me satisfaction in the doubt why don saltero writ his name with a spanish termination for he is descended in a right line not from john tradescan as he himself asserts but from that memorable companion of the knight of mancha and i hereby certify all the worthy citizens who travel to see his rarities that his doublebarrelled pistols targets coats of mail his sclopeta and sword of toledo were left to his ancestor by the said don quixot and by the said ancestor to all his progeny down to don saltero though i go thus far in favor of don salteros great merit i cannot allow a liberty he takes of imposing several names without my license on the collections he has made to the abuse of the good people of england one of which is particularly calculated to deceive religious persons to the great scandal of the welldisposed and may introduce heterodox opinions he shows you a strawhat which i know to be made by madge peskad within three miles of bedford and tells you it is pontius pilate s wifes chambermaids sisters hat to my knowledge of this very hat it may be added that the covering of straw was never used among the jews since it was demanded of them to make bricks without it therefore this is really nothing but under the specious pretense of learning and antiquity to impose upon the world there are other things which i cannot tolerate among his rarities as the china figure of a lady in the glasscase the italian engine for the imprisonment of those who go abroad with it both which i hereby order to be taken down or else he may expect to have his letters patents for making punch superseded be debarred wearing his muff next winter or ever coming to london without his wife it may perhaps be thought i have dwelt too long upon the affairs of this operator but i desire the reader to remember that it is my way to consider men as they stand in merit and not according to their fortune or figure and if he is in a coffeehouse at the reading hereof let him look round and he will find there may be more characters drawn in this account than that of don saltero for half the politicians about him he may observe are by their place in nature of the class of toothdrawers  the tatler no    from tuesd june    to thursd june  0   0  grecian coffeehouse june    there is an habit or custom which i have put my patience to the utmost stretch to have suffered so long because several of my intimate friends are in the guilt and that is the humor of taking snuff and looking dirty about the mouth by way of ornament  my method is to dive to the bottom of a sore before i pretend to apply a remedy for this reason i sat by an eminent storyteller and politician who takes half an ounce in five seconds and has mortgaged a pretty tenement near the town merely to improve and dung his brains with this prolifick powder i observed this gentleman the other day in the midst of a story diverted from it by looking at something at a distance and i softly hid his box but he returns to his tale and looking for his box he cries and so sir  then when he should have taken a pinch as i was saying says he  has no body seen my box his friend beseeches him to finish his narration then he proceeds and  sir  where can my box be then turning to me pray sir did you see my box yes sir said i i took it to see how long you could live without it he resumes his tale and i took notice that his dullness was much more regular and fluent than before a pinch supplied the place of as i was saying and so sir and he went on currently enough in that style which the learned call the insipid this observation easily led me into a philosophic reason for taking snuff which is done only to supply with sensations the want of reflection this i take to be an  a nostrum upon which i hope to receive the thanks of this board for as it is natural to lift a mans hand to a sore when you fear any thing coming at you so when a person feels his thoughts are run out and has no more to say it is as natural to supply his weak brain with powder at the nearest place of access viz the nostrils this is so evident that nature suggests the use according to the indigence of the persons who use this medicine without being prepossessed with the force of fashion or custom for example the native hibernians who are reckoned not much unlike the ancie t baeotians take this specific for emptiness in the head in greater abundance than any other nation under the sun the learned sotus as sparing as he is in his words would be still more silent if it were not for this powder  however low and poor the taking snuff argues a man to be in his own stock of thought or means to employ his brains and his fingers yet there is a poorer creature in the world than he and this is a borrower of snuff a fellow that keeps no box of his own but is always asking others for a pinch such poor rogues put me always in mind of a common phrase among schoolboys when they are composing their exercise who run to an upper scholar and cry pray give me a little sense but of all things commend me to the ladies who are got into this pretty help to discourse i have been this three years persuading sagissa to leave it off but she talks so much and is so learned that she is above contradiction however an accident the other day brought that about which my eloquence never could accomplish she had a very pretty fellow in her closet who ran thither to avoid some company that came to visit her she made an excuse to go in to him for some implement they were talking of her eager gallant snatched a kiss but being unused to snuff some grains from off her upper lip made him sneeze aloud which alarmed the visitants and has made a discovery that profound reading very much intelligence and a general knowledge of who and who is together cannot fill up her vacant hours so much but that she is sometimes obliged to descend to entertainments less intellectual  whites chocolatehouse june    i know no manner of news for this place but that cynthio having been long in despair for the inexorable clarissa lately resolved to fall in love the good old way of bargain and sale and has pitched upon a very agreeable young woman he will undoubtedly succeed for he accosts her in a strain of familiarity without breaking through the deference that is due to woman whom a man would choose for his life i have hardly ever heard rough truth spoken with a better grace than in this his letter  madam i writ to you on saturday by mrs lucy and give you this trouble to urge the same request i made then which was that i may be admitted to wait upon you i should be very far from desiring this if it were a transgression of the most severe rules to allow it i know you are very much above the little arts which are frequent in your sex of giving unnecessary torments to their admirs therefore hope you will do so much justice to the generous passion i have for you as to let me have an opportunity of acquainting you upon what motives i pretend to your good opinion i shall not trouble you with my sentiments till i know how they will be received and as i know no reason why difference of sex should make our language to each other differ from the ordinary rules of right reason i shall affect plainness and sincerity in my discourse to you as much as other lovers do perplexity and rapture instead of saying i shall die for you i profess i should be glad to lead my life with you you are as beautiful as witty as prudent and as good humored as any woman breathing but i must confess to you i regard all these excellencies as you will please to direct them for my happiness or misery with me madam the only lasting motive to love is the hope of its becoming mutual i beg of you to let mrs lucy send me word when i may attend you i promise you i will talk of nothing but indifferent things

coffeehouse june    having taken a resolution when plays are acted next winter by an entire good company to publish observations from time to time on the performance of the actors i think it but just to give an abstract of the laws of action for the help of the less learned part of the audience that they may rationally enjoy so refined and instructive a pleasure as a just representation of humane life the great errors in playing are admirably well exposed in hamlets direction to the actors who are to play in his supposed tragedy by which we shall form our future judgments on their behavior and for that reason you have the discourse as follows  speak the speech as i pronounce it to you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of our players do i had as lieu the towncryer had spoke my lines nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say the whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget a temperance

capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise i could have such a fellow whipped for oerdoing termagant it out herods herod be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special observance that you oerstop not the modesty of nature for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time its form and pressure now this overdone or come tardy off though it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censures of which one must in your allowance oversway a whole theater of others oh there be players that i have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having the accent of christian pagan or norman have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of natures journey men had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably this should be reformed altogether and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will of themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be then to be considered

change the dates of places as occurrences come into my way the following letter i lately received from epsom  epsom june    it is now almost three weeks since what you writ about happened in this place the quarrel between my friends did not run so high as i find your accounts have made it the truth of the fact you shall have very faithfully you are to understand that the persons concerned in this scene were lady autumn and lady springly autumn is a person of good breeding formality and a singular way practiced in the last age and lady springly a modern impertinent of our sex who affects as improper a familiarity as the other does distance lady autumn knows to an hairs breadth where her place is in all assemblies and conversations but springly neither gives nor takes place of any body but understands the place to signify no more than to have room enough to be at ease wherever she comes thus while autumn takes the whole of this life to consist in understanding punctilio and decorum springly takes every thing to be becoming which contributes to her ease and satisfaction these heroines have married two brothers both knights springly is the spouse of the elder who is a baronet and autumn being a rich widow has taken the younger and her purse endowed him with an equal fortune and knighthood of the same order this jumble of titles you need not doubt has been an aching torment to autumn who took place of the other on no pretense but her carelessness and disregard of distinction the secret occasion of envy broiled long in the breast of autumn but no opportunity of contention on that subject happening kept all things quiet till the accident of which you demand an account  it was given out among all the gay people of this place that on the  th instant several damsels swift of foot were to run for a suit of headclothes at the old wells lady autumn on this occasion invited springly to go with her in her coach to see the race when they came to the place where the governor of epsom and all his court of citizens were assembled as well as a crowd of people of all orders a brisk young fellow addresses himself to the younger of the ladies viz springly and offers her his service to conduct her into the musickroom springly accepts the compliment and is led triumphantly through a bowing crowd while autumn is left among the rabble and has much ado to get back into her coach but she did it at last and as it is usual to see by the horses my ladys present disposition she orders john to whip furiously home to her husband where when she enters down she sits began to unpin her hood and lament her foolish fond heart to marry into a family where she was so little regarded she that might  here she stops then rises up and stamps and sits down again her gentle knight made his approaches with a supple beseeching gesture my dear said he  tell me no dears replied autumn  in the presence of the governor and all the merchants  what will the world say of a woman that has thrown her self away at this rate sir thomas withdrew and knew it would not be long a secret to him as well as that experience told him he that marries a fortune is of course guilty of all faults against his wife let them be committed by whom they will but springly an hour or two after returns from the wells and finds the whole company together down she sat and a profound silence ensued you know a premeditated quarrel usually begins and works up with the words some people the silence was broken by lady autumn who began to say there are some people who fancy that if some people  springly immediately takes her up there are some people who fancy if other people  autumn repartees people may give themselves airs but other people perhaps who make less ado may be perhaps as agreeable as people who set themselves out more all the other people at the table sat mute while these two people who were quarrelling went on with the use of the word people instancing the very accidents between them as if they kept only in distant hints therefore says autumn redning there are some people will go abroad in other peoples coaches and leave those with whom they went to shift for themselves and if perhaps those people have married the younger brother yet perhaps he may be beholden to those people for what he is springly smartly answers people may bring so much ill humor into a family as people may repent their receiving their money and goes on  every body is not considerable enough to give her uneasiness upon this autumn comes up to her and desired her to kiss her and never to see her again which her sister refusing my lady gave her a box on the ear  springly returns ay ay said she i knew well enough you meant me by your some people and gives her another on the other side to it they went with most masculine fury each husband ran in the wives immediately fell upon their husbands and tore periwigs and cravats the company interposed when according to the slipknot of matrimony which makes them return to one another when any put in between the ladies and their husbands fell upon all the rest of the company and having beat all their friends and relations out of the house came to themselves time enough to know there was no bearing the jest of the place after these adventures and therefore marched off the next day it is said the governor has sent several joints of mutton and has proposed diverse dishes very exquisitely dressed to bring them down again from his address and knowledge in roast and boiled all our hopes of the return of this good company depend i am  dear

ordinary spirit would sink under his oppressions but he makes an advantage of his very sorrow and raises an income from his diseases long has this worthy been conversant in bartering and knows that when stocks are lowest it is the time to buy therefore with much prudence and tranquillity he thinks that now he has not a bone sound but a thousand nodous parts for which the anatomist have not words and more diseases than the college ever heard of it is the only times to purchase an annuity for life sir thomas told me it was an entertainment more surprising and pleasant than can be imagined to see an inhabitant of neither world without hand to lift or leg to move scarce tongue to utter his meaning so keen upon biting the whole world and making bubbles at his exit sir thomas added that he would have bought twelve shillings a year of him but that he feared there was some trick in it and believed him already dead what says that knight is mr partridge whom i met just now going on both his legs firmer than i can allowed to be quire dead and shall africanus without one limb that can do its office be pronounced alive  what heightened the tragicomedy of this market for annuities was that the observation of it provoked monocalus who is the most eloquent of all men to many excellent reflections which he spoke with the vehemence and language both of a gamester and an orator when i cast

pleased to form in the same species here am i able to eat to drink to sleep and do all acts of nature except begetting my like and yet by an unintelligible force of spleen and fancy i every moment imagine i am dying it is utter madness in thee to provide for supper for i will bet you ten to one you dont live till half an hour after four and yet i am so distracted as to be in fear every moment though i will lay ten to three i drink three pints of burnt claret at your funeral three nights hence after all i envy thee thou that have no sense of death art happier than one that always fears it the knight had gone on but that a third man ended the seen by applauding the knights eloquence and philosophy in a laughter too violent for his own constitution as much as he mocked that of africanus

from luchin on the causeway between tournay and lisle to epain near mortagne on the scheld the marshal villars remains in his camp at lens but it is said he detached ten thousand men under the command of the chevalier de luxemburg with orders to form a camp at crepin on the haine between conde and st guillain where he is to be joined by the elector of bavaria with a body of troops and after their conjunction to attempt to march into brabant but they write from brussels that the duke of marlborough having it equally in his power to make detachments to the same parts they are under no apprehensions from these reports for the safety of their country they further add from brussels that they have good authority for believing that the french troops under the conduct of marshal de bezons are retiring out of spain  the tatler no    by mrs jenny distaff halfsister to mr bickerstaff from saturd july   to tuesd july     0  whites chocolatehouse july   it may be thought very unaccountable that i who can never be supposed to go to whites should pretend to talk to you of matters proper for or in the style of that place but though i never visit these public haunts i converse with those that do and for all they pretend so much to the contrary they are as talkative as our sex and as much at a loss to entertain the present company without sacrificing the last as we our selves this reflection has led me into the consideration of the use of speech and made me look over in my memory all my acquaintance of both sexes to know to which i may more justly impute the sin of superfluous discourse in regard to conversation without entering into it as it respects religion  i foresee my acquaintance will immediately upon starting this subject ask me how i shall celebrate mrs alse copswood the yorkshire huntress who is come to town lately and moves as if she were on her nag and going to take a fivebar gate and is as loud as if she were following her dogs i can easily answer that for she is as soft as damon in comparison of her brotherinlaw tom bellfrey who is the most accomplished man in this kingdom for all gentlemanlike activities and accomplishments it is allowed that he is a professed enemy to the italian performers in music but then for our own native manner according to the customs and known usages of our island he is to be preferred for the generality of the pleasure he bestows much before those fellows though they sing to full theaters for what is a theatrical voice to that of a foxhunter i have been at a musical entertainment in an open field where it amazed me to hear to what pitches the chief masters would reach there was a meeting near our seat in staffordshire and the most emine t of all the counties of england were at it how wonderful was the harmony between men and dogs robin cartail of bucks was to answer to jowler mr tinbreast of cornwall was appointed to open with sweetlips and beaux slimber a londoner undertook to keep up with trips a whelp just set in tom bellfrey and ringwood were coupled together to fill the cry on all occasions and be in at the death of the fox hare or stag for which both the dog and the man were excellently suited and loved one another and were as much together as banister and king when jowler first alarmed the field cartail repeated every note sweetlipss treble succeeded and shook the wood tinbreast echoed a quarter of a mile beyond it we were soon after all at a loss till we rid up and found trips and slimber at a default in half notes but the day and the tune was recovered by tom bellfrey and ringwood to the great joy of us all though they drowned every other voice for bellfrey carries a note four furlongs three rood and six paces further than any other in england  i fear the mention of this will be thought a digression from my purpose about speech but i answer no since this is used where speech rather should be employed it may come in o consideration in the same chapter for mr bellfrey being at a visit where i was viz his cousins lady daintys in soho was asked what entertainments they had in the country now bellfrey is very ignorant and much a clown but confident withal in a word he struck up a foxchase lady daintys dog mr sippet as she calls him started and jumped out of his ladys lap and fell a barking bellfrey went on and called all the neighboring parishes into the square never was woman in such confusion as that delicate lady but there was no stopping her kinsman a room full of ladies fell into the most violent laughter my lady looked as if she was shrieking mr sippet in the middle of the room breaking his heart with barking but all of us unheard as soon as bellfrey became silent up gets my lady and takes him by the arm to lead him off bellfrey was in his boots as she was hurrying him away his spurs takes hold of her petticoat his whip throws down a cabinet of china he cries what are your crocks rotten are your petticoats ragged a man cannot walk in your house for trincums  every county of great britain has one hundred or more of this sort of fellows who roar instead of speaking therefore if it be true that we women are also given to greater fluency of words than is necessary sure she that disturbs but a room or a family is more to be tolerated than one who draws together parishes and counties and sometimes with an estate that might make him the blessing and ornament of the world around him has no other view and ambition but to be an animal above dogs and horses without the relish of any one enjoyment which is peculiar to the faculties of humane nature i know it will here be said that talking of mere country squires at this rate is as it were to write against valentine and orson to prove any thing against the race of men you must take em as they are adorned with education as they live in courts or have received instructions in colleges  but i am so full of my late entertainment by mr bellfrey that i must defer pursuing this subject to another day and wave the proper observations upon the different offenders in this kind some by profound eloquence on small occasions others by degrading speech upon great circumstances expect therefore to hear of the whisperer without business the laugher without wit the complainer without receiving injuries and a very large crowd which i

which are on foot concerning what was imported by the last advices there are it seems sixty battalions and seventeen squadrons appointed to serve in the siege of tournay the garrison of which place consists but of eleven battalions and four squadrons letters of the   th of the last month from berlin have brought advice that the kings of denmark prussia and his majesty augustus were within few days to come to an interview at potsdam these letters mention that two polish princes of the family of sapicha and lubermirsky lately arrived from paris confirm the reports of the misery in france for want of provisions and give a particular instance of it which is that on the day monsieur rouille returned to court the common people gathered in crowds about the dauphins coach crying peace and bread

tuesd july   to thursd july     0  from my own apartment july   i find among my brothers papers the following letter verbatim which i wonder how he could suppress so long as he has since it was sent him for no other end but to show the good effect his writings have already had upon the ill customs of the age  london june    sir the end of all public papers ought to be the benefit and instruction as well as the diversion of the readers to which i see none so truly conducive as your late performances especially those tending to the rooting out from amongst us that unchristianlike and bloody custom of duelling which that you have already in some measure performed will appear to the public in the following no less true than heroic story  a noble gentleman of this city who has the honor of serving his country as major in the trainbands being at that general mart of stockjobbers called jonathans endeavoring to raise himself as all men of honor ought to the degree of colonel at least it happened that he bought the bear of another officer who though not commissioned in the army yet no less eminently serves the public than the other in raising the credit of the kingdom by raising that of the stocks however having sold the bear and words arising about the delivery the most noble major no less scorning to be outwitted in the coffeehouse than to run into the field according to method abused the other with the titles of rogue villain bearskinman and the like whereupon satisfaction was demanded and accepted so forth the major marched commanding his adversary to follow to a most spacious room in the sheriffs house near the place of quarrel they come where having due regard to what you have lately published they resolved not to shed one anothers blood in that barbarous manner you prohibited yet not willing to put up affronts without satisfaction they stripped and in decent manner fought full fairly with their wrathful hands the combat lasted a quarter of an hour in which time victory was often doubtful and many a dry blow was strenuously laid on by each side till the major finding his adversary obstinate unwilling to give him further chastisement with most shrill voice cried out i am satisfied enough whereupon the combat ceased and both were friends immediately  thus the world may see how necessary it is to encourage those men who make it their business to instruct the people in every thing necessary for their preservation i am informed a body of worthy citizens have agreed on an address of thanks to you for what you have writ on the foregoing subject whereby they acknowledge one of their highly esteemed officers preserved from death  your humble servant a b   i fear the word bear is hardly to be understood among the polite people but i take the meaning to be that one who ensures a real value upon an imaginary thing is said to sell a bear and is the same thing as a promise among courtiers or a vow between lovers i have writ to my brother to hasten to town and hope that printing the letters directed to him which i knew not how to answer will bring him speedily and therefore i add also the following  july     0  mr bickerstaff you having hinted a generous intention of taking under your consideration the whisperers without business and laughers without occasion as you tender the welfare of your country i entreat you not to forget or delay so publickspirited a work now or never is the time many other calamities may cease with the war but i dismally dread the multiplication of these mortals under the ease and luxuriousness of a settled peace half the blessing of which may be destroyed by em their mistake lies certainly here in a wretched belief that their mimickry passes for real business or true wit dear sir convince em that it never was is or ever will be either of them nor ever did does or to all futurity ever can look like either of them but that it is the most cursed disturbance in nature which is possible to be inflicted on mankind under the noble definition of a sociable creature in doing this sir you will oblige more humble servants than can find room to subscribe their names   whites chocolatehouse july   in pursuance of my last date from hence i am to proceed on the accounts i promised of several personages among the men whose conspicuous fortunes or ambition in showing their follies have exalted them above their fellows the levity of their minds is visible in their every word and gesture and there s not a day passes but puts me in mind of mr wycherleys character of a coxcomb he is ugly all over with the affectation of the fine gentleman now though the women may put on softness in their looks or affected severity or impertinent gaiety or pert smartness their selflove and admiration cannot under any of these disguises appear so invincible as that of the men you may easily take notice that in all their actions there is a secret approbation either in the tone of their voice the turn of their body or cast of their eye which shows that they are extremely in their own favor  take one of your men of business he shall keep you half an hour with your hat off entertaining you with his consideration of that affair you spoke of to him last till he has drawn a crowd that observes you in this grimace then when he is public enough he immediately runs into secrets and falls a whispering you and he make breaks with adverbs as but however thus far and then you whisper again and so on till they who are about you are dispersed and your busy mans vanity is no longer gratified by the notice taken of what importance he is and how inconsiderable you are for your pretender to business is never in secret but in public  there is my dear lord nowhere of all men the most gracious and most obliging the terror of all valets de chamber whom he oppresses with good breeding in enquiring for my good lord and for my good ladys health this imitable courtier will whisper a privycounsellors lacquey with the utmost goodness and condescension to know when they next sit and is thoroughly taken up and thinks he has a part in a secret if he knows that there is a secret what it is he will whisper you that time will discover then he shrugs and calls you back again  sir i need not say to you that these things are not to be spoken of  and harkee no names i would not be quoted what adds to the jest is that his emptiness has its moods and seasons and he will not condescend to let you into these his discoveries except he is in very good humor or has seen some body in fashion talk to you he will keep his nothing to himself and pass by and overlook as well as the best of em not observing that he is insolent when he is gracious and obliging when he is haughty show me a woman so inconsiderable as this frequent character  but my mind now i am in turns to many no less observable thou dear will shoestring i profess my self in love with thee how shall i speak thee how shall i address thee how shall i draw thee thou dear outside will you be combing your wig playing with your box or picking your teeth or chusest thou rather to be speaking to be speaking for thy only purpose in speaking to show your teeth rub em no longer dear shoestring do not premeditate murder do not for ever whiten oh that for my quiet and his own they were rotten  but i will forget him and give my hand to the courteous umbra he is a fine man indeed but the soft creature bows below my apronstring before he takes it yet after the first ceremonies he is as familiar as my physician and his insignificancy makes me half ready to complain to him of all i would to my doctor he is so courteous that he carries half the messages of ladies ails in town to their midwives and nurses he understands too the art of medicine as far as to the cure of a pimple or a rash on occasions of the like importance he is the most assiduous of all men living in consulting and searching precedents from family to family then he speaks of his obsequiousness and diligence in the style of real services if you sneer at him and thank him for his great friendship he bows and says madam all the good offices in my power while i have any knowledge or credit shall be at your service the consideration of so shallow a being and the intent application with which he pursues trifles has made me carefully reflect upon that sort of men we usually call an impertinent and i am upon mature deliberation so far from being offended with him that i am really obliged to him for though he will take you aside and talk half an hour upon matters wholly insignificant with the most solemn air yet i consider that these things are of weight in his imagination and he thinks he is communicating what is for my service if therefore it be a just rule to judge of a man by his intention according to the equity of goodbreeding he that is impertinently kind or wise to do you service ought in return to have a proportionable place both in your aff ction and esteem so that the courteous umbra deserves the favor of all his acquaintance for though he never served em he is ever willing to do it and believes he does it  as impotent kindness is to be returned with all our abilities to oblige so impotent malice is to be treated with all our force to depress it for this reason flyblow who is received in all the families in town through the degeneracy and iniquity of their manners is to be treated like a knave though he is one of the weakest of fools he has by rote and at second hand all that can be said of any man of figure wit and virtue in town name a man of worth and this creature tells you the worst passage of his life speak of a beautiful woman and this puppy will whisper the next man to him though he has nothing to say of her he is a fly that feeds on the sore part and would have nothing to live on if the whole body were in health you may know him by the frequency of pronouncing the particle but for which reason i never hear him spoke of with common charity without using my but against him for a friend of mine saving the other day mrs distaff has wit good humor virtue and friendship this oaf added but she is not handsome coxcomb the gentleman was saying what i was not what i was not  st jamess coffeehouse july   the approaches before tournay have been carried on with great success and our advices from the camp before that place of the   th instant say that they had already made a lodgment on the glacis two hundred boats were come up the scheld with the heavy artillery and ammunition which would be employed in dismounting the enemys defenses and raised on the batteries the   th a great body of miners are summoned to the camp to countermine the works of the enemy we are convinced of the weakness of the garrison by a certain account that they called a council of war to consult whether it was not advisable to march into the citadel and leave the town defenseless we are assured that when the confederate army was advancing toward the camp of marshal villars that general dispatched a courier to his master with a letter giving an account of their approach which concluded with the following words the day begins to break and your majestys army is already in order of battle before noon i hope to have the honor of congratulating your majesty on the success of a great action and you shall be very well satisfied with the marshal villars  it is to be noted that when any part of this paper appears dull there is a design in it  the tatler no    by isaac bickerstaff esquire from thursd july   to saturd july     0  grecian coffeehouse july   as i am called forth by the immense love i bear to my fellow creatures and the warm inclination i feel within me to stem as far i can the prevailing torrent of vice and ignorance so i cannot more properly pursue that noble impulse than by setting forth the excellence of virtue and knowledge in their native and beautiful colors for this reason i made my late excursion to oxford where those qualities appear in their highest luster and are the only pretenses to honor and distinction superiority is there given in proportion to mens advancement in wisdom and learning and that just rule of life is so universally received among those happy people that you shall see an earl walk bearheaded to the son of the meanest artificer in respect to seven years more worth and knowledge than the nobleman is possessed of in other places they bow to mens fortunes but here to their understandings it is not to be expressed how pleasing the order the discipline the regularity of their lives is to a philosopher who has by many years experience in the world learned to contemn every thing but what is revered in this mansion of select and welltaught spirits the magnificence of their palaces the greatness of their revenues the sweetness of their groves and retirements seem equally adapted for the residence of princes and philosophers and a familiarity with objects of splendor as well as places of recess prepares the inhabitants with an equanimity for their future fortunes whether humble or illustrious how was i pleased when i looked round at st marys and could in the faces of the ingenious youth see ministers of state chansellors bishops and judges here only is humane life here only the life of man is a rational being here men understand and are employed in works worthy their noble nature this transitory being passes away in an employment not unworthy a future state the contemplation of the great decrees of providence each man lives as if he were to answer the questions made to job where wast thou when i laid the foundations of the earth who shut up the sea with doors and said hitherto shall thou come and no further such speculations make life agreeable make death welcome  but alas i was torn from this noble society by the business of this dirty mean world and the cares of fortune for i was obliged to be in london against the  th day of the term and accordingly governed my self by my oxford almanac and came last night but find to my great astonishment that this ignorant town began the term on the   th of the last month in opposition to all the learning and astronomy of the famous university of which i have been speaking according to which the term certainly was to commence on the  st instant you may be sure a man who has turned his studies as i have could not be mistaken in point of time for knowing i was come to town in term i examined the passing moments very narrowly and called an eminent astronomer to my assistance upon very strict observation we sound that the cold has been so severe this last winter which is allowed to have a benumming quality that it retarded the earth in moving round from christmas to this season full seven days and two seconds my learned friend assured me further that the earth had lately received a shog from a comet that crossed its vortex which if it had come ten degrees nearer us had made us lose this whole term i was indeed once of opinion that the gregorian computation was the most regular as being eleven days before the julian but am now fully convinced that we ought to be seven days after the chancellor and judges and eighteen before the pope of rome and that the oxonion computation is the best of the three  these are the reasons which i have gathered from philosophy and nature to which i can add other circumstances in vindication of the account of this learned body who published this almanac  it is notorious to philosophers that joy and grief can hasten and delay time mr lock is of opinion that a man in great misery may so far lose his measures as to think a minute an hour or in joy make an hour a minute let us examine the present case by this rule and we shall find that the cause of this general mistake in the british nation has been the great success of the last campaigne and the following hopes of peace stocks ran so high at the change that the citizens had gained three days of the courtiers and we have indeed been so happy this reign that it the university did not rectify our mistakes we should think our selves but in the second year of her pretent majesty it would be endless to enumerate the many damages that have happened by this ignorance of the vulgar all the recognizances within the diocese of oxford have been forfeited for not appearing on the first day of this fictitious term the university has been nonsuited in their action against the booksellers for printing clarendon in quarto indeed what gives me the most quick concern is the case of a poor gentleman my friend who was the other day taken in execution by a set of ignorant bailiffs he should it seems have pleaded in the first week of term but being a master of arts of oxford he would not recede from the oxonian computation he showed mr broad the almanac and the very day when the term began but the merciless ignorant fellow against all sense and learning would hurry him away he went indeed quietly enough but he has taken exact notes of the time of arrest and sufficient witnesses of his being carried into gaol and has by advice of the recorder of oxford brought his action and we doubt not but we shall pay em off with damages and blemish the reputation of mr broad we have one convincing proof which all that frequent the courts of justices are witnesses of the dog that comes constantly to westminster on the first day of the term did not appear till the first day according to the oxford almanac whose instinct i take to be a better guide than mens erroneous opinions which are usually biased by interest i judge in this case as king charles ii victuald his navy with the bread which one of his dogs chose of several pieces thrown before him rather than trust to the asseverations of the victuallers mr cowper and other learned council have already urged the authority of this almanac in behalf of their clients we shall therefore go on with all speed in our cause and doubt not but chancery will give at the end what we lost in the beginning by protracting the term for us till wednesday come sennight and the university orator shall for ever pray etc  from my own apartment july   the subject of duels has i find been started with so good success that it has been the frequent subject of conversation among polite men and a dialogue of that kind has been transmitted to me verbatim as follows the persons concerned in it are men of honor and experience in the manners of men and have fallen upon the truest foundation as well as searched the bottom of this evil  mr sage if it were in my power every man that drew his sword unless in the service or purely to defend his life person or goods from violence i mean abstracted from all punctos or whims of honor should ride the wooden horse in the tiltyard for such first offense for the second stand in the pillory and for the third be prisoner in bedlam for life   colonel plume i remember that a rencounter or duel was so far from being in fashion among the officers that served in the parliament army that on the contrary it was as disreputable and as great an impediment to advancement in the service as being bashful in time of action   sir mark yet i have been informed by some old cavaliers of famous reputation for brave and gallant men that they were much more in mode among their party than they have been during this last war   col plume that is true too sir   mr sage by what you say gentlemen one should think that our present military officers are compounded of an equal proportion of both those tempers since duels are neither quite discountenanced nor much in vogue   sir mark that difference of temper in regard to duels which appears to have been between the court and parliament men of the sword was not i conceive for want of courage in the latter nor of a liberal education because there were some of the best families in england engaged in that party but gallantry and mode which glitter agreeably to the imagination were encouraged by the court as promoting its splendor and it was as natural that the contrary party who were to recommend themselves to the public for men of serious and solid parts should deviate from every thing chimerical   mr sage i have never read of a duel among the romans and yet their nobility used more liberty with their tongues than one may do now without being challenged   sir mark perhaps the romans were of opinion that ill language and brutal manners reflected only on those who were guilty of them and that a mans reputation was not at all cleared by cutting the persons throat who had reflected upon it but the custom of those times had fixed the scandal in the action whereas now it lies in the reproach   mr sage and yet the only sort of duel that one can conceive to have been fought upon motives truly honorable and allowable was that between the horatii and curiatii   sir mark colonel plume pray what was the method of single combat in your time among the cavaliers i suppose that as the use of clothes continues though the fashion of them has been mutable so duels though still in use have had in all times their particular modes of performance   col plume we had no constant rule but generally conducted our dispute and tilt according to the last that had happened between persons of reputation among the very top fellows for bravery and gallantry   sir mark if the fashion of quarrelling and tilting was so often changed in your time colonel plume a man might fight yet lose his credit for want of understanding the fashion   col plume why sir mark in the beginning of july a man would have been censured for want of courage or been thought indigent of the true notions of honor if he had put up words which in the end of september following one could not resent without passing for a brutal and quarrelsome fellow   sir mark but colonel were duels or rencounters most in fashion in those days   col plume your men of nice honor sir were for avoiding all censure of advantage which they supposed might be taken in a rencounter therefore they used seconds who were to see that all was upon the square and make a faithful report of the whole combat but in a little time it became a fashion for the seconds to fight and i will tell you how it happened   mr sage pray do colonel plume and the method of a duel at that time and give us some notion of the punctos upon which your nice men quarrelled in those days   col plume i was going to tell you mr sage that one cornet modish had desned his friend captain smarts opinion in some affair but did not follow it upon which captain smart sent major adroit a very topping fellow of those times to the person that had slighted his advice the major never enquired into the quarrel because it was not the manner then among the very topping fellows but got two swords of an equal length and then waited upon cornet modish desiring him to choose his sword and meet his friend captain smart cornet modish came with his friend to the place of combat there the principals put on their pumps and striped to their shirts to show they had nothing but what men of honor carry about em and then engaged   sir mark and did the seconds stand by sir   col plume it was a received custom till that time but the swords of those days being pretty long and the principals acting on both sides upon the defensive and the morning being frosty major adroit desired that the other second who was also a very topping fellow would try a thrust or two only to keep them warm till the principals had decided the matter which was agreed to by modishs second who presently whipped adroit through the body disarmed him and then parted the principals who had received no harm at all   mr sage but was not adroit laughed at   col plume on the contrary the very topping fellows were ever after of opinion that no man who deserved that character could serve as a second without fighting and the smarts and modishes finding their account in it the humor took without opposition   mr sage pray colonel how long did that fashion continue   col plume not long neither mr sage for as soon as it became a fashion the very topping fellows thought their honor reflected upon if they did not proffer themselves as seconds when any of their friends had a quarrel so that sometimes there were a dozen of a side   sir mark bless me if that custom had continued we should have been at a loss now for our very pretty fellows for they seem to be the proper men to officer animate and keep up an army but pray sir how did that sociable manner of tilting grow out of mode   col plume why sir i will tell you it was a law among the combatants that the party which happened to have the first man disarmed or killed should yield as vanquished which some people thought might encourage the modishes and smarts in quarrelling to the destruction of only the very topping fellows and as soon as this reflection was started the very topping fellows thought it an encumbrance upon their honor to fight at all themselves since that time the modishes and the smarts throughout all europe have extolled the french kings edict   sir mark our very pretty fellows whom i take to be the successors of the very topping fellows think a quarrel so little fashionable that they will not be exposed to it by another mans vanity or want of sense   mr sage but colonel i have observed in your account of duels that there was a great exactness in avoiding all advantage that might possibly be between the combatants   col plume that is true sir for the weapons were always equal   mr sage yes sir but suppose an active adroit strong man had insulted an awkward or a feeble or an unpracticed swordsman   col plume then sir they fought with pistols   mr sage but sir there might be a certain advantage that way for a good marksman will be sure to hit his man at  0 yards distance and a man whose hand shakes which is common to men that debauch in pleasures or have not used pistols out of their holsters will not venture to fire unless he touches the person he shoots at now sir i am of opinion that one can get no honor in killing a man if one has it all rug as the gamesters say when they have a trick to make the game secure though they seem to play upon the square   sir mark in truth mr sage i think such a fact must be murder in a mans own private conscience whatever it may appear to the world   col plume i have known some men so nice that they would not fight but upon a cloak without pistols   mr sage i believe a custom well established would outdo the grand monarchs edict   sir mark and bullies would then leave off their long swords but i dont find that a very pretty fellow can stay to change his sword when he is insulted by a bully with a long diego though his own at the same time be no longer than a penknife which will certainly be the case if such little swords are in mode pray colonel how was it between the hectors of your time and the very topping fellows   col plume sir long swords happened to be generally worn in those times   mr sage in answer to what you were saying sir mark give me leave to inform you that your knightserrant who were the very pretty fellows of those ancient times thought they could

must be a spice o romantic gallantry in the composition of tha very pretty fellow   sir mark i am of opinion mr sage tha fashion governs a very pretty fellow nature or common sense your ordinary

that chimaera of a duel   sir mark there is no disputing against so great a majority   mr sage but there is one scruple col plume and i have done dont you believe there may be some advantage even upon a cloak with pistols which a man of nice honor would scruple to take   col plume faith i cannot tell sir but since one may reasonably suppose that in such a case there can be but one so far in the wrong as to occasion matters to come to that extremity i think the chance of being killed should fall but on one whereas by their close and desperate manner of fighting it may very probably happen to both   sir mark why gentlemen if they are men of such nice honor and must fight there will be no fear of foul play if they threw up cross or pile who should be shot   the tatler no  0 from saturday

guildhall whether a noble person has rts enough to deserve the enjoyment of the reat estate of which he is possessed the city  apprehensive that this precedent may go furer than was at first imagined the person ainst whom this inquisition is set up by his retions is a peer of a neighboring kingdom d has in his youth made some few bulls by which it is insinuated that he has forfeited his oods and chattels this is the more astonishg in that there are many persons in the said ity who are still more guilty than his lordip and who though they are idiots do not nly possess but have also themselves acquired reat estates contrary to the known laws of is realm which vests their possessions in the crown  there is a gentleman in the coffeehouse at is time exhibiting a bill in chancery against s fathers younger brother who by some range magic has arrived at the value of half  plumb as the citizens call an hundred thound pounds and in all the time of growing up  that wealth was never known in any of his rdinary words or actions to discover any proof of reason upon this foundation my friend ha set forth that he is illegally master of his coffers and has writ two epigrams to signify his own pretensions and sufficiency for spending that estate he has inserted in his plea some things which i fear will give offense for he pretends to argue that though a man has a little of the knave mixed with the fool he is nevertheless liable to the loss of goods and makes the abuse of reason as just an avoidance of an estate as the total absence of it this is what can never pass but witty men are so full of themselves that there is no persuading em and my friend will not be convinced but that upon quoting solomon who always used the word fool as a term of the same signification with unjust and makes all deviation from goodness and virtue to come under the notion of folly i say he doubts not but by the force of this authority let his idiot uncle appear never so great a knave he shall prove him a fool at the same time  this affair led the company here into an examination of these points and none coming here but wits what was asserted by a young lawyer that a lunatic is in the care of the chancery but a fool in that of the crown was received with general indignation why that says old renault why that why must a fool be a courtier more than a madman this is the iniquity of this dull age i remember the time when it went on the mad side all your top wits were scowrers rakes roarers and demolishers of windows i knew a mad lord who was drunk five years together and was the envy of that age who is faintly imitated by the dull pretenders to vice and madness in this had he lived to this day there had not been a fool in fashion in the whole kingdom when renault had done speaking a very worthy man assumed the discourse this is said he mr bickerstaff a proper argument for you to treat in your article from this place and if you would send your pacolet into all our brains you would find that a little fiber or valve scarce discernable makes the distinction between a politician and an idiot we should therefore throw a veil upon those unhappy instances of humane nature who seem to breath without the direction of reason and understanding as we should avert our eyes with abhorrence from such as live in perpetual abuse and contradiction to these noble faculties shall this unfortunate man be divested of his estate because he is tractable and indolent runs in no mans debt invades no mans bed nor spends the estate he owes his children and his character when one who shows no sense above him but in such practices shall be esteemed in his senses and possibly may pretend to the guardianship of him who is no ways his inferior but in being less wicked we see old age brings us indifferently into the same impotence of soul wherein nature has placed this lod  there is something very fantastical in the distribution of civil power and capacity among men the law certainly gives these persons into the ward and care of the crown because that is best able to protect em from injuries and the impositions of craft and knavery that the life of an idiot may not ruin the intail of a noble house and his weakness may not frustrate the industry or capacity of the founder of his family but when one of bright parts as we say with his eyes open and all mens eyes upon him destroys those purposes there is no remedy folly and ignorance are punished folly and guilt are tolerated mr lock has somewhere made a stinction between a madman and a fool a for is he that from right principles makes a wro conclusion but a madman is one who draws  just inference from false principles thus the fool who cut off the fellows head that lay aslee and hid it and then waited to see what he wou say when he awaked and missed his headpiece was in the right in the first thought that a man would be surprised to find such an alteration i things since he fell asleep but he was a little mistaken to imagine he could awake at all afte his head was off a madman fancies himself a prince but upon his mistake he acts suitably  that character and though he is out in supposion he has principalities while he drinks gruel and lies in straw yet you shall see him keep the port of a distressed monarch in all his words and actions these two persons are equally taken into custody but what must be done to half this good company who every hour of their life are knowingly and wittingly both fools and madmen and yet have capacities both of forming principles and drawing conclusions with the full use of reason  from my own apartment july    this evening some ladies came to visit my sister jenny and the discourse after very many frivolous and public matters turned upon the main point among the women the passion of love sappho who always leads on this occasion began to show her reading and told us that sir john suckling and milton had upon a parallel occasion said the tenderest things she had ever read the circumstance said she is such as gives us a notion of that protecting part which is the duty of men in their honorable designs upon or possession of omen in sucklings tragedy of brennoralt e makes the lover steal into his mistresss bedamber and draw the curtains then when is heart is full of her charms as she lies sleepg instead of being carried away by the vioce of his desires into thoughts of a warmer nature sleep which is the image of death ives this generous lover reflections of a diffeent kind which regard rather her safety than is own passion for beholding her as she lies eeping he utters these words so misers look upon their gold which while they joy to see they fear to lose the pleasure of the sight scarce equalling the jealousy of being dispossessed by others her face is like the milky way in the sky a meeting of gentle lights without name heavens shall this fresh ornament of the world these precious lovelines pass with other common things amongst the wastes of time what pity twere   when milton makes adam leaning on his arm beholding eve and lying in the contemplation of her beauty he describes utmost tenderness and guardian affection in one word adam with looks of cordial love hung over her enamored   this is that sort of passion which truly deserves the name of love and has something more generous than friendship it self for it has a constant care of the object beloved abstracted from its own interests in the ossession of it sappho was proceeding on the subject when my sister produced a letter sent to her in the time of my absence in celebration of the marriage state which is the condition wherein only this sort of passion reigns in  authority the epistle is as follows  dear madam your brother being absent i dare take the liberty of writing to you my thought of that state which our whole sex either is or desires to be in you will easily guess i mean matrimony which i hear so much decryd that it was with no small labor i maintained my ground against two opponents but as your brother observed of socrates i drew them into my conclusion from their own concessions thus in marriage are two happy things allowed a wife in wedding sheets and in a shroud how can a marriage state then be accursed since the last days as happy as the first   if you think they were too easily confuted you may conclude them not of the first sense by their talking against marriage  yours mariana   i observed sappho began to redden at this epistle and turning to a lady who was playing with a dog she was so fond of as to carry him abroad with her nays says she i cannot blame the men if they have mean ideas of our souls and affections and wonder so many are brought to take us for companions for life when they see our endearments so triflingly placed for to my knowledge mr truman would give half his estate for half the affection you have shown to that shock nor do i believe you would be ashamed to confess that i saw you cry when he had the cholick last week with lapping sour milk what more could you do for your lover himself what more replied the lady there is not a man in england for whom i could lament half so much then she stifled the animal with kisses and called him beau life dear monsieur pretty fellow and what not in the hurry of her impertinence sappho rose up as she always does at any thing the observes done which discovers in her own sex a levity of mind which renders em iuconsiderable in the opinion of ours  st jamess coffeehouse july    letters from the hague of the   th instant n s say that the siege of tournay went on with all imaginable success and that there has been no manner of stop given to the attempts of the confederates since they undertook it except that by an accident of firing a piece of ordnance it burst and killed    or    men the french army is still in the camp of lens and goes on in improving their intrenchments when the last advices came away it was believed the town of tournay would be in the hands of the confederates by the end of this month advices from brussels inform us that they have an account of a great action between the malcontents in the vivarez and the french kings forces under the command of the duke of roquelaure in which engagement there were eighteen hundred men killed on the spot they add that all sorts of people who are under any oppression or discontent do daily join the vivarois and that their present body of men in arms consisted of six thousand this sudden insurrection has put the court of france under great difficulties and the king has given orders that the main body of his troops in spain shall withdraw into his own dominions where they are to be quartered in such countries as have of late discovered an inclination to take up arms the calamities of that kingdom being such that the people are not by any means to be kept in obedience except by the terror of military execution what makes the distresses still greater is that the court begins to be doubtful of their troops some regiments in the action of the cevennes having faced about against their officers and after the battle was over joined the malcontents upon receiving advice of this battle the duke of berwick detached twelve battalions into those parts and began to add new works to his intrenchments near brianzon in order to defend his camp after being weakened by sending so great a reinforcement into the cevennes letters from spain say that the duchess of anjou was lately delivered of a second son they write from madrid of the   th of june that the blockade of olivenza was continued but acknowledge that the late provisions which were thrown into the place make them doubt whether they shall be masters of it this

no body at this end of the town have heard of it i protest i who make it my business to enquire after adventures should never have known this had not the following account been sent me enclosed in a

aldersgate street barbican and draw up in redcross street the right at st pauls alley in the rear march off lieutenant general with half the body up beechlane he sends a subdivision up kingsheadcourt and takes post in it and marches two divisions round into redlionmarket to defend that pass and succor the division in kingsheadcourt but keeps in whitecrossstreet facing beechlane the rest of the body ready drawn up then the general marches up beechlane is attacked but forces the division in the court into the market and enters with three divisions while he presses the lieutenantgenerals main body and at the same time the three divisions force those of the revolters out of the market and so all the lieutenantgenerals body retreats into chiswelstreet and lodges two divisions in grubstreet and as the general marches on they fall on his flank but soon made to give way but having a retreatingplace in redlioncourt but could not hold it being put to flight through pauls alley and pursued by the generals granadiers while he marches up and attacks their main body but are opposed again by a party of men as lay in blackravencourt but they are forced also to retire soon in the utmost confusion and at the same time those brave divisions in pauls alley ply their rear with granadiers that with precipitation they take to the rout along bunhillrow so the general marches into the artilleryground and being drawn up finds the revolting party to have found entrance and makes a show as if for a battle and both armies soon engage in form and fire by platoons  much might be said for the improvement of this system which for its style and invention may instruct generals and their historians both in fighting a battle and describing it when it is over these elegant expressions ditto  and so  but soon  but having  but could not  but are  but they  finds the party to have found etc  do certainly give great life and spirit to the relation  indeed i am extremely concerned for the lieutenant general who by his overthrow and defeat is made a deplorable instance of the fortune of war and vicissitudes of humane affairs he alas has lost in beechlane and chiswelstreet all the glory he lately gained in and about holborn and st giless the art of subdividing first and dividing afterward is new and surprising and according to this method the troops are disposed in kingsheadcourt and redlionmarket nor is the conduct of these leaders less conspicuous in their choice of the ground or field of battle happy was it that the greatest part of the achievements of this day was to be performed near grubstreet that there might not be wanting a sufficient number of faithful historians who being eyewitnesses of these wonders should impartially transmit them to posterity but then it can never be enough regretted that we are left in the dark as to the name and title of that extraordinary hero who commanded the divisions in paulsalley especially because those divisions are justly styled brave and accordingly were to push the enemy along bunhillrow and thereby occasion a general battle but pallas appeared in the form of a shower of rain and prevented the slaughter and desolation which were threatened by these extraordinary preparations  hi motus animorum atque haec certamina tanta pulveris exigui jactu compressa quiescunt wills coffeehouse july    some part of the

manages impertinents with the utmost dexterity it was diverting this evening to hear a discourse between him and one of these gentlemen he told me before that person joined us that he was a questioner who according to his description is one who asks questions not with a design to receive information but an affectation to show his uneasiness for want of it he went on in asserting that there are crowds of that modest ambition as to aim no further than to demonstrate that they are in doubt by this time will whynot was fate down by us so gentlemen says he in how many days think you shall we be

the duke of savoy make an irruption into france but says he time will clear all these mysteries his answer to himself gave me the altitude of his head and to all his questions i thus answered very satisfactorily  sir have you heard that this slaughterford never owned the fact for which he died have the newspapers mentioned that matter but pray can you tell me what method will be taken to provide for these palatines but this as you say time will clear ay ay says he and whispers me they will never let us into these things beforehand i whispered him again we shall know it as soon as there is a proclamation  he tells me in the other ear you are in the right of it then he whispered my friend to know what my name was then made an obliging bow and went to examine another table this led my friend and me to weigh this wandering manner in many other incidents and he took out of his pockets several little notes or tickets to solicit for votes to employments as mr john taplash having served all offices and being reduced to great poverty desires your vote for singingclerk of this parish another has had ten children all whom his wife has suckled her self therefore humbly desires to be a schoolmaster  there is nothing so frequent as this way of application for offices it is not that you are fit for the place but because the place would be convenient for you that you claim a merit to it but commend me to the great kirleus who has lately set up for midwisery and to help childbirth for no other reason but that he is himself the unborn doctor the way is to hit upon something that puts the vulgar upon the stare or that touches their compassion which is often the weakest part about us i know a good lady who has taken her daughters from their old dancing master to place them with another for no other reason but because the new man has broke his leg which is so ill set that he can never dance more  from my own apartment july    as it is a frequent mortification to me to receive letters wherein people tell me without a name they know i meant them in such and such a passage so that very accusation is an argument that there are such beings in humane life as fall under our description and our discourse is not altogether fantastical and groundless but in this case i am treated as i saw a boy was the other day who gave out pocky bills every plain fellow took it that passed by and went on his way without further notice at last came one with his nose a little abridgd who knocks the lad down with a why you son of a w  e do you think i am p  d but shakespeare has

overthrown those of the enemy on the   th instant n s general schuylemburgh had made a lodgment on the counterscarp of the tenaille which post was so weakly defended that we lost but six men in

ordered large detachments to make motions toward douay and conde the swift progress of this siege has so much alarmed the other frontier towns of france that they were throwing down some houses in the

 the tatler no     celebrare domestica facta  from thursd july    to saturd july      0  from my own apartment july    looking over some old papers i found a little treatise written by my greatgrandfather concerning bribery and thought his manner of treating that subject not unworthy my remark he there has a digression concerning a possibility that in some circumstances a man may receive an injury and yet be conscious to himself that he deserves it there are abundance of fine things said on the subject but the whole wrapped up in so much jingle and pun which was the wit of those times that it is scarce intelligible but i thought the design was well enough in the following sketch of the old gentlemans poetry for in this case where two are rivals for the same thing and propose to obtain it by presents he that attempts the judges honesty by making him offers of reward ought not to complain when he loses his cause by a better bidder the good old dogrel runs thus  a

doom has me undone when oil i gave my cause was good but now to ruin run poor man quoth he i thee forgot and see thy cause of foil an hog came since into my house and broke thy pot of oil wills coffeehouse july    the discourse happened this evening to fall upon characters drawn in plays and a gentleman remarked that there was no method in the world of knowing the taste of an age or period of time so good as by the observations of the persons represented in their comedies there were several instances produced as ben johnsons bringing in a fellow smoking as a piece of foppery but said the gentleman who entertained us on this subject this matter is no where so observable as in the difference of the characters of women on the stage in the last age and in this it is not to be supposed that it was a poverty of genius in shakespeare that his women made so small a figure in his dialogues but it certainly is that he drew women as they then were in life for that sex had not in those days that freedom in conversation and their characters were only that they were mothers sisters daughters and wives there were not then among the ladies shining wits politicians virtuosae freethinkers and disputants nay there was then hardly such a creature even as a coquet but vanity had quite another turn and the most conspicuous woman at that time of day was only the best housewife were it possible to bring into life an assembly of matrons of that age and introduce the learned lady woodby into their company they would not believe the same nation could produce a creature so unlike any thing they ever saw in it  but these ancients would be as much astonished to see in the same age so illustrious a pattern to all who love things praiseworthy as the divine aspasia methinks i now see her walking in her garden like our first parent with unaffected charms before beauty had spectators and bearing celestial conscious virtue in her aspect her countenance is the lively picture of her mind which is the seat of honor truth compassion knowledge and innocence there dwells the scorn of vice and pity too in the midst of the most ample fortune and veneration of all that behold and know her without the least affectation she consults retirement the contemplation of her own being and that supreme power which bestowed it without the learning of schools or knowledge of a long course of arguments she goes on in a steady course of uninterrupted piety and virtue and adds to the severity and privacy of the last age all the freedom and ease of this the language and mien of a court she is possessed of in the highest degree but the simplicity and humble thoughts of a cottage are her more welcome entertainments aspasia is a female philosopher who does not only live up to the resignation of the most retired lives of the ancient sages but also to the schemes and plans which they thought beautiful though inimitable this lady is the most exact oeconomist without appearing busy the most strictly virtuous without tasting the praise of it and shuns applause with as much industry as others do reproach this character is so particular that it will very easily be fixed on her only by all that know her but i dare say she will be the last that finds it out  but alas if we have one or two such ladies how many dozens are there like the restless poluglossa who is acquainted with all the world but her self who has the appearance of all and possession of no one virtue she has indeed in her practice the absence of vice but her discourse is the continual history of it and it is apparent when she speaks of the criminal gratifications of others that her innocence is only a restraint with a certain mixture of envy she is so perfectly opposite to the character of aspasia that as vice is terrible to her only as it is the object of reproach so virtue is agreeable only as it is attended with applause  st jamess coffeehouse july    it is now twelve a clock at noon and no mail come in

little encouraged by people of rank and quality that the wits of the age are obliged to run within temple bar for patronage there is a deplorable instance of this in the case of mr d  y who has

have elsewhere celebrated the contrivance of this excellent drama but was not till i read the dedication wholly let into the religious design of it i am afraid it has suffered discontinuance at this gay end of the town for no other reason but the piety of the purpose there is however in this epistle the true life of panegyrical performance and i do not doubt but if the patron would part with it i

praiseworthy you are so far from thinking your self better than others that a flourishing and opulent fortune which by a certain natural corruption in its quality seldom fails to infect other

hitherto attempted he read to us the plan upon which he intends to proceed i thought his account by way of fable of the worlds about us had so much vivacity in it that i could not forbear transcribing his hypothesis to give the reader a taste of my friends treatise which is now in the press  the inferior deities having designed on a day to play a game at football knead together a numberless collection of dancing atoms into the form of seven rolling globes and that nature might be kept from a dull inactivity each separate particle is endued with a principle of motion or a power of attraction whereby all the several parcels of matter draw each other proportionably to their magnitudes and distances into such a remarkable variety of different forms as to produce all the wonderful appearances we now observe in empire philosophy and religion but to proceed  at the beginning of the game each of the globes being struck forward with a vast violence ran out of sight and wandered in a straight line through the infinite spaces the nimble deities pursue breathless almost and spent in the eager chase each of them catched hold of one and stamped it with his name as saturn jupiter

reduced to a primitive simplicity and whoever shall be found to have persevered in a constancy of dress in spite of all the allurements of profane and heathen habits shall be rewarded with a neverfading doublet of a thousand years all points in the system which are doubted shall be attested by the knights extemporary oath for the satisfaction of his readers  wills coffee house july    we were upon the heroic strain this evening and the question was what is the true sublime many very good discourses happened thereupon after which a gentleman at the table who is it seems writing on that subject assumed the argument and though he ran through many instances of sublimity from the ancient writers said he had hardly known an occasion wherein the true greatness of soul which animates a general in action is so well represented with regard to the person of whom it was spoken and the time in which it was writ as in a few lines in a modern poem there is continued he nothing so forced and constrained as what we frequently meet with in tragedies to make a man under the weight of a great sorrow or full of meditation upon what he is soon to execute cast about for a simile to what he himself is or the thing which he is going to act but there is nothing more proper and natural for a poet whose business is to describe and who is spectator of one in that circumstance when his mind is working upon a great image and that the ideas hurry upon his imagination i say there is nothing so natural as for a poet to relieve and clear himself from the burden of thought at that time by uttering his conception in simile and metaphor the highest act of the mind of man is to possess it self with tranquillity in eminent danger and to have its thoughts so free as to act at that time without perplexity the ancient authors have compared this sedate courage to a rock that remains immovable amidst the rage of winds and waves but that is too stupid and inanimate a similitude and could do no credit to the hero at other times they are all of em wonderfully obliged to a lybian lion which may give indeed very agreeable terrors to a description but is no compliment to the person to whom it is applied eagles tigers and wolves are made use of on the same occasion and very often with much beauty but this is still an honor done to the brute rather than the hero mars pallas bacchus and hercules have each of em furnished very good similes in their time and made doubtless a greater impression on the mind of a heathen than they have on that of a modern reader but the sublime image that i am talking of and which i really think as great as ever entered into the thought of man is in the poem called the campaign where the simile of a ministering angel sets forth the most sedate and the most active courage engaged in an uproar of nature a confusion of elements and a scene of divine vengeance add to all that these lines compliment the general and his queen at the same time and have all the natural horrors heightened by the image that was still fresh in the mind of every reader  twas then great marlbros mighty soul was proved that in the shock of charging hosts unmoved amidst confusion horror and despair examined all the dreadful scenes of war in peaceful thought the field of death surveyed to fainting squadrons sent the timely aid inspired repulsed battalions to engage and taught the doubtful battle where to rage so when an angel by divine command with rising tempests shakes a guilty land such as of late over pale britannia past calm and serene he drives the furious blast and pleased the almightys orders to perform rides in the whirlwind and directs the storm the whole poem is so exquisitely noble and poetic that i think it an honor to our nation and language the gentleman concluded his critic on this work by saying that he esteemed it wholly new and a wonderful attempt to keep up the ordinary ideas of a march of an army just as they happened in so warm and great a style and yet be at once familiar and heroic such a performance is a chronicle as well as a poem and will preserve the memory of our hero when all the edifices and statues erected to his honor are blended with common dust  st jamess coffeehouse july    letters from the hague of the   d instant n s say that the allies were so forward in the siege of tournay that they were preparing for a general assault which it was supposed would be made within a few days deserters from the town gave an account that the garrison was carrying their ammunition and provisions into the citadel which occasioned a tumult among the inhabitants of the town the french army had laid bridges over the scarp and made a motion as if they intended to pass that river but though they are joined by the reinforcement expected from germany it was not believed they would make any attempt toward relieving tournay letters from brabant say there has been a discovery made of a design to deliver up antwerp

to thursd july      0  whites chocolatehouse july    this day passing through covent garden i was stopped in the piazza by pacolet to observe what he called the triumph of love and youth i turned to the object he pointed at and there i saw a gay gilt chariot drawn by fresh prancing horses the coachman with a new cockade and the lacques with insolence and plenty in their countenances i asked immediately what young heir or lover owned that glittering equipage but my companion interrupted do not you see there the mourning aesculapius the mourning said i yes isaac said pacolet he is in deep mourning and is the languishing hopeless lover of the divine hebe the emblem of youth and beauty the excellent and learned sage you behold in that furniture is the strongest instance imaginable that love is the most powerful of all things  you are not so ignorant as to be a stranger to the character of aesculapius as the patron and most successful of all who profess the art of medicine but as most of his operations are owing to a natural sagacity or impulse he has very little troubled himself with the doctrine of drugs but has always given nature more room to help her self than any of her learned assistants and consequently has done greater wonders than is in the power of art to perform for which reason he is half deifyd by the people and has ever been justly courted by all the world as if he were a seventh son  it happened that the charming hebe was reduced by a long and violent fever to the most extreme danger of death and when all skill failed they sent for aesculapius the renowned artist was touched with the deepest compassion to see the faded charms and faint bloom of hebe and had a generous concern in beholding a struggle not between life but rather between youth and death all his skill and his passion tended to the recovery of hebe beautiful even in sickness but alas the unhappy physician knew not that in all his care he was only sharpening darts for his own destruction in a word his fortune was the same with that of the statuary who fell in love with the image of his own making and the unfortunate aesculapius is become the patient of her whom he lately recovered long before this disaster aesculapius was far gone in the unnecessary and superfluous amusements of old age in increasing unweildy stores and providing in the midst of an incapacity of enjoyment of what he had for a supply of more wants than he had calls for in youth it self but these low considerations are now no more and love has taken place of avarice or rather is become an avarice of another kind which still urges him to pursue what he does not want but behold the matamorphosis the anxious mean cares of an usurer are turned into the languishments and complaints of a lover behold says the aged aesculapius i submit i own great love thy empire pity hebe the fop you have made what have i to do with guilding but on pills yet o fair for thee i sit amidst a crowd of painted deities on my chariot buttoned in gold clasped in gold without having any value for that beloved metal but as it adorns the person and laces the hat of thy dying lover i ask not to live o hebe give me but gentle death euthanasia euthanasia that is all i implore when aesculapius had finished his complaint pacolet went on in deep morals on the incertainty of riches with this remarkable exclamation o wealth how impotent art thou and how little do thou supply us with real happiness when the usurer himself can forget thee for the love of what is as foreign to his felicity as thou art  wills coffeehouse july    the company here who have all a delicate taste of theatrical representations had made a gathering to purchase the movables of the neighboring playhouse for the encouragement of one which is setting up in the haymarket but the proceedings at the auction by which method the goods have been sold this evening have been so unfair that this generous design has been frustrated for the imperial mantle made for cyrus was missing as also the chariot and two dragons but upon examination it was found that a gentleman of hampshire had clandestinely bought them both and is gone down to his country seat and that on saturday last he passed through stains attired in that robe and drawn by the said dragons assisted by two only of his own horses this theatrical traveller has also left orders with mr hall to send the faded rainbow to the scowrers and when it comes home to dispatch it after him at the same time c  r  esquire is invited to bring down his setting sun himself and be boxkeeper to a theater erected by this gentleman near southampton thus there has been nothing but artifice in the management of this affair for which reason i beg pardon of the town that i inserted the inventory in my paper and solemnly protest i knew nothing of this artful design of vending these rarities but i meant only the good of the world in that and all other things which i divulge  and now i am upon this subject i must do my self justice in relation to an article in a former paper wherein i made mention of a person who keeps a puppetshow in the town of bath i was tender of naming names and only just hinted that he makes larger promises when he invites people to his dramatick representations than he is able to perform but i am credibly informed that he makes a profane lewd jester whom he calls punch speak to the dishonor of isaac bickerstaff with great familiarity and before all my learned friends in that place takes upon him to dispute my title to the appellation of esquire i think i need not say much to convince all the world that this mr powell for that is his name is a pragmatical and vain person to pretend to argue with me on any subject mecum certasse feretur that is to say it will be an honor to him to have it said he contended with me but i would have him to know that i can look beyond his wires and know very well the whole trick of his art and that it is only by these wires that the eye of the spectator is cheated and hindered from seeing that there is a thread on one of punchs chops which draws it up and lets it fall at the discretion of the said powell who stands behind and plays him and makes him speak sawcily of his betters he to pretend to make prologues against me  but a man never behaves himself with decency in his own case therefore i shall command my self and never trouble me further with this little fellow who is himself but a tall puppet and has not brains enough to make even wood speak as it ought to do and i that have heard the groaning board can despise all that his puppets shall be able to speak as long as they live but ex quovis ligno non fit mercurius he has pretended to write to me also from the bath and says he thought to have deferred giving me an answer till he came to his books but that my writings might do well with the waters which are pert expressions that become a schoolboy better than one that is to teach others and when i have said a civil thing to him he cries oh i thank you for that  i am your humble servant for that ah mr powell these smart civilities will never run down men of learning i know well enough your design is to have all men automata like your puppets but the world is grown too wise and can look through these thin devices i know you design to make a reply to this but be sure you stick close to my words for if you bring me into discourses concerning the government of your puppets i must tell you i neither am nor have been nor will be at leisure to answer you it is really a burning shame this man should be tolerated in abusing the world with such representations of things but his parts decay and he is not much more alive than partridge  from my own apartment july    i must beg pardon of my readers that for this time i have i fear huddled up my discourse having been very busy in helping an old friend of mine out of town he has a very good estate is a man of wit but he had been three years absent from town and cannot bear a jest for which reason i have with some pains convinced him that he can no more live here than if he were a downright bankrupt he was so fond of dear london that he began to fret only inwardly but being unable to laugh and be laughed at i took a place in the northern coach for him and his family and hope he is got to night safe from all sneerers in his own parlour  st jamess coffeehouse july  0 this morning we received by express the agreeable news of the surrender of the town of tournay on the   th instant n s the place was assaulted at the attacks of general schuylemberg and that of general lottum at the same time the action at both those parts of the town was very obstinate and the allies lost a considerable number at the beginning of the dispute but the fight was continued with so great bravery that the enemy observing our men to be masters of all the posts which were necessary for a general attack beat the chamade and hostages were received from the town and others sent from the befiegers in order to come to a formal capitulation for the surrender of the place we have also this day received advice that sir john leak who lies off of dunkirk had intercepted several ships laden with corn from the baltic and that the dutch privateers had fallen in with others and carried them into holland the french

chocolatehouse july    the other day i took a walk a mile or twoout of town and strolling wherever chance led me i was insensibly carried into a byroad along which was a very agreeable quickset of an extraordinary height which surrounded a very delicious seat and garden from one angle of the hedge i heard a voice cry sir sir  this raised my curiosity and i heard the same voice say but in a gentle tone come forward come forward i did so and one through the hedge called me by my name and bad me go on to the left and i should be admitted to visit an old acquaintance in distress the laws of knight errantry made me obey the summons without hesitation and i was let in at the backgate of a lovely house by a maidservant who carried me from room to room till i came into a gallery at the end of which i saw a fine lady dressed in the most sumptuous habit as if she were going to a ball but with the most abject and disconsolate sorrow in her face that i ever beheld as i came near she burst into tears and cried sir do not you know the unhappy teraminta i soon recollected her whole person but said i madam the simplicity of dress in which i have ever seen you at your good fathers house and the cheerfulness of countenance with which you always appeared are so unlike the fashion and temper you are now in that i did not easily recover the memory of you your habit was then decent and modest your looks serene and beautiful whence then this unaccountable change nothing can speak so deep a sorrow as your present aspect yet your dress is made for jollity and revelling it is said she an unspeakable pleasure to meet with one i know and to bewail my self to any that is not an utter stranger to humanity  when your friend my father died he left me to a wide world with no defense against the insults of fortune but rather a thousand snares to entrap me in the dangers to which youth and innocence are exposed in an age wherein honor and virtue are become mere words and used only as they serve to betray those who understand them in their native sense and obey them as the guides and motives of their being the wickedest of all men living the abandoned decius who has no knowledge of any good art or purpose of humane life but as it tends to the satisfaction of his appetites had opportunities of frequently seeing and entertaining me at a house where mixed company boarded and where he placed himself for the base intention which he has since brought to pass decius saw enough in me to raise his brural desires and my circumstances gave him hopes of accomplishing them but a l the glittering expectations he could lay before me joined by my private terrors of poverty it self could not for some months prevail upon me yet however i hated his intention i still had a secret satisfaction in his courtship and always exposed my self to his solicitations see here the bane of our sex let the flattery be never so apparent the flatterer never so ill thought of his praises are still agreeable and we contribute to our own deceit i was therefore ever fond of all opportunities and pretenses of being in his company in a word i was at last ruined by him and brought to this place where i have been ever since immured and from the fatal day after my fall from innocence my worshipper became my master and my tyrant  thus you see me habited in the most gorgeous manner not in honor of me as a woman he loves but as this attire charms his own eye and urges him to repeat the gratification he takes in me as the servant of his brutish lusts and appetites i know not where to fly for redress but am here pining away life in the solitude and severity of a nun but the conscience and guilt of an harlot i live in this lewd practice with a religious awe of my minister of darkness upbraided with the support i receive from him for the inestimable possession of youth of innocence of honor and of conscience i see sir my discourse grows painful to you all i beg of you is to paint in so strong colors as to let decius see i am discovered to be in his possession that i may be turned out of this detestable scene of regular iniquity and either think no more or sin no more if your writings have the good effect of gaining my enlargement i promise you i will atone for this unhappy step by preferring an innocent laborious poverty to all the guilty affluence the world can offer me  wills coffeehouse july    to show that i do not bear an irreconcilable hatred to my mortal enemy mr powell at bath i do his function the honor to publish to the world that plays represented by puppets are permitted in our universities and that sort of drama is not wholly thought unworthy the critic of learned heads but as i have been conversant rather with the greater ode as i think the critics call it i must be so humble as to make a request to mr powell and desire him to apply his thoughts to answering the difficulties with which my kinsman the author of the following letter seems to be embarrassed  to my honored kinsman isaac bickerstaff esquire dear cousin had the family of the beadlestaffs whereof i though unworthy am one known of your being lately at oxon we had in our own name and in the universities as it is our office made you a compliment but your short stay here robbed us of an opportunity of paying our due respects and you of receiving an ingenious entertainment with which we at present divert our selves and strangers a puppetshow at this time supplies the want of an act and since the nymphs of this city are disappointed of a luscious musickspeech and the country ladies of hearing their sons or brothers speak verses yet the vocal machines like them by the help of a prompter say things as much to the benefit of the audience and almost as properly their own the license of a terrafilius is refined to the wellbred satyr of punchenella now cousin bickerstaff though punch has neither a french nightcap nor long pockets yet you must own him to be a pretty fellow a very pretty fellow nay since he seldom leaves the company without calling son of a whore demanding satisfaction and duelling he must be owned a smart fellow too yet by some indecencies toward the ladies he seems to be of a third character distinct from any you have yet touched upon a young gentleman who sat next me for i had the curiosity of seeing this entertainment in a tufted gown red stockings and long wig which i pronounce to be tantamount to red heels and a dangling cane was enraged when punchenello disturbed a soft lovescene with his ribaldry you would oblige us mightily by laying down some rules for adjusting the extravagant behavior of this almanzor of the play and by writing a treatise on this sort of dramatick poetry so much favored and so little understood by the learned world  from its being conveyed in a cart after the thespian manner all the parts being recited by one person as the custom was before aeschilus and from the behavior of punch as if he had won the goal you may possibly deduce its antiquity and settle the chronology as well as some of our modern critics in its natural transitions from mournful to merry as from the hanging of a lover to dancing upon the rope from the stalking of a ghost to a ladys presenting you with a jig you may discover such a decorum as is not to be found elsewhere than in our tragicomedies but i forget my self it is not for me to dictate i thought fit dear cousin to give you these hints to show you that the beadlestaffs dont walk before men of letters to no purpose and that though we do but hold up the train of arts and sciences yet like other pages we are now and then let into our ladies secrets i am  your most affectionate kinsman benjamin beadlestaff from mother gourdons at hedington near oxon june     from my own apartment july    i am got hither safe but never spent time with so little satisfaction as this evening for you must know i was five hours with three merry and two honest fellows the former sang catches and the latter even died with laughing at the noise they made well says tom belfrey you scholars mr bickerstaff are the worst company in the world ay says his opposite you are dull to night prithee be merry with that i huzzad and took a jump cross the table then came clever upon my legs and fell a laughing let mr bickerstaff alone says one of the honest fellows when he is in a good humor he is as good company as any man in england he had no sooner spoke but i snatched his hat off his head and clapped it upon my own and burst out a laughing again upon which we all fell a laughing for half an hour one of the honest fellows got behind me in the interim and hit me a sound slap on the back upon which he got the laugh out of my hands and it was such a twang on my shoulders that i confess he was much merrier than i i was half angry but resolved to keep up the good humor of the company and after hollowing as loud as i could possibly i drank off a bumper of claret that made me stare again nay says one of the honest fellows mr isaac is in the right there is no conversation in this what fignifies jumping or hitting one another on the back let us drink about we did so from seven a clock till eleven and now i am come hither and after the manner of the wise pythagoras begin to reflect upon the passages of the day i remember nothing but that i am bruised to death and as it is my way to write down all the good things i have heard in the last conversation to furnish my paper i can from this only tell you my sufferings and my bangs  i named pythagoras just now and i protest to you as he believed men after death entered into other species i am now and then tempted to think other animals enter into men and could name several on two legs that never discover any sentiment above what is common with the species of a lower kind as we see in these bodily wits whom i was with to night whose parts consist in strength and activity but their boisterous mirth gives me great impatience for the return of such happiness as i enjoyed in a conversation last week among others in that company we had florio who never interrupted any man living when he was speaking or ever ceased to speak but others lamented that he had done his discourse ever arises from a fullness of the matter before him and not from ostentation or triumph of his understanding for though he seldom delivers what he need fear being repeated he speaks without having that end in view and his forbearance of calumny or bitterness is owing rather to his good nature than his discretion for which reason he is esteemed a gentleman perfectly qualified for conversation in whom a general good will to mankind takes off the necessity of caution and circumspection  we had at the same time that evening the best sort of companion that can be a goodnatured old man this person meets in the company of young men veneration for his benevolence and is not only valued for the good qualities of which he is master but reaps an acceptance from the pardon he gives to other men faults and the ingenious sort of men with whom he converses have so just a regard for him that he rather is an example than a check to their behavior for this reason as senecio never pretends to be a man of pleasure before youth so young men never set up for wisdom before senecio so that you never meet where he is those monsters of conversation who are grave or gay above their years he never converses but with followers of nature and good sense where all that is uttered is only the effect of a communicable temper and not of emulation to excel their companions all desire of superiority being a contradiction to that spirit which makes a just conversation the very essence of which is mutual good will hence it is that i take it for a rule that the natural and not the acquired man is the companion learning wit gallantry and good breeding are all but subordinate qualities in society and are of no value but as they are subservient to benevolence and tend to a certain manner of being or appearing equal to the rest of the company for conversation is composed of an assembly of men as they are men and not as they are distinguished by fortune therefore he that brings his quality with him into conversation should always pay the reckoning for he came to receive homage and not to meet his friends  but he din about my ears from the clamor of he people i was with this evening has carried e beyond my intended purpose which was to xplain upon the order of merry fellows but i hink i may pronounce of them as i heard good enecio with a spice of the wit of the last age ay viz that a merry fellow is the saddest felow in the world  the tatler no    non been convenient nec in una sede morantur majestas and amor   from saturd july    to tuesd july      0  whites chocolatehouse july    we see every day volumes written against that tyrant of humane life called love and yet there is no help found against his cruelties or barrier against the inroads he is pleased to make into the mind of man after this preface you will expect i am going to give particular instances of what i have asserted that expectation cannot be raised too high for the novelty of the history and manner of life of the emperor aurengezebe who has resided for some years in the cities of london and westminster with the air and mien indeed of his imperial quality but the equipage and appointment only of a private gentleman this potentate for a long series of time appeared from the hour of twelve till that of two at a coffeehouse near the change and had a seat though without a canopy sacred to himself where he gave diurnal audiences concerning commerce politics tare and tret usury and abatement with all things necessary for helping the distressed who are willing to give one limb for the better maintenance of the rest or such joyous youths whose philosophy is confined to the present hour and were desirous to call in the revenue of next half year to double the enjoyment of this long did this growing monarch employ himself after this manner and as alliances are necessary to all great kingdoms he took particularly the interests of lewis the fourteenth into his care and protection when all mankind were attacking that unhappy monarch and those who had neither valor or wit to oppose against him would be still showing their impotent malice by laying wagers in opposition to his interests aurengezebe ever took the part of his contemporary and laid immense treasures on his side in defense of his important magazine of toulon aurengezebe also had all this while a constant intelligence with india and his letters were answered in jewels which he soon made brillant and caused to be affixed to his imperial castor which he always wears cocked in front to show his defiance with an hear of imperial snuff in the middle of his ample visage to show his sagacity the zealots for this little spot called great britain fell universally into this emperors policies and paid homage to his superior genius in forfeiting their coffers to his treasury  but wealth and wisdom are possessions too solemn not to give weariness to active minds without the relief in vacant hours of wit and love which are the proper amusements of the powerful and the wise this emperor therefore with great regularity every day at five in the afternoon leaves his money changers his publicans and little hoarders of wealth to their low pursuits and ascends his chariot to drive to wills where the taste is refined and a relish given to mens possessions by a polite skill in gratifying their passions and appetites there it is that the emperor has learned to live and to love and not like a miser to gaze only on his ingots or his treasures but with a nobler satisfaction to live the admiration of others for his splendor and happiness in being master of them but a prince is no more to be his own caterer in his love than in his food therefore aurengezebe has ever in waiting two purveyors for his dishes and his wenches for his retired hours by whom the scene of his diversion is prepared in the following manner  there is near covent garden a street known by the name of drury which before the days of christianity was purchased by the queen of paphos and is the only part of great britain where the tenure of vassalage is still in being all that long course of building is under particular districts or ladyships after the manner of lordships in other parts over which matrons of known abilities preside and have for the support of their age and infirmities certain taxes paid out of the rewards of the amorous labors of the young this seraglio of great britain is disposed into convenient allies and apartments and every house from the cellar to the garret inhabited by nymphs of different orders that persons of every rank may be accommodated with an immediate consort to allay their flames and partake of their cares here it is that when aurengezebe thinks fit to give a loose to dalliance the purveyors prepare the entertainment and what makes it more august is that every person concerned in the interlude has his set part and the prince sends beforehand word what he designs to say and directs also the very answer which shall be made to him  it has been before hinted that this emperor has a continual commerce with india and it is to be noted that the largest stone that rich earth has produced is in our aurengezebes possession  but all things are now disposed for his reception at his entrance into the seraglio a servant delivers him his bever of state and love on which is fixed this inestimable jewel as his diadem when he is seated the purveyors pandarus and nuncio marching on each side of the matron of the house introduce her into his presence in the midst of the room they bow all together to the diadem  when the matron   whoever thou art as thy awful aspect speaks thee a man of power be propitious to this mansus of love and let not the severity of thy wisdom disdain that by the representation of naked innocence or pastoral figures we revive in thee the memory at least of that power of venus to which all the wise and the brave are some part of their lives devoted aurengezebe consents by a nod and they go out backward  after this an unhappy nymph who is to be supposed just escaped from the hands of a ravisher with her tresses disheveled runs into the room with a dagger in her hand and falls before the emperor  pity oh pity whoever thou art an unhappy virgin whom one of the train has robbed of her innocence her innocence which was all her portion  or rather let me die like the memorable lucretia  upon which she stabs her self the body is immediately examined after the manner of our coroners lucretia recovers by a cup of right nants and the matron who is her next relation stops all process at law  this unhappy affair is no sooner over but a naked madwoman breaks into the room calls for her duke her lord her emperor as soon as she spies aurengezebe the object of all her fury and love she calls for petticoats is ready to sink with shame and is dressed in all haste in new attire at his charge this unexpected accident of the madwoman makes aurengezebe curious to know whether others who are in their senses can guess at his quality for which reason the whole convent is examined one by one the matron marches in with a tawdry country girl  pray winifred says she who do you think that fine man with those jewels and pearls is  i believe says winifred it is our landlord  it must be the squire himself  the emperor laughs at her simplicity  go fool says the matron then turning to the emperor  your greatness will pardon her ignorance after her several others of different characters are instructed to mistake who he is in the same manner then the whole sisterhood are called together and the emperor rises and cocking his hat declares he is the great mogul and they his concubines a general murmur goes through the assembly and aurengezebe certifying that he keeps them for state rather than use tells them they are permitted to receive all men into their apartments then proceeds through the crowd among whom he throws medals shaped like halfcrowns and returns to his chariot  this being all that passed the last day a which aurengezebe visited the womens apartments i consulted pacolet concerning the foundation of such strange amusements in old age to which he answered you may remember when i gave you an account of my good fortune in being drowned on the  0th day of my humane life i told you of the disasters i should otherwise have met with before i arrived at the end of my stamen which was sixty years i may now add an observation to you that all who exceed that period except the latter part of it is spent in the exercise of virtue and contemplation of futurity must necessarily fall into an indecent old age because with regard to all the enjoyments of the years of vigor and manhood childhood returns upon them and as infants ride on sticks build houses in dirt and make ships in gutters by a faint idea of things they are to act hereafter so old men play the lovers potentates and emperors from the decaying image of the more perfect performances of their stronger years therefore be sure to insert aesculapius and aurengezebe in your next bill of mortality of the metaphorically defunct  wills coffeehouse july    as soon as i came hither this evening no less than ten people produced the following poem which they all reported was sent to each of them by the pennypost from an unknown hand all the battlewriters in the room were in debate who could be the author of a piece so martially written and every body applauded the address and skill of the author in calling it a postscript it being the nature of a postscript to contain something very material which was forgotten or not clearly expressed in the letter it self thus the verses being occasioned by a march without beat of drum and that circumstance being no ways taken notice of in any of the stanzas the author calls it a postscript not that it is a postscript but figuratively because it wants a postscript common writers when what they mean is not expressed in the book it self supply it by a preface but a postscript seems to me the more just way of apology because otherwise a man makes an excuse before the offense is committed all the heroic poets were guessed at for its author but though we could not find out his name yet one repeated a couplet in

mr withers next winter in this place for the service he has done his country no man deserves better of his friends than that gentleman whose distinguishing character it is that he gives his orders with the familiarity and enjoys his fortune with the generosity of a fellowsoldier his grace the duke of argyle had also an eminent part in the reduction of this important place that illustrious youth discovers the peculiar turn of spirit and greatness of soul which only make men of high birth and quality useful to their country and considers nobility as an imaginary distinction unless accompanied with the practice of those generous virtues by which it ought to be obtained but that our military glory is arrived at its present height and that men of all ranks so passionately affect their share in it is certainly owing to the merit and conduct of our glorious general for as the great secret in chemistry though not in nature has occasioned many useful discoveries and the fantastic notion of being wholly disinterested in friendship has made men do a thousand generous actions above themselves so though the present grandeur and fame of the duke of marlborough is a station of glory to which no one hopes to arrive yet all carry their actions to an higher pitch by having that great example laid before them  the tatler no    quicquid agunt homines nostri farrago libelli  from tuesd july

posture of affairs in that place but that the tranquillity and correspondence of the company begins to be interrupted by the arrival of sir taffety trippet a fortunehunter whose follies are too gross to give diversion and whose vanity is too stupid to let him be sensible that he is a public offense if people will indulge a splenatick humor it is impossible to be at ease when such creatures as are the scandal of our species set up for gallantry and adventures it will be much more easy therefore to laugh sir taffety into reason than convert him from his foppery by any serious contempt i knew a gentleman that made it a maxim to open his doors and ever run into the way of bullies to avoid their insolence the rule will hold as well with coxcombs they are never mortified but when they see you receive and despise them otherwise they rest assured that it is your ignorance makes them out of your good graces or that it is only want of admittance prevents their being amiable where they are shunned and avoided but sir taffety is a fop of so sanguine a complexion that i fear it will be very hard for the fair one he at present pursues to get rid of the chase without being so tired as for her own ease to fall into the mouth of the mungrel she runs from but the history of sir taffety is as pleasant as his character  it happened that when he first set up for a fortunehunter he chose tunbridge for the scene of action where were at that time two sisters upon the same design the knight believed of course the elder must be the better prize and consequently makes all his sail that way people that want sense do always in an egregious manner want modesty which made our hero triumph in making his amor as public as was possible the adored lady was no less vain of his public addresses an attorney with one cause is not half so restless as a woman with one lover wherever they met they talked to each other aloud chose each other partner at balls saluted at the most conspicuous parts of the service at church and practiced in honor of each other all the remarkable particularities which are usual for persons who admire one another and are contemptible to the rest of the world these two lovers seemed as much made for each other as adam and eve and all pronounced it a match of natures own making but the night before the nuptials so universally approved the younger sister envious of the good fortune even of her sister who had been present at most of their interviews and had an equal taste for the charms of a fop as there are a set of women made for that order of men the younger i say unable to see so rich a prize pass by her discovered to sir taffety that a coquet air much tongue and three suits was all the portion of his mistress his love vanished that moment himself and equipage the next morning it is uncertain where the lover has been ever since engaged but certain it is he has not appeared in his character as a follower of love and fortune till he arrived at epsom where there is at present a young lady of youth beauty and fortune who has alarmed all the vain and the impertinent to infest that quarter at the head of this assembly sir taffety shines in the brightest manner with all the accomplishments which usually ensuare the heart of woman with this particular merit which often is of great service that he is laughed at for her sake the friends of the fair one are in much pain for the sufferings she goes through from the perseverance of this hero but they may be much more so from the danger of his succeeding toward which they give him an helping hand if they dissuade her with bitterness for there is a fantastical generosity in the sex to approve creatures of the least merit imaginable when they see the imperfections of their admirers are become marks of derision for their sakes and there is nothing so frequent as that he who was contemptible to a woman in her own judgment has won her by being too violently opposed by others  grecian coffeehouse july    in the several capacities i bear of astrologer civilian and physician i have with great application studied the public emolument to this end serve all my lucubrations speculations and whatever other labors i undertake whether nocturnal or diurnal on this motive am i induced to publish a neverfailing medicine for the spleen my experience in this distemper came from a very remarkable cure on my ever worthy friend tom spindle who through excessive gaiety had exhausted that natural stock of wit and spirits he had long been blessed with he was sunk and flattened to the lower degree imaginable sitting whole hours over the book of martyrs and pilgrims progress his other contemplations never rising higher than the color of his urine or regularity of his pulse in this condition i found him accompanied by the learned dr dram and a good old nurse dram had prescribed magazines of herbs and mines of steel i soon discovered the malady and descanted on the nature of it till i convinced both the patient and his nurse that the spleen is not to be cured by medicine but by poetry apollo the author of physic shone with diffusive rays the best of poets as well as of physicians and it is in this double capacity that i have made my way and have found sweet easy flowring numbers are often superior to our noblest medicines when the spirits are low and nature sunk the muse with sprightly and harmonious notes gives an unexpected turn with a grain of poetry which i prepare without the use of mercury i have done wonders in this kind for the spleen is like the tarantula the effects of whose malignant poison are to be prevented by no other remedy but the charms of music for you are to understand that as some noxious animals carry antidotes for their own poisons so there is something equally unaccountable in poetry for though it is sometimes a disease it is to be cured only by it self now i knowing tom spindles constitution and that he is not only a pretty gentleman but also a pretty poet found the true cause of his distemper was a violent grief that moved his affections too strongly for during the late treaty of peace he had writ a most excellent poem on that subject and when he wanted but two lines in the last stanza for finishing the whole piece there comes news that the french tyrant would not sign spindle in a few days took his bed and had lain there still had not i been sent for i immediately told him there was great probability the french would now sue to us for peace i saw immediately a new life in his eyes and knew that nothing could help him forward so well as hearing verses which he would believe worse than his own i read him therefore the brussels postscript after which i recited some heroic lines of my own which operated so strongly on the tympanum of his ear that i doubt not but i have kept out all other sounds for a fortnight and have reason to hope we shall see him abroad the day before his poem  this you see is a particular secret i have found out viz that you are not to choose your physician for his knowledge in your distemper but for having it himself therefore i am at hand for all maladies arising from poetical vapors beyond which i never pretend for being called the other day to one in love i took indeed their three guineas and gave them my advice which was to send for aesculapius aesculapius as soon as he saw the patient cries out it is love it is love oh the unequal pulse these are the symptoms a lover feels such sighs such pangs attend the uneasy mind nor can our art or all our boasted skill avail  yet o fair for thee  thus the sage ran on and owned the passion which he pitied as well as that he felt a greater pain than ever he cured after which he concluded all i can advise is marriage charms and beauty will give new life and vigor and turn the course of nature to its better prospect this is the new way and thus aesculapius has left his beloved powders and writes a recipe for a wife at sixty in short my friend followed the prescription and married youth and beauty in its perfect bloom  supine in silvias snowy arms he lies and all the busy care of life defies each happy hour is filled with fresh delight while peace the day and pleasure crowns the night from my own apartment july    tragical passion was the subject of the discourse where i last visited this evening and a gentleman who knows that i am at present writing a very deep tragedy directed his discourse in a particular manner to me it is the common fault said he of you gentlemen who write in the buskin style that you give us rather the sentiments of such who behold tragical events than of such who bear a part in em themselves i would advise all who pretend this way to read shakespeare with care and they will soon be deterred from putting forth what is usually called tragedy the way of common writers in this kind is rather the description than the expression of sorrow there is no medium in these attempts and you must go to the very bottom of the heart or it is all mere language and the writer of such lines is no more a poet than a man is a physician for knowing the names of distempers without the causes of them men of sense are professed enemies to all such empty labors for he who petends to be sorrowful and is not is a wretch yet more contemptible than he who pretends to be mery and is not such a tragedian is only maudlin drunk the gentleman went on with much warmth but all he could say had little effect upon me but when i came hither i so far observed his counsel that i looked into shakespeare the tragedy i dipped into was harry the fourth in the scene where morton is preparing to tell northumberland of his sons death the old man does not give him time to speak but says the whiteness of thy cheeks is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand even such a man so faint so spiritless so dull so dead in look so woe  be gone drew priams curtain at the dead of night and would have told him half his troy was burnt but priam found the fire ere he his tongue and i my percys death ere thou reportst it   the image in this place is wonderfully noble and great yet this man in all this is but rising toward his great affliction and is still enough himself as you see to make a simile but when he is certain of his sons death he is lost to all patience and gives up all the regards of this life and since the last of evils is fallen upon him he calls for it upon all the world  now let not natures hand keep the wild blood confined let order die and let the world no longer be a stage to feed ontion in a lingering act but let one spirit of the firstborn cain reign in all bosoms that each heart being set on bloody courses the wide scene may end and darkness be the burier of the dead reading but this one scene has convinced me that he who describes the concern of great men must have a soul as noble and as susceptible of high thoughts as they whom he represents i shall therefore lay by my drama for some time and turn my thoughts to cares and griefs somewhat below that of heroes but no less moving a misfortune proper for me to take notice of has too lately happened the disconsolate maria has three days kept her chamber for the loss of the beauteous fidelia her lap dog lesbia her self did not shed more tears for her sparrow what makes her the more concerned is that we know not whether fidelia was killed or stolen but she was seen in the parlourwindow when the trainbands went by and never since whoever gives notice of her dead or alive shall be rewarded with a kiss of her lady  the tatler no     virtutem verba putant ut lucum ligna  hor from thursd july    to saturd july  0   0  from my own apartment july    this day i obliged pacolet to entertain me with matters which regarded persons of his own character and occupation we chose to take our walk on tower hill and as we were coming from thence in o der to stroll as far as garraways i obse ved two men who had but just landed coming from the waterside i thought there was something uncommon in their mien and aspect but though they seemed by their visage to be related yet was there a warmth in their manner as if they differed very much in their sentiments of the subject on which they were talking one of them seemed to have a natural confidence mixed with an ingenuous freedom in his gesture his dress very plain but very graceful and becoming the other in the midst of an overbearing carriage betrayed by frequently looking round him a suspicion that he was not enough regarded by those he met or that he feared they would make some attack upon him this person was much taller than his companion and added to that height the advantage of a feather in his hat and heels to his shoes so monstrously high that he had three or four times fallen down had he not been supported by his friend they made a full stop as they came within a few yards of the place where we stood the plain gentleman bowed to pacolet the other looked on him with some displeasure upon which i asked him who they both were when he thus informed me of their persons and circumstances  you may remember isaac that i have often told you there are beings of a superior rank to mankind who frequently visit the habitations of men in order to call them from some wrong pursuits in which they are actually engaged or divert them from methods which will lead them into errors for the future he that will carefully reflect upon the occurrences of his life will find he has been sometimes extricated out of difficulties and received favors where he could never have expected such benefits as well as met with cross events from some unseen hand which have disappointed his best laid designs such accidents arrive from the interventions of aerial beings as they are benevolent or hurtful to the nature of man and attend his steps in the tracts of ambition of business and of pleasure before i ever appeared to you in the manner i do now i have frequently followed you in your evening walks and have often by throwing some accident in your way as the passing by of a funeral or the appearance of some other solemn object given your imagination a new turn and changed a night you had destined to mirth and jollity into an exercise of study and contemplation i was the old soldier who met you last summer in chelseafields and pretended that i had broken my woodenleg and could not get home but i snapd it short off on purpose that you might fall into the reflections you did on that subject and take me into your hack if you remember you made your self very merry on that fracture and asked me whether i thought i should next winter feel cold in the toes of that leg as is usually observed that those who lose limbs are sensible of pains in the extreme parts even after those limbs are cut off however my keeping you then in the story of the battle of the boin prevented an assignation which would have led you into more disasters than i then related  to be short those two persons you see yonder are such as i am they are not real men but are mere shades and figures one is named alethes the other verisimilis their office is to be the guardians and representatives of conscience and honor they are now going to visit the several parts of the town to see how their interests in the world decay or flourish and to purge themselves from the many false imputations they daily meet with in the commerce and conversation of men you observed verisimilis frowned when he first saw me what he is provoked at is that i told him one day though he strutted and dressed with so much ostentation if he kept himself within his own bounds he was but a lacquey and wore only that gentlemans livery whom he is now with this frets him to the heart for you must know he has pretended a long time to set up for himself and gets among a crowd of the more unthinking part of mankind who take him for a person of the first quality though his introduction into the world was wholly owing to his present companion  this encounter was very agreeable to me and i was resolved to dog them and desired pacolet to accompany me i soon perceived what he told me in the gesture of the persons for when they looked at each other in discourse the welldressd man suddenly cast down his eyes and discovered that the other had a painful superiority over him after some further discourse they took leave the plain gentleman went down toward thames street in order to be present at least at the oaths taken at the custom house and the other made directly for the heart of the city it is incredible how great a change there immediately appeared in the man of honor when he got rid of his uneasy companion he adjusted the cock of his hat anew settled his swordknot and had an appearance that attracted a sudden inclination for him and his interests in all who beheld him for my part said i to pacolet i cannot but think you are mistaken in calling this person of the lower quality for he looks much more like a gentleman than the other dont you observe all eyes are upon him as he advances how each sex gazes at his stature aspect address and motion pacolet only smiled and shaked his head as leaving me to be convinced by my own further observation we kept on our way after him till we came to exchangealley where the plain gentleman again came up to the other and they stood together after the manner of eminent merchants as if ready to receive application but i could observe no man talk to either of them the one was laughed at as a fop and i heard many whispers against the other as a whimsical sort of fellow and a great enemy to trade they crossed cornhill together and came into the full change where some bowed and gave themselves airs in being known to so fine a man as verisimilis who they said had great interest in all princes courts and the other was taken notice of by several as one they had seen somewhere long before one more particularly said he had formerly been a man of consideration in the world but was so unlucky that they who dealt with him by some strange infatuation or other had a way of cutting off their own bills and were prodigiously slow in improving their stock but as much as i was curious to observe the reception these gentlemen met with upon change i could not help being interrupted by one that came up toward us to whom every body made their compliments he was of the common height and in his dress there seemed to be great care to appear no way particular except in a certain exact and feat manner of behavior and circumspection he was wonderfully careful that his shoes and clothes should be without the least speck upon them and seemed to think that on such an accident depended his very life and fortune there was hardly a man on change who had not a note upon him and each seemed very well satisfied that their money lay in his hands without demanding payment i asked pacolet what great merchant that was who was so universally addressed to yet made too familiar an appearance to command that extraordinary deference pacolet answered this person is the demon or genius of credit his name is umbra if you observe he follows alethes and verisimilis at a distance and indeed has no foundation for the figure he makes in the world but that he is thought to keep their cash though at the same time none who trust him would trust the other for a groat as the company rolled about the three specters were jumbled into one place when they were so and all thought there was an alliance between them they immediately drew upon them the business of the whole change but their affairs soon increased to such an unweildy bulk that alethes took his leave and said he would not engage further than he had an immediate fund to answer verisimilis pretended that though he had revenues large enough to go on his own bottom yet it was below one of his family to condescend to trade in his own name therefore he also retired i was extremely troubled to see the glorious mart of london left with no other guardian but him of credit but pacolet told me that traders had nothing to do with the honor or conscience of their correspondents provided they supported a general behavior in the world which could not hurt their credit or their purses for said he you may in this one tract of building of london and westminster see the imaginary motives on which the greatest affairs move as well as in rambling over the face of the earth for though alethes is the real governor as well as legislator of mankind he has very little business but to make up quarrels and is only a general referree to whom every man pretends to appeal but is satisfied with his determinations no further than they promote his own interest hence it is that the soldier and the courtier model their actions according to verisimiliss manner and the merchant according to that of umbra among these men honor and credit are not valuable possessions in themselves or pursued out of a principle of justice but merely as they are serviceable to ambition and to commerce but the world will never be in any manner of order or tranquillity till men are firmly convinced that conscience honor and credit are all in one interest and that without the concurrence of the former the latter are but impositions upon our selves and others the force these delusive words have is not seen in the transactions of the busy world only but also have their tyranny over the fair sex were you to ask the unhappy lais what pangs of reflection preferring the consideration of her honor to her conscience has given her she could tell you that it has forced her to drink up half a gallon this winter of tom dassapass potions that she still pines away for fear of being a mother and knows not but the moment she is such she shall be a murderess but if conscience had as strong a force upon her mind as honor the first step to her unhappy condition had never been made she had still been innocent as she is beautiful were men so enlightened and studious of their own good as to act by the dictates of their reason and reflection and not the opinion of others conscience would be the steady ruler of humane life and the words truth law reason equity and religion would be but synonymous terms for that only guide which makes us pass our days in our own favor and approbation  the tatler no    quicquid agunt homines nostri farrago libelli  from saturd july  0 to tuesd aug     0  whites chocolatehouse august   the impo ition of honest names and words upon improper subjects has made so regular a confusion amongst us that we are apt to sit down with our errors well enough satisfied with the methods we are fallen into without attempting to deliver ou selves from the tyranny under which we are reduced by such innovations of all the laudable motives of humane life none has suffered so much in this kind as love under which revered name a brutal desire called lust is frequently concealed and admitted though they differ as much as a matron from a prostiture or a companion from a buffoon philander the other day was bewailing this misfortune w much indignation and upbraided me for have g some time since quoted those excellent lines of the satyrist to an exact perfection they have brought the action love the passion is forgot   how could you said he leave such a hint so coldly how could aspasia and semphronia enter into your imagination at the same time and you never declare to us the different reception you gave em  the figures which the ancient mythologists and poets put upon love and lust in their writings are very instructive love is a beauteous blind child adorned with a quiver and a bow which he plays with and shoots around him without design or direction to intimate to us that the person beloved has no intention to give us the anxieties we meet with but that the beauties of a worthy object are like the charms of a lovely infant they cannot but attract your concern and fondness though the child so regarded is as insensible of the value you put upon it as it is that it deserves your benevolence on the other side the sages figured lust in the form of a satyr of shape part humane part bestial to signify that the followers of it prostitute the reason of a man to pursue the appetites of a beast this satyr is made to haunt the paths and coverts of the woodnymphs and shepherdesses to lurk on the banks of rivulets and watch the purling streams as the resorts of retired virgins to show that lawless desire tends chiefly to prey upon innocence and has something so unnatural in it that it hates its own make and shuns the object it loved as soon as it has made it like it self love therefore is a child that complains and bewails its inability to help it self and weeps for assistance without an immediate reflection or knowledge of the food it wants lust a watchful thief which seizes its prey and lays snares for its own relief and its principal object being innocence it never robs but it murders at the same time  from this idea of a cupid and a satyr we may settle our notion of these different desires and accordingly rank their followers aspasia must therefore be allowed to be the first of the beauteous order of love whose unaffected freedom and conscious innocence give her the attendance of the graces in all her actions that awful distance which we bear toward her in all our thoughts of her and that cheerful familiarity with which we approach her are certain instances of her being the truest object of love of any of her sex in this accomplished lady love is the constant effect because it is never the design yet though her mien carries much more invitation than command to behold her is an immediate check to loose behavior and to love her is a liberal education for it being the nature of all love to create an imitation of the beloved person in the lover a regard for aspasia naturally produces decency of manners and good conduct of life in her admirers if therefore the giggling leucippe could but see her train of fops assembled and aspasia move by em she would be mortified at the veneration with which she is beheld even by leucippes own unthinking equipage whose passions have long taken leave of their understandings  as charity is esteemed a conjunction of the good qualities necessary to a virtuous man so love is the happy composition of all the accomplishments that make a fine gentleman the motive of a mans life is seen in all his actions and such as have the beauteous boy for their inspirer have a simplicity of behavior and a certain evenness of desire which burns like the lamp of life in their bosoms while they who are instigated by the satyr are ever tortured by jealousies of the object of their wishes often desire what they scorn and as often consciously and knowingly embrace where they are mutually indifferent  florio the generous husband and limberham the kind keeper are noted examples of the different effects which these desires produce in the mind amanda who is the wife of florio lives in the continual enjoyment of new instances of her husbands friendship and sees it the end of all his ambition to make her life one series of pleasure and satisfaction and amandas relish of the goods of life is all that makes em pleasing to florio they behave themselves to each other when present with a certain apparent benevolence which transports above rapture and they think of each other in absence with a confidence unknown to the highest friendship their satisfactions are doubled their sorrows lessened by participation  on the other hand corinna who is the mistress of limberham lives in constant torment her equipage is an old woman who was what corinna is now an antiquated footman who was pimp to limberhams father and a chambermaid who is limberhams wench by fits out of a principle of politics to make her jealous and watchful of corinna under this guard and in this conversation corinna lives in state the furniture of her habitation and her own gorgeous dress make her the envy of all the strolling ladies in the town but corinna know she her self is but part of limberhams household stuff and is as capable of being disposed of elsewhere as any other moveable but while her keeper is persuaded by his spies that no enemy has been within his doors since his last visit no persian prince was ever so magnificently bountiful a kind look or falling tear is worth a piece of brockade a sigh is a jewel and a smile is a cupboard board of plate all this is shared between corinna and her guard in his absence with this great economy and industry does the unhappy limberham purchase the constant tortures of jealousy the favor of spending his estate and the opportunity of enriching one by whom he knows he is hated and despised these are the ordinary and common evils which attend

of albemarle is appointed governor of the town soon after the surrender there arose a dispute about a considerable work which was asserted by the allies to be part of the town and by the french to belong to the citadel it is said monsieur de survill was so ingenuous as to declare he thought it t be comprehended within the limits of the town but monsieur de mesgrigny governor of the citadel was of a contrary opinion it is reported that this affair occasioned great difficulties which ended in a capitulation for the citadel i self the principal article of which is that i shall be surrendered on the  th of september next in case they are not in the mean time relieved this circumstance gives foundation to believe that the enemy have acted in this manner rather from some hopes they conceive of a treaty of peace before that time than any expectation from their army which has retired toward their former works between lens and la bassee these advices add that his excellency the czarish ambassador has communicated to the states general and the foreign ministers residing at the hague a copy of a letter from his masters camp which gives an account of the entire defeat of the swedish

affection he sighed not for delia for chloris for chloe for betty nor my lady nor for the ready chambermaid nor distant baroness woman was his mistress and the whole sex his seraglio his form was always irresistible and if we consider that not one of five hundred can bear the least favor from a lady without being exalted above himself if also we must allow that a smile from a sidebox has made jack spruce half mad we cannot think it wonderful that orlandos repeated conquests touched his brain so it certainly did and orlando became an enthusiast in love and in all his address contracted something out of the ordinary course of breeding and civility however powerful as he was he would still add to the advantages of his person that of a profession which the ladies always favor and immediately commenced soldier thus equipped for love and honor our hero seeks distant climes and adventures and leaves the despairing nymphs of great britain to the courtship of beaus and witlings till his return his exploits in foreign nations and courts have not been regularly enough communicated unto us to report em with that veracity which we profess in our narrations but after many feats of arms which those who were witnesses to them have suppressed out of envy but which we have had faithfully related from his own mouth in our public streets orlando returns home full but not loaded with years beaus born in his absence made it their business to decry his furniture his dress his manner but all such rivalry he suppressed as the philosopher did the sceptick who argued there was no such thing as motion by only moving the beauteous villar j who only was formed for his paramour became the o of his affection his first speech to he was as follows  madam it is not only that nature has made us two the most accomplished of each sex and minted to us to obey her dictates in becoming one but  there is also an ambition in following the mighty persons you have favored where king and heroes as great as alexander or such as could personate alexander have bowed permit your general to lay his laurels  according to milton the fair with conscious majesty approved his pleaded reason    fortune having now supplied orlando with necessaries for his high taste of gallantry and pleasure his equipage and economy had something in them more sumptuous and gallant than could be received in our degenerate age therefore his figure though highly graceful appeared so exotic that it assembled all the britons under the age of sixteen who saw his grandeur to follow his chariot with shouts and acclamations which he regarded with the contempt which great minds affect in the midst of applauses i remember i had the honor to see him one day stop and call the youths about him to whom he spoke as follows  good bastards  go to school and dont lose your time in following my wheels i am loath to hurt you because i know not but you are all my own offspring harkee you sirrah with the white hair i am sure you are mine there is half a crown tell your mother this with the half crown i gave her when i got you comes to five shillings thou have cost me all that and yet thou art good for nothing why you young dogs did you never see a man before never such a one as you noble general replied a truant from westminster sirrah i believe thee there is a crown for thee drive on coachman  this vehicle though sacred to love was not adorned with doves such an hieroglyphick denoted too languishing a passion orlando therefore gave the eagle as being of a constitution which inclined him rather to seize his prey with talons than pine for it with murmurs  from my own apartment august   i have received the following letter from mr powell of the bath who i think runs from the point between us which i leave the whole world to judge  to isaac bickerstaff esquire sir having a great deal of more advantageous business at present on my hands i thought to have deferred answering your tatler of the   st instant till the company was gone and season over but having resolved not to regard any impertinences of your paper except what relate particularly to me i am the more easily induced to answer you as i shall find time to do it first pa tly lest you should think your self neglected which i have reason to believe you would take heinously ill secondly partly because it will increase my fame and consequently my audience when all the quality shall see with how much wit and raillery i show you  i dont care a farthing for you thirdly partly because being without books if i dont show much learning it will not be imputed to my having none  i have traveled italy france and spain and fully comprehend whatever any german arrist in the world can do yet cannot i imagine why you should endeavor to disturb the repose and plenty which though unworthy i enjoy at this place it cannot be that you take offense at my prologues and epilogues which you are pleased to miscall foolish and abusive no no until you give a better i shall not forbear thinking that the true reason of your picking a quarrel with me was because it is more agreeable to your principles as well as more to the honor of your ured victory to attack a governor mr isaac mr isaac i can see into a millstone as far as another as the saying is you  for sowing the seeds of sedition and bedience among my puppets and your eal for the good old cause would make you persuade punch to pull the string from his chops and not move his jaw when i have a mind he should harangue now i appeal to all men if this is not contrary to that uncontrollable unaccountable dominion which by the laws of nature i exercise over them for all sorts of wood and wire were made for the use and benefit of man i have therefore an unquestionable right to frame fashion and put them together as i please and having made them what they are my puppets are my property and therefore my slaves nor is there in nature any thing more just than the homage which is paid by a less to a more excellent being so that by the right therefore of a superior genius i am their supreme moderator although you would insinuate agreeably to your levelling principles that i am my self but a great puppet and can therefore have but a coordinate jurisdiction with them i suppose i have now sufficiently made it appear that i have a paternal right to keep a puppetshow and this right i will maintain in my prologues on all occasions  and therefore if you write a defense of your self against this my selfdefence i admonish you to keep within bounds for every day will not be so propitious to you as the   th of april and perhaps my resentment may get the better of my generosity and i may no longer scorn to fight one who is not my equal with unequal weapons there are such things as scandulums magnatums therefore take heed hereafter how you write such things as i cannot easily answer for that will put me in a passion  i order you to handle only these two propositions to which our dispute may be reduced the first whether i have not an absolute power whenever i please to light a pipe with one of punchs legs or warm my fingers with his whole carcass the second whether the devil would not be in punch should he by word or deed oppose my sovereign will and pleasure and then perhaps i may if i can find leisure for it give you the trouble of a second letter  but if you intend to tell me of the original of puppetshows and the several changes and revolutions that have happened in them since thespis and i dont care who that is noli me tangere i have solemnly engaged to say nothing of what i cannot approve or if you talk of certain contracts with the mayor and burgesses or fees to the constables for the privilege of acting i will not write one single word about any such matters but shall leave you to be mumbled by the learned and very ingenious author of a late book who knows very well what is to be said and done in such cases he is now shuffling the cards and dealing to timothy but if he wins the game i will send him to play at backgammon with you and then he will satisfy you that deuceace makes five  and so submitting my self to be tried by my country and allowing any jury of    good men and true to be that country not excepting any unless mr isaac bickerstaff to be of the panel for you are neither good nor true i bid you heartily farewell and am  sir your loving friend powell bath july     the end of the first volume a faithful index of the dull as well as ingenious passages in the tatlers vol i a
