bade his minstrels sound soft slumbrous lydian airs to sooth his rest the author has ventured to take some hints in the following lines from lucretiuss description of the uncivilized state of man which is one of the finest pieces of poetry extant glandiferas inter curabant corpora quercus  quod sol atque imbres dederant quod terra crearat sponte sua satis id placebat pectora donum  glandiferas
