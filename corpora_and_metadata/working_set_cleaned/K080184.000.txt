 as well as by sympathy etc  as performed by the rev john bell member of the philosophical harmonic society of france fellow correspondent to the museum at paris and the only person authorized to teach and practice that science in great britain ireland etc  the souls dark cottage battered and decayed lets in new light through chinks which time has made waller dublin printed for and to be had of the author also of mr butler no   graftonstreet and other booksellers  mdcclxxxviii  price one british shilling  preface i was not initiated in the science of animal electricity and magnetism until i was introduced to the augustine convent at paris where the celebrated father harvier attended daily a great number of patients of every rank and degree gratis i was instantly struck with astonishment by the magnetical somnambulism which i saw constantly performing before crowds of the most respectable and dignified clergy who assembled every day all of whom were thoroughly convinced that the art was practiced by men of integrity without any deceit i was soon after presented to the famous and learned marquis de puysegur and to several other noblemen distinguished in the literary world who took delight in showing those phenomena to their friends scarcely had i acquired a knowledge of the science before i put one person in a state of somnambulism which made me exult on the success as my tutors in the science were present viz general meziere chevalier justamond who encouraged me to persevere i na little time i produced numbers who in that state answered my questions found out the diseases of the people present and prescribed infallible cures for them they are called malade medecin concerning whom i shall speak at large in my treatise upon the doctrine of somnambulism  that it is practicable to put certain persons into this state need be no longer doubted without touching or giving them any previous operation it is a matter strange to persons unacquainted with the science but that will vanish when the mind receives instruction and becomes familiar with it in order to the attainment of which i invite all persons of every sex rank and degree to come see and judge for themselves i shall soon publish one number on theory and another on the practice  an essay on the probabilities of electrical and magnetical somnambules or sleepwalkers of all the novelties which are created by animal electricity and magnetism somnambulism is doubtless the most interesting  by somnambulism is meant that peculiar state when the senses are suspended between sleeping and waking partaking of both and is also productive of many phoenomena which each are strangers to  the patient being reduced to a state of somnambulism without touching him is deaf to all that is near him motionless amidst the greatest motions he seems separated from nature as if it were to communicate only with the person who put him into that state  the latter owing to magnetisation alone has an intimate analogy with the patient by the means of a kind of an invisible leaver he causes him to move at his pleasure and such is the power of his influence that he not only makes himself understood by speaking and signs but even by the very thought itself and what is still more extraordinary the magnetiser can by a single contract communicate his faculty to other people and from that moment there is a constant communication between the somnambule and his new director  the patient being put into a state of somnambulism there is in him a want of organization which breaks the equilibrium of his senses so that some experience an extreme degradation whilst others acquire a prodigious degree of subtlety  thus some have their hearing entirely lost or weakened and their sight becomes prodigiously penetrating in others the privation both of sight and hearing are amply compensated by an incredible delicacy both of feeling and taste  and in many a sixth sense appears to declare itself by an extreme extent of the intellectual faculty far superior to the common altitude of the human mind  in a word the phoenomena attending on the state of somnambulism daily offer new subjects of astonishment even to those who ought to be more famiiar with them  it remains to consider whether those pretended phoenomena are such as is propagated or whether on the contrary they are nothing the but illusions kept up by the imposition of some ill designed persons and the credulity of others  for it is well known that the human mind naturally bent toward every thing mavelous eagerly seizes on whatever is flattering to the taste and there are exalted geniusses to be found that employ both their head and talents to realize mere chimeras  among the persons who have been witnesses to the singularities attending on somnambulism some struck with astonishment and admiration have given full credit to its influence and look on it as an irresistible proof of animal electricity and magnetism  others though convinced of the reality of its phoenomena are yet incredulous with regard to the cause which produced them they had rather suppose in this affair some secret spring productive of illusions and though incapable of comprehending those means of intelligence they have nevertheless supposed their existence alleging for example those cunning tricks which a subtle philosopher caumus and pinetty made use to astonish all paris and london during many years  as to the physicians most of them have disdained to prove witnesses to the essects of magnetical somnambulism under the pretense that it was sufficient for them such a phoenomenon was contrary to those notions consecrated in physic and physiology they have considered those pretended marvels as mere chimeras unworthy a serious examination  there was even a learned body who went so far as to forbid their members to entertain the least doubt on the subject and expelled from their society whomsoever have given themselves up to the study of this new doctrine a decree of the faculty of paris      which is the same as they did for inoculation which is now adopted by them   however on the other hand magnetical somnambulism becomes daily more and more consistent a great number of people remarkable for their learning probity found judgment and sagacity certify beyond a doubt the reality of magnetical somnambulism and that contradiction of respectable authorities on both sides leave the public in suspense who to take a decisive part in the contest impatiently wait until the matter is more fully investigated  the following impartial reflections may serve to fix the opinion of impartial people on the subject of magnetical somnambulism to treat this object with the more success i think it is necessary to divide the discussion into three parts  the first point to be considered is to know in fact the public have been witnesses of phoenomena of some importance well deserving to excite their curiosity and of which the cause ought to be investigated  secondly suppose the effects spoken of deserved to be enquired into it is proper to examine whether they cannot reasonably be suspected of artifice  lastly admitting it impossible to find out the artifice it will remain to examine whether they are contrary to common notions already received   st are magnetical somnambulism phoenomena of such an importance as to deserve the curiosity of both the public and the learned  the object of this question is i believe very plain and obvious i mean to say that previously to our being at the trouble of examining whether magnetical somnambulism be an illusion or reality we must establish that there exist at least seemingly some singularities which concern both the public good and the improvement of learning  many people however might have a right to doubt it because they had no occasion to know the truth of the assertion they have a right to require to be satisfied previously to the discussion of the two following propositions viz that there are either at paris dublin etc in the provinces or any where else some people who being naturally forced into a state of sleep really offer the phoenomena which we are about to examine  for if it was not certain that such a scene is not to be met with somewhere it would be a loss of time to enquire into its principle  it is therefore a preliminary obligation for any body else to establish well the existence of magnetical somnambulism whether right or wrong  this point was for a long time a matter of general incredulity they plainly denied that there were any such individuals existing any where and the very discourse held on the subject was looked upon merely as a fable to amuse the public  the first writing which treated of magnetical somnambulists was if i am not mistaken a letter from mr cloquet paymaster of rents at soissons who relating what he had seen at buzancis treatment by the marquis de puysegur insinuated something which seemed to characterise magnetical somnambulism  since that letter a gentleman whose candor is above all suspicion has consigned in a writing which is in every respect interesting several phoenomena he had observed in puzoneis treatment still more wonderful than those which  cloquet had given a sketch of  the perusal of this performance having inspired some people of the first rank with the eager desire of being witnesses to a like somnambulism the author of the above found an opportunity of gratifying their curiosity at paris in the winter of       more than  000 people have been at liberty to see those phoenomena true or false of which notice was taken both in the national and foreign prints these somnambules underwent repeated trials which all met with more or less success  besides those mentioned many more were made at paris or in some other provinces this somnambulism example having induced the magnetisers to adhere to that part of magnetism they applied themselves to it with more zeal as it seemed to be a sure way toward a remedy thus the concern of magnetism and that of the patient uniting both to prescribe that mode of proceeding it is become the common object of all magnetisers attempts and in all treatment they gloried in showing some patient more or less improved  it is evident then that there exists many individuals struck with a seeming somnambulism and i begin to establish the question in order to proceed methodically after settling constant and notorious facts which might lead to infallible consequences  it is then certain and indisputable that there are pretended somnambules which offer wonderful phoenomena to the spectators as compensative gratification for excited curiosity  now the question is to know what opinion we should form concerning those somnambules if it be not a feigned state by the means of which they endeavor to impose on the credulity of those whom they are surrounded by   d how far are magnetical somnambules to be believed  among the somnambules i am here speaking of i do not include that multitude of persons of both sexes among the common people who are to be seen at some impostors and may reasonably be suspected to perform somnambulism through imitation or to make themselves interesting and others who are paid for it  it is a misfortune constantly attending on good things that they can never be preserved in their native purity nor escape that mixture which malice or cupidity seldom fail to blend with them  those who either through prejudice or interest endeavor to display the discovery take care to examine it on that side only which seems to convey an idea of apparent quackery and never fail to present it to the public in that view  but those who sincerely wish for information pay but little regard to such a consideration and throwing aside quackery and exaggerations carefully penetrate as far as the principle itself thus a botanist desirous of procuring the fruit of an almond to be enabled to discern its true quality is not discouraged by the putrid flesh which surrounds it but cheerfully lopping all nauseous superfluities he finds at last the fruit which is to be the rule of his study  in that manner should every unbiassed man act who sincerely seeks for truth without having interest or design to destroy it  let us contemptuously disregard those suspicious apparent somnambules and attend to those who by their civil existence their character manner etc are above suspicion and in whom besides somnambulism the science is portrayed and brought to the highest degree of perfection  i think those ought to be chosen among patients in whom somnambulism appears to be in a higher degree of perfection and such a caution is in my opinion very material  in fact the more imperfect the somnambule is the easier it is to impose if he badly answers your signs and follows your motions in an untoward and ill contrived manner he apologizes by saying he is not as yet arrived to a state of perfect somnambulism and the observator who really conceives that such a state must have its degrees is puzzled on account of his not knowing whether the bad success he has experienced is to be attributed to the untowardness of the somnambule or the imperfection of his state  but when i fix on a somnambule recommended as a perfect being it is evident that this task is very painful in that case there is neither excuse nor pretense the observator is easy and somnambulism has a trial to undergo which is to prove either his shame or his triumph  such perfect somnambules have not been wanting last year in france and among those who have tried my experiments there is one with whom i staid more than half an hour and who has before me and at my pleasure executed such motions as i prescribed him  being at my own disposal without witnesses and contradictors left nothing untried to discover the fraud if there had been in the case but the swiftness of his evolutions the precision of his movements a vast number of facts which it would be too tedious to relate disconcerted all my attempts  many other experiments which had their intended effects with regard to other perfect somnambules have all given me the same satisfaction  there are at paris and in the provinces more than  00 persons who are in the same predicament  therefore to overthrow the consequences resulting from such experiments there is no other resource left but to persevere in giving out that it was a deceitful trick on the part of somnambules  but such a supposition carries with it the greatest difficulties and is accompanied by improbabilities still more shocking than somnambulism itself  to admit that the phoenomena in question are the result of imposition two things are absolutely required  st somnambules must have an intention of deceiving  d they must be endowed with an address to do it but we must first confess that among those who have already been or are daily inspired with somnambulism there are many above all kind of suspicion they are respectable women of family men of stability and known integrity people of a plain and simple turn of mind children etc in whom we cannot reasonably suppose to exist any design or interest to seign a like situation   should they be led by any faction or the intention of performing animal electricity and magnetism with any seeming reality but most of them have no concern at all as to the fortune of animal electricity and magnetism nay many of them had no notion of it at the moment they were confirming magnetical sleep  shall it be said that it is possible some of those individuals are encouraged by the partisans of animal electricity and magnetism and that they are but a mere instrument in the hands of the latter to favor the success of that system  but for what purpose should the partisans of animal electricity and magnetism have recourse to so capricious a stratagem the supposition would at the best be admissible if somnambulism had originally been announced as a necessary effect of magnetism so that they must have been forced to resign animal electricity and magnetism had they been deprived of the resource tendered them by somnambulism but the case is very different  animal electricity and magnetism was originally announced without the attendance of somnambulism this singularity is a later discovery the result of the habitual practice of magnetism even now there are many magnetisers who do not look on somnambulism as being an effential part of the science but only as an accessory which may indifferently be united to or separated from magnetism  from whence it plainly follows that if the partisans of animal electricity and magnetism were in want of a resource to impose on the public surely they must have been very destitute of penetration to embrace so strange a maneuver which carried with it a prodigious complication of springs and insuperable difficulties in its execution  and that had it been an artifice it would have been sufficient to deter every honest man from entering or associating with it  they must then have only dealt with and chosen people of profligate manners and of the worst sort to invest them with that confidence at the risk of seeing it betrayed and made public on the very next day that is not all they must have found in those individuals an extraordinary address to act so difficult a part and deceive the experiments of an enlightened and incredulous people at whose tribunal appearance must be made  had things been thus transacted somnambulism could not have lasted long and far from gaining credit time would soon have discovered the illusion and deceit by the difficulty of finding actors capable of perpetrating the imposture but the contrary has happened every day somnambulism gets new partisans and the credit which it constantly obtains partisans and the credit which it constantly obtains plainly contradicts every idea of deceit  patients are daily seen in that condition in the very bosom of their family under the inspection of their nearest relations and those who are the most interested to verify their situation  who could believe that such patients surrounded with the very horrors of death and most painful sufferings could dissemble for the sole interest of magnetism their relations fathers husbands wives children  are they then concerned in the piot  shall it be said that their illness is feigned it is another supposition no less admissible for besides that it is no easy matter to feign a malignant fever a fiuxion dropsy and other diseases of that kind there are some so well averred that no man in his senses could possibly doubt their existence  another consideration may be added here that is even in supposing that a healthy man could long act the part of a sick man or the patient take upon himself to act the somnambule and that people hidden before the curtain should preside over this mummery i maintain would be impossible in the execution and whatever address may be supposed to exist on both sides the deceit must soon be discovered and indeed after a few moments i would defy the most nimble buffoon the most expert of all and the most inured to bodily exercises to assect somnambulism before scientific persons or execute any such thing as is observed among the somnambules whom i am now treating of i defy any one to remain during eight or ten hours having his eyes shut and his eyelids quite close together without one eyelid separating from the other during that period of time such a perseverance seems to be much above the reach of human power and patience who is the man that could remain five or six hours in a motionless attitude without showing the least sensation of what passes round him inaccessible to every emotion and all the sudden and unforeseen shocks of noise which his attention shall at periods be gratified with who is that histrion subtle enough to imitate with his eyes closely shut the different signs which will be presented him and describe the lines which will be traced with a justness and acuteness that no interval shall be found between the order and the compliance a few experiments of this nature would be sufficient to discourage the most consummate saltimbank and make him give up his undertaking in two hours time  now when we see the same effects constantly repeated without the least effort and multiplied in the presence of a prodigious number of persons of all sexes age and rank we must necessarily acknowledge that they act through a natural impulse without any assistance of art for it is well known that nature can easily perfect what is impossible for art to execute  thus physical probabilities concur with moral ones to establish the reality of magnetical somnambulism  somnambulism cannot be rejected without supposing it a deceit too palpable to credit and in whatever manner you act it will prove a phoenomenon either moral or physical and i confess the latter is by far easier to be conceived than the former for a natural phoenomenon after all is susceptible of an explanation and the plot of a deceit without interest and motive whatever is no less complicated in its execution  a number of people are to be found over whom such considerations striking as they are can never triumph whatever difficulties may be encountered with to make those stratagems succeed they suppose that such an address takes place because they say in the things hurtful to reason the authority of testimonies is of no value  that evident impossibility is a kind of resentment on that part of the public who have not seen the phoenomena in question and inspire those who have actually seen them with a certain degree of diffidence  if a common fact consistent with the usual proceedings of nature was only agitated it is in general confessed that there would be more proofs than requisite to establish its credit on bare words and without having seen it but as to a phoenomenon so little consistent with nature which is neither explicable nor conceivable and overthrows all received notions we are authorized not only to refuse the testimony of others but even that of our own senses it is after such an absurdity that many learned have been heard to say that they would not believe it if they saw it  now then it remains to consider whether magnetical somnambulism and the several phoenomena usually attending on it are as inconceivable as those gentlemen would insinuate  are magnetical somnambulisms phoenomena repugnant to the order of nature  physicians by affecting the greatest incredulity in magnetical somnambulism under the mere pretense that such phoenomenon is inconceivable give no satisfactory account of their disbelief because that the identical difficulty they attempt to condemn cannot withhold the victorious testimonies which militate in favor of magnetical somnambulism  the difficulty of conceiving a phoenomenon by no mean destroys its reality we are surrounded with a multitude of natural marvels which no one has the least doubt about though they are incomprehensible for it is evident that nature has prescribed certain limits which are inaccessible to human conception  but perhaps some will say from such a mode of reasoning it will then follow that we must give credit to every absurdity we hear and believe the greatest oddities in the world and those who will exact such a belief shall only have to invoke the great power of nature and the immense extent of its resources  that way of reasoning would deprive arts of their rules and banish principles from sciences in order to make room for rash assertions etc our learning instead of being susceptible of improvement and enlargement would fall again into chaos and confusion  but that objection is by no means applicable for the question is not to admit a phoenomenon under the single consideration that nothing is impossible to nature it is on the contrary recommended that we should submit to the trial of contradiction experience and reasoning itself a fact certified by a multitude of persons of every denomination who have been eye witnesses to the same  thus till now presumption is still in favor of somnambulism since being grounded on the strongest considerations those considerations are neither overcome nor weakened by the pretended improbability urged against them  but what will then be said if we were to discover that magnetical somnambulism far from offering to the learned an inconceivable phoenomenon incompatible with all notions admitted both in physic and physiology it is on the contrary a natural consequence from those very principles accessory of the common notions with which it is blended and united in a very natural manner  it is what i propose to demonstrate and in order to proceed methodically i shall first successively examine the two articles of magnetical somnambulism which have excited the reclamation of the doctors  st the facility of putting a patient in a state of somnambulism  d the phoenomena usually attending on such a state  article  st the somnambulisms communication is in the order of the already admitted notions in physiology  it is something remarkable to hear many learned men obstinately declare it to be absolutely impossible for a patient to be put in a state of somnambulism by any art whatever when we consider that it is one of the favorite maxims in physic that by the assistance of art all natural revolutions may be imitated in the human body it is on that principle that the partisans of inoculation chiefly relied to defend both the practice and success of that proceeding  all physicians agree that the art of inoculation consists in preventing by a factitious indisposition in an individual the real one which nature would have soon or late occasioned  it is still according to the same maxim that physicians attempt to inoculate many kinds of distempers either to prevent them or to make them serve as a counterpoise to other diseases and now the art of curing one disease by another is esteemed in medicine as a complete knowledge of physic  the case being thus and since it is acknowledged that nature is liable to imitation by introducing such or such maladies in the human body is it so strange so inconceivable that somnambulism should also be transmissible through artificial means  somnambulism is by physicians entitled a disease it is therefore in that quality as in the number of those revolutions which the power of art introduces to that effect one more step is to be made in the career of distempers and inoculation but such an extension far from contradicting the principles of physiology only confirms them  it is expected however that physicians will oppose this similitude in establishing some differences and distinctions nay they will perhaps forget themselves so far as to take somnambulism from the number of maladies by disowning their nosologists in this point  that no pretense may be left for subterfuge we shall be intent on maladies and discourse solely on sleep  neither doctor or natural philosophers have as yet been able to explain the cause of sleep nor the manner by which it is produced  whatever has been said on the subject offers nothing but mere conjectures the work of imagination one thing only is certain that sleep comes on whenever the body is in any disposition to produce it and is put in such a disposition by the assistance of art such is the evident effect of narcotical piants as opium cockleweed etc  now if there exists any art whatever conducive to put the body in a disposition to sleep it is not surprising at all that magnetical proceedings might also produce the same effect will they say that there is a want of similitude because in magnetical proceedings neither decoctions nor infusions are employed to create sleep i answer that there is no need at all to have recourse either to drink or any drug whatever to convert any one into the state of sleep the same effect is produced by a multitude of other means and proceedings and it is even one of the particular singularities inherent to sleep that it is produced by an infinitely different number of causes and which are all contrary to each other for example if excessive heat causes sleep it is also the effect of excessive cold soldiers have been seen to fall asleep on the snow and even perish with cold in that state of drowsiness  if gentle and soft friction invite to sleep exquisite sufferings act the same which is proved by the example of those wretches who being put to the torture fall asleep at the very moment of their most poignant sufferings others are said to have yielded to sleep while lying on the wheel  gemelli carreri relates that when in china he traveled with a tartar who every night was obliged in order to procure sleep to desire somebody to beat him for a while on the belly as they do a drum  hunger and the excess of food fatigue and rest and cool and warm refreshments likewise produce sleep it is also the result of the increase or decrease of the blood running in the brain it is the effect of bathing as well as bleeding fever which causes insomnies likewise creates drowsiness a small difference in a dose of wine awakes or makes a man sleep it would be an endless task to sum up all the various cause which induce man to that state whether because these causes produce themselves or that many different combinations are likewise capable of producing sleep or because notwithstanding the seeming disserence the result is the same  but in both cases one must confess that the means productive of sleep are infinite and that we are unable to determine on their nature or quality this consideration alone doubtless suffices to destroy the improbability of a sleep arising from magnetical feelings  those means which at first seem so extraordinary appear far less mavelous when compared with others still more strange concerning which not a doubt can be reasonably entertained such as those as have just now been mentioned  the efficacy of simply touching to create sleep seems besides to be a necessary consequence flowing from the general law of nature that has designed the five senses to serve as an introduction to sleep if touching could not produce it it would be the only one deprived of that faculty  indeed if we consider but a moment the four other senses hearing smelling sight and taste we shall perceive in them as many conductors to sleep no one can deny but the ear is a very efficacious way to sleep the noise of a mill the murmur of a river the spouting of waters a lingering conversation the monotony of the voice a slow and melancholy music organize the body more or less quickly in a manner fit for sleep  the smell of aromatical and narcotical plants occasions a drowsiness and some chemists have in their works given the receipt of somniserous essences which criminals have often abused  taste is another introductor to sleep and medicine establishes those means in administering narcotical physics either to procure sleep to those who naturally want it or to render patients insensible to painful operations  it is to be observed that most of the drugs productive of that effect display their power before they have been decomposed in the stomach even before they are come down to it merely by contract of the palate or tongue which plainly shows that such an effect belongs to the taste  lastly the sight is no less productive of sleep too bright a light by inviting the eyelids to shut themselves insensibly encourages and causes sleep  it is also well known how far reading contributes to invite sleep many people never resist that impression and even they make upon occasion a sure resource of it  and it must not be said that sleep is then the effect of tediousenss since sleep is for the most part involuntary and comes on in the middle of the interesting lectures we could hear other people deliver without feeling the least propensity to sleep  it is then doubtless sight which in that case serves as a vehicle to sleep  from whence it follows that it is clearly proved that sleep comes in through five of our senses now that observation naturally leads us to think that touching is endowed with the like power because the constant uniformity which is visible in all nature does not permit us to suppose that sense alone would have been made particular exception of  moreover a little reflection will show that the above faculty ought to belong to feeling more specially than any other sense it is agreed that generally speaking there is but one sense which is feeling and that the other four are only a modification of it  the sight hearing taste and smelling produce no sensation in us but through the means of contact the light sound savours and smell only act upon us by shaking the nervous tufts of our organs and such a shaking can never be obtained before they have touched them this is an uncontrovertible truth  feeling properly so called only differs from other senses by its great energy and vast extent the other senses occupy but a very narrow place and are only susceptible of a local impression but feeling by experience is spread over all the surface of the body and this is sufficient to show that feeling ought to enjoy in a superior manner the faculty of opening a way to sleep for being the chief sense and almost to say the principal one from which the others are derived how is it possible to conceive it deprived of a power which the subordinate senses are endowed with  lastly it is so certain that sleep is introduced by feeling that the faculty prescribe opium taken in topic and applied to the skin which really produces sleep the touching we may even recollect on that account manner of touching made use of in india by which means slaves procure sleep to their masters which is called masser of an organized body may then without any marvel occasion sleep and it is the point i want to clear and answer fully the objection of improbability but will they say supposing the magnetisers to be endowed with the power of producing sleep there is not the like reason to lead us to think that they can likewise produce somnambulism  the answer is plain and obvious  somnambulism itself is nothing else but a mere modification of sleep there is no somnambulism without sleep  we might even add that there is no sleep without somnambulism and that every man is born a somnambule  this proposition which is apparently a paradox is no less incontestable provided too much extent is not allowed to the meaning of the word somnambule perfect sleep is a time of rest during which sensations are reduced to a state of concentration which discovers seemingly no other sign of life but respiration and the motion of the pulse  imperfect sleep is that in which such a concentration is not complete so that it still leaves some access for the interior display of organs we seldom enjoy the former kind of sleep  in a sound and natural sleep the person whose mental powers were absolutely in suspension preserves still a more or less active portion of watching by the means of which diverse motions are performed who does not know that during our very sleep the body is agitated and combines itself in order to choose an advantageous position the hand is continually assisting the incommoded parts property adjusts the bed clothes destroys insects etc all these things doubtless belong to the watch and of course constitute a kind of somnambulism for we must comprehend under that denomation the exercise of every motion whatever occasioned during sleep  most men carry still farther the effects of somnambulism since there are many people who speak during their sleep make different gestures hold discourses of a considerable length address those whom they think themselves in company with get out of their beds and in again etc  so common are such practices that they are to be met with almost in every house  whenever somnambulism acquires a more extended penetration it produces wonderful things  then the sleeper is seen writing working opening the doors lighting the fire ascending the tops of houses swimming over rivers currying horses etc  but you must observe that somnambulism in this last degree is no new state nor contrary to the nature of sleep it is singly a reinforced modification of a state natural to man and inherent to sleep which naturally leads us back to the following proposition that every sleeper is in the commencement of somnambulism that whoever gives himself up to sleep is in a near state of somnambulism which is to display itself in a more or less striking manner according to the physical constitution of the sleeper the nature of his distemper and especially according to the different causes which have produced preceded or accompanied his sleep  from thence it is easily conceived that a sick person already inclined either by his constitution or the nature of his disease to a somnambulism in its juvenile state is liable to receive with magnetical sleep a greater determination toward somnambulism  is such a state useful in curing the disease such a question is not now to be discussed whether somnambulism be salutary or not it is however certain that it is a dependent on sleep introduces itself with it and ought consequently to predominate more or less  there are people whose magnetical drowsiness is attended by no very striking signs of somnambulism who are only drowsy and possess a continual somnolency not insensible to any thing that may be transacted round them  others are only drowsy for a short time then awake and fall again into a state of drowsiness the nuances are infinitely multiplied from the very sleepers who display nothing but what usually appears in a common sleep to those who perform the wonderful things so much spoken of in all the world  it is those very marvels that remain to be explained for having fully proved that magnetical proceedings or a contact graduate and combined according to principles can produce sleep and then somnambulism i shall be obliged to reduce magnetism to that rule which is already known but the animal magnetisms adversaries will not fail to object that magnetical somnambulism extends still further by offering the spectacle of a somnambulism of which we can have no idea is attended with phoenomena never before observed in natural somnambulism  such is the last allegation which serves as a refuge to the incredulity of those who never saw any somnambule and the disbelief of them who had it in their power to see and be convinced but it will in a moment be deemed surprising to observe that magnetical somnambulism has nothing superior to the effects of natural somnambulism that on the contrary it exactly agrees with the phoenomena of the latter state which is nothing more than a more discovery and such a consideration might be by many people looked on as a victorious argument in favor of magnetical somnambulism  article  d magnetical somnambulisms phoenomena far from being inconceivable are on the contrary a necessary consequence of somnambulism  according to the virulent declamations thrown out against magnetical somnambulism representing it as a base and deceitful trick unworthy the least credit it would be natural to suppose that such phoenomena are without precedents and only concentered in magnetical somnambulism  such is the prevalent opinion with the public even among the sensible part composed of people no less remarkable for their virtues than their learning but who not being familiar with physiological phoenomena must necessarily have adopted that way of thinking  those very persons might perhaps have had a different opinion on that matter if it had been in their power to know that there exists in nature a state absolutely the same as that given out merely as a feigned one and that the same phoenomena which are in the one pronounced to be chimerical impossible and inadmissible are in the other looked upon as incontestable and certainly beyond any manner of doubt  such a circumstance makes a material difference for they only refuse to give credit to the phoenomena of magnetical somnambulism because reason will hardly admit of facts by which it is hurt and which are grounded on no precedents  but if credit ought to be given to natural somnambulism the same must be granted to magnetical somnambulism for it being proved that those phoenomena really exist with regard to one of these two species of somnambulism it would be to contend for contradictions sake only to deny the possibility of their existence in the other  we must then necessarily know that there exists a state of natural somnambulism acknowledged and awarded by the faculty during which sleepers execute things impossible for any man awake to perform  without entering into a detail of the singularities already observed on that account i shall only mention the phoenomena perfectly analogous to those observed among magnetical somnambules  nothing is more common than to see magnetical somnambules walk go toward other people speak to them come back to their places take a book paper ink in a word perform a prodigious number of things which supports the idea of perfect reason and sense  thus is the public justly incensed when any one presumes to insinuate that such persons are not in a state of sleep and that they neither see nor hear through their usual organs  some of those somnambules having their eyes open the spectators naturally thought they must make use of them and the faculty themselves have ridiculed this pretension that people could see without the use of their eyes and having their eyes open could not make use of them  but unhappily for them such a pusillanimous observation loses much of its strength when we consider that even our learned have consecrated that very truth in one of their books calculated to teach posterity the actual state of our knowledge open the encyclopedia and at the word somnambule you may read literally thus  people struck with somnambulism given up to a sound sleep walk talk write and perform many other actions as if they were awake nay even sometimes with more discernment and exactitude and afterward  some somnambules have their eyes open but do not seem to make use of them  the learned consequently for encyclopedia is their work are convinced plainly to believe with magnetisers that it is possible to see without the eyes assistance and that though the somnambule has his eyes open he does not make use of them  magnetisers have often observed that magnetical somnambulism displayed in many patients a wonderful subtlety of sight so far that they discern very delicate objects through a bandage or any other intermediate body  that proposition has not been more savourably received  they have laughed at the story of a magnetical somnambule who had written when his eyes were covered with a headband and corrected words erased letters to substitute others upon or near them  they said such a thing should be seen before it was believed and even after having really seen it they suspected the good faith of the somnambule so extraordinary the event appeared  but how could they forget that our learned had beforehand prepared us to believe those phoenomena by presenting them to us as a necessary consequence from somnambulism if you follow a somnambule says the already quoted article it is casy to perceive that his sleep so much alike when he is awake offers a prodigious number of wonderful things truth itself becomes incredible  the author despising the exaggerations often attending on such stories has only referred to notorious sacts of which the truth cannot even be suspected  it is after such a preamble that he relates the story of a young somnambule a clergyman and fellowstudent of the archbishop of bourdeaux that prelate used to go every night in that somnambules room as soon as he thought him asleep he remarked in particular that the person got up took paper composed and wrote sermons when he had finished a page he read it over and repeated it very loud if adds the author that action was done without the eyes assistance can it be called reading  the same clergyman with his eyes shut composed music a cane served him as a compass with it he traced at an equal distance the five necessary lines put in their stead the key flat sharp then marked the notes which he had first done all white and when he had finished in taking up again every one of them he made them black such as should have been so and wrote the words under  it once happened that he wrote them with too large characters so that they were not placed directly under their corresponding notes he soon perceived his mistake without the assistance of his eyes and in order to mend it he erased what he had just done by passing his hand over and made again lower that musical line with all possible precision  the prelate to whom we are indebted for these particulars having placed himself before the somnambule to be enabled to follow him with more application observed a very wonderful circumstance the young clergyman having put in some place of his sermon the words this divine infant perceived in reading it over again that these two words made a disagreeable dissonance and substituted the epithet adorable instead of the word divine but that alteration left an imperfection in the phrase because there was ce adorable enfant the somnambule perceiving the error very dexterously added a t after ce so that it was written cet adorable enfant  whenever the somnambule read or corrected what he had written he took care to put his fingers on the characters that were not yet dry he made a digression to avoid rubbing them a caution he never took when the letters were not wet  it is to be observed that the prelate in order positively to know whether he made any use of his eyes had imagined to put a pasteboard under his nose and it was in that position he continued the operations abovementioned  there are facts certified in the encyclopedia itself equally notorious and above all contradiction which is no doubt sufficient evidently to prove one of these two points viz that the somnambule can see without the assistance of his eyes or that his sight exalted to an inconceivable degree pierces through his eyelids and the opacous bodies  the memorials of the academy of sciences and the physicians works contain a prodigious number of observations which plainly consirm the facts hinted and others of the same nature when an explanation of such a singularity is demanded they all unite to acknowledge the weakness of our comprehension and exhort us to admire what we cannot understand what encyclopedia says on that account well deserves to be related  how is it possible says he that a man buried in a sound sleep should hear walk write or see in a word enjoy the exercise of all his senses and perform diverse motions with exactness and precision  we must freely own there exist many things the reason of which we are quite ignorant of and which we cannot penetrate into nature has its mysteries  the author of the same article after having mentioned many surprising facts which he asserts as incontestable makes a judicious sarcasm against those pretenders in point of learning who believe nothing but what they can account for and will not for a moment suppose that there are in nature mysteries impenetrable to their sagacity let us now observe the dangerous effect of prejudice  whenever the same phoenomena are repeated by a magnetical somnambule it is insinuated those concerned in them use deceit and fraud because such phoenomena are contrary to all received notions and have no instance in nature to authorize a belief but how is it possible to reconcile such a reclamation with the various examples which have just now been quoted  one of the chief objections against magnetical somnambulism is because it offers both contradictions and inconsequences with that pretended subtlety of both sense and feeling  it has been observed that those somnambules so discerning with regard to certain objects were altogether insensible of others  for example such a man who dexterously crosses a row of chairs without touching them and writes or reads through a pasteboard shall not see whether there are people round him he will take one thing for another and shall not perceive the fraud imposed on him  but natural somnambulisms example fully answers that objection and the supposed contradiction far from being an argument against the reality of magnetical somnambulism better establishes its veracity since it presents a degree of resemblance more consistent with natural somnambulism  the natural somnambule of encyclopedia well saw his paper and letter through a pasteboard and yet could not see the very person who was placed before him busily employed in examining his motions  the same somnambule imagining he was walking on the border of a river thought he saw a child falling into the water immediately he precipitates himself on his bed making the same gestures as a man swimming and after having much moved and fatigued himself finding the bed clothes in a heap he supposes it the child takes it up with one hand and employs the other to return by swimming on shore when he thinks himself there he lays himself on the bed and rattles his teeth conveying the appearance of a man quite wet and cold he then asks the bystanders for a glass of brandy to warm him and as they were giving him a glass of water he perceived the trick and insisted on having brandy which as soon as he has got he eagerly drinks it declaring at the same time that it does him good  by that example it is evident that the somnambule though deceived by the sight and feeling had his taste sound and perfect since he well knew how to discern brandy from water  such contradictions being hereditary to natural somnambules they should not be looked upon as extraordinary in magnetical somnambules since both somnambulisms are derived from a secret disposition which likely are very near the same  i had many times an opportunity of seeing myself such contradictions which at first produced in me a great diffidence because i was not then well acquainted with the singularities inherent to somnambulism  two years ago being at the marquis of puysegurs i ordered a magnetical somnambule whom he showed me to take a hat which was lying on a table in the closet and to go and put it on the head of some of the company  i did not express my command in speaking but only by sign in tracing the line which i gave him to run over and at the end of which was the hat the somnambule whose eyes were covered with a pasteboard got up from his chair follows the direction shown with my finger advances toward the table and takes the hat amidst many other objects that were on the same table but before he presented it to the person thinks it civil to brush it and though there was no brush on the table he makes the gesture of a man who took one and holding the hat with his left hand he brushes it on the three sides with his right hand puts the imaginary brush on the table and carries the hat placing it on the head of the indicated person though that somnambule had perfectly fulfilled my intention i conceived some diffidence on account of the circumstance of the brush  how could that man whose sight and feeling were seeming perfectly sound not perceive there was no brush on the table how could he mistake himself so far as to think he had one in his hand  from thence i inferred that having committed so gross and palpable a mistake he was far from having the feeling and sight as subtle as they would give to understand and that there was in the rest of his operations more address than fair practice  the magnetical somnambules whom i have since seen have all given me reason for the same dissidence by displaying contradictions of the same nature  but how great was my surprise when after having consulted the works memorials and relations made on somnambulism i observed the same contradictions in natural somnambules and that they were also an object of great astonishment to spectators so what at first seemed to me a motive of suspicion became at last a new reasen to ground my persuasion what is inconceivable says pigatti an italian doctor speaking of somnambules is that on certain occasions their sensations are very subtle whilst on others they are very impenetrable  i saw in the same work an infinite number of other somnambules which after having at first shown a wonderful subtlety of sensation seemed the next moment to be entirely deprived of them by taking one thing for another and confounding the objects which could claim no analogy to one another  the most astonishing somnambule that ever existed is without a doubt john baptist negretti who was both followed and closely examined during five successive nights by a vast number of people mr pigatti who was present at those experiments has given an exact and precise account of them which is found in the journal etranger march       that somnambule having his eyes closely shut took snuff out of a box presented to him came down many large stairs without groping hesitation or even touching turning and stopping precisely where he should placed bottles and glasses on a small pillar which was in his way went and came into the different apartments without running against any thing stopped at doors which were shut and opened them went to draw water from the well took out of the buffet napkins towels knives and generally all that was necessary for a table and performed many other things no less surprising too tedious to relate but which all suppose an exquisite subtlety in the sight and feeling  next to this are to be seen mistakes which quite contradict that perfection in the senses after having looked for a light the somnambule imagines he has a candle in his hand without perceiving his error he thinks he holds a candlestick whilst it is only a bottle he helps himself with that pretended light by carrying it along with him he draws near the chimney to dry a wet towel though there is no fire he salutes the ladies and gentlemen in whose company he imagines himself whilst there is not any such person as he supposes among those that surround him he goes to the publichouse thinking to be accompanied by a comrade though there is not such a thing he pours him some drink addresses him and drinks his health without perceiving he is alone when busy in eating a sallad they take his plate away to substitute a dish of cabbages imbibed with vinegar and cinnamon unknown to him they take the last dish to serve him with a plate of raw fritters and he continues to eat they give him water instead of wine at last somebody jestingly rubbing his legs with a cane he takes it for the beating of a dog which he supposes near him he falls in a passion against the dog looks for him endeavors to beat him goes and ferches a whip to chastise him after having returned with the whip some of the spectators throw a muff at him then imagining to lay hold of the dog he beats him with violenc  there are contradictions to explain that which struck me so forcibly in the somnambule of the marquis of puysegur on account of the imaginary brush he thought he held  there are an infinite number of other examples which might be quoted and which all tend fully to manifest that inequality of sensations and sensibility observed in the several somnambules  the library of medicine vol x p     mentions a somnambule who getting out of his bed at midnight went to a neighboring decayed house and of which but little remained saving the bare walls and some pieces of timber  the somnambule mounted to the very top of that house and jumped from one beam to another though there was under a profound abyss  in the same work is related a story of another somnambule who in the night time dressed himself put on his boots and spurs and then leapt on the border of a window five stories high which he mistook for his horse and in that posture agitated himself with all the gestures of a cavalier who rides post  in the two last instances there is an inexplicable association of the most perfect penetration with the greatest stupidity how a man who had address enough to climb up the top of a decayed house and run on a few weak beams could not perceive the profound abyss which lay under and how he who dressed himself as a cavalier put on his boots and spurs could take the border of a window for a horse to explain those singularities the principle of somnambulism and that want of organization which at that moment took place in the individual should be better known  that induces mr rehelini a colebrated italian doctor author of many observations on somnambulism to say that we ought to content ourselves with admiring the wonderful effects of that condition which providence seems to present to the learned in order to confound them and show the narrow compass of human understanding  the apparent immobility and insensibility of magnetical somnambules for whatever is said or transacted round them is also experienced in natural somnambules he whom i just now spoken of was quite insensible to the approach of a candle which almost burnt his eyebrows  there is likewise in the memorials of the academy of sciences for the year      p  0  a dissertation of mr de savage de in croix on the somnambulism of a girl from montpellier exhibiting a striking instance of the like insensibility  on the  th of april      says the author when i visited the hospital at ten oclock in the morning i found the patient in bed  she began to speak with a degree of vivacity and wit which she never showed when out of that situation she changed now and then her discourse and seemed to address many of her friends who were assembling round her bed what she uttered seemed to bear some analogy with what she said in her attack of the preceding day wherein having verbatim related an instruction in the way of a catechism which she heard the day before she made some moral and malicious applications to the people of the house whom she took care to mention under fictitious names accompanying the whole with gestures and motions of her eyes which she had opened in a word with all the circumstances attending on the action done the day before and yet she was in a sound sleep it was a very awarded circumstance which no one doubted but foreseeing i could never presume to ascertain it unless i had previously rendered some formal experiments i made them on her senses and organs whilst she was in the act of speaking  at first as the girl had her eyes open i thought that dissimulation if there was any in the case could not withstand a slap on the hand or one given suddenly on the face but this repeated experiment did not either occasion the least grimace or interrupt her discourse i had recourse to another experiment which was to put briskly my singer to her eye and to approach a lighted wax candle near enough to burn her eyebrows but she did not even twinkle on the occasion  secondly a hidden person made suddenly a great noise in the girls ear and repeated it with a stone against the bolster of her bed at any other time she would have been trembling with fear but then she appeared perfectly indifferent and insensible to what passed  thirdly i poured in her eyes and mouth some brandy and spirit of ammoniac salt i even applied on the horny tuniele of the eye a seathers beard then the end of my finger but in vain snuff blown up her nose pricking with pins and fingers extorted had on her the same effect as on a mere machine she never gave the least sign of sentiment  the  0th vol of the medicines library contains a memorial on a female somnambule who was insensible to the blows she received with a whip on her naked shoulders one day they rubbed her back with honey and in that condition exposed her in the suns meridian to the stinging of bees which occasioned a great number of blisters on her body without showing the least motion in the world but when she awoke she seemed to suffer acute pain in the affected places and bitterly complained of the hard usage and treament she had met with  concerning that woman i observed an interesting circumstance which is perfectly conformable to what is now past it is because the learned and other professors of medicine declined to go and verify the case of that sleeper under the pretense that such a state contradicted the notions already received in physiology  the author of the relation thus expresses himself  the long stay that woman made at louvain gave every body an opportunity of seeing her and scrupulously examining so extraordinary a phoenomenon the ancient professors in that town looking on the event as a fable and mere chimera could not take on themselves to increase the number of spectators it is thus continues the author that prejudice shuts the eyes of men of the first merit and hinders them from studying and applying themselves to the discovery of several things which might prove very beneficial to monkind  lastly says the same author the young professors and other physicians in the town looking on this phoenomenon with an indifferent eye seriously enquired into the case of that sleeper and after a thorough investigation had every reason to be fully satisfied  it will not be amiss to observe that the author of this page is a physician of the faculty at paris  such an insensibility is true for the noise which surrounds magnetical somnambules does not extend to every kind of noise since the somnambule preserves the faculty of hearing those persons with whom he is in analogy and harmony  this distinction has been deemed by many a mere extravagance as it is not conceivable how in the same individual a faculty could exist which lies open only to such a person and open for all others  but that wonder repugnant to reason finds its analogy in natural somnambulism wherein somnambules are seen who though deaf to thundering noises and the voice of several people yet hear very well and without the least dissiculty another person with whom they keep an exclusive relation such as patients nurses or others they have more specially approached as a husband wife or children  these last have not only the faculty of making themselves heard to a natural somnambule but even that of making him speak  this singularity is so very remarkable that many authors complain that certain persons avail themselves of such a circumstance to catch the secret of the somnambule it is thus that begins the article somnambule in encyclopedia  somnambules are frequently seen says that article who in their sleep relate whatever happened to them in the course of the day some answer the questions made them and hold very consistent discourses there are persons so uncandid as to avail themselves of the condition they are in to catch in spite of them certain secrets which it is much their interest to conceal  observe well these expressions to catch in spite of them this plainly shows the acknowledgment of the formal influence which certain persons awake can exercise over the somnambule  but by similar means and proceedings can such a relation take place betwixt the person awake and the somnambule magnetisers pretend and insinuate that the relation is established by mere contact by touching the somnambule in the extremities of his fingers or pulse or by touching in a like manner any body else in relation with him which presents a kind of resemblance with the loadstone  they have not failed in exclaiming against this affertion and when experience has seemingly convinced them of the truth a deceit has been suspected on the part of the pretended somnambule  but to what purpose then have they recourse to that pretended reluctance to admit of so ancient an effect and long since well known in the world a proverbial expression traces us this opinion of old for it is well known that most proverbs are but scattered remains of forgotten truths  but as many persons might refuse such authority we must furnish them with a testimony given out by the learned themselves and which fully evinces the efficacy of the proceeding taught magnetisers  henry de steers a flemish physician certifies that he knew from his infancy a somnambule who during his sleep performed wonderful things among others he relates that in the middle of night and during a most profound sleep he went and took his child out of the cradle where he lay and then walked over all the house holding the infant in his arms his wife who had accidentally perceived this afraid of the child followed her husband step by step with an intent of assisting them if occasion required or as she had observed that in that situation her husband answered all questions she put to him and took the freedom of interrogating him on the most secret things she wanted to know  the author observes that the husband was in daytime very circumspect with his wife on his personal affairs which he affected to conceal from her but being interrogated by his wife when in a state of somnambulism and holding his child in his arms then said the author he plainly answered all the questions put to him by his wife who followed him and then had nothing concealed from her and was often surprised to hear her speaking of things which he thought were only known to himself vide library of medicine vol x p      the tetimony of a respectable author serves first to confirm that influence spoken of in the encyclopedia which lies in certain persons to oblige the somnambule to speak and declare those very thing which it was his interest to conceal it also confirms the possibility of finding out a means to establish a relation between the person who is awake and the somnambule  the somnambule we were speaking of was in no relation with his wife from the moment he entered into the state of somnambulism to establish a communication it was necessary he should have had his child in his arms lastly observe that the circumstance of having his child in his arms perfectly answers the proceedings pointed out by the magnetisers the child placed in his fathers arms and on the other hand supported by the hands of a trembling mother established a relation between the husband and wife through the communication and analogy he bore to each of them  thus that astonishing marvel against which physicians have so much inveighed as a mere chimera a fable a fraud has long ago been attested by one of their authors who confirms in the most precise manner what magnetisers had advanced  it is easy to perceive that magnetisers by putting themselves in harmony with magnetical somnambules do nothing else but procure themselves that intimate analogy of which instances are to be found in natural somnambulism and into the principle of which they have neglected to enquire  as to the faculty the magnetisers pretend to be endowed with to direct the somnambules motions by making him go from the right to the left forwards and backwards in a direct and circulary line after the manner of a loadstone in the presence of the carupeas that faculty is a necessary consequence of what has been said before and after having admitted and acknowledged the power of making a somnambule speak against his will and declare those very things he has a material interest to conceal ought not have any great objection to admit the faculty of directing his motions  an instance quoted by kaau boerhaave will afford an idea of the astonishing subjection which a man is liable to with regard to another person with whom he is in affinity  that author speaks of a man who had the whim quickly to enter in affinity with all those whom he approached  after a few moments his body acquired a sympathetical flexibility which forced him to imitate with precision and rapidity all the motions he perceived in the person he had fixed upon as to move his eyes lips hands arms feet to cover or uncover his head walk etc and all this in spite of himself and through the influence of a superior force which prompted his sympathetical organs to act with those of others  it was an amusement to hold his hands in the presence of any one who happened to make gestures and then he was extremely agitated continually struggling and endeavoring to set himself at liberty  if any kind of sensation was required of him he was in those moments constrained and answered he had the head or heart ach  boerhaave adds that in consequence of that odd kind of organization he was obliged to go in the street with his eyes closely shut and that he was a very troublesome member of society  the example of such a sympathetical sensibility may serve to diminish the improbability of the assinity and relation which animal magnetism seems to establish between the patient and the magnetiser and it is on that account that kaau boerhaave certifies that a man can by the means of such an affinity well establisned become a god for another man by making him subservient to his will and pleasure sic home homini deus est  we read in the work of the marquis de puysegur entitled memorials to serve for establishing animal magnetism many observations of that nature concerning the patients he had put in a state of somnambulism  the very first person whom to his great astonishment he put in that state was in such perfect affinity with him that he exactly followed all his motions and loudly repeated every air which the marquis internally sang  that singularity which at first appeared incredible acquires notwithstanding the high character of the author a new degree of authority from the above related examples and the testimony of the authors who have spoken of that kind of sympathetical influence  the proceedings made use of by magnetisers find likewise their analogy and authority in natural somnambulism  mr iati was used to put an end to the state of somnambulism by lightly passing the extremity of his fingers ever the somnamoules evelids it is exactly the method used by magnetisers we read in the work of the marquis de puysur that he made at his pleasure a patient change his conversation by deterring him from sad objects and presenting him with some of a more consoling nature  when i thought says the author that his thoughts ought to affect him in a disagreeable manner i stopped him and tried to inspire him with agreeable ones which i easily did and then saw him perfectly pleased and imagining that he either aimed at some prize or danced at an entertainment i united those thoughts in him and by that means forced him to move himself in his chair as in imitation of dancing etc  those phoenomena have been suspected though they are fully confirmed by the encyclopedia in the article of somnambule  the author of that article relating a number of wonderful facts in the somnambule mentioned continues thus  the same somnambule has furnished us with a great number of extraordinary facts but those which i have related are sufficient to my purpose i shall therefore only add that whenever i had a mind to make him change his discourse leave off sad and disagreeable subjects it was sufficient to pass a pen over his lip and immediately he discussed quite different question  that conformity betwixt both recitals serves to confirm the one by the other and if after that double testimony any one is authorized to persevere in his surprise he is still more so to persevere in his suspicions  to conclude the last proof of resemblance between the two kinds of somnambules is that of waking they both entirely forget whatever they have either done or said during their sleep  i could by extending such discussion account for the communication of thoughts without the assistance of either voice or signs it being easy to show that this singularity is not more difficult to be understood than the other that it has been suspected by ancient physiologists and even mentioned in modern works of celebrated physicians but i think it useless to expatiate any further on a phoenomenon with which the different minds are not as yet grown familiar enough  my object is by no means to write a complete work wherein the subject of magnetical somnambulism should be fully discussed i only meant to elucidate some ideas and to encourage judicious persons to investigate the matter excite their reflections and provoke in them a philosophical doubt and lastly to encourage them to contribute by investigation and observations to resolve a problem no less interesting to mankind than conducive to the improvement of sciences  in my next i shall give an essay on the theory of somnambulism  finis
