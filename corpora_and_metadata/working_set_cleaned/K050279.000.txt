considerations upon the eighth and ninth articles of the treaty of commerce and navigation now published by authority with some enquiries into the damages that may accrue to the english trade from them  london printed for j baker at the black boy in paternoster row      price   d  introduction before any just observations can be made upon the two heads which we are now to consider it is absolutely necessary to let the reader a little into the general knowledge of the state of the commerce between england and france as it now stands and this cannot be done so as to give him a clear understanding in the reading either the treaty it self or these considerations without letting him know what the meaning of the tariff of      and the tariff of      so often now to be made mention of is and as far as will consist with the brevity of this tract to give an abridgement of those tariffs as they concern the present treaty of commerce the necessity of understanding these things perfectly before we can make any judgment of the matter in hand is such that it seems the most natural introduction that could possibly be made to the work and without which however the book is written in english it would be an unknown tongue to most of the readers and might as well have been written in arabic or any other language or character which no body could understand  a tariff in the french as it may best be expounded to us in a tradingdialect is no more or less than a book of rates establishing the duties and customs of goods exported and imported from and to the kingdom of france it is true if you speak literally it is the acts of public authority from whence the books of rates are collected as our books of rates are so many abstracts of the acts of parliament by which those rates are established and therefore as our laws of customs are called acts of parliament so those in france are called edits du roy declaration du roy ordonnance du roy arrest du conseild etat du roy and the like and the collection of them into a body is called in french recueil des tarifs etc and table de tarifs arrests and reglemens des droits de entree and sortie etc that is in english a book of rates and nothing else  it is therefore a vulgar error to think these tariffs are treaties between france and other nations and to say the tariff between france and holland or between france and england etc is to talk nousense or which is much the same thing to say nothing to the purpose with this exception only that in several treaties of commerce there have been agreements made and articles entered into especially between france and the states general by which the duties of merchandises have been adjusted respectively and in these treaties the tariffs in france formerly made have been made the foundation with such particular additions respecting the duties of such or such goods about which they have then treated and made any alteration of this we have an example after the treaty of reswick when by a separate treaty of trade though in former cases the duties in general were adjusted yet new agreements were made for sundry things the rest being referred to the tariffs of other years and this was called indeed tarif arreste enter la france and la hollande this was the  th of december       it is necessary farther as an introduction to this discourse to observe that the general tariffs or book of rates which have been made and are referred to in the present treaties stand thus that of      was the most general in which the english merchandises and manufactures paid upon their importation into france very moderate duties and particularly of our woollen manifactures thus fine english cloth the piece qt    else  0 livres half cloths or dozens    livres stockens worsted per dozen    0 sols serges the piece qt  0 else   livres cloth serges    else  0 livres scotch serges and shaloons    else   livres  and the like of other merchandises these duties were enlarged in the year      and by an arrest du conseil de estat   sept   0  an entire prohibition of our woollen manufactures was published and new extravagant duties laid upon those which were allowed to be entered  these things being necessary to premise by way of introduction on the side of the french it may suffice on the other part to observe that by sundry acts of parliament made on several occasions and with various prospects in england several additional duties and some prohibitions have been laid upon and against the goods and merchandises of the growth of france besides the general prohibition or final stop of intercourse or commerce between the two nations occasioned by the accident of the war  as to particular prohibitions the chief are those first against alamodes and lustrings in favor of the company who have erected the manufactures of that kind here and who if those prohibitions had not been made could not have succeeded  also that for a prohibition of all wrought silks for the encouragement of the broadweavers in england and without which they must have been reduced if not quite ruined  the high additional duties were such as principally respect the wines and brandies imported hither from france which by the several acts of parliament establishing those duties amount at this time as follows wine per ton    l brandy per gallon   s   d  these duties being so great as to be equal almost to a prohibition stand as an equivalent to the impositions which the french have laid upon ours and is the foundation of the present debate  thus much seems sufficient by way of introduction  considerations on the articles etc as our considerations extend to no other part of the treaty than what relates to trade and to the duties and impositions upon merchandise so we shall confine it according to the title to the two particular articles which have made so much noise in the town viz the eighth and ninth articles  the eighth article runs thus furthermore it is agreed and concluded as a general rule that all and singular the subjects of the most serene queen of great britain and of the most serene the most christian king in all countries and places subject to their power on each side as to all duties impositions or customs whatsoever concerning persons goods and merchandises ships freights seamen navigation and commerce shall use and enjoy the same privileges and immunities at least and have the like favor in all things as well in the courts of justice as in all such things as relate either to commerce or to any other right whatever which any foreign nation the most favored has uses and enjoys or may hereafter have use and enjoy  this article proposes an equality in the general circumstances of trade for the subjects of the two nations in their respective dominions with the subjects of other nations viz that france shall not demand any toll duty custom impost portcharges etc of the english merchants in any ports or places of her dominions more than the subjects of all other nations pay in the same ports and vice versa england shall do the same  i know it is objected here that this article directly contravenes the treaty with portugal and some people lay a great stress upon that treaty in which we are obliged to admit the portugal wines at a certain rate or duty lower than the french whether the parliament will think that treaty relates to a farther term than the expiration of the war i shall not determine and this is named because some insist upon it that that treaty was made for considerations which wholly related to the war and which considerations or conditions on the behalf of portugal as has been mentioned in parliament were not honorably and punctually performed vide the votes of the house of commons and representation and address last session now how far the queen of great britain will think her self bound by that treaty which on the other hand they say was never performed is the question these people offer in this case but this i shall not take upon me to determine of here but leave it to the casuists in those cases whose judgments are founded on the laws of nations and the nature of treaties  but the considerations of trade are of a differing nature and though there were much more to be said for the interest of the kingdom respecting peace and war than we think can be said here yet those things weight not in arguments of commerce the present enquiry is whether the french or portugal trades are of most advantage to england many arguments offer themselves to our view upon this head but i believe no man will pretend to say but that as things stand now the portugal trade is much more to the general profit than the french because besides many other reasons we make effectual exportation of our woollen manufactures for all the wines oils etc that we receive from portugal whereas the obstructions in france to our woollen goods by the war and the improvements made in france not only in our woollen manufactures but in many other things makes that trade run in a different channel and the balance at least before our stop to their wine brandy and wrought silks by the high duties and prohibitions now in force were against england  the argument brought against these things by those who think the equality of duties reasonable at least the argument which is most cogent is this it may be true that while our trade to france lies under the discouragements and disadvantages of their tariffs of      and   0  the loss is ours because we export but few of our woollen manufactures thither but the question is not yet thought of how great a trade we may have to france a kingdom of so large extent so populous and so wanting manufactures of wool when those high duties are taken off and the tariff of      restored as by the ninth article is proposed  i shall however state this as impartially between both as possible we are sure that now the trade to portugal is not only a great but a gainful trade and we know it is an increased and an increasing trade also it is a trade as is mentioned above especially advantageous to britain in that our whole import from thence is balanced by our woollen manufacture and great sums brought hither in specie of gold every year this as it is said we are sure of and it can be no offense to any to say we hope that when commissioners shall meet as is provided by the ninth article to remove the difficulties and to regulate mutually the duties and circumstances of trade they will be very careful to prevent breaking in too far upon so beneficial a trade as that to portugal before they have a clear view of making at least an equal advantage to britain in the trade to france and this may suffice to say at present upon the affair of general equallities in commerce which is the sustance of the eighth article  the ninth article requires a farther discussion and may be particularly divided into three periods or heads   the proposal of repealing the laws on either hand which relate to additional impost and duties on merchandises in both kingdoms and all the prohibitions of importation also from the year        the settling the duties upon french goods imported into england upon the same foot and at the same rates upon which goods of the like nature are imported from other parts   the appointing commissioners not only to adjust the exceptions and separate proposals which are not yet settled but to regulate the methods of future commerce between the nations in such a manner as may be for mutual advantage   the two first of these are contained in the first part of the ninth article of the treaty in these words it is further agreed that within the space of two months after a law shall be made in great britain whereby it shall be sufficiently provided that no more customs or duties be paid for goods and merchandises brought from france to great britain than what are payable for goods and merchandises of the like nature imported into great britain from any other country in europe and that all laws made in great britain since the year      for prohibiting the importation of any goods and merchandises coming from france which were not prohibited before that time be repealed the general tariff made in france the   th day of september in the year      shall take place there again and the duties payable in france by the subjects of great britain for goods imported and exported shall be paid according to the tenor of the tariff abovementioned and shall not exceed the rule therein settled in the provinces whereof mention is there made and in the other provinces the duty shall not be payable otherwise than according to the rule at that time prescribed and all prohibitions tariffs edicts declarations or decrees made in france since the said tariff of the year      and contrary thereunto in respect to the goods and merchandises of great britain shall be repealed  to consider this with all possible impartiality it must be allowed that the french binding themselves to repeal all their tariffs edicts declarations or decrees made in france back to the year      entitled them very justly to insist upon the same thing with us and were we sure that repealing those tariffs would open the door to a free trade for our manufacturers into france that demand would meet with the less difficulties here and the alternative be the more just of which we shall say more when we come to enquire into the excepted articles  but although this may seem very just for the french to demand yet it will require some retrospect upon our own circumstances to consider whether it consists with our trading interest to come into this mutual repealing of duties and prohibitions and indeed whether it be consistent with the very nature and being of our trade as particularly the taking off the prohibition of wrought silks which we call broad silks and that severe prohibition of alamodes and lustrings  it might require here some very mature thoughts to reflect upon the state of our own trade for example the encouragement given to the making lustrings and alamodes in england and upon which the subscribers to the lustringcompany embarked their stocks was without question the prohibition of the french silks of that kind and the confidence they had that if at any time that prohibition expired they should obtain that encouragement which is generally granted to all new undertakings of that nature and without which they are supposed not to be able to promote or set up such works or at least with any success this encouragement is generally the laying large impositions or actual prohibitions upon goods of the same nature made in other countries but if on the contrary the impositions and prohibitions aforesaid are actually taken off and the trade laid open so that the like goods may be admitted upon low terms from abroad those undertakings are ruined of mere consequence this i take to be the case of the lustringcompany in london and i believe the master or members of that company will be free to own that they can make but small pretense to the carrying on their said trade if the prohibition and duty upon the french lustrings and alamodes should be taken off by this treaty what weight the interest of the company shall bear in the consideration of this great affair when either the parliament in general or the commissioners when nominated to enquire into it in particular shall come to debate it i will not undertake to determine  the case of our broad weavers may come next to be mentioned in favor of whom and in consideration of the numbers of families maintained by the manufacture of silk in this nation the general prohibition of french wrought silks first and afterward of east india wrought silks was made what other considerations moved the house to those prohibitions and how importunate the weavers and importers of silk were to obtain those prohibitions is too fresh in the memories of all men who think of these things that i need not repeat any thing of it here what a hurt it will be to the silk manufacture in england i rather leave to the people concerned to talk of who are apt to be loud enough than to pretend to meddle with it here  it is argued here that the increase of the exportation of our woollen manufactures will follow by taking off the high duties in france by which that whole nation will be open to our sale and we shall export vast quantities thither yearly i say if this be urged as a thing of such weight to which the loss in the silk manufactures etc is not to be compared i readily yield to it only with this proviso viz that we are certain that exportation shall so increase i shall allow my self to hope it will do so at least if the commissioners who are to meet can bring the french to consent that the english woollen manufactures be comprised in the treaty and the duties upon them be reduced to the tariff of      nor will i allow that to be a question in the case since the known interest of their country so much requires it and the ruin or damage to other parts of our trade will be so just an equivalent  but as that notion of the increase of our woollen manufacture is an answer to the nation in general so here may be an answer suggested to the broad silk weavers and lustringcompany in particular viz that although the prohibitions be taken off yet still there seems to be a liberty left to britain by this ninth article to continue or lay any higher duty on such foreign wrought silks as the government shall think needful to encourage our silk manufactures and yet the french be obliged to repeal their high duties at the same time this i say seems plain at least to our common view who can judge of these things but without doors from these two circumstances    from the demand the french make of keeping four species of goods up to the rule of the tariff of      which if they insist upon there seems to be a parity of reason that our commissioners may insist upon the like advance of a duty on the wrought silks made in england   because the reason of the french for holding up their duties on our woollen manufactures to the tariff of      is the very same which we would give for laying a duty on their silks viz the giving the manufactures at home the advantage against those which are imported from abroad and encouraging the proper subjects of each kingdom   because it does not contradict the letter of the treaty to lay any new or high duties or customs upon the goods and merchandises of any kind imported from france provided it is no more than is paid upon goods of the like nature imported from other parts and i must grant that if this construction of the article will hold as i hope and believe it will the prohibitions may be all taken off of the broad silks lustrings alamodes etc without such ruin and destruction to the broad silk weaving and lustring trade as has been apprehended but as the ministry on both sides must be allowed the construction of their own terms and to explain their own thoughts to one another so it may not be proper to anticipate all the thoughts our commissioners may have least it prepare the enemy to oppose them  the french are no more to be looked upon in trade as they formerly were viz as an improving and encroaching people in respect to the general commerce of europe but as a nation arrived to such an improvement that they are really our rivals in the best and greatest part of our trade in particular i mean the woollen manufacture indeed we have the good fortune to be on the better side of the hedge with them and they have the difficulty of the want of materials to struggle with viz the wool but then against that by their art dexterous management money and other helps joined to the baseness and treachery of our own people who for private gain will set their hands to the ruin of their country they have found the way in spite of severe laws strict guards and the utmost vigilance of officers to get so great quantities of our wool conveyed over to france as sufficiently enables them in conjunction with spanish wool and wool from barbary to make a very great quantity of woollen manufactures and thereby do us an inestimable damage in our trade and which is yet more as the people are poor industrious and work very low where they are able to make the goods at all they are sure to underwork and undersell us  for this reason it must be allowed that if the french can be brought to open a door for a free trade that is for an importation of our woollen manufactures into france with moderate duties the value and gooodness of our manufactures would force their own way so far at least that the advance they make upon us in those things would not be so great or increase so fast in order then to come to such a free trade many things may be thought on and it may be counted rational that england should grant all they can be supposed to grant and take every step that can conduce to that main end and design which they can take and grant without prejudice to their own nation and to the main trade thereof viz the woollen manufacture in some other branch for to do thus viz to yield what would be fatal to it in another part would be to build with one hand and pull down with another  this brings us then to the second head mentioned above    the settling the duties upon french goods upon an equality with the duties on goods of the like nature imported from foreign countries  this as is noted above signifies not at all as i can understand it an entire reduction of our impost and customs upon french goods or as the article at first view seemed to suggest and as many still understand it to take off all our new impositions since the year      but rather an agreement with france that as peace is restored between the two nations and they stand to one another upon an equality of general interest in the same relation of neighborhood one to another so they should of trade also and the equality of duties upon goods of like sort i laid down as the foundation of this equality those who are of opinion that an equality of all nations in trade is requisite must produce other arguments to back that opinion than ihave seen yet unless by equalities they will make suitable allowances for tie different scituations of countries quality of goods and circumstances of trade  now let others put what construction they will upon the ninth article and upon the meaning of those words the same duties and goods of like nature i must be allowed to think that it is implied that allowances and regulations must be made in order to bring the nature of things to be like and the duties to be the same things may be said to be the same when by just allowances and proportions they are regulated and adjusted and brought to an equality on the contrary though the sum paid upon any goods be the same yet it may give one side a great inequality and advantage over the other and that which is the same thing in the letter is not the same in the consequence  these are things cannot be reasoned upon so well before hand as they will be debated and calculated upon a personal treaty with commissioners and therefore i say no judgment can be made at present by a common eye but that every body may judge a little what may be the state of our trade when this door of intercourse and commerce is opened it may not be improper to look back and see what the trade was formerly and to know thereby what we are like to expect when the high duties are taken off from the french goods here  it is true that dr davenant in his report from the books of the customhouse to the commissioners named in the act for taking examining and stating the public accounts observes that in the four years interval of peace at the latter end of king william we exported to france only thus that is to say in our woollen manufactures only  l s d from christmas school to christmas                   00              00   0               0    0     0               the last year being the year when the trade was stopped by breaking out of the war may pass for nothing and then we see the export of our woollen manufactures to france appears very small if the doctors valuation of those goods are right  on the other hand in a representation of trade and commerce with france made to the late king by his majestys especial command dated december         by the commissioners of trade as i have been informed there was given in the following terrible abstract of the french trade with england viz   in general that the french overballancd us in trade above a million per annum   in particular that in one year the importations from france into england only for scotland was not then united amounted to       0 pou st whereas our exportations to them for the same year amounted but to    0   pou st overbalance against us          in the same report it is laid down that the goods which were imported from thence yearly had been computed thus l wrought silks to the value of  00000 linnens  00 00 wines and brandy    000 in all  0   00  to descend to farther particulars they say that in the year      there was twenty thousand tons of wine and six thousand tons of brandy imported into england from france and more especially that from anno      to      there was upwards of the said quantity of twenty thousand tons of wine and six thousand tons of brandy imported  it would be unjust at this time of day to let such accounts as these lie open for every one to pass their judgments of without giving the opinion of him that publishes them because the reason and design of the making them public will very much lie in the giving or not giving that opinion and therefore i think my self bound to own that i do not look on the said account to have any foundation in the matter of fact or in the nature of the thing and therefore as it does not comport with the customhouse books of those years so neither does it to me appear reasonable howbeit being given in to the late king by such persons so qualified to know and who were under such obligations to do it exactly i shall say no more to it but this that no man need go any farther for a reason why the late king appeared very backward after the peace of reswick to enter upon any treaty of commerce with france or to open the same by taking off the said high duties which at that time and till now have been as a prohibition on both sides  and i cannot wonder why any man who may have drawn his calculate of things from these estimates should be of the same mind now for certain it is that no export which we can hope for of our woollen manufactures to france can ever come up to balance such an account as this nay though the king of france were willing to take off and revoke all his tariffs to      and the tariff of      too  on the other hand the customhouse books make it appear as is also to be seen in the said report of dr davenant that the whole import of wine and brandy in the year from michaelmass      to michaelmass      came out thus wine      tons brandy   0 tons    which it seems was placed to the balance of trade just as the inclination of the people pleased to lead them some reckoned it at the rate or price which the wine cost in france which i must acknowledge is the true way to state the balance between the trade of the two kingdoms because in estimating our exports to france we always reckon the value of those exports being of our own goods at the worth here and can do no otherwise but others willing to make the sum appear big rated or valued them at the price wine and brandy was sold for by the retailer in england in which valuations the difference was as follows the first rated the wine at   l per ton and the brandy at   l per ton the other at    l and    l by the first the rate was thus l wine      tons at   l is    0  brandy   0    tons at   l is            the other thus l wine      tons at    l is  0     brandy     tons at    l is          0    this makes a manifest difference and shows that we ought upon very good examination to take the calculations of other people in these cases who always speak as their party opinions guide them however take it which way we will it is apparent that after this the quantity of wine in general imported from all france and from other countries too increased prodigiously for whereas during the years      and      as abovesaid when we imported six thousand tons of wine and brandy from france there was then no importation at all of wine from portugal or if there was the customhouse knew it by no other name than of spanish wines which might indeed be the case and those spanish wines amounted the same year to      tons so that the general import of wine in england anno      was   0   tons the same general account about the year      or   00 was one year with another near   000 tons in particular thus entered tons spain   0  portugal      italy   0  france      total        how much of this wine shall in a future trade be imported from france is hard to determine some allege the whole draught of red wines will come from thence but this is running too far and too fast for even before the war though the duties of french wines were much lower than the duties of the portugueze wines yet there were always great quantities of alicant florence bar a bar and oporto wines brought in which by reason of the deepness and brightness of the color or face of the wines were always found useful by the vintners to draw with their thin meaner french wines and sold at a much greater price and if as sometimes it happened the vintage in france failed or the wines proved small and ill colored the quantity and price of the wines from lisbon oporto alicant etc always increased in proportion  if this was the case then when the duties of those other wines were about   l per ton greater than the duties of the french we may reasonably hope it will be still so and with more advantage to the spanish and portugal wines when the duties of the french wines shall be made equal  but here comes in an objection which was hinted at before upon the subject of what you will call equality viz that the alicant florence and lisbon wines etc come in here at a greater expense both in their first cost as also in their freight cask length of the voyage etc than the french and thus therefore if the french wines pay but an equal duty yet the trade is not thereby put upon an equality but the advantage given to the french and that a proportion ought to be stated here to bring this matter to an equality  this may have some weight in it and as i can do no more than mention it here so i cannot prevail upon my self to doubt but the government will take care to have the disproportion considered in the further debates they are to have of that affair  as to the treaties with portugal and the conditions to be performed in that part of the case with the king of portugal they are not for a subject to dispute but must be left to the consideration of parliament to whom it belongs and who no doubt will do what is requisite in that case  it remains now to examine a little into that part of the ninth article which speaks of the excepted species of goods and of appointing commissaries to regulate the duties and differences of those species according to the tenor of the other part of the agreement this is contained in the following words of the article it self viz but whereas it is urged on the part of france that certain merchandises that is to say manufactures of wool sugar salted fish and the product of whales be excepted out of the rule of the abovementioned tariff and likewise other heads of matters belonging to this treaty remain which having been proposed on the part of great britain have not yet been mutually adjusted a specification of all which is contained in a separate instrument subscribed by the ambassadors extraordinary and plenipotentiaries on both sides it is hereby provided and agreed that within two months from the exchange of the ratifications of this treaty commissaries on both sides shall meet at london to consider of and remove the difficulties concerning the merchandises to be excepted out of the tariff of the year      and concerning the other heads which as is abovesaid are not yet wholly adjusted and at the same time the said commissaries shall likewise endeavor which seems to be very much for the interest of both nations to have the methods of commerce on one part and of the other more thoroughly examined and to find out and establish just and beneficial means on both sides for removing the difficulties in this matter and for regulating the duties mutually but it is always understood and provided that all and singular the articles of this treaty do in the mean while remain in their full force and especially that nothing be deemed under any pretense whatsoever to hinder the benefit of the general tariff of the year      from being granted to the subjects of her royal majesty of great britain and the said british subjects from having and enjoying the same without any delay or tergiversation within the space of two months after a law is made in great britain as abovesaid in as ample manner and form as the subjects of any nation the most favored might have and enjoy the benefit of the aforesaid tariff any thing to be done or discussed by the said commissaries to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding  it seems here that the four species of goods mentioned viz fish produce of whale that is whale fins and oil sugar refined and woollen maenufactures shall be excepted out of this article that is to say out of the tariff of      but what then say we signify all the rest for our woollen manufacture is the main thing which we have to insist upon if this should not be adjusted then the whole trade is gone it is to be hoped that the wisdom of our parliament will provide that unless such a method may be found out that our manufactures may be admitted into france upon such terms as will make them vendible there and that they may not only come to market but may have a market to come to where they will be sold they will be very cautious how they make a law to take off our high duties and prohibitions upon the french goods for this would be to ruin us effectually by admitting french goods of all kinds into england and having our woollen manufactures in effect prohibited  the great question then is what is the tariff of      which the articles make mention of and what is the difference between that and      and to answer this directly it is to be understood that there is no such thing in france as a tariff of      that respects english goods other than that mentioned before made with holland by which the english fine broad cloth is taxed at  0 livres for    else french viz for about  0 to    yards more than they were charged before viz by the tariff of      and serges stuffs etc in proportion this addition is the thing upon which it seems turns the question between a trade and no trade with france if this addition will effect a prohibition the king of france cannot insist upon it when he proposes a treaty of trade for that would be to have us open our trade to him and shut up his trade from us but if the french king is in earnest to seek a treaty of commerce with us then the difference between the tariff of      and      is so little that he cannot scruple to give it up besides as by the eighth article the subjects of britain are to enjoy all those privileges liberties and immunities and have the like favor in all things as to all duties impositions or customs whatsoever concerning persons goods and merchandises which any foreign nation the most favored enjoys or may hereafter have use and enjoy if this i say be agreed then it will remain to enquire how the treaties of commerce with the dutch and other nations have settled this affair as to salted fish and woollen manufactures for as to the produce of whales it concerns us little who have no whale fishing and as to fish the dutch also are the main parties concerned but as to the woollen manufacture if the dutch have yielded that point then we seem to be stopped by the eighth article from asking any more and how far that may consist with the sale of our manufactures in france remains to be examined and we may hope will be effectually debated before it be yielded to france  the debate which the respective commissaries to be appointed are to have as the article says for the interest of both nations will no question be very agreeable to all honest men if it may be so adjusted as that our woollen manufactures may meet with no interruption in their exportation to france no question there may be such regulations of commerce made as may be for the interest of both nations but all must be with a supposition of admitting our manufactures into france upon equal and reasonable terms which if it be not done our trade is rather prohibited than extended rather shut up than opened so that upon this one article all the rest depends viz that the trade be opened for our woollen goods in france  how else shall we make our selves amends for the loss of our trade in portugal i shall say nothing here to the obligation upon her majesty to the king of portugal the government will no doubt concern themselves to preserve the conditions of every agreement with the princes of europe from any clashing inconsistencies one with another no more will i undertake to say the portugueze wait to prohibit our manufactures as soon as they shall hear this transaction is settled i do not believe the portugueze so weak neither we are told this will be most certain that whatever amends we may make our selves by the french trade we shall certainly lessen our wine trade from portugal and to also from leghorn and other parts to whom we at the same time send very large quantities of our manufactures and therefore if the treaty with france do not make up the diminution of those trades it will not then be an equivalent to us for the exchange but we hope the commissioners who are to meet upon this subject will concern themselves to weigh this part also and so to admit the french trade that the trade to portugal may not be in a worse case than it was before the war indeed it must be owned it would be hard to suggest that the trade to portugal can be in a worse state than it was before the war when it is known that before the war the whole duties upon french wines were not more than   l or thereabout per ton and at the same time the portugal wines paid above    l   s duty and beyond the years      we do not find any wines imported from portugal at all but under the title of spanish wines which may be noted not that there came no wines from portugal at all but that portugal was then under the dominion of the king of spain till the revolt of the duke of braganza the grandfather of the present king i say then it can hardly be rational to think the portugal trade will be quite sunk or that the king of portugal will prohibit trade with us but that the french and portugal wines paying the same dutys the first will gain the preference at market no body will question and therefore it had been to be wished there had been some little reserved advantage to the trade of portugal wine but since it is otherwise determined the portugal trade must take its fate and all that remains seems to be the taking a due care that the trade to france for our manufactures may be so enlarged as may be a recompense for what may happen on the other side and if this may but appear we shall have reason to be the better satisfied with the treaty of commerce and we shall all be glad to find it so that the complaints of those who pretend to fear nay to know as they say the contrary may appear to have been without ground  the silk manufacture is next to be considered the lustring company is now near expiring and their charter which was granted for  years is almost run out whether they will obtain a new charter or no is not for us to enquire whatever we may suppose but whether they shall or not it may be the same thing the prohibition or duty equal to a prohibition upon lustrings and alamodes if it is to remain as by the equality with other nations mentioned in the treaty it may makes a very great difference in the manufacture at home and the importation from abroad whether the lustringcompany can go on or no is for them to determine but it must be owned that if the dutys on foreign lustrings are held up at about    l per cent more than the manufactures of lustrings at home are valued at and the lustringcompany cannot go on but the foreign will outsell them the making them at home must sink under the imperfections of the performance rather than under the mistake of the treaty of commerce  it is true a man who has any value for the trade of his native country cannot but regret the misfortune of the humor of our people in britain who are so far from encouraging the manufactures of their own country that they will upon all occasions and almost in all cases choose any thing to wear that comes from abroad and advance in price for such goods without regard to the real goodness or worth of the thing they buy merely upon its being foreign this puts all manufacturing at least of silks under very great discouragements and frequently has defeated the end and design of many wholesome and good laws which have been made for the encouragement of our own people and it is feared this will still be a help to the french interest in trade when our duties on their goods shall be reduced to an equality with the goods and merchandises of other countries it is true that this is a mischief that ought if it were possible rather to be punished than encouraged but still while this is our misfortune and we cannot help it the government may provide as well against it in treaties and capitulations as the nature of such things will admit  how far it can be expected that the ministers of state should in treaties of peace and commerce allow for these national follies i will not meddle with here it is most certain that if this humor of our people prevails after the present treaty they may defeat the best designs of the government in the treaty and make that mischievous which otherwise would not be so we had an eminent example of this humor of the people in the extravagance of their fancy after the painted callicoes and fine chints of the indies which run on to so ridiculous an extreme that on a sudden you saw all the ladies of quality and wealthy citizens wives dressed up in a tawdry piece of callicoe which but a few years before their chambermaids would have thought beneath them to be seen in nor was this all but immediately by the same rule our velvet and damaskbeds fine windowcurtains nay the very hangings of rooms were all turned into painted callicoes and meslepatan chints to the entire destruction if it had gone on of the silk manufacture and the exceeding damage of the woollen manufacture also there was no remedy for this distemper for no doubt it was a distemper in our people but to quash it at once by an immediate prohibition of all east india silks and painted callicoes and forbidding the wearing and making them up upon the severest penalties that could be though of  i should have observed that as the humou for east india goods began at the chints and painted callicoes so as they began to grow familiar the ladies went on to the wrought silks o china and japan and to wear fine atlasses rich gold and silver stuffs and fine damasks and this to that degree that the company imported nine thousand pieces of rich damasks in one ship nay even in furnishing our houses the indian pictures in themselves simple ordinary and ridiculous became more valuable than the finest paintings of italy  these things are mentioned here for this reason to note that since our fancies are thus debauched if possible then whatever treaties of commerce are made as much provision ought also to be made as the nature of the thing will permit to prevent the ill consequences of it in our trade  it is very well known that the like excess in the humor and temper of our people has for many years past appeared in their extravagant passion for every thing that is french as well in wearing apparel silks etc as in wines and if the extravagance should now return to possess our fancy when the french trade opens by this new treaty we may ruin our own trade in spite of the best conditions and articles in the world as an exhortation against this humor in the people would be of greater use in the main than all possible exclamation can be against the treaty so it cannot be offensive to any one to say that this will necessarily move the government when they shall treat by the new commissioners which the treaty allows that such dutys may be kept up upon foreign wrought silks or added if need be as will give our english manufactures of silk a sufficient preference and cause those people who will still be for french goods to see the madness and distraction of their fancy and how dear they must pay or worse goods than they may have at home  it cannot be doubted but such measures would in time give a shock to the mischief and perhaps in time take off our people from the extravavagance and folly which has formerly done them so much harm in trade and is still so dangerous in the case before us  the french are an industrious people they work cheap and work well their fancy in contriving fashions figures and fancies in their work is very bright and quick and these things recommend their goods to us the vanity and levity of their nation prompts them to apply to all the novelties and niceties of dress they gratify the beaus and the ladies and this leads us insensibly into the error and makes our people infinitely fond of their trade if then the commissaries who are to meet and regulate the trade do not state the duties on wrought silks etc so as to give a very great difference to the english wrought silk so as that they may not be discouraged in their work and the humor for every thing that is french again prevail our hometrade will be ruined of course and by its own friends even the very people who ought to support and carry it on  the present duties upon wrought silks to be paid in britain as well from france as from other countries are thus l s d alamodes and lustrings for every  0 lb weight    00 00 all other sorts of broad silks for every  0 lb weight         these dutys the french may still be obliged to pay because all other nations pay the same nay if our articles are rightly managed and the parliament thinks fit to lay any other and higher dutys on the said species of wrought silks so be it that other nations pay the same dutys upon goods of the like nature  it is humbly recommended then to those in whose hands power is or shall be lodged to do these things that they would consider the many thousand families of our poor as well weavers as others who depend upon the silk manufactures in this nation as also the great and truly beneficial trade to turkey and the levant from whence our silk is chiefly imported and to purchase which our broad cloth is sent in such great quantities as to make a very considerable figure also in the employment of our people in the country all which must sink in a very great degree if some immediate care is not taken and means used to keep up the value of our own broad silks and keep down and discourage as much as may be the importation of french silks upon this new opening of the trade  this is the rather urged now because it is evident that there is room very happily made in the treaty for it and that at the same time that we apprehend the danger we yet can with satisfaction so far compliment the makers of this treaty in that they have left room for so advantageous a step to be taken in favor of the weavers and workers of silk and that by the treaty it may be done since as above the french scruple not our high duties at all only desire that they may pay no more than other nations which if it be granted them can do us no harm provided that both they and all other nations may but be obliged to pay so much that we may be able to go on with our trade at home  this is not said by way of complaint against any thing agreed on in the treaty the danger does not seem to be in what is done and agreed on by the treaty but from what may yet be done in consequence of the treaty and therefore it is that this case is insisted on  we have seen very large accounts published of the importations of foreign silks from france dr davenant in his report to the commissioners of accounts says that the commissioners of trade in king williams time gave his majesty an account that the importations from france to england only amounted in value in this one article of wrought silks to l 00000 sterling  by a scheme of the trade to france now printed and handed about the same is calculated for the year      at   0000 lb weight of wrought silk value l  per lb weight is l  00000  it is noted in the same scheme that there was recieved at the port of dover that year l  000 for the dutys on french wrought silks besides what may be supposed to be run there that year  it is not material for us to examine into the truth of these accounts nay though they should be allowed to be fictitious and false as i believe they are  but it will be allowed that the quantity was very great and it is humbly offered to the consideration of those whom it concerns to weigh from hence how great a consumption of the silk manufacture this nation makes and consequently how well worthy their concern it is that as much of this as is possible might be manufacturd by our own hands and the trade be kept among our selves  it is true as the dutys are now viz    l for every  0 l or    s per pound duty on the said wrought silks it is a very great difference but as this comes to be reckoned upon the measure it does not especially in midling slight silks amount to much by the yard and suppose it was one shilling or two shillings per yard it is too well known that the humor of our ladies when they are buying fine cloths and are wheedled with the opinion of the fineness and goodness of french silks is not to be restrained by a shilling two or three in a yard  if then the duties were enlarged upon the sine wrought silks to such a degree that the weaving of broad silks and rich brocaded silks in britain may not be discouraged such a treaty of commerce will be a happy means to prevent the ruin of our trade the starving many thousands of poor familys and the french trade may not be so prejudicial to us in that particular trade as otherwise there is reason to fear it might be offered at to set down what addition of duty would be sufficient to preserve our trade in this case but i rather choose to omit that than prescribe to our legislature the weavers are of age ask them they are the best judges  the like argument and with the same force will hold good in the linen manufacture especially since two great events both which have happened since the commencement of the late war   the union with scotland   the prohibiting the exportation of the woollen manufacture and the encouraging the making of linen in ireland   both these countries are now employed at least very considerably in linen manufactures and it is not to be doubted but that we are and ought to be very justly concerned for the encouragement of them both now if the aforesaid printed accounts of importations from france are true for the year      which however i must own i do not credit yet thus far they serve to argue in this case that the linen manufacture of france is very considerable  that account stands thus imported from france into england anno       0000 pieces of lockram and dowlas   000 hundred of vitry canvas and noyals  000 hundred of ditto normandy   00 pieces of quintins   00 pieces dyed linen    0  yards diaper tabling       yards ditto napkining      pieces buckram   00 bolts of poldavies    0 pair of old sheets  it is without any question that the canvas the dowlas and the diaper may in a little time come to be all made in britain and ireland the diaper is already improved to such a degree as nothing can be better and it is humbly hoped that the dutys which may be still added upon the french linen will be such as shall prevent the discouragement upon these manufactures  this we think is the only way to make the articles of commerce effectual to the advantage of britain and to enable us to trade with france for the future upon as good terms as we do with other nations of europe  finis
