entered at stationers hall  it is all for the best it is all for the best said mrs simpson whenever any misfortune befell her she had got such an habit of vindicating providence that instead of weeping and walling under the most trying dispensations her chief care was to convince herself and others that however great might be her sufferings and however little they could be accounted for at present yet that the judge of all the earth could not do but right the honor of god was dearer to her than her own credit and her chief desire was to turn all events to his glory though she was the daughter of a clergyman and the widow of a genteel tradesman she had been reduced to accept of a room in an almshouse instead of repining at the change instead of dwelling on her former gentility and saying how handsomely she had lived once and how hard it was to be reduced and she little thought ever to end her days in an almshouse which is the common language of those who were never so well off before she was thankful that such an asylum was provided for want and age  one fine evening as she was sitting reading her bible on the little bench shaded with honeysuckles just before her door who should come and sit down by her but mrs betty who had formerly been ladys maid at the great house in the village of which mrs simpsons father had been minister betty after a life of vanity was by a train of misfortunes brought to this very almshouse and though she had taken no care by frugality and prudence to avoid it she thought it a hardship and disgrace instead of being thankful as she ought to have been for such a retreat at first she did not know mrs simpson her large cloak bonnet and brown stuff gown for she always made her appearance conform to her circumstances being very different from the dress she had been used to wear when mrs betty had seen her dining at the great house and time and sorrow had much altered her countenance but when mrs simpson kindly addressed her as an old acquaintance she screamed with surprise   what you madam cried she you in an almshouse living on charity you who used to be so charitable yourself that you never suffered any distress in the parish which you could prevent   that may be one reason betty replied mrs simpson why providence has provided this refuge for my old age and my heart overflows with gratitude when i look back on his goodness  no such great goodness me thinks said betty why you was born and bred a lady and are now reduced to live in an almshouse  betty i was born and bred a sinner undeserving of the mercies i have received  no such great mercies said betty why i heard you had been turned out of doors that your husband had broke and that you have been in danger of starving though i did not know what was become of you   betty glory be to god it is all true  wellsaid betty you are an odd sort of a gentlewoman if from a prosperous condition i had been made a bankrupt a widow and a beggar i should have thought it no such mighty matter to be thankful for but there is no accounting for taste the neighbors used to say that all your troubles must needs be a judgment upon you but i who knew how good you were thought it very hard you should suffer so much but now i see you reduced to an almshouse i beg your pardon madam but i am afraid the neighbors were in the right and that so many misfortunes could never have happened to you without you had committed a great many sins to deserve them for i always thought that god is so just that he punishes us for all our bad actions and rewards us for all our good ones   so he does betty but he does it in his own way and at his own time and not according to our notions of good and evil for his ways are not as our ways god indeed punishes the bad and rewards the good but he does not do it fully and finally in this world indeed he does not set such a value on outward things as to make riches and rank and beauty and health the rewards of piety that would be acting like weak and erring men and not like a just and holy god our belief in a future state of rewards and punishments is not always so strong as it ought to be even now but how totally would our faith fail if we regularly saw every thing made even in this world so far am i from thinking that god is less just and future happiness less certain because i see the wicked sometimes prosper and the righteous suffer in this world that i am rather led to believe that god is more just and heaven more certain for in the first place god will not put off his favorite children with so poor a lot as the good things of this world and next seeing that the best men here below do not often attain to the best things why it only serves to strengthen my belief that he has most assuredly reserved for those that love him such good things as eye has not seen nor ear heard god by keeping man in paradise while he was innocent and turning him into this world as soon as he had sinned gave a plain proof that he never intended this world even in its happiest state as a place of reward my father gave me good principles and useful knowledge and while he taught me by a habit of constant employment to be if i may so say independent on the world yet he led me to a constant sense of dependence on god as he could save little or nothing for me he was very desirous of seeing me married to a young gentleman in the neighborhood who expressed a regard for me but while he was anxiously engaged in bringing this about my good father died  how very unlucky interrupted betty  no betty it was very providential this man though he maintained a decent character and lived soberly yet he would not have made me happy  why what could you want more of a man said betty religion returned mrs simpson as my father made a creditable appearance and was very charitable and as i was an only child this gentleman concluded that he could give me a good fortune for he did not know that all the poor in his parish are the children of every pious clergyman finding i had little or nothing left me he withdrew his attentions  what a sad thing cried betty no it was all for the best providence overuled his covetousness to my good i could not have been happy with a man whose soul was set on the perishable things of this world nor did i esteem him though i labored to submit my own inclinations to those of my kind father the very circumstance of my being left pennyless produced the direct contrary effect on mr simpson he was a sensible young man engaged in a prosperous business we had long esteemed each other but while my father lived he thought me above his hopes we were married i found him an amiable industrious good tempered man he respected religion and religious people but i had the grief to find him less pious than i had hoped he was ambitious and a little too much immersed in worldly schemes and though i know it was all done for my sake yet that did not blind me so far as to make me think it right he attached himself so eagerly to business that he thought every hour lost in which he was not doing something that would tend to raise me the more prosperous he grew the less religious he became and i began to find that one might be unhappy with a husband one tenderly loved one day as he was standing on some steps to reach down some goods he fell from the top and broke his leg in two places  what a dreadful misfortune said mrs betty what a signal blessing said mrs simpson here i am sure i had reason to say all was for the best from that very hour in which my outward troubles began i date the beginning of my happiness severe suffering a near prospect of death absence from the world silence reflection and above all the divine blessing on the prayers and scriptures i read to him were the means used by our merciful father to turn my husbands heart during this consinement he was awakened to a deep sense of his own sinfulness of the vanity of all this world has to bestow and of his great need of a savior it was many months before he could leave his bed during this time his business was neglected his principal clerk took advantage of his absence to receive large sums of money in his name and absconded on hearing of this great loss our creditors came faster upon us than we could answer their demands they grew more impatient as we were less able to satisfy them one misfortune followed another till at length mr simpson became a bankrupt  what an evil exclaimed mrs betty yet it led in the end to much good resumed mrs simpson we were forced to leave the town in which we had lived with so much credit and comfort and to betake ourselves to a mean lodging in a neighboring village till my husbands strength should be recruited and till we could have time to look about us and see what was to be done the first night we got to this poor dwelling my husband felt very sorrowful not for his own sake but that he had brought so much poverty on me whom he so dearly loved i on the contrary was unusually cheerful for the blessed change in his mind had more than reconciled me to the sad change in his circumstances i was contented to live with him in a poor cottage for a few years on earth if it might contribute to our spending a blessed eternity together in heaven i said to him instead of lamenting that we are now reduced to want all the comforts of life i have sometimes been almost ashamed to live in the full enjoyment of them when i have reflected that my savior not only chose to deny himself all these enjoyments but even to live a life of hardship for my sake not one of his numerous miracles tended to his own comfort and though we read at different times that he both hungered and thirsted yet it was not for his own gratification that he once changed water into wine it was for others not himself that even the humble sustenance of barley bread was multiplied see here we have a bed left us i had indeed nothing but straw to stuff it with but the savior of the world had not where to lay his head my husband smiled through his tears and we sat down to supper it consisted of a roll and a bit of cheese i had brought with me and we ate it thankfully after we had prayed together we read the eleventh chap of the epist to the hebrews when my husband had finished it he said surely if gods chief favorites have been martyrs is not that a sufficient proof that this world is not the place of happiness nor earthly prosperity the reward of virtue shall we after reading this chapter complain of our petty trials shall we not rather be thankful that our affliction is so light  next day mr simpson walked out in search of some employment by which we might be supported he got a recommendation to an opulent farmer and factor who had large concerns and wanted a skilful person to assist him in keeping his accounts this we thought a fortunate circumstance for we found that the salary would serve to procure us at least all the necessaries of life the farmer was so pleased with mr simpsons quickness regularity and good sense that he offered us of his own accord a little neat cottage of his own which then happened to be vacant and told us we should live rent free and promised to be a friend to us  all does seem for the best now indeed interrupted mrs betty we shall see said mrs simpson who thus went on   i now became very easy and very happy and was cheerfully employed in putting our few things in order and making every thing look to the best advantage my husband who wrote all the day for his employer in the evenings assisted me in doing up our little garden this was a source of much pleasure to us we both loved a garden and we were not only contented but cheerful our employer had been absent for some weeks on his annual journey he came home on a saturday night and the next morning sent for mr simpson to come and settle his accounts which were got behind hand by his long absence we were just going to church and mr simpson sent back word that he would call and speak to him on his way home a second message followed ordering him to come to the farmers directly he agreed that we would walk round that way and that my husband should call and excuse his attendance the farmer more ignorant and worse educated than his plowmen with all that pride and haughtiness which wealth without knowledge or religion is apt to give rudely asked my husband what he meant by sending him word that he could not come to him till the next day and insisted that he should stay and settle the accounts then sir said my husband in a very respectful manner i am on my road to church and am afraid i shall be too late   are you so said the farmer do you know who sent for you you may however go to church if you will so you make haste back and do you hear you may leave your accounts with me as i conclude you have brought them with you i will look them over by the time you return and then you and i can do all i want to have done to day in about a couple of hours and i will give you home some letters to copy for me in the evening   sir answered my husband i dare not obey you it is sunday  and so you refuse to settle my accounts only because it is sunday  sir replied mr simpson if you would give me a handful of silver and gold i dare not break the commandment of my god  well said the farmer but i dont order you to drive my cattle or to work in my garden or to do any think which you might fancy would be a bad example  sir replied my husband the example indeed goes a great way but it is not the first object the deed is wrong in itself   well but i shall not keep you from church and when you have been there there is no harm in doing a little business or taking a little pleasure the rest of the day  sir answered my husband the commandment does not say thou shall keep holy the sabbath morning but the sabbath day  get out of my house you puritanical rascal and out of my cottage too for if you refuse to do my work i am not bound to keep my engagement with you as you will not obey me as a master   sir said mr simpson i would gladly obey you but i have a master in heaven whom i dare not disobey   then let him find employment for you said the enraged farmer for i fancy you will get but poor employment on earth with these scrupulous notions and so send home my papers directly and pack off out of the parish   out of your cottage said my husband i certainly will but as to the parish i hope i may main in that if i can find employment  i will make it too hot to hold you replied the farmer so you had better troop off bag and baggage for i am overseer and you are sickly it is my duty not to let any vagabonds stay in this parish who are likely to become chargeable  by the time my husband returned home for he found it too late to go to church i had got our little dinner ready it was a better one than we had for a long while been accustomed to see and i was unusually cheerful at this improvement in our circumstances i saw his eye full of tears and oh with what pain did he bring himself to tell me that it was the last dinner we must ever eat in that house i took his hand with a smile and only said the lord gave and the lord takes away blessed be the name of the lord   notwithstanding this sudden stroke said my husband this is still a happy country our employer it is true may turn us out at a moments notice because the cottage is his own but he has no further power over us he cannot confine or punish us his riches it is true give him power to insult but not to oppress us and as to our being driven out from a cottage how many persons of the highest rank have lately been driven out from their palaces and castles persons born in a station which we never enjoyed and used to all the indulgences of that rank and wealth we never knew are at this moment wandering over the face of the earth without a house and without bread exiles and beggars while we blessed be god are in our own native land we have still our liberty our limbs the protection of just and equal laws our churches our bibles and our sabbaths  this happy state of my husbands mind hushed my sorrows and i never once murmured nay i sat down to dinner with a degree of cheerfulness endeavoring to cast all our care on him who cares for us we had begged to stay till the next morning as sunday was not the day on which we liked to remove but we were ordered not to sleep another night in that house so as we had little to carry we marched off in the evening to the poor lodging we had before occupied the thought that my husband had cheerfully renounced his little all for conscience sake gave an unspeakable serenity to my mind and i felt thankful that though cast down we were not forsaken nay i felt a lively gratitude to god that while i doubted not he would accept this little sacrifice he had graciously forborne to call us to greater trials  and so you were turned adrist once more well maam saving your presence i hope you will not be such a fool to say all was for the best now   yes betty he who does all things well now made his kind providence more manifest than ever that very night while we were sweetly sleeping in our poor lodging the pretty cottage out of which we had been so unkindly driven was burnt to the ground by a flash of lightning which caught the thatch and so completely consumed the whole little building that had it not been for that merciful providence who thus overuled the cruelty of the farmer for the preservation of our lives we must have been burnt to ashes with the house  o that men would therefore praise the lord for his goodness and for all the wonders that he does for the children of men  i will not tell you all the trials and troubles which befell us afterward because i would spare my heart the sad story of my husbands death  well that was another blessing too i suppose said betty oh it was the severest trial ever sent me i almost sunk under it at the time and yet i now feel it to be the greatest mercy i ever experienced he was my idol no trouble came very near my heart while he was with me i prayed and struggled indeed to be weaned from this world but still my affection for him tied me down to earth with a strong cord and though i did try to keep my eye fixed on the eternal world yet i viewed it at too great a distance i had deceived myself  i fancied i bore my troubles so well from the pure love of god but i now find that my love for my husband had too great a share in reconciling me to every trouble which i underwent for him i lost him the charm was broken the cord which tied me down to earth was cut this world had nothing left to engage me heaven had now no rival in my heart though my love of god had been always sincere i found there wanted this blow to make it perfect but though all that had made life pleasant to me was gone i did not sink as one who had no hope i prayed that i might even now be enabled to adore the doctrine of god of my savior  after many more hardships i at length got an asylum in this almshouse here my cares are at an end but not my duties i can still read and pray with the sick in my younger days i thought it not much to sit up late for my pleasure shall i now think much of sitting up now and then to watch by a dying bed my savior waked and watched for me in the garden and on the mount it is only by keeping his sufferings before me that i can practice true selfdenial just as mrs simpson was saying these words a letter was brought her from the minister of the parish where the farmer lived by whom mr simpson had been turned out of his cottage the letter was as follows  madam i write to tell you that your old oppressor mr thomas is dead i attended him in his last moments o may my latter end never be like his i shall not soon forget his despair at the approach of death his riches which had been his sole joy now doubled his sorrows for he was going where they could be of no use to him and he found too late that he had laid up no treasure in heaven he felt great concern at his past life but for nothing more than his unkindness to mr simpson he charged me to find you out and let you know that by his will he had bequeathed you five hundred pounds as some compensation he died in great agonies declaring with his last breath that if he could live his life over again he would serve god and strictly observe the sabbath  yours j johnson   mrs betty who had listened attentively to the letter jumped up clapped her hands and cried out now all is for the best and i shall see you a lady once more  i am indeed thankful for this mercy said mrs simpson and am glad that riches were not sent me till i had learnt as i humbly hope to make a right use of them but come let us go in for i am very cold and find i have sat too long in the night air  betty was now ready enough to acknowledge the hand of providence in this prosperous event though she was blind to it when the dispensation was more dark next morning she went early to visit mrs simpson but not seeing her below she went up stairs where to her great sorrow she found her confined to her bed by a fever caught the night before by sitting so late on the bench reading the letter and talking it over betty was now more ready to cry out against providence than ever what to catch a fever while you were reading that very letter which told you about your good fortune which would have enabled you to live like a lady as you are i never will believe this is for the best i did think that providence was at last giving you your reward  reward cried mrs simpson o no my merciful father will not put me off with so poor a portion as wealth i feel i shall die  it is very hard indeed said betty so good as you are to be taken off just as your prosperity was beginning  you think i am good just now said mrs simpson because i am prosperous success is no sure mark of gods favor at this rate you who judge by outward things would have thought herod a better man than john the baptist and if i may be allowed to say so you on your principles would have believed pontius pilate higher in gods favor than the savior whom he condemned to die for your sins and mine  in a few days mrs betty found that her new friend was dying and though she was struck at her resignation she could not forbear murmuring that so good a woman should be taken off at the very time she came into possession of so much money betty said the dying woman do you really think that i am going to a place of rest and joy eternal   to be sure i do said betty do you fimly believe that i am going to the assembly of the first born to the spirits of just men made perfect to god the judge of all and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant   i am sure you are said betty and yet resumed the dying woman you would detain me from all this happiness and you think my merciful father is using me unkindly by removing me from a world of sin and sorrow and temptation to such joys as have not entered into the heart of man to conceive while it would have better suited your notions of reward to defer the blessedness of heaven that i might have enjoyed a legacy of a few hundred pounds  mrs simpson expired soon after in a frame of mind which convinced her new friend that gods ways are not as our ways   finis
