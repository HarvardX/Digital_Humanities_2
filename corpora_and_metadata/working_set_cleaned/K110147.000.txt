at large of sir walter ralegh his condemnation long imprisonment in the tower and execution  the whole compiled from the most approved authorities and curious manuscripts  london printed for the booksellers in town and country  m dccxl  the life of sir walter ralegh though abundance of solid particulars are naturally sunk in the rapid current of time while many less substantial are floating upon the surface to the hand of every ordinary memorialist and though some shining circumstances in the prosperous part of sir walter raleghs life have been darkened through envy as others in the unfortunate period through interest by the age in which he lived nevertheless his single life may perhaps be found more fruitful of memorable incidents than many histories of entire ages insomuch as i may be apprehensive with a late collector of his memoirs that the describing a person of so diffusive a praise so equally great in so many different parts of life will be like attempting a landscape from a high hill where the multiplicity and extent of the prospects may rather distract the mind than direct it and call for judgment to restrain the fancy which is apt to run riot when employed upon too many objects many guides may indeed appear to lead us through this wilderness but numerous as the authors are who mention him they contain but fragments of his story diverse whereof hitherto widely dispersed have escaped not only our general historians but the many compilers of distinct pieces on his actions even the moderns who have treated of him with impartiality have yet been deficient in point of industry so as to prove no less injurious to his merits than some who in his own age conspired to depreciate them hence the generality having been too superficial and undigested having neither regarded due choice and order of matter proportion in the parts or connection of the whole nor yet discharged themselves by such references to proper vouchers as might satisfy those readers it is my ambition to please i have esteemed the number of such writers no discouragement to the revival of his story  and first for the name of ralegh otherwise written rale and ralega in some old deeds i have formerly seen it is certainly of great antiquity in this kingdom since there are some villages and towns in the west as well as other parts so called which might at first receive their denomination from some as well as afterward give it to others who were natives or possessors thereof and since we are credibly informed that one of those districts belonged anciently to noble lords of the same name as also that several of them were so called from the very family we are to speak of and as the raleghs of devonshire will appear to have flourished there before the conquest they might be the progenitors of those in other countries as it is expressly intimated out of the records they were of those in warwickshire but as we are also told of no less than five knights of this name at one time differently situated in that western county before mentioned and that there were three great families so named also there contemporary with sir walter raleghs who bore arms different from those of his paternal coat we may conclude they were not all of one lineage and at the same time that it is owing to the eminency of this great man that a distinction of the several houses and his in particular when all but his were in a manner extinct has been so elaborately endeavored by the antiquaries and genealogists of his own time  as to the family of sir walter ralegh therefore in particular it is generally agreed on that smalridge in the parish of axminster in the county of devon was one of their most ancient seats but sir william pole who is said to have been one of the greatest searchers into the antiquities of that country has been singularly short in the time of their first settling there however if we should agree with him upon that person for sir walter raleghs direct ancestor who first removed thither out of nettlecombralegh in somersetshire in the reign of king henry iii from whom there is a successive descent of those six knights sir wimond in a visitationbook made anno      of the counties of wilts dorset and somerset among the ms collections of brown willis esquire of whaddon hall in bucks there is a pedigree of sir walter raleghs family from the reign of king john with a copy whereof that worthy antiquary having obliged me i find this wymond in the time of king henry iii is therein called lord of coliton and nettlecomb so it may seem the estate in somersetshire was of latter accession to the family and that in devonshire the more ancient seat or that the removal was made rather to the former than the latter county sir hugh sir john sir peter and two sir johns more besides others who were either of the same degree themselves or married into families distinguished with it even down to wimond the grandfather of sir walter ralegh i know not but it may be also allowed that the honors of this pedigree were sufficient to have been boasted of by some of his traducers for though in the eye of heraldry many titles are accounted more noble than knighthood though native and patrimonial dignities or such as descend necessarily from father to son may in the eye of the common lineal claimant appear most legitimate and such as are venal be esteemed in that of the wealthy most valuable yet those which are personal the individual acquisition or recompense of every mans proper merit will in the eye of reason be held most honorable  john hooker a famous antiquary mr hooker who was the first chamberlain of exeter about      and twice member of parliament for that city as we find in the notitia parliamentaria by brown willis esquire vol        p     as also for athenry in ireland about    0 as i find by his own words did actually set forth in print his tracts about the government of exeter and bishops of that see besides his augmentations of the english and irish chronicles with other pieces before or by the year      and having lived to near eighty years died in   0  according to anthony wood and my said author prince in his life though the former of them quotes from hookers own words that he was living in   0  if it is not a mistake of the press and the latter has made no boggle at the blunder in one of his performances gives us to understand that smalridge was in the possession of the raleghs before the norman conquest and that one of the family being taken prisoner by the gauls did for his deliverance upon st leonards day build at his return home a chapel there consecrated to that saint and therein as a grateful monument hung up his target the records of which foundation are said to have been given by a priest of axminster to sir walter ralegh as their most rightful owner hookers synopsis chronographical or historical record of devonshire a ms as quoted by prince fol   0 a copy whereof in this authors time was in the custody of mr john eastchurch of wood in that county still extant as i have heard in those parts and pity it is that it has not yet seen the public light since above a hundred years ago it was revised by so able a judge of its worth as sir john dodderidge and had his recommendation to the press so much for the antiquity of the family in devonshire and as for its derivation the said hooker even in a printed dedication to sir walter ralegh as i hinted which he repeatedly confirms in the aforesaid performance not only avouches his alliance to the courtenays earls of devon and other illustrious houses but traces the stream of consanguinity up to the kings of england where he says that one of his ancestors in the directest line sir john de ralegh of fardel another seat of their ancient inheritance in the parish of cornwood eight miles east of plymouth espoused the daughter of sir roger damerei who married elizabeth daughter of gilbert earl of gloucester by joan dacres daughter of king edward i which gilbert was descended of robert earl of gloucester son of king henry i so goes up to the conqueror and farther adds that in like manner he may be derived by his mother also out of the same house but since these two authors the likeliest we have in print to have confirmed us in the truth of this matter vary thus from each other since sir william pole thought it rather another family of the raleghs which was thus royally descended since also five or six ancient pedigrees of this family which i have seen in manuscript by the heraldical visitors and antiquaries of those western parts also differ not only from hooker but in several points both from sir william pole and from one another and lastly since it will be considered that i have not undertaken to account for the whole race of the raleghs but only one select person of the name here let the truth as to these remote ancestors or alliances hover for me for i am not moved on the wings of conjecture to make myself a party with any of those antiquaries nor shall endeavor to compromise the difference between them unless such prevailing authorities had occurred as would enable me to do it with certanity besides as those whose virtues have adorned them with a sufficiency of personal honors are ever least anxious about such as are relative so it might well argue but little weight in the judgment of a historian to show himself contentious about these feathers for his worthy especially such a one as shall be found to have thought so justly light of them himself  however as all accounts allow him a very honorable extract let us prefer which we please the freedom some great courtiers took in calling him jack and upstart upon his advancement to queen elizabeths favor is thought to have somewhat reflected rather on themselves in suffering their sprightly parts to take such advantage of their noble principles one of these sarcasms i find recorded by lord bacon in his little book of apophthegms where he says that when queen elizabeth had advanced ralegh she was one day playing on the virginals and my lord of oxford with another nobleman stood by when it happened that the ledge before the jacks was taken away so that they were seen whereupon that lord and the other nobleman smiled and whispered a little the queen marked it and would needs know what was the matter his lordship answered they laughed to see that when jacks went up heads went down though the application of this reflection particularly to ralegh if such was made is disputable notwithstanding lord bacons allusion yet it is plain that sir robert naunton who was secretary of state at the time of raleghs death and whose observations on that queens favorites were written though not printed before those apophthegms thought also that it was made upon ralegh for he has said with relation to this jest by that witty earl we all know it savours more of emulation and his humor than of truth it being a certain note of the times that the queen in her choice never took into her favor a mere new man or a mechanic but it is believed sir walter ralegh himself was afterward pretty even with his qualitycritics where he so solidly exposes the emptiness of merit nay the real detriment to it in posteritys being entitled to the rewards of their ancestors virtues by hereditary honors succession of blood and nobility in parchment those only being truly noble who by worthy acts have rendered themselves most notable  all therefore that needs be added on this head as a matter more immediately requisite and indeed sufficient for my present purpose is that sir walter ralegh was the son of walter ralegh esquire of fardel aforesaid who being thrice married had by his first wife joan daughter of john drake of exmouth in devon esquire two sons one named george and the other john which last married anne the daughter of sir bartholomew fortescue of filley in devon and relict of  gaicrick of ford and they had issue his second wife was daughter of one darell of london by whom he had a daughter named mary who was married to hugh snedale of hilling in cornwall esquire and had issue his third wife was catherine daughter of sir philip champernon of modbury and relict of otho gilbert of compton in devon esquire he had by this last venture his third son carew afterward knighted and of wiltshire who married dorothy daughter of sir william wroughton and relict of sir john tbynn by whom he had issue and lastly his fourth son named walter the subject of our ensuing discourse who was thereby the uterine brother of those three eminent knights sir john sir humphry and sir adrian gilbert by this last wife mr ralegh had also one daughter named margaret who was married first to  radford of mount radford in devon clerk of the peace and afterward to  hull of larkebre esquire in st leonards parish exeter  the family was indeed at this time much declined from its former splendour of fame and affluence of fortune for the estate of smalridge which remained in the name of ralegh to the time of king henry viii was then sold by sir walters grandfather wimond to john the father of sir john gilbert of compton but i cannot find it reduced to that low ebb in the latter respect which some have intimated for fardel remained still in their possession which after the death of sir walters father sell to the eldest son george and there were besides widdycomb ralegh and colitonralegh in their possession the former of which was sold by sir walters elder brother sir carew ralegh to george the natural son of george aforesaid and the latter was sold by sir walter himself to richard martin or his father of exeter but neither of these places claim the honor of his birth  for his father having the remainder of a fourscoreyears lease in a pleasant farm called hayes situate in the parish of budley in that part of devonshire bordering eastward upon the sea near where the ottery or river of otters discharges itself into the british channel and residing upon the said farm during the time of his last marriage this was the birthplace of sir walter ralegh and it is accordingly distinguished as for nothing more remarkable by topographical writers to this day after the expiration of that lease ralegh applied but unsuccessfully to mr duke of otterton to whom the estate devolved to fell it him as appears by raleghs letter to him wherein he says that for the natural disposition he ad to the place being born in that house he had rather seat himself there than any where else from whence it seems that what some are by another devonian antiquary said to have reported and himself appears only to have recorded as if sir walter ralegh was born in the city of exeter and in the house adjoining to the palacegate has no authority and perhaps had not so much as rumor to countenance it  as to the time of his birth i find the computation has been made from camden s account of his age at his death that he was born in the year      and herewith corresponds an observation i have found in an astrological author who fixing his birth in the sixth year of king edward vi which answers to the year of our lord aforesaid calls it a year remarkable in our chronicles first for that strange shole of the largest seafishes which quitting their native waters for fresh and untasted streams wandered up the thames so high till the river no longer retained any brackishness and secondly for that it is thought to have been somewhat stained in our annals with the blood of the noble seymer duke of somerset events says he surprisingly analogous both to the life of this adventurous voyager sir walter ralegh whose delight was in the hazardous discovery of unfrequented coasts and also to his unfortunate death  that his younger years were seasoned at the university of oxford we may gather from good authorities as hooker aforesaid lord bacon and anthony wood which last says he became commoner of oriel college in or about the year      when his kinsman c champernon studied there and that his natural parts being strangely advanced by academical learning under the care of an excellent tutor he became the ornament of the juniors and was worthily esteemed a proficient in oratory and philosophy but in that he came so late thither as this author mentions and stayed so long there as three years is a mistake for he will presently appear two years before that time amounts to in the wars abroad what time then can we spare for his residence at christchurch college also in that university whereof dr fuller would needs have him a member either before or after he was of oriel unless we could find as i fear we shall not that he returned from the school of mars to that of the muses little more can we expect to have been observed of this remote part of his life and yet something more in it has been preserved by lord bacon aforesaid who had the judgment to foresee that every little circumstance would be acceptable of a man whose fortunes and misfortunes had rendered him so memorable and indeed it has been represented to me as a matter of no small honor to sir walter ralegh that a casual expression of his in his immature and greenest years should prefer it self to the commemoration of that great philosopher in his sagest and most advanced age but as he had observed on the nature of things that great objects may be discerned through a little crevice so he knew with respect to the nature of men that a great discovery of genius may be made through a small and sudden repartee and hence might he be moved to remember that while ralegh was a scholar at oxford there was a cowardly fellow who happened to be a very good archer but having been grossly abused by another he bemoaned himself to ralegh and asked his advice what he should do to repair the wrong that had been offered him ralegh answered why challenge him  at a match of shooting  how long he continued at the university is at last rightly concluded by anthony wood to be uncertain but as sure as he thinks himself right in settling him a student of the municipal laws in the middle temple upon seeing a copy of verses he might write in that inn of conrt i take this assertion to be a greater uncertainty than the other for though sir robert naunton and possibly from him most other writers of raleghs life have also consigned him to the study of the law on his leaving oxford there is a late author who believes it a mistake so obvious that no merit can reasonably be assumed from correcting it for sir walter at his arraignment in a reply to the attorney general lays a heavy imprecation upon himself if ever he read a word of law or statutes before he was a prisoner in the tower so that if this ralegh was the author of that poem before mentioned and of the middle temple in that year it was written which we shall presently arrive at we must yet take care to keep the lawyer clear from the templar  for we are expressly told by hooker that after ralegh had laid a good ground to build his actions on at the university he traveled into france and this is confirmed by camden according to whose account of the time ralegh could not be at his departure above seventeen years of age and by the occasion of his first going over it will appear that a military course of life first fledged his fame for as it has been rightly observed ralegh had the advantage of a stirring age to encourage and exercise his active genius throughout the whole series of his first engagements france was now embroiled in civil wars england soon after to divert a menaced danger from the encroaching power of spain lent assistance to the then distressed and humble states of holland spain by a political reprisal raised stubborn insurrections in ireland and the pope to make the rebellion more permanent and more plausible religiously pretended that kingdom was a perquisite of st peter  but first of france and here we need not recur to the original of those commotions there need not trace the hugonots to their fountainhead apologize for their oppositions against the guisards labor to reconcile queen elizabeths defense of another princes oppressed subjects to the laws of nations when imminent danger by such oppressions threatened her own nor lastly aggravate her motives against france in particular from their late violation of covenants relating to the rendition of calais these topics being to be sought where they have already been and it is more proper they should be directly discussed sufficient therefore it will be to observe in this place out of camdens annals that though the queen had her hand full of disorders at home yet she was not wanting either in commiseration or relief to the persecuted protestants of france and not only exhorted other princes of the same persuasion to lend their hands to the common cause but supplied the queen of navarre with money and men to support it permitting henry champernon a relation by marriage of the earl of montgomery to match with a select troop of a hundred gentlemen volunteers well mounted and accoutred into france who bore in their standard this motto finem det mihi virtus let valor decide the cause in the list of these volunteers was philip butshed with francis barcley men afterward of note in their time and this walter ralegh the most noted of all then a very young man and first beginning to push his fortune in the world admodum adolescens jam primum satis monstratus says our above cited annalist  the greatest historian in france of those times tells us this select troop of horse arrived in the french camp on the  th of october      and that they were very honorably received by the queen of navarre and the princes but what services distinctly they performed in france or how long they continued there neither the writers of that country nor of our own have i think given full satisfaction this consequence we draw from some circumstances in the latter part of raleghs life that he established himself a considerable reputation while he was in that kingdom and from hooker that he spent good part of his youth in wars and martial services there agreeable to which is that passage in another author who also seems to have known him where speaking of his education he adds it was not part but wholly gentleman wholly soldier  some french historians tell us that what with the supplies of queen elizabeth who sent the french protestants a hundred thousand angels besides some pieces of cannon and ammunition and what with the aids of their other allies the protestant army which took the field under admiral coligny and the prince of conde and encamped about limosin this year of raleghs going over being in the beginning of their third civil war amounted to no less than   000 fighting men when the kings army under his brother the duke of anjou being encamped at rochlabeille amounted to above  0000 but others reckon the protestant army of equal number and observe though their men and horse died at limosin in great numbers for want of food and forage and though a great reward was offered for the admiral dead or alive that it only added fuel to the fire for what terror could it strike says my author into persons who headed an army of  0000 men and ventured their lives with the utmost bravery on all occasions as for the insincere league or union of france and england by the pretended marriage which appears to have been negotiated two years after between the two crowns it seems not to have withdrawn these english auxiliaries at least not him along with them because raleghs continuance in france would then fall short of hookers implication aforesaid but as we shall discover him to have been in that kingdom beyond the death of king charles ix which from raleghs entrance thither is about five years and that in this compass of time near  0 battles sieges overthrows treaties and capitulations on one side or other may be enumerated it is manifest that our young volunteer was hazardously engaged in some if not several of them he had afterward occasion to mention upon his observing here the ill consequence of having commanders in equal power whom it is almost impossible to choose of equal courage and discretion in another place ralegh speaks of a stratagem which he and his company used with success at languedoc where the enemy had fortified themselves in certain caves which had but one narrow entrance cut in the midway of the high rocks and which says he we knew not how to enter by any ladder or engine till at last by certain bundles of lighted straw let down by an iron chain with a weighty stone in the midst those that defended it were so smothered that they surrendered themselves with their plate money and other goods therein hidden or they must have died like bees that are smoaked out of their hives and in another place he gratefully takes notice of a deliverance he had in these wars it is where reasoning upon the manner and opportunities of retreats in battle he first gives an example of its being less dishonor to retire in the dark than to be ruined in the light in the sentiment of m de la noue upon the retreat made just before the battle of moncountour for says that frenchman staying upon our reputation in show not to dislodge by night we lost our reputation indeed in dislodging by day whereby we were forced to fight upon our disadvantage and to our ruin yet says ralegh did that worthy gentleman count lodowick of nassau brother to the late famous prince of orange make the retreat at moncountour with so great resolution as he saved one half of the protestant army then broken and disbanded of which myself was an eyewitness and was one of them who had cause to thank him for it but by what means ralegh escaped that comprehensive destruction which broke out in the third year of this turbulent period unless with young sidney afterward a knight of great renown for his own accomplishments and the patronage of other mens then upon his travels in france he took sanctuary in the ambassador walsinghams house see diggess complete ambassador fol   0 we despair at this distance of learning for then the cruel and insidious young king aforesaid inflamed by the queen mother and her firebrands of religion perpetrated that horrible massacre of all the protestants in the capital city and other parts of his realm the invitation to which was the nuptials of his sister the signal to which was the bell they rung to their pious mattins and in the execution whereof among many thousands fell the great admiral aforesaid by the procurement of his implacable enemy the duke of guise the massacre of paris was begun on st bartholomews day      and if between mezerays estimate of the numbers that were butchered over france which is one of the least and perefixes which is one of the largest we incline to the medium we shall prefer the computation of natalis comes who wrote earlier and about the very time he reckons them at threescore thousand and so insatiable was the fury of these parricides that they spared neither age sex nor quality but yet sir w ralegh in one of his ms discourses on the marriage between england and savoy hereafter more particularly spoken of numbers them not yet so high as some of their own historians at no less than a hundred thousand and margaret queen of navarre consesses in her memoirs live   that several of her brothers friends fell as well as his enemies in the blind rage of this diffusive and undistinguishing desolation insomuch that in contempt of all princely promises and protestations of amity their historians were suffered to boast more heretics had been destroyed in that one day than in all the twelve years of the war well therefore did that deputy of the reformed religion in his treaty for a peace with the king and queen mother which they agreed to insist upon security for the preservation of it and when the queen mother said why is not the word of a king sufficient security well did he answer no by st bartholomew madam how much this flagrant exploit was gloried in over france and rome their processions thanksgivings medals and jubilee will sufficiently declare and though the comet which soon after glared out of the face of heaven upon these bloody actors for many months together this blazing star on which  0 different books were written which had been read by tycho brahe the noble dane before he composed his larger work thereon first appeared on the  th of november      in the form of a lozenge of four points and continued immovable nine months says de serres sir thomas smith in a letter dated december    that year to sir f walsingham describes it a fair comet without beard or tail on the backside of cassiopeias chair and on the edge of lactea via that it was between the size of jupiter and venus and had then appeared three weeks in england but camden in his annals of queen elizabeth more particularly observes it to have shone brighter than the planet of jupiter in the perigree of his eccentric and epicycle that it continued in the same place full sixteen months though after eight months it visibly diminished mr thomas digges and dr john dee two famous mathematicians of those times have learnedly proved by the doctrine of parallexes that it was fixed in the celestial not the elementary region and that it disappeared by ascension theodore beza very ingeniously applied it to the star which appeared at the slaughter of the innocents under herod and queen elizabeths gallant comportment at the sight of it from her window at richmond which ought not to have escaped her annalist aforesaid is preserved by the earl of northampton in his learned defensative against the poison of supposed prophecies  d edit fol    0 p    seems to have wrought little remorse or contrition in them during life yet is their untimely and violent end with the extirpation of the very line of valois somewhat remarkable especially that of this king himself whose early delight in hunting of wild beasts thus improved to the slaughter of his fellow creatures till in less than two years after that inhuman massacre his insatiable thirst of his peoples blood was quenched by an irresistible extravasation of his own that extraordinary eruption of blood carried off king charles ix on the  0th of may      in the   th year of his age his successor henry iii was stabbed to death by a jacobin friar named james clement anno      in that very chamber where the council had been held for the fatal bartholomews day so made way for the house of bourbon and the duke of guise was murdered in the said kings cabinet at blois about a year before see the historians of france   now that ralegh was till the death of that king and even longer in france we may be fully convinced from the further light i have fortunately met with in an eminent author of his own time for mr richard hackluyt in his most excellent collection of voyages dedicating his translation of a french adventure therein to sir walter ralegh tells him that calling to mind you had spent more years in france than i and understand the french better than myself i perceived you approve my endeavor not for any private ease but for the special care you had of those to be employed in your own like enterprise and how long hakluyt had been in france appears in his dedication to sir francis walsingham of his first edition of those voyages where he takes the occasion to tell his patrons that himself had been five years in that kingdom so that raleigh must have been at least six years there  and this will lead us near the time we are to look for him in london if we take for our guide in the chronology of raleghs life that copy of verses beforementioned which anthony wood took for his in relation to raleghs profession these verses i have found to be a commendatory poem of three stanzas by walter rawely of the middle temple as he is there written and printed among others before a satire called the steel glass published in      by a learned and ingenious poet of repute in those days named george gascoigne esquire  now though i have had the opportunity of seeing some original manuscripts of sir walter raleghs writing and his name written several times by his own hand i shall not cavil at the pseudography thereof before the said printed copy of verses because i could instance greater errors of the like nature which yet have not excluded authors from the reputation of their compositions but more especially because there are some glimmering circumstances which render the writing of that piece by this our author probable to me as namely a kind of familiar dependency which that gascoigne had upon the lord gray of wilton as in the dedication of this and some other of his works is evident under which nobleman ralegh will soon after appear to have served in the wars of ireland again gascoigne had led a life somewhat like ralegh in foreign travel and military services then it is to be noted gascoigne used the very motto under his picture prefixed to that satyr beforementioned which after his death is so well known to have been assumed by or appropriated to ralegh himself tam martii quam mercurio all which seem to shadow out the links if not the perfect chain of some acquaintance between them but the poem itself to me discovers in the very first line of it a great air of that solid axiomatical vein which is observable in other productions of raleghs muse sweet were the sauce would please each kind of taste   and the whole middle of hexastic is such an indication of his own fortune or fate such a caution against that envy of superior merit which he himself ever struggled with that it could proceed from no hand more properly than his own  though sundry minds in sundry sort do deem yet worthiest wights yield praise to every pain but envious brains do naught or light esteem such stately steps as they cannot attain for whosoever reaps renown above the rest with heaps of hate shall surely be oppressed lastly as to the particular of his being at this time of the middle temple all we can conclude of it is since he has so publicly and solemnly protested he never studied the law there that it might be as customary in the inns of court then as it is now for a young gentleman to be with a friend or have the use of his chambers while he is out of town or even have chambers of his own rather than be confined to the singularities of a family in lodgings and never read a word of the law much less have any purpose to practice it  his next stage of action was in the netherlands according to one of the writers of his life who tells us he served under the prince of orange as a volunteer against the spaniards making himself in the low countries master of the art military and confirming through the success of his first campaigns his resolution to advance himself by arms as the nobler and readier way to glory sir robert naunton also intimates that before he was in ireland under the lord gray he was engaged in the law countries and also in a voyage at sea another author likewise agrees in this low countries service and voyage at sea before ralegh was known at court but whereas the first of these two writers mentions an earlier expedition of raleghs in ireland before this of the low countries as his first exposure to a military life being ignorant of all the time he passed in the french wars and whereas the last fixes him in that first irish expedition under general norris i apprehend them to be herein both mistaken the former in that ralegh appears not to have been twice against the rebels in ireland nor once at his first engagement in war and the latter in that this norris appears not to be in ireland when the course of raleghs employments will allow him to have been in that kingdom but now that there is room for raleghs being in the netherlands we find general norris to be there  for the emperor charles natural son don john of austria a brisk forward young man flushed with the late victorious battle of lepanto against the turks and high in the popes favor being sent by his brother the king of spain in the year      governor of the low countries to divert his mind from higher reaches at home and having incurred the general odium of the states for his tyranny over them no less than the jealousy of the english for his treachery to this nation queen elizabeth thought the dutch now more immediately needful of her notice and more particularly from a discovery that had been made to her some say by the prince of orange of a vain project the said don john had formed of rescuing the queen of scots out of prison and by marriage with her or the force of arms to dethrone the queen of england and make himself master of her crown sor don johns haughty conceit of himself says ralegh overcame the greatest difficulties though his judgment was overweak to manage the least wherefore the queen not only receded from that peace with the spaniards and neutrality then in agitation but sent the states both men and money as they had requested to carry on the war more powerfully against them among the forces both english and scots which now poured over under sir john norris sir robert stewart colonel john north henry cavendish and others not to forget colonel thomas morgan whose veteran troops were the first perfect harquebusiers of our nation and the first who taught us to like the musket there is here and here only i think a vacancy in the story of ralegh that will admit of him under the first of those commanders so might he probably share in the danger and honor of that memorable lammas day anno      which buried the reputation of don john which this governor did not two months survive and which has raised the emulation of pencils as well as pens to commemorate for the states having thus gathered a powerful army and planted themselves near the village of rimenant about a league from mecklin don john at the head of some say thirty thousand men being assisted by the prince of parma mondragon and other the best commanders of spain now resolved to give them battle he made a furious onset but in the end by a notable stratagem was deluded to a great overthrow for perceiving as he thought the whole confederate army encamped before the said village in an open and inviting plain don john precipitously detached a stronger force to encounter them which so succeeded on both sides that the states army after a convenient resistance feigning a flight quitted this their counterfeit camp the spaniards eagerly pursuing in a scattered and disorderly manner to complete their supposed victory till amazed they found themselves in the midst of the fugitives true camp environed with nineteen thousand horse and foot a number considerably greater than the assailants to extricate themselves was impossible there was a river on one side when they attempted the thicket on the other it was lined with an armed ambuscade of english and scots and when they assaulted the trenches they could not sustain the fury of the artillery yet was the battle vigorously maintained from morning till night though the english and scots harrassd by a long and wearisome march came but a day some say but an hour to the field before the encounter began and yet partly through bravery partly through the sultry warmth of the weather or as one author has it more sensible of a little heat of the sun than any cold fears of death they made themselves further remarkable by stripping off armor and clothes and fighting in their shirts till at last those who had pursued the states army in a pretended flight were themselves driven with great slaughter to a real one  soon after his brother sir humphry gilbert having now newly obtained a patent of the queen to plant and inhabit some northern parts of america unpossessd by any prince with whom she was in alliance soon engaged ralegh upon his return into england who was always ready to grasp at every occasion that might reputably advance his fortune or his knowledge to embark in this adventure for though the coasts from the cape of florida northward to the isles now called the newfoundlands had been before discovered by john cabot the father with sebastian and sancius his sons both englishmen born through the authority and expense of king henry vii yet there wanted not only more inland researches and the establishment of christianity but the very trade and commerce with newfoundland was very slothfully neglected even since the reign of king edward vi and yet within four years before sir humphrey gilbert obtained his patent there resorted to the coasts of newfoundland for fish about fifty sail of english above a hundred sail of spaniards for cod and thirty more from biscay for whale to make trainoil above fifty sail of portuguese and about an hundred and fifty sail of the french and bretaigns my author observes that the trade our nation had then to iceland was the reason the english were not there in such numbers as other nations for our merchants and adventurers in his time enriched this nation considerably from their fishery in those parts as appears by that act wherein care is taken to prevent the exaction of any doles or taxes from them by the officers of the admiralty that they might not be discouraged from the merchandise of fish but transport it more plentifully into the realm and at more reasonable rates now gilbert having as i said procured an ample commission to repossess these advantages with improvement many gentlemen of good account resorted to him among whom was his brother ralegh so that from these preparations was expected a potent fleet nevertheless among such variety of volunteers dispositions were various which in the end bred division and even confusion of the attempt for after the shipping was by degrees prepared and the men ready to go aboard some disagreeing in opinion some shrinking at obedience and others failing of their promises and engagements the greater number were dispersed leaving the general with a few only of his assured friends however with these he ventured to sea where having tasted of no less misfortune he was shortly after driven to retire home with the loss of a tall ship and more to his grief of a valiant gentleman named miles morgan now this misfortune at sea and loss of a ship with that valiant gentleman i have not only reason to believe was by a sharp encounter they had with the spaniards however tenderly touched at that time perhaps to avoid their triumph but that ralegh was in this very engagement and his life in great danger thereby for there is another author who in his address to him before mentioned tells him that after his return from his landservices having gained sufficient knowledge and experience therein to the end that you might be every way able to serve your prince and commonwealth says he you were desirous to be acquainted with maritimal affairs then you together with your brother sir humphrey gilbert traveled the seas for the search of such countries as if they had then been discovered infinite commodities in sundry respects would have ensued and whereof there was no doubt if the fleet then accompanying you had according to appointment followed you or your self had escaped the dangerous sea fight when many of your company was slain and your ships therewith also sore battered and disabled  this ill success kept not these adventures long abroad and now new disturbances broke out which called for men of experience in war at home for the first dart of any consequence which was thrown from spain or rome upon ireland being in    0 we shall then find ralegh among that body of his countrymen which effectually broke its force and shielded off the mischief wherewith it would otherwise have galled that kingdom for as to the invasion of thomas stucley two years before it blew over into africa where that meteor of ostentation and tool of ambitious princes fell in the plains of alcazar and with royal company expired but now that james fitzmorris of the geraldine family was come over and not long after san josepho under the popes banner with spanish and italian forces to assist the desmonds in the munster rebellion and had landed in three ships at smerwick in kerry where having built a fort which they called fort del ore and refortifyd it with the benedictions of allen an irish and sanders an english jesuit the irish rebels under sir james and sir john brothers to the late earl of desmond soon resorted thither to join as the english forces also did to disperse them their ships were soon taken by thomas courtenay a devonshire gentleman and fitzmorris himself for a prey he had made of some garons and other cattle was by sir william burk and his sons soon lain and his quarters exposed at kilmallock the next whose fate drew on was sir james desmond who on the fourth of august in the above mentioned year having made an inroad upon muskerry and taken a great booty from sir cormac mac teige sheriff of cork the said sheriff making head against him recovered the booty wounded sir james mortally and took him prisoner in that condition he was kept till by letters from the lord justice named sir william pelham and the council he was delivered to sir warham sentleger then provost marshal of munster and to captain ralegh and according to the commission directed to them he was examined indicted arraigned and then upon judgment drawn hanged and quartered and his head and limbs impaled upon the citygates of cork sor a terror to his associates and a prey for the fowls of the air and this is the first appearance we meet with of ralegh in ireland enough to shake the report of those who say he was a militia there and had his first commission from arthur lord gray baron of wilton  but the chief commander in these parts at this time was the earl of ormond soon after governor of munster a man of such loyalty as to have reduced his rebellious brothers to allegiance and of such courage as constantly partaking in every danger with his own soldiers made him much beloved by all his adherents while his apparent contempt thereby of that danger gained him no less fear from all his adversaries he on the other side bending his course against the foreign enemy encamped his army at tralegh within ken of the spanish fort aforesaid hereupon many of those invaders dislodged whom the earl valiantly engaged slaying some and taking others prisoners the rest flew to the coverts of glaningell the prisoners he took confessed their force was not above seven hundred strong but that they had brought arms and ammunition for five thousand natives besides a mass of money for the desmonds and dr sanders and daily expected farther supplies from rome for it was absolutely determined by the pope and king philip to make a complete conquest of ireland and england besides nay so confident they seemed of success if we can credit the assertion of an author who was this year in spain that his holiness had provided a chalice to drink the queen of englands precious blood says he as soon as she should be made a sacrifice now after the aforesaid defeat about  00 of the enemy having made their way back to the fort the earl followed them close and encamped at dingle but wanting ammunition for a battery was forced to retire and finding himself of unequal force to withstand another salley the spaniards made returned to join the deputy at rakele who having now about eight hundred horse and foot with him under the conduct of captain ralegh zouch denny mackworth and others decamped and marched up toward the fort but ralegh who had observed it to be the custom of the irish kerns upon any dislodgement of the english camp to flock in parties thither and glean away whatever they saw left behind lingered and lay in ambush to receive them they came accordingly with their wonted constancy and greediness but in the midst of their proling ralegh fell upon them so advantageously that he enclosed them all with his men and took every rebel upon the spot who was not slain in resistance among them there was one laden with withies who being demanded what he intended to have done with them boldly answered to have hung up the english churls well said ralegh but they shall now serve for an irish kern so commanded him to be immediately tucked up in one of his own neckbands and dealt with the rest of these robbers and murderers according to their deserts we read of another irish rebel but of greater rank named brian o rourk who being afterward to suffer at the gallows showed great concern that it was to be by the common halter and earnestly petitioned not for pardon or preservation of his life but that they would change the instrument of his death and instead of a rope to let him take his swing in a withy but being asked why he insisted upon such an insignificant distinction he answered twas a distinction had been paid to his countrymen before him  while the lord deputy lay before the fort there arrived in the bay of smerwick vice admiral bingham and soon after sir william winter admiral of the fleet with fresh supplies hereupon the lord deputy resolved to besiege the fort by land while the admiral should batter it by sea but first the spaniards were summoned to surrender at discretion they answered they were sent some from the holy father who had given that realm to king philip and some from that king who was to recover this land to the church of rome which by her majestys means was become schismatical and excommunicate therefore in short were obliged to retain what they had and recover what they could nor did they omit the advantage they thought this parley would produce of finding the english unguarded to make a sally upon them but they were so disappointed through the vigilance and valor of raleghs company and that of captain denny that such as were not left dead behind were forced to retreat with more haste than good speed the culverins and other pieces of ordnance being now landed and a large mountainous bank laboriously cut through for the carriages to pass to the place convenient for planting them the deputy is said to have given the enemy another summons by cannonshot to surrender and receive mercy but they answered as before thereupon the artillery was ordered to attack the fort both by land and water ralegh commanded the first three days after the opening of the trenches and assaulted the fort so roughly from his battery that he forced the spaniards to several excursions but they skirmishd so warily and hived again so nimbly that there was no closing with them effectually the fourth day was commanded by zouch under whom john cheke the son of a knight well known among the learned for his writings venturing so near the fort as to look over the parapet being observed by a spaniard who levelled his piece and brought him to the ground but now the trenches for the full battery were drawn so near the spaniards and the english played their cannon so furiously and incessantly upon them from every side and finding no succors arrive they beat a parley and hung out the white flag crying out misericordia misericordia but the lord deputy would not listen to any treaty with the confederates of traitors and rebels no not so much as to their departure with bag and baggage or free passage to any one particular person nothing but an absolute surrender and as for mercy which hooker before intimates to have been offered on proviso of their timely submission we find by edmund spenser who was then secretary to the lord deputy and upon the very spot that his lordship never gave the spaniards any hopes of it  for after the lord deputy had discovered that they had yielded and surrendered the fort on the ninth of november ralegh and mackworth who had the ward of that day first entered the castle and with their companies made a great slaughter so that except one irish nobleman who was reprieved another irishman and an englishman who were sent to public execution except also san josepho the spanish commander and his camp master with a few spanish officers who were sent prisoners into england and reserved for ransom all the invaders between four and five hundred were according to the deputys positive command put to the sword and the country was thus weeded of these noxious foreigners as for ralegh he never was taxed that i can learn with any cruelty upon this account more than mackworth or the rest of the officers  ralegh was quartered this winter at cork where he observed the seditious practices of david lord barry patrick condon and other ringleaders of the rebellion in those parts to distress so intolerably those subjects who were peacefully inclined and foment the disaffected to an insurrection that he was forced to take a journey in person to the lord deputy at dublin where he remonstrated the dangerous consequences he foresaw so urgently that the case being taken into consideration by his lordship and the council they returned him with a full commission to enter upon the castle called barrycourt with all other lands of the said barry and to reduce him to peace and subjection by such means as he judged most feasible appointing him for his farther enablement a party of horse in the interim such measures were used with those in authority at cork that the commission proved of little effect but though the said estate of barrymore was made over to the mother of david barry and only rented to the son and though it was his principal seat yet partly in fear of that commission partly through spite and indignation he burnt the castle himself to the ground and wasted the country about it with greater outrage and destruction than his enemies had they taken it would have done moreover as ralegh was on his journey back to his quarters an old rebel of barrys faction named fitzedmonds and his crew sallied from their ambuscade and crossed him to oppose his passage whom ralegh manfully encountered and defeated or at least broke through them so that he got clear over the river but one of his company mr henry mole following his horse foundering threw him down in the middle of it where between fear of drowning and being taken by the enemies he called out to ralegh for help who though he had escaped both dangers yet incurred them again to save his companions life but moyle in haste and confusion remounting overleapd his horse and fell down on the other side into a deep mire where he might have been stifled had not ralegh recovered him a second time and brought him safe to land but his horse run over to the rebels ralegh waited on the opposite bank with his staff these staves were not short like truncheons but rather like poles or watermens stretchers though not so long or clumsily made for being headed at one end with a sharp point or pile of iron they might be used for defense or offense either as quarter staves or spears in one hand and a pistol in the other for the rest of his company who were yet to cross the river among whom was his servant jenkin who had two hundred pounds of his money in charge a sum in those days enough to make a soldier of fortune in these circumstances look about him especially now fitz edmonds had got a recruit of twelve men and was in all above twenty strong against him yet this hero as his party called him when he beheld ralegh stand his ground and the rest of his company advance whom he possibly thought might be of greater number than they were only exchanged a few rough words with him and thought it best to offer no further molestation  soon after the earl of ormond departed from his long and wearisome services here to england about the spring of the year      his government of munster was given to captain ralegh in commission with sir william morgan and captain piers ralegh lay for the most part at lismore and in the country and woods thereabouts spent all this summer in continual action against the rebels  then ralegh removed with his little band of fourscore foot and eight horse to his old quarters at cork but receiving intelligence by the way that the archtraitor barry was at clove with several hundred men he resolved to pass through that town and offer him the combat accordingly at the towns end he met barry and his forces whom ralegh charged with great bravery and put him to flight as he pursued his journey he overtook another company of the enemy in a plain by a woodside upon whom having only six horsemen with him expecting probably his company would soon join him he gave the onset but the rebels who were in much greater number being cut off from the wood and having no other relief faced about and fought very desperately killing five of the horses belonging to raleghs company whereof his own was one and he himself very near being overborne by the numbers upon him had not his trusty servant nicholas wright a yorkshire man interposed who perceiving his masters horse so mortally wounded with darts and plunging past all recovery encountered six of the enemy at once and killed one of them while another of his fellowservants named patrick fagaw rescued ralegh which had been so unsuccessfully attempted by james fitzrichard and his kern both of raleghs company that the man was slain and the master very near the same fate whereupon ralegh would not suffer wright to fight by him any longer but ordered him to charge above hand and save the gentleman at which command he rushed into the throng of the enemy dispatched the antagonist who pressed forest upon mr fitzrichard and rescued him in this sharp skirmish there were many of the rebels slain and two taken prisoners whom ralegh carried with him to cork and while he lay here he performed several other notable services which deserve to be for ever registered  among the rest his excellent conduct in the seizure of the lord roch is more particularly remembered and applauded this nobleman being much suspected to hold confederacy with some of the chief rebels ralegh undertook to bring with his family before the earl of ormond at cork but the design of this hazardous surprise took air among the enemy and a party of  00 men under fitzedmonds and barry were gathered to waylay the english either going or coming however ralegh knowing the lord roch to be a powerful and popular man among the irish so suddenly commanded all his company to be in readiness by eleven aclock that night and they were so punctual to the hour that he directly marched away to bally in harsh which was rochs seat about twenty miles from cork and escaped the ambuscade he arrived there by break of day but the townsmen were so alarmed that they soon gathered  00 strong ralegh drew up and in such manner bestowed his men in the town it self that he soon quelled and restrained the people there then selecting half a dozen out of his company and having appointed another little party to follow him he marched up to the castle he was met by three or four of rochs gentlemen of whom he desired to speak with their lord which was agreed to on condition he would dismiss three or four of his own attendants to which with apparent readiness he complied but so contrived that none of them were locked out then he gave them directions which way the rest also without the gates might be admitted whilst he should hold the lord roch in discourse which succeeded so happily that by degrees his whole compliment were got within the courtyard some guarding the gates others watching in the hall each having his piece laden with a brace of balls the lord roch was amazed and terrified at so silent and insensible a seizure but dissembling his uneasiness he would needs have ralegh and the gentlemen with him participate of his plentiful table yet the policy of his hospitality did not defeat that of their enterprise for as soon as the dinner was over ralegh ingenuously laid open the occasion of his visit lord roch made many excuses and in the end absolutely refused to go along with him but when the commission was produced and he found ralegh inflexible he chose to do that by consent which he found he must do by compulsion then ralegh urged him to oblige his townsmen likewise who had so faithfully risen for his defense in his neighborhood to escort and defend him in his journey to which lord roch also consented professing he doubted not but to clear himself of whatever allegations should be laid to his charge when his lordship with his lady and attendants had made themselves ready ralegh was for another nocturnal progress but though the night fell out so very dark and tempestuous and the ways were so full of hills and dales rocks and precipices that many of his soldiers were much bruised by falls and one of them so mortified that he lost his life in the march yet the veil wherewith the rest were sheltered by that obscurity from the more dangerous ambuscades of their enemy who had every where bestrewd the passages to intercept them made such sufficient compensation for those disasters that by the next morning early he safely presented his prisoners to the general not without raising an universal astonishment at his dexterous evasion of so many perils but the lord roch upon examination being honorably acquitted he approved himself a faithful subject ever after and three of his sons laid down their lives in her majestys service  in the month of august the same year the lord deputy made the aforesaid captain john zouch governor of munster with whom ralegh and dowdal made several journeys to settle and compose the country but the certain place of their residence was at cork and when zouch with dowdal made that secret expedition in which he lopped off the third branch of this venomous hydra sir john desmond whose body was hung by the heels on a gibbet then fixed on the gates of that city and his head sent to london he left the government of cork to ralegh who appears no longer after this reduction in the wars of ireland but how well his services were received by the queen and how nobly she rewarded him for them after the earl of desmond himself was slain we shall hear when we arrive at the time that his large possessions came to be divided among those who had assisted in quenching the flames of his rebellion  ralegh was not long in england before his relation in some degree to the court began to appear tradition has industriously abscribd his first introduction thither to a piece of gallantry wherewith he surprised the queen accidentally in one of her walks her majesty meeting says my author with a plashy place made some scruple to go on when ralegh dressed in the gay and genteel habit of those times presently cast off and spread his new plushcloak on the ground whereon the queen trod gently over rewarding him afterward with many suits for his so free and seasonable tender of so fair a footcloth thus an advantageous admission into the notice of a prince is more than half a degree to preferment after this ralegh coming to court and finding some hopes of the queens favor reflecting upon him he wrote in a glass window obvious to her eye fain would i climb yet fear i to fall   under which her majesty soon after wrote if thy heart fail thee climb not at all   but though he always made a very elegant appearance as well in the splendour of attire as the politeness of address having a good presence in a handsome and well compacted person a strong natural wit and a better judgment with a bold and plausible tongue whereby he could set out his parts to the best advantage all very engaging advocates for royal favor especially in a female sovereign but be that as it may we find him upon his return into england employed in an expedition or two by authority belike from the court they being upon occasions of state and though it imports not much whether it was now or before he was in ireland that he accompanied the french ambassador monsieur simier among those gentlemen who were appointed for his safe convoy to france yet if that ambassador returned home when his master the duke of anjou came last over in november the year beforenamed this is the place for it to be mentioned in  but after the duke of anjou himself had been three months in england he also departed to take upon him the government of the netherlands this departure was in february following and though the queen seems to have declined the marriage with him principally because she found her ministry so averse to it yet there was an author and his printer who for having published a little treatise against it about two years before this treatise is entitled the discovery of a gaping gulf wherein england is likely to be swallowed by another french marriage etc printed with a small letter in a thin octav      had their hands cut off but a few days after the duke came to london the names of this author and his printer or publisher were john stubbs and william page and that sentence was executed on them at westminster november        vide stows chronicles and camdens annals in those years and she showed him many other marks of favor and distinction particularly when he left the kingdom she bore him company in person to dover and having appointed a most splendid retinue of nobles and gentlemen to wait upon him to his new government i find that ralegh was also among this grand assembly they attended the duke to antwerp where making a most magnificent procession he was created duke of brabant etc and invested with his charge ralegh seems not only to have staid there some time after the lord admiral howard leicester young sidney and the rest were returned but through the opportunity of being personally known to the prince of orange honored with some special acknowledgments from him to the queen of england and ralegh mentions thus much himself in a discourse he wrote many years afterward wherein fpeaking of the hollanders flourishing state he lays down as the first cause thereof the favor and assistance granted them by this crown which says he the late worthy and famous prince of orange did always acknowledge and in the year      when i took my leave of him at antwerp after the return of the earl of leicester into england and monsieur s arrival there when he delivered me his letters to her majesty he prayed me to say to the queen from him sub umbra alarm tuarum protegimur for certainly says he they had withered in the bud and sunk in the beginning of their navigation had not her majesty assisted them  toward the end of august this last mentioned year the lord gray resigned the sword of ireland after he had been two years deputy in that kingdom and this must be the time that dispute between him and ralegh was brought to a hearing of which authors have so blindly written sir robert naunton is confident that among the second causes of ralegh s growth not denying or rather acquiescing in his actions and accomplishments to have been the first that variance between him and the lord gray in his descent into ireland was a principal for it drew them both over says he to the council table there to plead their cause where what advantage he had in the cause my said author knew not but says he had much the better in telling of his tale and so much that the queen and the lords took no slight mark of the man and his parts for from thence he came to be known and to have access to the queen and the lords now if this author is so defective as not to have known the cause or subject of their quarrel or that ralegh leaving ireland long before the lord gray was not likely to be drawn over together with him to the council table how much more must those writers following him be so who have confused this matter with several other particulars though they seem to have had no other authority one of them says ralegh had in deed but not in truth the better by the tongue and insinuates with great caution and delicacy he thought no doubt that the queen had been told something so engaging of ralegh besides his advantage in pleading that it was not to be mentioned as if any of her courtiers dared to say any thing to the queens face which this anonymous writer near fifty years after her death would be either ashamed or afraid to repeat a later writer makes such distinctions of raleghs extraordinary behavior in this dispute as if he had been at the counciltable and seen as well as heard him and another after them all has found out the cause of this difference between them to be captain zouchs preferment the author of sir walter raleghs life in lives english and foreign   0  vol   p    says that raleghs disgust at the deputys preferring zouch grew to a difference between him and the said lord gray which was referred by the council of war in ireland to that in england and there decided in raleghs favor the soliciting of which business was the true cause of his leaving ireland but he quotes no authority and i think by what is before said of the matter this true cause will appear a groundless conjecture at least less probable than what might perhaps be drawn from spensers view of ireland vol   p  0  but passing these over our author naunton goes on and though he does not determine whether the lord leicester had then cast in a good word for ralegh to the queen yet says it is true that he had gotten the queens ear at a trice and she began to be taken with his elocution and loved to hear his reasons to her demands and the truth is she took him for a kind of oracle which nettled them all yea those he relied on began to take this his sudden favor for an alarm to be sensible of their own supplantation and to project his which made him shortly after sing fortune my foe etc  it is hinted to us somewhat more expressly by another courtwriter of those times that the earl of leicester befriended ralegh perhaps through his friendship with young sidney that earls worthily beloved nephew in his first advancement at court and that being willing for his own ease to bestow handsomely upon another some part of the pains and perhaps of the envy to which a long indulgent fortune is obnoxious either brought or let him into that promising sphere of preferment where the earl soon found him such an apprentice as knew well enough how to set up for himself so that if the earl of sussex who was leicesters antagonist had any hand in raleghs rise as some later writers of less authority have suggested it seems to have been afterward when raleghs courtly splendour was somewhat obstructed and leicester meant to allay it by interposing the young earl of essex for ralegh continued during that storm in some luster of a favored man like billows which sink but by degrees even when the wind is down that first stirred them but this we shall observe as we go on that in all the different aspects or conjunctions of interest through the access or change of new favorites in this long reign none were less immergd by the smiles of the court in the luxuries and vanities of it nor more animated by its frowns to the enterprising of public and superior difficulties for the honor and aggrandisement of his country not that he set out to sea but when he had despaired of raising himself on shore for these public enterprises were rooted so early in raleghs aspiring mind that we perceive even now before factions at court could drive him from the land or preferments and grants from the crown enable him for the sea that he had built at his own expense to prosecute them a strong handsome ship which was named bark ralegh of two hundred ton burden  and now that the six years period of sir humphrey gilberts patent grew short four of them being elapsed he thought it high time to make a new attempt in person since his assignments had proved of little consequence at those discoveries he had before failed in that he might confirm by experience what he had so excellently advanced in theory accordingly having fitted out a fleet of four ships ralegh also victualld and manned out his beforementioned which was the largest among them and in the quality of vice admiral set out to bear his brother gilbert company in this his last expedition to newfoundland the fleet departed from plymouth on the   th of june      my author who was in this voyage tells us no cost was spared by ralegh in provisions and necessaries for the happy accomplishment of it yet that in two or three days following he returned greatly distressed to plymouth by reason his whole ships company was infected with a contagious sickness but lucky to him perhaps was this visitation since the voyage proved so fatal to those who went through it particularly sir humphrey himself who though he arrived in newfoundland in the beginning of august following took possession of the country in right of the crown of england by digging up a turf and receiving it with a hasel wand delivered to him according to our law and custom also had assigned lands to every man in his company and was got three hundred leagues in his way home again with full hopes of the queens assistance to fit out a fleet not only for the north but one also for the south next year yet overhardily venturing in a little frigate of but ten ton burden called the squirrel he was on the ninth of september following at midnight in a high sea swallowed up as authors have been very defective and erroneous in their accounts of this brave and publickspirited but unfortunate knight sir humphrey gilbert of compton i shall here observe that john hooker who knew him says he was bred at oxford hooker takes notice of his extraordinary services in ireland for which he was made colonel of munster and sir roger williams in his actions of the low countries tells us he was the first english commander who led a regiment thither to serve the prince of orange against the spaniards but john prince who pretends to give us his life among his worthies of devon mentions nothing of his landservices the said j prince quotes sir w poles mss to vouch this gilberts being knighted by the queen at greenwich      but hooker aforesaid shows him to have been knighted in the church at drogheda by sir hon sidney deputy of ireland seven years sooner at least and agreeable thereto we find him called sir humphrey gilbert in a letter of sir thomas smiths dated      among sir d diggess collection before mentioned p     lastly another writer of his life in latin places his last expedition to newfoundland  0 years sooner than he undertook it if it is not the fault rather of the printer than the author vid hollandi herwologia anglica fol arnheim    0 p    as for sir humphreys writings we have extant in hakluyt vol   p    his discourse to prove a passage by the northwest to cathay and the east indies in ten chapters first published in  to      at the end of which he mentions another discourse now lost i fear wherein he amended the usual errors of seacards which make the degrees of longitude in every latitude of equal bigness and invented a spherical instrument with a compass of variation for the perfect knowledge of the longitude and laid down a precise order to prick the seacards with certain rules for the shortning any discovery and knowing at the first entrance of any fret whether it lies open to the ocean more ways than one and how far the sea stretches itself into the land as for the picture at compton said by prince to be drawn for sir h gilbert if his author sir w pole is no truer in his assertion of the queens having given sir humphrey the gold chain represented about the neck thereof than he was in her having knighted him and there are no other signatures besides that chain and the inscription of virginia on the globe with the verses under it relating thereto i see not but the picture is to be doubted as rather meant for his brother ralegh who was honored with a golden chain by the queen and whose title to that inscription on the globe was beyond any mans in the world but the stately poem in latin hexameters upon his last expedition by stephanus parmenius budeius a learned hungarian who was drowned with him was undoubtedly among other english adventurers therein named chiefly intended for his honor another of the vessels called the delight but few days before also suffered the same fate and even the rest returned not without great hazard hardship and loss teaching says camden that it is a more difficult manner to carry over colonies to remote countries upon private mens purses than he and others had persuaded themselves to their own loss and detriment but neither these unfortunate attempts by sea hitherto nor the ruin of sir humphrey gilberts estate nor the loss of his life nor the hardships of all his company besides could teach ralegh that lesson these examples and this experience were so far from satiating that they did but sharpen his appetite to such honorable dangers  and as we are assured from family tradition by a late author of his own name and lineage that the discoveries of the great columbus the conquests of fernando cortez the famous francis pizarro and other leaders of the spaniards who under the emperor charles and his son philip ii had made the greatest and most surprising additions to their empire that ever prince received or subjects wrought were the favorite histories that took up raleghs early reading and conversation while he was but a young man we may presume they so possessed his noble genius with perhaps also some late domestic and living examples that no little personal oppositions at home or particular misadventures abroad could ever discourage him from the pursuit of these grand and national undertakings but when by his own observation he found the spaniards had only settled upon the middle and southern parts of america and that there were certain vast territories yet unknown to the north of those lands which the spaniards already enjoyed as fit perhaps for settlement and as easy to conquer as any they did enjoy and when by his enquiries among the most observant pilots and mariners who had sailed in the spanish ship to the gulf of mexico many of whom he had opportunity to meet and discourse with in holland and flanders he had learnt that the spaniards always went into the gulf of mexico by st domingo and the island of hispaniola where the currents with the tradewinds always ran together and set into the bay that they always disembogud as they called it or came out by the havana and the channels of bahama which they now call the gulf of florida and that as they returned by this gulf they found a continued coast on the west side trending away north which they generally lost sight of by standing away to the east to make for the coast of spain ralegh fully determined that there was a vast extent of land north of that gulf or west from the coast of spain which might be well worth discovering and after mature deliberation fully resolved upon the discovery as soon as he had digested his proposal and displayed the manner of prosecuting it in proper schemes he laid them before the queen and council to whom it appearing a rational practical and generous undertaking her majesty was pleased in the beginning of the year      to grant him full power to enjoy such countries as he proposed to discover by her letters patents  immediately upon the grant of this patent ralegh gave his instructions for an american voyage but that he now sailed thither himself or then made the discovery whatever he might do before of the country hereafter mentioned in person and returned in the beginning of      as the author of his life in lives english and foreign tells us vol i p  0 is all fancy and fiction to captain philip amadas and captain arthur barlow two experienced commanders and had got a couple of barks well furnished with men and provivisions at his own expense in such readiness that on the   th day of april following they departed from the west of england the  0th of may they arrived at the canaries and a month after fell upon the isles of the west indies which with the rest adjoining says my author one of those captains are so well known to yourself directing the account of this voyage to his proprietor and to many others that i will not trouble you with the remembrance of them in the beginning of july they were saluted with a most fragrant gale from the land they were seeking and soon after arrived upon the coast but sailed along some sixscore miles before they could find an entrance by any river issuing into the sea at last discovering one they manned out their boats to view the land adjoining where they saw vines laden with grapes in vast abundance climbing up the tall cedars and spreading so luxuriantly along the sandy shore that the sea often overflowed them on the   th of july they took possession in right of the queen and afterward delivered the country over to raleghs use they thought this land had at first been the continent but found it afterward only an island  0 miles long called wocoken plentifully stocked with animals groves of sweet smelling trees pulse grain and esculent roots they observed along the coast a tract of islands   or  00 miles long and passing between them saw another great sea  0  0 and in some places  0 miles over before they could reach the continent and in this enclosed sea above  00 islands of various size whereof one is    miles long called roanoak and about seven leagues distant up the river occam from the harbor they first entered at which they chiefly settled while they staid finding it so pleasant and fruitful as to yield three harvests in five months but they remained upon the borders of wocoken two days before they beheld a human creature on the third they saw a boat rowing toward them with three of the natives one of them landed and walked up the shore near their ship for they were then on board then the two captains with some others took their boat and rowed to land and by their courteous carriage soon prevailed on the native to return with them on board where they clothed him and gave him victuals wine and several little toys or utensils which won the simple creatures heart soon after his departure he returned again with a boat full of fish to be divided between the ship and the pinnace and then he left them the next day came the kings brother granganimeo with a great many attendants for the king himself who was named wingina and his large territories wingandacoa lay ill of the wounds he had lately received in war his brother was highly pleased with his entertainment and having received several presents soon after sent the savages to traffic with the english also came again himself and exchanged  0 skins worth as many nobles for a tin dish which he hung as a gorget about his neck to defend him from the arrows of his enemies then also he brought his wife and children with her attendants  0 or  0 in number she was wellfavourd but bashful clad in a mantle of deerskin lined with fur and a kind of apron of the same her hair hung down long on each side with a band of white coral about her forehead and long bracelets of pearl down to her middle as big as pease in her ears a bracelet whereof we delivered to your worship says my author to ralegh her husbands apparel was much like hers only about his head he wore a broad plate of gold or copper and his hair was long but on one side after this interview familiar commerce passed between the natives and the english who when they went to roanoak were much caressed and treated by the lady aforesaid and when she could not prevail with them to stay being but few in company though the natives had no edgetools of iron or steel and had proffered a great box of pearl for some armor and a sword she sent her women to watch them all night in their ships on the bankside and indeed all the people who saw them admired much at their ships their firearms their clothes and above all their complexions for except a vessel which was cast away with some christian adventurers about    years before near secotan the southermost town in wingandacoa never any people in apparel or of fair color were seen or heard of among them which made them wonder so much at the whiteness of their skins and so fond of seeing and touching them under these favorable recommendations and the distress which the natives were in for some powerful friends to defend them from the invasions of their neighbors the promises of visiting them again wherewith the english left them after having learnt as much of the situation state and product of the country as was at this time convenient were very acceptable so bringing over a couple of the indians with them named manteo and wanchese to show them our fine country they arrived safely in the west of england about the middle of september following  when ralegh had laid before her majesty these and all other reports most worthy of notice of this rich beautiful and virgin country and had acknowledged how much this hopeful progress toward the possession of it was owing to the auspices of a virgin queen she was so well pleased with the honor and advantage it promised and gave him such encouragement to complete the discovery which he forthwith prepared to do by another expedition that she called it herself by the name of virginia  about two months after he was elected a knight of the shire for the county of devon sir william courtenay being the other representative there was then a clerk of the parliament so very indolent or otherwise indisposed that the transactions of the house of commons at this time were very imperfectly recorded yet we find ralegh mentioned to have been chosen of the committees upon some bills that were then read on the   th of december following the bill in confirmation of his patent aforesaid for the discovery of foreign countries was read the first time in the afternoon it was read the second time and committed to the vicechamberlain hatton secretary walsingham sir philip sidney sir francis drake sir richard greenfield or grenvill sir william courtenay sir william mohun and others three days after the said bill was without any alteration ordered to be engrossed the next day it was read the third time when it passed the house between this time and the   th of february following he received the honor of knighthood for being then in a committee for considering after what manner and measure they should supply her majesty by subsidy this is the earliest time i meet with of his being styled sir walter ralegh a title which her majesty bestowed as all others of honor with frugality and choice therefore was it a more certain cognizance of virtue or valor than titles of more pompous denomination in the reign of her successor who suffered lucre to corrupt the noble fountain to turn it into vulgar channels and drain it even to the dregs sir edward walker garter and secretary of war to king charles i observes that in all queen elizabeths    years reign she created but six earls and eight or nine barons so that when she died the nobility consisted but of one marquis    earls two viscounts and about  0 barons but doubts whether in the reign of king james the dispensing of honors so liberally was not one of the beginnings of general discontents especially among persons of great extraction so that when this king died having reigned but    years he left the nobility in his three kingdoms above double the number to what he found them though his reign was peaceable and not full of action which renders men in capacity highly to merit from their prince and so without envy receive advancement and a little further when alliance to a favorite riches though gotten in a shop persons of private estates and of families that many of them and their fathers would have thought themselves highly honored to have been but knights in queen elizabeths time were advanced then the fruits thereof began to appear etc nay that this honor was intended by that queen as the most significant testimony of personal desert may be instanced according to an ingenious observer of her reign in sir francis vere a man nobly descended and sir walter ralegh exactly qualified says he with many others set apart in her judgment for military services whose titles she never raised above knighthood saying when importuned to make vere a baron that in his proper sphere and her estimation he was above it already  about the time that her majesty granted ralegh the patent above cited for the discovery of remote countries she seems also to have given him another to license the vending of wines throughout the kingdom that he might be better able to sustain the great charges which the other brought upon him there were no restrictions belike in this patent from increasing the number of vintners in any part of the realm and hence arose his controversy at this time with one of the universities for ralegh having by virtue of that general patent given license to one john keymer to sell wine in cambridge some of the hotter heads especially the other vintners there among whom was baxter a squire beadle licensed to sell wine by that university opposed this keymer and his wife with such violence that she was likely to have died complaint being made to ralegh he wrote a letter to the worshipful dr howland vice chancellor and the rest of the masters to tell them how much he took this riotous demeanor as a contempt of the queens grant to him presuming if he had given any unlawful privilege the conference he had offered by his deputies for a quiet decision of the matter by learned council between them would have been accepted further telling them that if the abuse was not regulated and the said keymer permitted to enjoy the liberty granted him he would take some other course for reformation therein but resting assured they would use such means as might occasion no further trouble he not desiring to execute his grant to its extent among their vintners who were the only disturbers herein respecting more their own gain than quiet government he only craves their answer and that the riotous persons might not rest unpunished so bids them heartily farewell from his lodgings at the court the  th of july      and subscribes himself your very affectionate loving friend this producing no answer in seven months and ralegh having heard they continued to oppress keymer he wrote again to his loving friend the vice chancellor etc telling him that being by information persuaded himself with the grave and welldisposed of the university were so grieved with the unseemly outrages lately committed by the young and unbridled heads thereof to the contempt of the queens prerogative and his discredit as sufficient order had been taken for the bearers quiet which caused him to rest from requiring reformation therein at his good lordtreasurers hands who as yet understood nothing from him of these riots through the good will he bore to their university and that he meant so to deal with them for the other four taverns as should sufficiently have contented them but his too favorable dealing with them had given such encouragement as that intending further to disturb the bearer they had warned him to appear before them with which he had persuaded him to comply upon their sending no answer to this and ralegh hearing they had suddenly clapped up the man in prison he sent  0 days after the last his third letter from the court directed to the vice chancellor and the rest of the masters etc and herein tells them he cannot a little marvel at their peremptory and proud manner of dealing that he was content to use all manner of courtesy toward them in respect of his honorable good lord the lordtreasurer but perceived his reasonable or rather too submiss dealing had bred in them a proceeding unsufferable having committed a poor man to prison for doing nothing but what was warranted by the great seal of england which supposing they had a charter he knew not that any man or society would so much take upon them to do before a trial as i reverence the place says he of which you are the governors so i will not willingly take any wrong or disgrace from you but as he was assured the lordtreasurer would be indifferent in the case and as the matter so much concerned the validity of his patent elsewhere as well as in their university he would try the utmost of his right as well for this one wherewith he was content to have been satisfied as for all the other four so having thought they would have vouchsafed him an answer to his last letters he ends subscribing himself your friend as you shall gave cause this roused them to some consideration and soon after a handsome apologetical letter was sent from the vice chancellor to sir w ralegh setting forth that the hard opinion he had conceived of them for this matter made them doubt what manner of answer they might address to him without offense and that their silence was so ill taken they knew not how their endeavors to excuse it might give him satisfaction that they had not neglected any reasonable means to procure his favor for the quiet enjoyment of that whereof they had the fruition for above two hundred years nor omitted to become petitioners to him in a very humble manner that his counsel had not made any just exception against their charters and those who had the hearing of the case thought them to have the better warrant yet that he used such hard terms as they little looked for at his hands being by birth a gentleman by education trained up to the knowledge of good letters instructed with the liberal disposition of a university the fountain and nursery of all humanity and further by gods good blessing advanced in court from whence the very name of courtesy is drawn that the prejudice he apprehended from their example against his patent was unlikely to fall out since other places were not privileged as the universities were that her majestys grant by her prerogative gave him his title and the like prerogative was the ground of their charters and as he would think it hard to have his patent impeached by an aftergrant they hoped he would with like equity measure them who were warranted to have the sole dealing with all vintners in cambridge town and the precincts thereof touching the imprisonment of the party whom he charged them with proceeding against before trial and who according to mr browns promise to the lordtreasurer was to have given over at michaelmas last however the course thereof had been otherwise reported to him it was only at this time to correct his contempt in not appearing being lawfully warned and refusing to answer before the ordinary judge or enter bond for appearance when cause should require that for their own part it would be no disadvantage whether he or other one or many were vintners there but in regard of the youth committed to their charge duty bound them to consider who they admitted to keep taverns the number whereof was also limited which if they exceeded would endanger their privileges for the preservation whereof as they had all taken a special oath so they right humbly eftsoons beseechd him to have regard of them for their duties therein concluding thus whatever kindness you shall any ways show to the university as the body thereof does still continue so the memory thereof cannot decay there is not one of us but you may readily command wherein it may please you to employ us only we pray you and that in the heartiest manner to vouchsase us your favor in matter of our privileges that we may leave them in no worse estate to our posterity than we did receive them of our predecessors thus desiring god so to direct you with his blessed spirit as may be most to his glory and your greatest comfort we take our leave from cambridge this might probably pacify ralegh at present both for their neglect in not answering his letters and their forwardness in imprisoning the man till the difference was a few months afterward accommodated by the lordtreasurer who was chancellor of that university for the said lordtreasurer burghley sent in a letter to dr norgate his vice chancellor on the   th of july      the opinion of the two chief justices sir christopher wraye and sir edmond anderson upon this controversy between that university and mr rawlie as he is therein called for the nomination of vintners and setting the price of wine there which opinion is as follows  first touching the nomination of vintners there we think it appertains to the university by usage and charters from her majesty confirmed by parliament and that mr rawlie can nominate none there for the price it seems they may set prices so as it be according to the statute and not otherwise and if the vintners set at higher prices they are to be punished by law which penalty mr rawlie may dispense withal and yet cannot sue for the penalty by his patent against the statute laws for therein all liberties to the university is excepted after this we hear no more of the dispute   the parliament being soon after on the   th of march      prorogued ralegh appears several ways engaged in the laudable improvements of navigation for his brother adrian gilbert of sandridge afterward knighted in pursuance of the arguments laid down by his brother sir humphrey having been at great charges in finding out the northern passage to china and the moluccas and in consideration thereof been granted a patent by the queen two years before this time to pursue the discovery by partners under the title of the colleagues of the fellowship for the discovery of the northwest passage ralegh was now one of the associates in this enterprise and after having duly consulted about the likeliest means to success and liberally contributed toward the expense they chose captain john davis an experienced navigator to be undertaker of the exploit he set first out upon it this summer from falmouth in two barks when he came to land sixtysix degrees forty minutes latitude he anchored in a very fair road under a brave mountain which for the splendid appearance it made the cliffs thereof being as orient as gold they named mount ralegh in honor of their proprietor and soon after fell into the very passage they sought since well known by the name of daviss streights the farther search whereof through the same patronage and support captain davis made in two voyages more the two following years and in a manner completed the said discovery  but about two months before davis begun his said first voyage for this discovery ralegh sent out his own fleet for virginia which consisted of seven sail whereof some were his own ships and they departed from plymouth on the  th of april the year above specified he deputed his gallant relation sir richard greenville general of the expedition and mr ralph lane who was afterward knighted to be governor of the colony which they now transported there went besides mr thomas candish john arundel raymond stucley bremige vincent mr john clark and several others whereof some were captains and others assistants for council and direction in the voyage so they shaped their course to the canary islands from thence to dominica and to the island of st john de puerto rico where they were sadly stung with the musketoes and near which they took two spanish frigates one whereof was freighted with a rich cargo and diverse spaniards of distinction who afterward were ransomed for good round sums of money then they made away to hispaniola soon after which the general and some of his company were near being cast away in catching of seals from thence they sailed to florida one argument used by a lte author to prove this was the first attempt made for the discovery of these parts of america is that these navigators knew no other way to sail from england to the coast of virginia than to go first to the canaries from thence to hispaniola and into the gulf of mexico then out by cuba and the gulf of bahama and so coast along the shore from florida to virginia from the latitude of  0 minutes to    which is in short says he like going from london by portsmouth and from thence to exeter away to bristol and so up by the banks of the severn to come at westchester and on the   th of june anchored at wocoken where they sent word of their arrival to king wingina at roanoak they carried the indians with them from england and manteo on the  th of july led mr arundel to the main continent where they found some of their men who had been conducted thither twenty days before by captain raymond on the eleventh following the general accompanied by arundel stuckley lane candish hariot amadas clark and others passed over the water to the main land and victualld their ships in which voyage they first discovered the towns of pomeioc aquasgococ and secotan also the great lake paquipe and many other places then returned to their fleet they afterward revisited those parts and were kindly entertained by the savages coming at last to anchor to hatorask prince grangino or granganimeo before mentioned came attended by manteo to visit them on board the admiral which was named the tiger the particulars which passed between them about the settlement are not mentioned in the short journal of this voyage but we may conclude it was agreed on to their mutual satisfaction since one hundred and seven men whose names are printed at the end of the said journal under the government of mr lane were left for a year in the country without disturbance to begin the plantation on the   th of august the general weighed anchor and set sail for england about six days after he took a spanish ship of three hundred ton richly laden and on the   th of october arrived with the prize at plymouth where he was courteously received by his worshipful friend  an end having been put to the munster rebellion by force of arms and the country further laid desolate by a raging famine which devoured what the sword had left except a few who remained in cities fled to england or could feed upon weeds and carrion so as even to rob the graves and the gibbets of the dead to keep the dying alive the queen soon became desirous of repeopling the country and to have ways considered on how the late earl of desmonds large territories in ireland might be disposed of to the advantage of her and her subjects after commissioners were sent over for this purpose and proper methods taken to prevent frudulent conveyances by the rebels there was at last a scheme resolved on for the plantation of munster and secretary fenton carried over the instructions toward the latter end of this year the whole forfeiture was above    000 acres of land and after some restitutions had been made the remainder was divided into seigniories among certain gentlemanundertakers as they were called but chiefly such as had been instrumental in appeasing the irish rebellion one of the largest divisions which was twelve thousand acres situate in the counties of cork and waterford was given by her majesty to sir walter ralegh and his heirs with certain privileges and immunities upon those conditions of planting and improving the same to which the rest were also obliged and though many of the undertakers did not people their seigniories with wellaffected english but sold them to english papists or otherwise to their profit nor fortified according to their covenants nor forbore encroaching upon the lands of the loyal and protected irish as the crown on the other side failed of maintaining certain forces promised for their security from fresh invasions yet i meet with none of those irregularities objected to ralegh on the contrary that he peopled his plantation unexceptionably that he kept the said estate to the latter end of the queens reign and then sold it to richard boil afterward the famous earl of cork as in a memorial of his own life the said earl has related but as capacious as this benefit seemed it was rather expensive perhaps at first than profitable to him  for sir richard greenvil who at his departure from virginia had promised the colony he left behind to return punctually with supplies by the following easter at furthest was not altogether so expeditious as they expected probably through some difficulties attending the charge thereof which raleghs new undertaking of planting also that seigniory might probably render more burdensome greenvil brought over letters from governor lane to a very worthy encourager of all naval adventurers describing the commodities and fertility of the country they were about to cultivate and civilize the said governor also drew up notes while he was there which he afterward methodized into a discourse of two parts displaying the particularities of the country of virginia and the reasons which moved their departure from thence into england in this discourse we learn that their discovery for sir walter ralogh had extended from roanoak southward as far as secotum about eighty miles northward as far as the chesepians being a hundred and thirty miles more and to the north west as far as chawanook a hundred and thirty miles and further mentions many towns about the waterside discovered by the way it also informs us of his enquiries after a fishery and traffic for pearl in those parts besides a mine of strange metal like copper but paler and softer moreover of the taking prince skyco prisoner and after the death of granganimeo aforesaid how his brother king wingina changed his name and plotted an insurrection against the english for which he lost his life while another king called okisco sent to pay homage and acknowledge subjection to the grand weroanza or queen of england and after her to sir walter ralegh lastly the arrival of sir francis drake about the  0th of june      who returning from his prosperous conquest of st domingo cartagena and st augustine determined in his way homeward to visit his friends colony in virginia they had despaired of sir richard greenvils promise and the rather because of the preparations then making for flanders and other parts of america their corn was indeed within a fortnight of inviting the sickle but they were in need of many other provisions hereupon drake readily proffered them all manner of supplies by victuals men ammunition and ships to carry on and complete their worthy undertaking the governor desired only a ship and so much provision as about august would carry him and his company to england which drake granted in full sufficiency besides pinnaces boats and two experienced masters or pilots to abide with them and apply themselves earnestly in the action all this was performed in two days on the next day while some were writing letters into england and others relating their adventures to each other some at sea some on shore there arose a most violent tempest which lasted three days drove most of the fleet from their anchors away to sea and in them the provisions and masters aforesaid with the chief of the english colony who they saw no more till they met in england then drake proffered them another ship but the rest of the colony who were left behind all begged to go for england to which drake consenting took them aboard on the   th of july and set sail sir walter ralegh had in the mean time provided a ship of a hundred ton freighted with all kind of provisions in a most plentiful manner for the relief of this colony but not sailing till after easter the said colony was newly departed before this fresh supply arrived at virginia after some time spent upon the country in seeking the colony and not finding it they returned with all the provision aforesaid into england about a fortnight after sir richard greenvil arrived at virginia with three ships more well stored for the same company of planters but he after much search missing also of them and of the aforesaid ship left fifteen men at roanoak with plenty of supplies and made for england and not without some conquests over the spaniards at the azores in his return and indeed ralegh was also about this very time victorious at the same place for when he sent the aforesaid ship to relieve the colony or soon after he dispatched two more named the serpent and maryspark both of them his own to the azores against the spaniards under the conduct of captain jacob whiddon john evesham and others they departed from plymouth on the  0th of june aforesaid and took more spanish prizes than they could bring home in one of them was the governor of st michaels island in another which they took near the isle of graciosa was the famous pedro de sarmiento governor of the streights of magellan who was the furthest and most experienced navigator in all spain while this sarmiento was raleghs prisoner in england they were one day surveying a map together concerning which sarmiento told him a pleasant story of the painters wives island which ralegh afterward ingenicusly applied where he compares the liberties of local and historical fiction of such as geographers make in filling up the blank spaces of their maps with lands of pigmeys and rocks of lodestone to those of historians in repairing the broken accounts of past ages yet concludes with an encouraging difference against the ignorant describers of remote places in favor of liberal conjecture to enlighten the obscurities of ancient times see the history of the world lib   cap    sec   they took also three other vessels but turned two adrift after having taken out of them what they wanted because they could not spare hands to man them and after a fight for thirtytwo hours with two great carracks and the other guardships of twenty sail more richly laden they gave over for want of powder and returned safe to plymouth where they were received with triumphant joy then proceeding to southampton they were met by their owner sir walter ralegh who rewarded them with their shares out of the merchandise and other commodities of value which in those three prizes were thus taken from the enemy not long after this there was another voyage set out the same year by the earl of cumberland to the south sea but performed no further than the latitude of fortyfour degrees to the south of the equinoctial in which as sir walter ralegh was also an adventurer his fine pinnace named dorothy being engaged therein and some small prizes also being taken he had no doubt his proportion in the profits that arose from them  but to return to the virginian colony it arrived at plymouth on the   th of july following camden has remembered that by this colony of raleghs and in those ships of drakes the famous american plant called tobacco was first brought into england by or under governor lane doubtless according to the instructions they had received of their proprietor for the introduction among us of that commodity is generally ascribed to ralegh himself there are some pleasant stories of this plant with relation to him which have been as carefully preserved as the box he kept it in being at leeds in yorkshire soon after mr ralph thoreshy the antiquary died anno      i saw his musaeum and in it among his other rarities what himself has publicly called in the catalogue thereof annexed to his antiquities of that town sir walter raleghs tobacco box from the best of my memory i can resemble its outward appearance to nothing more nearly than one of our modern muffcases about the same height and width covered with red leather and opened at top but with a hinge i think like one of those in the inside there was a cavity for a receiver of glass or metal which might hold half a pound or a pound of tobacco and from the edge of the receiver at top to the edge of the box a circular stay or collar with holes in it to plant the tobacco about with six or eight pipes to smoke it in this traveling box with the manuscripts medals and other rarities in its company descending to a young clergyman the son of the deceased was soon after reported to have been translated to london but the tradition of raleghs smoking tobacco at first privately in his study and of the servant who used to wait on him there surprising him one time with his tankard of ale and nutmeg as he was intent upon his book before he had done his pipe and seeing the smoke reeking out of his mouth threw all the ale in his face then running down stairs alarmed the family with repeated exclamations that his master was on fire and before they could get up would be burnt to ashes this i say if true has nothing in it of more surprising or unparalled simplicity than there was in that poor norwegian who upon the first sight of roses could not be induced to touch though he saw them grow being so amazed to behold trees budding with fire or to come closer by way of retaliation than there was in those virginians themselves who the first time they seized upon a quantity of gunpowder which belonged to the english colony sowed it for grain or the seed of some strange vegetable in the earth with full expectation of reaping a plentiful crop of combustion by the next harvest to scatter their enemies  but passing over these tales as ralegh was the first who brought this herb in request among us and laid the foundation for that great traffic therewith which has been of such considerable benefit to his country there is no less honor due to him than has been conferred on that ambassador who had before brought it out of portugal into france where in mentioning the herb they pay grateful acknowledgments to the importer by calling it nicotiana after his own name nay his politic sovereign catherine de medicis did so zealously encourage the use of it that it was also afterward in honor of her called the queens herb nor was the queen of england backward in listening to and promoting the advantages it was promised to produce we may gather from some authors that she was very curious to know its virtues and properties and that once conversing with ralegh upon this subject he assured her majesty he had so well experienced the nature of it that he could tell her of what weight even the smoke would be in any quantity proposed to be consumed her majesty fixing her thoughts upon the most impracticable part of the experiment that of bounding the smoke in a balance suspected that he put the traveller upon her and would needs lay him a wager he could not solve the doubt so he procured a quantity agreed upon to be thoroughly smoked then went to weighing but it was of the ashes and in the conclusion what was wanting in the prime weight of the tobacco her majesty did not deny to have been evaporated in smoke and further said that many laborers in the fire she had heard of who turned their gold into smoke but ralegh was the first who had turned smoke into gold whether those two queens did ever recommend the use of this herb by their own example we are not certain but it is evident it soon became of such vogue in queen elizabeths court that some of the great ladies as well as noblemen therein would not scruple to take a pipe sometimes very sociably however it was such an abomination to the refined palate of her scotch successor that he not only refused the use of it himself but endeavored to rob his crown of what has since proved one of its greatest revenues an author of experience has lately informed us that the benefit of this vegetable to great britain is prodigious if we consider the short time since it was first introduced into england by sir walter ralegh it is now become says he the staple of two of his majestys colonies inhabited by half a million of people many of whom could hardly support themselves at home yet there they live in great splendour and ease having sumptuous buildings rich equipages slaves and other attendance according to the exactest computation that has been made on this branch of our trade about   0 sail of ships with above  000 seamen have been employed in one year to bring over about   000 hogsheads of tobacco from virginia and maryland the freight of which at   l per ton a medium in times of peace amounts to   0000 l sterling most of which sum centers among ourselves in the payment of sailors and tradesmen who live by shipping besides about    s per hogshead customhouse fees cooperage lighterage wharfage porterage cartage warehouse rent brokerage and other incident charges it is further calculated that out of the said   000 hogsheads imported there are exported   000 hogsheads containing   0 lb per hogshead at fourpence per pound on board which amounts to    000 l toward supporting the balance of trade with foreign nations the same author a little further observes as another great benefit arising from this vegetable that the produce is laid out in our british manufactures and exported to the british colonies which in one year has amounted to  00000 l and would be much more if proper encouragement were given to manufacture it before exportation therefore it may be justly said that tobacco is become in few years one of the most valuable branches of trade belonging to great britain thus far mr john lacy tobacco merchant in his observations on the nature use and trade of tobacco folio one sheet printed mar        besides the advantage this vegetable is of to trade a large revenue arises to the crown y customduties on tobacco  i have seen an account upon the veracity whereof i can depend by which it appears the money paid on this article of tobacco into his majestys exchequer in the year      was        l   s  0 d and that a medium for seven years past to that time was    0   l o s  0 d by restraining his subjects also from it indeed it is not to be wondered that such a philosopher as could magnify the power of witches after the manner he has done in one of his learned pamphlets should be such a politician as to discourage the taking of tobacco in another entitled the counterblast to tobacco  to without date there is also extant king jamess warrant to the lordtreasurer dorset anno   0  for laying a good heavy imposition upon tobacco that less quantity may be brought into the realm and only sufficient for the better sort who will use it with moderation for their health wherefore he authorizes the said treasurer to order that from the   th of october ensuing the proper officers should take of all who import tobacco the sum of six shillings and eightpence upon every pound weight over and above the custom of twopence per pound usually paid heretofore rymers foedc tom xvi fol  0  but those who have not admired at his prejudice in this attempt to dispel the fumes of that herb with greater of his own if i may allude to the witty title of his performance without imputation of irreverence to his memory may yet applaud his policy in so far conducing to its suppression as to exclude it from the body of his works when this royal pamphleteer resolved to become an author in folio as for the uses and virtues of this plant since so many learned writers have given us whole books upon them i shall only here observe from the first author among us immediately upon his return with the colony aforesaid from virginia where he had been employed by ralegh to survey the country that the savages distinguished it by sowing apart from all other vegetables and held it of highest estimation in all their sacrifices by fire water and air either for thanksgiving to or pacification of their gods and as by sucking it through it through pipes of clay they purged all gross humors from the head and stomach opened all the pores and passages of the body preserving it from obstructions or breaking them whereby they notably preserved health and knew not many grievous diseases wherewith we in england are often afflicted so we ourselves says he during the time we were there used to suck it after their manner as also since our return and have found many rare and wonderful experiments of its virtues whereof the relation would require a volume by itself the use of which by so many men and women of great calling as well as others and some learned physicians also is sufficient witness  the learned author of this account mr thomas hariot having further confuted the calumnies which had been raised of this new discovered country by the idle ignorant and avaritious part of the colony lately returned from it and given a faithful relation of the merchantable commodities with those fit for food or building and an account of the natures of the people in three parts expresses himself toward the conclusion of the whole in this manner seeing the air there is so temperate and wholesome the soil so fertile and yielding such commodities as i have beforementioned the voyage also to and fro sufficiently experienced to be performed twice a year with ease and at any season and the dealings of sir walter ralegh so liberal in large giving and granting lands there as is already known with many helps and furtherances else the least that he has granted having been  00 acres to a man only for the adventure of his person i hope re remains no cause whereby the action should be misliked  i remember to have met with a scarce old tract in the lambeth library written by a learned and ingenious author of those times he adds yet you more respecting the good ends whereunto you levelled your line for the good of your country did not give over till you had recovered a land and had made a plantation of the people of your own english nation in virginia the first english colony that was ever planted there not a little to the derogation of the spaniards glory and impeachment to their vaunts who because with all cruel immanity they subdued a naked and yielding people whom they sought for gain and not for religion or the plantation of a commonwealth over whom to satisfy their insatiable covetousness they did most cruelly tyrannise and against the course of all human nature scorch and roast them to death as by their own histories does appear these i say do brag and vaunt that they only have drawn strange nations and unknown people to the obedience of their kings to the knowledge of christianity and to the enriching of their country and thereby claim the honor to themselves alone but if these your actions were well looked into and with due consideration it shall be found much more honorable in sundry respects for the advancement of the name of god the honor of the prince and the benefit of the commonwealth for what can be more pleasant to god than to gain and reduce in all christianlike manner a lost people to the knowledge of the gospel and a true christian religion than which cannot be a more pleasant and sweet sacrifice and a more acceptable service before god and what can be more honorable to princes than to enlarge the bounds of their kingdoms without injury wrong and bloodshed and to frame them from a savage life to a civil government neither of which the spaniards in their conquests have performed and what can be more beneficial to a commonwealth than to have a nation and a kingdom to transfer unto the superfluous multitude of fruitless and idle people here at home daily increasing to travel conquer and manure another land which by the due intercourses to be devised may and will yield infinite commodities and how well you do deserve every way in following so honorable a course not we ourselves only can witness but strange nations also do honor you for the same as does appear by the epistle of bassimerus of france to the history of florida and by julius caesar a citizen of rome in his epistle to his book entitled columbeados to this we may here add the testimony of camden who speaking of this undertaking of virginia at the return of the last colony sent thither by sir walter ralegh says he was a man never to be sufficiently commended for the great pains he took in discovering remote countries and advancing the glory of the english navigation  that baffimerus was the learned martine bassaniere of paris as i find elsewhere with whom richard hakluyt the worthy collector of our naval adventures being acquainted and having procured a very valuable history in manuscript of the first discovery of florida about  0 years before this time by rene laudonniere and three other french captains he sent it over to that monsieur bassaniere who published it from the said french copy this year at paris and dedicated it as aforesaid to sir walter ralegh who as appears above is therein celebrated for i have not yet seen though i have been promised that original french edition but it was translated into english the year following by richard hakluyt himself who also dedicates it anew to the same patron and indeed we find ralegh from this time a very considerable patron of learned and ingenious authors not only in history and geography but antiquities chemistry poetry and other polite branches of art and science for admiral coligny having sent over with the aforesaid discoverers of florida a very skilful artist from france to take draughts of whatever he found observable and worthy of representation in the said country which he did not only among the animal and vegetable rarities thereof but also it seems from the customs of the natives and historical events among the discoverers themselves this painter living afterward in london at or before the publication of those discoveries was supported by ralegh in the great expense of publishing also his draughts and descriptions for hakluyt among other reasons for not particularizing the commodities of those parts the accidents of the frenchmens government therein the causes of their good and bad success with the surprises made by their enemies tells ralegh he does not reckon them up again the rather because the same with diverse other things of chiefest importance are lively drawn in colors at your no small charges by the skilful painter james morgues sometime living in blackfriars london whom monsieur chastillion then admiral of france sent thither to florida with laudoniere for that purpose which painter was an eyewitness of the goodness and fertility of those regions and has put down in writing many singularities which are not mentioned in this treatise and which he has since published together with the portraitures hereunto we may further add that there was about this time also another book dedicated to ralegh in praise of music wherein besides the antiquity and dignity thereof is declared the sober and lawful use of the same in the congregation and church of god  i apprehend there was a greater propriety in the publishers choice of this patron to that work than is now commonly known for i have somewhere met with hints that sir walter ralegh was a great proficient in music either vocal instrumental or both whence we might be somewhat induced to construe some lines of spensers concerning him hereafter quoted in the literal sense  about this time it was her majesty conferred upon him some preferments but of honor more than profit perhaps to him for hooker in the dedication of his irish history dated the   th of october this year superscribes it to the right worthy and honorable gentleman sir walter ralegh knt seneschal of the dutchies of cornwall and exeter and lordwarden of the stannaries in devon and cornwall there is in being an old manuscript list of the officers in queen elizabeths time and their fees in which i find that as officer of the coinage of tin and steward of the stannaries in the duchy of cornwall sir walter raleghs fee was    l   s   d cotton libr to these dignities i presume he was then but newly advanced because the said historian in the body of the dedication begs leave to remember how it has pleased god to bring you says he into the favor of your prince and sovereign who besides her great favor toward you many ways has also laid upon you the charge of a government in your own country where you are to command many people by your honorable office of the stannary and where you are both a judge and a chancellor to rule in justice and to judge in equity  how ralegh used this favor and what usage it also procured him the same dedication does somewhat further reveal in these words it is well known that it had been no less easy for you than for such as have been advanced by kings to have builded great houses purchased large circuits and to have used the fruits of princes favors as most men in all former and present ages have done had you not preferred the general honor and commodity of your prince and country before all that is private whereby you have been rather a servant than a commander to your own fortune  the earl of essex had now been near a twelvemonth abroad under his fatherinlaw leicester governor of the netherlands was but nineteen years of age when he went over being his first engagement in any public action yet no less than a general of the horse and before that as himself says he had small grace and few friends at court on the  th of december      the earl of leicester and his train with an army of about  000 men set out from harwich in  0 sail of ships to his government of the netherlands and it was committed as absolutely to him as it had been to the emperor charles v but at last the hollanders growing jealous of his authority and complaining of certain innovations factions and treacherous commanders under him he was recalled and returned to london the   d of november this following year soon after the corpse of his much lamented nephew sir philip sidney not without leaving behind a printed vindication of himself in dutch now scarce to be found and striking a medal representing his own head on one side and seven unguarded straggling sheep on the other the author of a brief discourse of dr allens seditious drifts etc  to      p    endeavors to clear the earls conduct in that government against the said doctor as e cliffe in his breviate of hollands deliverance and ingratitude to the crown of england and the house of nassau  to      p    does against vander sand and hugo grotius especially the latter who insinuates as if the earl who died within two years following was poisoned by his wife because she soon after married again i have read this earls effects were then seized upon by the crown for debt and heard that an inventory of them is in the possession of sir john evelyn bart so that it must be now after their return that leicester set him up a competitor against ralegh as we are before informed out of sir henry wotton but leicester as great as his power was could no more bridle the licentious reflections of the populace than ralegh an instance whereof we have from some ancient authority it seems though in a modern author who speaking of tarleton the best comedian of these times in england tells us that when a pleasant play he had made was acting before her majesty he pointed at sir walter ralegh and said see the knave commands the queen for which she corrected him with a frown yet he had the confidence to add that he was of too much and too intolerable a power and going on with the same liberty he reflected on the over great power and riches of the earl of leicester which was so universally applauded by all who were present that she thought fit at that time to bear these reflections with a seeming unconcernedness but yet was so offended that she forbad tarleton and all her jesters from coming near her table being inwardly displeased with this impudent and unreasonable liberty ralegh seems to have little regarded these aspersions but constantly attended his public charge and employments whether in town or country as occasion called him accordingly we find him the latter end of this year in parliament where among other weighty concerns the fate of mary queen of scots was determined there is nothing particular upon record in the journals of the house of commons of raleghs opinion in this matter nor indeed any debates upon the sentence that had been pronounced against that queen for on the   th of november a petition agreed upon in both houses was presented to queen elizabeth by the speaker puckering the privy council and a body of the commons joined with the lord chancellor bromley and twenty other temporal lords for the speedy execution of the said queen of scots in consideration of the treasonable and rebellious practices wherewith she had been proved to endanger this realm and its ruler the said petition was immediately printed and that queen in less than three months after executed he was appointed one of the committee to confer upon the amendment of some things whereunto the clergy were required to be sworn and that some good course might be taken to have a learned ministry for the queen had in her speech at the close of the last sessions told the bishops of some faults and negligences which if you my lords of the clergy said she do not amend i mean to depose you  now ralegh resolving to persevere in planting his country of virginia prepared a new colony of one hundred and fifty men to be sent thither under the charge of mr john white whom he appointed governor and with him twelve assistants to whom he gave a charter and incorporated them by the name of the governor and assistants of the city of ralegh in virginia their fleet consisting of three sail departed from portsmouth on the   th of april      and in less than three months following arrived safe at hatorask from whence they went to the isle of roanoak to look for the fifteen men left there by sir richard greenvil the year before meaning from thence to pass to the bay of chesepiock where they intended to make their seat and fort according to the charge given them by sir walter ralegh but when they came to the north part of the island where governor lane had bu lt his fort they found it razed and the groundrooms of the dwellinghouses which had been also erected about it inhabited by deer and overgrown with melons or such like sort of fruit which those animals broozed upon at croatoan they were very well received and entertained by the natives through the means of manteo their countryman of these they learnt that the englishmen they were seeking had been treacherously set upon by a party of the savages who wounded some of them and drove the rest to some remote and obscure parts of the country on the   th of august their friend manteo was according to the commands of sir walter ralegh christened in roanoak and called lord thereof and of dasamonguepeuk in reward of his faithful services three days after the governors daughter eleanor wife of ananias dare one of the assistants was delivered of a daughter in roanoak and the infant was christened there the sunday following who because she was the first creolian or christian born in that country was baptized by the name of virginia now having reestablished their interest and alliance with the natives as far as this short interview would permit and delivered their ships of the provisions for the colony the planters began to consider they should be in want of fresh supplies therefore upon some difference about choosing a factor to return for that purpose into england they unanimously petitioned the governor to return himself to which he at last consented and the ships with some few of the company arrived in england not without storms sickness and the death of several of them by other like casualties about the latter end of the same year  it was but five days after the going forth of this second colony that mr richard hakluyt dedicated his translation of the voyages to florida before mentioned to the right honorable sir walter ralegh as he styles him captain of her majestys guard lordwarden of the stannaries and her highnesss lieutenant general of the county of cornwall in this dedication it will somewhat appear that neither the returns which might have been made by any merchantable products in virginia nor the profits arising to him from any spanish prizes which had been taken at sea were equivalent to the great expenses he had been at in settling this plantation and further that he had received no particular or private assistance in this enterprise from the queen because his hopes therein and her majestys regard thereof are so handsomely excited by the said author here this author illustrates his address by these examples the spaniards at their first entrance into hispaniola found neither sugarcanes nor ginger growing there nor any king of our cattle but finding the place fit for pasture they sent kine and bulls and sundry other profitable beasts thither and transported the plants of sugarcanes and set the roots of ginger the hides of which oxen with the sugar and ginger are now the chief merchandise of that island the portugals also at their first footing in madera as john barras writes in his first decade found nothing there but mighty woods for timber whereupon they called the island by that name howbeit the clime being favorable they enriched it by their own industry with the best wines and sugars in the world the like manner of proceeding they used in the isles of the azores by sowing therein great quantity of woad so they dealt in st thomas under the equinoctial and in brasile and in sundry other places   but the ships in which this second colony was transported had not been many days returned into england before we find raleghs thoughts diverted for a while from planting in a foreign country and engaged upon schemes of displanting rather those powerful enemies who were preparing to root themselves in his own for the rumor grew stronger every day of such a mighty fleet threatening us as if all spain and rome were to land upon our little island and overrun the whole kingdom the queen and her privy council therefore no longer delayed all proper means for the defense of the realm but out of all her commanders by land and sea appointed those of most approved abilities in naval and military affairs as well as of the greatest authority in their respective counties to hold consultations for the security of her person her people and their possessions and as there were such consultations distinctly held by the most ancient and experienced commanders at sea so we find by the like appointment a council of war also held on the   th of november this year by others of highest repute for their knowledge how to put the forces of the realm in the best order to withstand any invasion by land for this purpose were chosen the lord gray sir francis knolles sir thomas leighton sir walter ralegh sir john norris sir richard greenvil sir richard bingham sir roger williams and ralph lane esquire of their determinations in this important council i have a manuscript drawn up perhaps by sir walter ralegh himself the said draught being annexed to another manuscript now before me which was apparently of his composing  besides this grand scheme for the safeguard of the kingdom in general ralegh seems to have had some special regard to several particular places for there has been found among the lord burghleys papers a remembrance for the lordtreasurer touching the request of sir w r dated it seems this year which makes request for five pieces of brass cannon lying at woolwich also for letters to the marquis of winchester lieutenant of dorsetshire for a hundred men and arms to defend the castle and island of portland with a supply of powder there being but one last further for removal of the unserviceable ordnance there to london and that the lord marquis would give order for his said hundred men by his commission directed to the lieutenant of portland and he will undertake to collect men of sufficiency not of the trained number lastly for his lordships good remembrance for the towns of weymouth and melcombregis from whence my author is not only inclined to believe this paper was sent by sir walter ralegh but that he was now governor of portland castle and had those towns under his care we may indeed hence believe this paper was written by him and that he not only took those places but several others under his consideration that they might be put in the best state of defense but that he was now governor of portland castle or limited to the defense of that place at the time of the invasion as might be implied from my author seems not very consistent with his lieutenancy in the west  but as much engaged as ralegh seems at this time to have been for the safety of the kingdom he found some interval to consider also upon means for the relief of his colony for after governor white returned and had delivered him his letters with other advertisements concerning his late voyage and the state of the planters in virginia ralegh immediately appointed a pinnace to be sent thither with all such provisions as he apprehended they might want and also wrote letters to them promising that he would prepare a good supply of shipping and men with all other necessaries to be with them the summer following this pinnace and fleet he accordingly prepared at biddeford in the west of england under the command of sir richard greenvil and all things being now ready they waited only for a fair wind in the mean time the alarm so increased throughout all england of that vast and formidable armament made by the king of spain under the sanction of the popes crusado for the invasion and conquest of the whole island that most of the ships of war then in any readiness received orders from the state to attend in their harbors for the defense of their own country and sir richard greenvil was personally commanded not to depart out of cornwall governor white nevertheless labored so earnestly for the relief of the colony that he obtained two small pinnaces called the brave and the roe wherein fifteen planters and all convenient provisions for those who wintered in the country were transported but the names of the captains who commanded those vessels are not remembered on the   d of april      they put over the bar at biddeford and the same night came to anchor at the isle of lundy but the company minding more to make a gainful voyage than a safe one run in chase of prizes till at last one of them was met with by a couple of strong men of war of rochelle about  0 leagues to the northeast of madera where after a bloody fight the english were beaten boarded and rifled but it is observable the french men were so immoderate in possessing themselves of their spoil that by overloading the boats with the freight of the english ships they sunk what they were too eager to share in this maimed ransacked and ragged condition the said ship returned to england in a months time and about three weeks after returned the other having perhaps tasted of the same fare at least without performing the intended voyage to the distress of the planters abroad and displeasure of their patron at home  in the mean time the king of france sent queen elizabeth a message assuring her that the tempest which had been gathering in spain for three years would certainly break very speedily upon her kingdom therefore advised her to make the best preparation she could for its defense nor did the king of spain keep it now any longer a secret having this year published at lisbon an ample and ostentatious account of this invincible armada as the spaniards themselves had called it wherein it appears the whole fleet consisted of   0 or according to sir walter ralegh and hugo grotius   0 sail some few tenders or others joining them by the way not being perhaps in the spanish list reckoned carrying by the generality of accounts above   00 pieces of brass and iron ordnance near   000 soldiers between   and  000 sailors besides officers priests galleyslaves servants and other attendants amounting in all to about  0000 persons or according to the confession of don diego piementelli one of their own commanders who was driven into zealand the whole fleet army etc were no less than   000 men and cost the king of spain  0000 ducats every day the general of this mighty navy was the duke of medina sidonia knight of the golden fleece and john martines de ricalde was chief admiral in flanders the prince of parma was also making great preparations to join this armada had gathered up an army consisting of more than  00 some say  00 companies of foot and  000 horse and was very busy in making rafts ferryboats floating bridges portcullices gabions and what not nor were they idle in england for how well the directions of the council of war aforesaid were put in execution and how far ralegh may be presumed to have been engaged among the most indefatigable in this service is to be inferred from the words of that author who says in a very short time the whole kingdom and every corner were speedily furnished with armed people on horseback and on foot and those continually trained exercised and put into bands in such warlike manner as in no age ever was before in this realm and a little further that all concurred in one mind to be in readiness to serve for the realm and some one country was able to make a sufficient army of  0000 men fit to fight and   000 of them well armed and weaponed and in some countries the number of  0000 able men that the maritime countries from cornwall all along southward to kent and from thence eastward to lincolnshire were so furnished with soldiers both of themselves and with resort from their next shires as there was no place to be doubted for landing of any foreign forces but there were within    hours to come to the place above  0000 fighting men on horseback and on foot with all manner of ammunition provision and carriages under the principal nobles of the countries and captains of the greatest knowledge besides these armies for the maritime countries the city of london exercised before the queen  0000 men and had several thousands more in readiness that there was also two great armies raised whereof one were encamped at tilbury in essex between the city and the mouth of the thames consisting of   000 foot and  000 horse under the command of the earl of leicester  the queen reviewed this camp several times dined made orations in it and lodged in the borders of it the other army consisting of   000 foot and  000 horse commanded by the lord hunsdon was planted about the queens own person but six years before this occasion of raising the military strength of england according to sir walter ralegh there were upon a general view and master found in the kingdom of all men fit to bear arms     000 see his select essays and observations  vo    0 in his discourse of the invention of shipping p    and it increased daily by the several bands and troops which were led from the inland countries by such noblemen knights and gentlemen as had no special charge or government in their respective counties while the young earl of essex and others among them entertained her majesty with tiltings and tourneys barriers mockfights and suchlike arts as in public are wont to render men popular the earl of essex was now master of the queens horse see the letter to mendoza aforesaid p    in which sir henry wotton agrees who makes this father observation this service at tilbury camp was in my judgment says he the very poison of all that followed for there while the queen stood in some doubt of the spanish invasion she made him in field commander of the cavalry as he was before in court and much graced him openly in view of the soldiers and people even above my lord of leicester the truth is from thenceforth he fed too fast parallel bebetween robert devereux earl of essex and george villiers duke of buckingham but the lieutenants of the maritime counties were otherwise employed and as the earl of pembroke had been assiduous in levying the forces of wilts and somersetshire and the earl of bath those of devonshire so ralegh seems to have been no less forward and industrious in raising and reducing those of cornwall to the best order and discipline for the service of his country against the common enemy notwithstanding what he might have done as has been said before at portland and like the rest of the lordslieutenant to have sent up constantly his certificates to the queen of the numbers that were assembled the posture they were in the provisions they were supplied with or those whereof they stood in need  but notwithstanding all these landpreparations which moved some speculative warriors at court to think a seaforce unnecessary as if the english were sufficient to cut the spaniards to pieces in landing or when they were ashore and run away with their ships at the same time sir walter ralegh knew better what another kingdom might do even against england by the advantage of a fleet if we have none no man having so solidly resolved as himself that weighty question whether england without the help of a fleet is able to debar an enemy from landing he knew that ships without putting themselves out of breath will easily outrun the soldiers that coast them he knew that a fleet after sunset may be seen at the lizard and by the next morning at portland which an army should be six days in marching and consequently that the sailor may choose his landingplace where there are no soldiers that can oppose him and even supposing an invader should offer to land near where our greatest army was ready to receive him ralegh doubted when the choice of all our traindbands and of officers were drawn together as at tilbury to attend the person of the queen and to defend the city of london whether those that should remain to guard the coast could be of any such force as to encounter an army like that which the prince of parma should have landed in england  by sea therefore all possible defense was likewife made and the chief command was very properly conferred on the lordadmiral howard who hearing the invincible armada was upon the point of hoisting sail sent sir francis drake his vice admiral with fiftysix ships well appointed to the westernparts and himself arrived there on the   d of may with others which made up the fleet about a hundred sail while the lord henry seymer was sent to lie with forty english and dutch snips according to camden between dover and calais to intercept the prince of parma michael caielnau who was ambassador here many years and who has given the most noble and ingenuous character of the queen in his memoirs of any foreigner i have met with that knew her observes that she built a noble fleet the bulwark of ner kingdom and launched a large man of war every second year but by that long list of the english navy which this year opposed the spanish armada among the mss in the royal library    b xiii lately printed by mr lediard in his naval expeditions fol     it appears there were very few ships of that burden among them for though that list raises their number beyond all other accounts to     sail manifestly omitting some which were there and probably admitting several which were not yet there are not above six ships among them mentioned to be of  00 ton and not above seven of greater burden the invincible armada loosed anchor from lisbon four days before but met with such storms sickness and other disasters that the lordadmiral put forth toward spain in hopes of surprising them in their distress till more maturely considering they might pass by undiscovered he returned to plymouth and suffered his men to relieve themselves on shore the queen had received such assurance they were so disabled from coming this year by that storm that she made secretary walsingham send for four of her firstrate ships to be brought home to chatham but their return was prevented by the intelligence which captain thomas fleming brought into the harbor on the   th of july that he had discovered the enemy approaching from the lizardpoint in cornwall the captains and commanders were then it seems at bowls upon the hoe at plymouth and the tradition goes that drake would needs see the game up but was soon prevailed on to go and play out the rubbers with the spaniards all hands were now at work to warp out the ships which with the admirable industry of the seamen was very speedily performed the wind blowing stiffly into the haven from the southwest the lordadmiral with the few he could then get ready lay all night in the road next day about fifty or threescore more joined him and at noon they kend the spanish fleet some with lofty turrets and decks reared one above another and others rowed along with two or three hundred oars apiece all advancing with their spanish gravity the wind being abated in a semicircular order and extended seven miles from end to end the english suffered them all to pass by so got the advantage of the wind when they began to chase them in the rear nor did the spaniards offer to land at plymouth their commission being to join the prince of parma and sail directly to london the next day which was the   st of july the lordadmiral sent out a pinnace called the defiance and begun the fight this i take it was near the eddistone for there we have account of the first conflict and of the first spanish ship that was taken or sunk then the lordadmiral in the arkroyal drake in the revenge with hawkins frobisher and others having thundered thick upon the enemy for two hours together withdrew  0 of their ships not being yet come up in this engagement the spaniards by endeavoring to circle in and shelter one of their disabled galleons she had her foremast broken and was left behind which drake took the next day with don pedro de valdez and other nobles in her besides   000 ducats which were shared among his sailors immediately after another of their greatest ships was set on fire with all the people in her and yet the powder escaped but how the lordadmiral all the first night followed the spanish lanthern instead of drakes into their fleet while drake at the same time was making another mistaken pursuit and how the ark royal followed the spanish fleet also the second night so far almost alone that it was the afternoon following before the english fleet overtook her with other particulars i leave to the more ample accounts of this engagement that i may attend the motions of sir walter ralegh who from being at first the nearest now growing impatient at being the most remote from the enemy appears to have committed his charge by land to proper officers or detached part thereof to march up nearer the spaniards and with a gallant company of nobles and gentlemen in several ships to have joined the english fleet that is to say on the   d of july when the spanish fleet was advanced over against portland where this whole day being one continued engagement from morning till night it proved the most general and bloody fight of any between them in the british channel and here after the taking of a great venetian ship and others of lesser bulk the spaniards were driven from all intention of assaulting the english till they had joined the prince of parma for during this fight the english navy increased whereunto out of all havens of the realm resorted ships and men for they all with one accord came flocking thither to portland as unto a set field where immortal fame and glory was to be attained and faithful service to be performed unto their prince and country in which number having mentioned the earls of oxford northumberland and cumberland he also names sir walter ralegh among the foremost of near  0 other knights and gentlemen whereby the english ships were augmented to  00 sail and doubtless by some of those camden mentioned to have been left behind in plymouthsound with which ralegh very probably advanced what further persuades me to believe ralegh entered the fleet at this place and time is my having met with a certain foreign history hereafter mentioned which had been his own book and wherein he has with his own hand corrected other passages relating to himself but has let this of his joining the fleet as above pass uncontradicted these ever asunder and always in motion were on every side useful to annoy the enemy now presenting a broadside and sheering off then tacking about and discharging the other in such fort that sir henry wotton called it a morricedance upon the his parallel between robert earl of essex and george duke of buckingham beforementioned waters while the sluggish and unweildy castles of the enemy clustered and hampered together could only offer offense from one disabled side and that when they had done flew over the english mens heads camden tells us that in this days engagement the lordadmiral was advised by some of his officers with more heat than discretion to grapple with and board the enemy now ralegh having made some excellent animadversions upon this very circumstance goes nigh to prove out of his own words that he was not only in this days engagement but that the counsel he might thence appear to have given did greatly contribute to the success of it he has shown how well he knew that in such case the advantage of weapons would be likeliest to carry it whereof the enemy was provided with far the greatest number also that in such close fight how liable the lesser ships were to be crushed by the greater that these by their very height must have further advantage over those that endeavored to board them from below and lastly in these of more bulk and breadth being also more firm and more steady those who could best keep their feet would probably be best able to use their hands  next day the spaniards were glad to lie by and the english no less pleased with the cessation that they might take the opportunity of sending to shore for a recruit of ammunition and this being a circumstance taken notice of also by ralegh himself further confirms his having been now among them the   th of july the english had another sharp battle with the spanish admiral and the three great galleasses at the isle of wight in which cambden mentions the taking of a portuguese galleon and that from this time the galleasses durst not venture upon any new engagement but closing themselves up again in a rundel as they called it made the best of their way to tell the prince of parma how they had been served the english fleet followed and kept playing upon their rear all the next day having determined to forbear any closer engagement till they came to the british frith or streights of calais where the lord seymer expected their arrival but so far was this invincible armada from alarming the seacoasts says camden that the english gentry of the younger sort entered themselves volunteers and leaving their friends and families did with incredible cheerfulness hire ships at their own charge and in pure love to their country joined the grand fleet in vast numbers and here camden names those nobles and some of those gentlemen with ralegh among them which composed the squadron beforementioned as if it entered but now from dover or some of those ports not that he confines their entrance to this day otherwise than naming them under it or any other way suggests they did not join the grand fleet three days before but seems by remembering them in this place to have believed they were most conspicuous or in greatest number at this time unless he postponed the mention of them to a day that was least thronged with circumstances of action indeed that this noble squadron of volunteers was united to the queens navy when such valiant services were performed against the spaniards in the great fight before calais another writer also greatly to their commendation agrees but neither is he so expressive as to satisfy us it was the first appearance they made and that they were not before at portland for having mentioned the earls of cumberland northumberland and other gentlemen of distinction who without any charge or knowledge of the queen joined the fleet before calais and ventured their lives in the said engagement he goes on to observe how earnest all ranks and degrees were by instancing also that the earl of oxford one of the most ancient nobles in this land went to sea and served the queen among them as did robert cecil lord dudley and sir walter ralegh a gentleman of the queens privy chamber says he and in his company a great number of young gentlemen among whom were william cecil edward darcie and arthur gorge the same persons mentioned with others by camden and also in larger number by the dutch historian above quoted three days before with the recital of whom i only show you continues my last author the letterwriter how far we have been deceived to think that we should have had a party here for us when as you behold both by land and sea all sorts of men were so ready at their own charges without either commandment or entertainment to adventure also their lives in defense of the queen and the realm from hence it appears this squadron must have also been at the final overthrow of the spanish armada which on the   th of july in the evening anchored before calais intending to hold on for dunkirk in expectation of the prince of parma who was always preparing but never ready and the english following anchored also within culvering shot of them here the lord seymer joined the english and then the lordadmirals fleet was increased to a hundred and forty sail says camden wherein he both exactly agrees with the augmentation thereof at portland by these volunteers as we have it from the dutch historian there quoted and also excludes all intermediate addition of ships at least by the number himself has before given us of the lord seymers squadron next day the english resolved according to the queens directions upon the stratagem of the fireships to burn or disperse the spanish navy and the same was put in practice at or soon after midnight so successfully that the enemy cutting their cables with the utmost horror and precipitancy were some scattered by the wind some fell foul of each other and others struck upon the sands the english chasing and thundering upon them from all quarters then was a great galleass taken by captain preston its commander moncada slain and a booty of near as much gold fell to the conquerors as was taken in another beforementioned it was affirmed by men of great judgment in calais that never was seen by any man living such a battery so great for number so furious and of so long continuance as the english made against the spanish calais saw the spanish navy first driven from their anchors with fire they saw the greatest galleass of the spanish whereof was commander that worthy nobleman moncada spoiled and himself slain in it by the english calais saw the next day that the english fought and beat the armada from eight oclock in the morning till four in the afternoon without ceasing calais saw the spanish hoist up all their sails and fly as fast as the wind could drive and the english pursue them yet calais saw a sufficient navy of england left before dunkirk able to master all the shipping that the duke of parma had provided thus in a scarce old tract in the harleyan library b h called a pack of spanish lies first printed in spain translated and now ripped up unfolded and condemned  to      p   on the   th of july the spaniards ranged themselves into the best order they could within sight of graveling hither the english fleet also pursued them and here the spaniards received their last fatal adieu by incessant and numberless damages from the english cannon the greatest part of the day till their galleons galleasses galleys urcas and zabras were so miserably shattered having their hulls pierced through and through their oars and rudders cut away their tackling all rent and their masts broken that some were deserted as unserviceable some sunk with the crew that was in them and others retiring upon the neighboring coasts were seized and plundered by the inhabitants while those that had the ability left them most prudently employed it in running away the english still followed them into the northern seas even beyond the latitude of    degrees and leaving them past all thoughts of the prince of parma returned on the  th of august when the violent storms that arose resumed their cause and completed their victory for by the tempests shipwrecks sickness and famine in their dangerous passage homewards they sustained greater losses than even all they had met with throughout the narrow seas for the particulars of those losses we shall refer to the distinct and more copious narratives of this invasion at the end of an old pamphlet before quoted called certain advertisements out of ireland concerning the losses and distresses of the spanish navy there is one list of fifteen spanish ships which perished or were taken by the english in july and august in the narrow seas and another list of    more sunk burnt and taken on the coasts of ireland in september so that both losses were    ships in which were also destroyed and taken  0    men whereof  000 were detained prisoners in england and zealand further adding there were multitudes besides slain sunk or starved who were not accounted for insomuch as van meteran in hakluyt more distinctly computes with whom i observe most of our historians agree there returned not home above    sail leaving also behind the greater and better part of their men and as they all conclude there was not a famous or worthy family in all spain which in this expedition lost not a son a brother or a kinsman  among the english there were not in the whole eight or nine days engagement above  00 lost and among them only one captain named cock   and close this account with the summary thereof which was soon after published to the world by sir walter ralegh himself where giving the honor of the victory to the courage and conduct of the lordadmiral howard he says that notwithstanding the victories they pretended to have obtained it was soon manifested to all nations how the navy which they had termed invincible consisting of   0 sail was by  0 of the queens ships of war and a few merchantmen beaten and shuffled together even from the liard point in cornwall to portland where they shamefully left don pedro de valdez with his mighty ship from portland to calais where they lost hugo de moncada with the galleys of which he was captain and from calais driven with squibs from their anchors were chased out of the sight of england round about scotland and ireland where for the sympathy of their barbarous religion hoping to find succor and assistance a great part of them were crushed against the rocks and those other who landed being very many in number were notwithstanding broken slain and taken and so sent from village to village coupled in halters to be shipped into england where her majesty of her princely and invincible disposition disdaining to put them to death and scorning either to retain or entertain them they were all sent back again to their own country to witness and recount the worthy achievements of their invincible navy  the services of sir walter ralegh against this invasion his diligence in regulating the forces of the land and his interest in strengthening those of the sea the charges he was at and the dangers he voluntarily incurred however undistinguished more than is above expressed by our common historians and those few inaccurate accounts thereof which are descended to us were yet received with such approbation by the queen that she seems as some recompense for them to have this year made a considerable augmentation to his patent of wines as if he had besides the grant beforementioned another now also bestowed upon him for tonnage and poundage upon those liquors except it is the same patent with the former only renewed this year or wrong dated in the author who mentions it be it as it should this patent seems to have been one of the most beneficial favors which ralegh ever received of the queen and might perhaps exceed in profit the pension which she settled on the lordadmiral himself for his conduct and courage in the said overthrow this benefit ralegh enjoyed as long as she lived though toward the close of her reign the number of suchlike grants to others being very much increased they were inveighed against in parliament as grievous and burdensome monopolies by those especially who had not the merit or interest to procure any for themselves sir robert naunton tells us in his conclusion of raleghs character with relation to the grants he thus obtained that though he gained much at the court yet he took it not out of the exchequer or merely out of the queens purse but by his wit and the help of the prerogative for the queen was never profuse in delivering out her treasures but paid many and most of her servants part in money and the rest with grace we meet with another office which ralegh himself erected no less praiseworthy than this was profitable to him for one writer in the short account he gives of him having spoken of the division he made of his time in allowing five hours to sleep four to reading two for discourse and the rest to business and other necessaries and having hinted at the diversity of his correspondencies intelligence and the like says that in the capacity of an agency for all sorts of persons he set up a kind of office of address and further that considering the dispatch of such variety of engagements in the former part of his life one must be much to seek how a man of so many actions should write any thing and one of so many writings should do any thing by another little hint that has been elsewhere preserved we may conceive this office did chiefly respect a more liberal intercourse a nobler mutuality of advertisement than would perhaps admit of all sorts of persons and such as advanced rather to the improvement of men themselves than their means but this suggestion is drawn only from comparing it with the general tendency of those other schemes among which i once saw it mentioned in a letter written by an ingenious person of great note for his writings to a nobleman who had the greatest correspondence with such persons of any in his time recommending that long dried fountain of communication which montaigne first proposed sir walter ralegh put in practice and mr hartlib endeavored to revive the notice of this most useful scheme since i have not at present mr hartlibs own account i shall here offer in sir william pettys ingenious representation of it directed many years since to the said last projector himself we must recommend says he an office of address according to the projection of mr hartlib that painful and great instrument of this design whereby the wants and desires of all may be made known to all where men may know what is already done in the business of learning what is at present in doing and what is intended to be done to the end that by such a general communication of designs and mutual assistance the wits and endeavors of the world may no longer be as so many scattered coals which for want of union are soon quenched whereas being but laid together they would have yielded a comfortable light and heat for methinks the present condition of men is like a field where a battle having been lately fought we see many legs arms and organs of sense lying here and there which for want of conjunction and a soul to quicken and enliven them are fit for nothing but to feed the ravens and infect the air so we see many wits and ingenuities dispersed up and down the world whereof some are now laboring to do what is already done and puzzling themselves to reinvent what is already invented others we see quite stuck fast in difficulties for want of a few directions which some other man might he be met withal both could and would most easily give him again one man wants a small sum of money to carry on some design that requires it and there is perhaps another who has twice as much ready to bestow upon the same design but these two having no means ever to hear the one of the other the good work intended and desired by both parties does utterly perish and come to nothing but this we pass over slightly though very fundamental to our business because the master builder thereof himself has done it so solidly   don antonio king of portugal who had been expelled from his dominions by king philip and was now in london soon after the signal overthrow of the armada aforesaid took this opportunity to renew his motion to queeen elizabeth for her assistance toward his restoration which he propounded to the lordtreasurer in a letter full of liberal offers written in the portuguese language all with his own hand the queen not only consented to the enterprise as thinking it more convenient to return the late visit of the spaniards in their own country than suffer them to repeat it here but lent six of her men of war and disbursed  0000 pounds toward defraying the charges thereof this encouragement and the late provocation so spirited up the warlike men of the kingdom and ralegh among the rest to become volunteers therein that they augmented the number of the said ships with a hundred and twenty sail more and manned them with fourteen or fifteen thousand soldiers and sailors at their own further expense committing the charge by sea to sir francis drake and that by land to sir john norris who were probably the most considerable contributors thereto  but first ralegh took care for the relief of his plantation in virginia which that he might more effectually secure than could be expected from his own single assistance especially after the many heavy disbursments he had made and the great disappointment the colony must doubtless have received by missing of the last supplies he sent them through the losses which his agents too rashly brought thereon he made an assignment to diverse gentlemen and merchants of london for continuing the plantation of this new discovered country with english men and this was now no less advisedly done with regard to himself than affectionately with respect to the people employed therein whom though he generously assisted with his advice and interest in some future prosecutions of this undertakings yet these proving improsperous through the oblique courses they took at first setting out upon this new foundation like that in which they lately failed it was twenty years from this time before even a whole company could make a more successful and advanced p ogress in this settlement than sir walter ralegh of himself alone had done it having cost him no less than  0000 l  as for the expedition before mentioned which was set out under drake and norris about five weeks after the said assignment that is on the   th of april      in which don antonio was by ralegh among the rest accompanied to portugal we need not here be circumstantial thereon especially as to the action at the groine the overthrow of the spaniard at puente de burgus the taking of peniche with the castle of cascais the assault of lisbon and the burning of vigo seeing our historians have not distinguished what part ralegh had therein in which perhaps they seem not so grateful to him as he was to his associates but particularly in not mentioning him at the taking of that great number of easterling hulks and other ships laden with spanish goods provisions and ammunition for a new invasion of england which from the  d of june some or other of the adventurers none are named continued to bring into the english fleet then lying in the road of cascais for six days together this fleet of ours was but thinly manned at first and having lost some thousands by sickness and intemperance with the new wines of those countries hands could not be spared to bring home much above a quarter of those vessels and their lading that were thus taken for sir roger williams who was a colonel in the landservice of this expedition has said in a letter of his still extant it is well known we had above two hundred sail of all sorts of which we could not carry with us above threescore for the want of men hence arose at their return into england a little contention between williams and ralegh for ralegh having taken some of these prizes williams placed in one of them his lieutenant with some of his soldiers without which says williams it could not have been carried into england wherefore he would have laid claim it seems both to the ship and its cargo this voyage as he goes on having cost him a thousand pounds as it did several other of the adventurers no doubt but his claim not being thought reasonable the earl of bath lieutenant of devonshire discharged his men from that vessel at dartmouth williams at this growing very turbulent and his clamours reaching the queens ear procured her displeasure against him which occasioned his said letter to three of the privy council whence this intelligence is extracted from this letter we farther collect the achievements of the english in this voyage so well satisfied the queen in the disablement of the enemy especially as to their naval powers that she honored the commanders or chief adventurers therein and sir walter ralegh among the rest with a golden chain for sir roger presumed the earl of essex his great friend as appears in the histories of this expedition with the rest who were in the action would testify that i deserve a chain as well as my fellows say he as for the coarse expression which follows of raleghs belying his hulk as he had done the ark of noah the best ship that ever was though it may betray some impoliteness of manners and impetuosity of disposition in sir rogers civil capacity yet in the field and against an enemy those rougher qualities might invigorate his courage and experience and illustrate the miliary character of the man  in the latter end of june this year and some weeks before this dispute the english fleet returned home but ralegh appears first to have touched upon the coast of ireland probably to make a short visit to his seigniory there and see some of his acquaintance among the new settlements in the province of munster we may be pretty well convinced that ralegh was in ireland this year from his own writings where speaking of the long lives of the patriarchs and some of late memory he says i myself knew the old countess of desmond of inchequin in munster who lived in the year      and many years since who was married in edward the fourths time and held her jointure from all the earls of desmond since then and that this is true all the nobility and gentlemen of munster could witness history of the world lib i cap   sect   of this old lady see more in lord bacons history of life and death and sir william temples essay on health and long life in his miscellanies part   published by jonathan swift m a prebendary of st patricks  vo   0  p     where telling us she lived far in king james s reign it appears she must have been alive at the time sir walter ralegh was writing that he knew her in ireland the year aforesaid and that it was upon his return from a long voyage out of some verses hereafter following in spenser the poet for here we may observe that while ralegh was a commander in the irish wars under the lord gray as we have before related this edmund spenser then famous for those pastorals he had newly published going over secretary to that nobleman had frequent opportunities by his ingenious conversation so to make his learning and other accomplishments known as engaged the friendship of our worthy so substantially toward him that none of the great men in queen elizabeths court after the death of sir philip sidney was so great a patron to that extraordinary genius as sir walter ralegh indeed the queen herself in regard that spenser employed his time so commendably in ireland as afterward more publicly appeared in the excellent political view he made of that kingdom gave him a considerable tract of land out of earl desmonds capacious forfeitures amounting at the lowest computation that has been made to  000 acres of ground lying in the county of cork the preservation and improvement whereof engaged spenser to settle there and a pleasant seat he had at kilcolman near the river mulla which ran through his grounds and which he has so beautifully described in some of his poems here it was in this retirement that ralegh now paid him a visit the circumstances whereof spenser himself has most agreeably celebrated in that poem which about two years after this time he dedicated to the right worthy and noble knight sir walter ralegh etc in this dedication he has these words i make you present of this simple pastoral unworthy of your higher conceit for the meanness of the style but agreeable with the truth in circumstance and matter the which i humbly beseech you to accept in part of payment of the infinite debt in which i acknowledge myself bounden unto you for your singular favors and sundry good turns showed me at my last being in england and with your good countenance protect against the malice of evil mouths which are always wide open to carp at and misconstrue my simple meaning in the pastoral itself entitled collin clouts come home again in the last edition of spenser vol   p      the poet gives us this description of raleghs first accosting him in the said rural retirement  one day quoth he i sat as was my trade under the foot of mole that mountain hoar keeping my sheep amongst the cooly shade of the green alders by the mullas shore there a strange shepherd chanced to find me out whether allured with my pipes delight whose pleasing sound yshrilled far about or thither led by chance i knew not right whom when i asked from what place he came and how he hight himself he did ycleep the shepherd of the ocean by name and said he came far from the mainsea deep he sitting me beside in that same shade provoked me to play some pleasant fit and when he heard the music that i made he found himself full greatly pleased at it yet aemuling my pipe he took in hond my pipe before that aemuled of many and played thereon for well that skill he cond himself as skilful in that art as any it further appears they now entertained each other with some of their poetical compositions spenser rehearsed a pretty tale he had made of the amors between some of his neighboring rivers but raleghs muse ran upon a more melancholy strain which by the transient view it gives of some little cloud he had lately but undeservedly been under at court lets us into a piece of his secret history where the poet tells us  his song was all a lamentable lay of great unkindness and of usage hard of cynthia the lady of the sea which from her presence faultless him debarred and ever and anon with singults rife he cried out to make his undersong ah my loves queen and goddess of my life who shall me pity when thou do me wrong but it immediately appears to have been soon blown over by some pathetical address of raleghs to the queen whereby he was at this time restored to her favor as we may fully conclude from these words   right well be sure did plain that could great cynthias sore displeasure break and move to take him to her grace again and this is confirmed a little further where through raleghs affection for his welfare and his regret to behold so rare a genius banished to a desert and buried in such a state of obscurity he persuades spenser to go along with him into england and proffers to introduce him to the queen the poet knowing his interest embraced his offer then having given a description of the sea with raleghs great ship suitable to the simplicity of the character he assumes and having represented raleghs description of the flocks and herds of that royal shepherdess which were kept upon those watery hills under the charge of triton and proteus he makes him further say  and i among the rest of many least have in the ocean charge to me assigned where i will live or die at her beheast and serve and honor her with faithful mind he then proceeds to the progress of their voyage how they passed by the isle of lundy and landed at st michaels mount in cornwall so took their journey to the court where the poet having expatiated on the dazzling presence of the queen agreeable to the admiration of a spectator in his pastoral character we have this further acknowledgment  the shepherd of the ocean quoth he unto the goddess s grace me first enhanced and to my oaten pipe inclined her ear that she thenceforth therein gan take delight and it desired at timely hours to hear all were my notes but rude and roughly dight this honor the poet further magnifies as the more wondrous condescension in her majesty in that she had so many more learned shepherds about her to glorify her name here he takes an opportunity to give a character of the several poets and wits then shining in her court among the rest  and there that shepherd of the ocean is that spends his wit in loves consuming smart full sweetly tempered is that muse of his that can impierce a princes mighty heart as to raleghs poetical talents we shall hear more of them very speedily in this place we must pursue his farther design of bringing spenser over into england which was to make him oblige the public with what he had hitherto finished of his capital work called the fairy queen for though spencer had begun this grand poem through the encouragement of sir philip sidney before he went over into ireland yet it was there he seems to have writ most of what we have in print and now by the encouragement of sir walter ralegh that he was brought to publish the three first books which he had completed thereof it is certain he took his advice in the publication of them and particularly in drawing up a plan to explain or discover the general intention and meaning of that allegorical poem this he directed to his said patron the right noble and valorous sir walter ralegh etc in a letter dated the   d of january this year      concluding with an humble request for the continuance of his honorable favors and wishes for the eternal establishment of his happiness this letter is printed at the end of the said first three books of that poem which were published at london the ensuing year among the commendatory verses thereto also subjoined the first two copies are both said to be written by sir walter raleigh and not without great probability being subscribed with the initial letters of his name the first of these copies written in alternate verse is highly poetical for our author correspondent with the visionary manner of his author fancying himself in the temple of the vestal virgins where his curiosity led him to the tomb of laura which was guarded by love and virtue he was suddenly attracted from thence by the appearance of the fairy queen at whose approach the soul of petrarch wept seeing those graces desert that mistress of his to attend upon this royal lady and oblivion supply their place the compliment is surely fine and perhaps the more judiciously expressed in not being bounded more periodically than it is according to the doctrine of our modern critics in the structure of versification for being the recital of one solemn and surprising thought it may engage our attention more closely to the end of the two or three quadrains it is comprised in than if the author had affected to divide or bound the sense with a full period at the end of every four lines but every reader may easily judge for himself the poem being in most editions of spenser and therefore needs not here be recited his other verses upon this poet are composed in a measure more obsolete to the manner of our age but what the queen her self imitated in some poetry still to be seen of her writing being in lines of six and seven feet long it may be sufficient therefore to observe there is a distinguished conduct also in this performance for the induction is writ with great modesty in regard to himself  the praise of meaner wits this work like profit brings as does the cuckows song delight when philomela sings and having advertised the poet that his portraits are to be judged of or improved by the originals of those virtues whereof he has composed his fictitious queen he very dexterously transfers or appropriates them to the real one then reigning so concludes with a compliment to him which though of a very transcendent and absolute nature yet in regard to the little good english poetry then in being and the great fame of that poet still surviving among us is still thought not more expressive of sir walter raleghs affection than his judgment of me no lines are loved nor letters are of price of all that speak the english tongue but those of thy device   we further observe among the copies of verses inscribed by spenser himself at the end of his said fairy queen to the several ministers of state and noblemen in queen elizabeths court one to the noble and valorous sir walter ralegh etc as he again styles him and this because it not only informs us what a favorite ralegh was at this time with the queen but also gives us occasion to dilate upon his own poetical productions a little more copiously than opportunity has before offered  to thee that are the summers nightingale thy sovereign goddesses most dear delight why do i send this rustic madrigal that may thy tuneful ear unseason quite thou only fit this argument to write in whose high thoughts pleasure has built her bower and dainty love learned sweetly to indite my rhymes i know unsavry are and sour to taste the streams which like a golden shower flow from thy fruitful head of thy loves praise fitter perhaps to thunder martial stowre when so thee list thy lofty muse to raise yet till that thou thy poem wilt make known let thy fair cynthias praises be thus rudely shown hence we learn sir walter ralegh wrote a poem called cynthia that it was in praise of the queen and that it was not now published spenser in his letter to ralegh above cited also mentions again something of this poem where he says in that fairy queen i mean glory in my general intention but in my particular i conceive the most excellent and glorious person of our sovereign the queen and her kingdom in fairyland and yet in some places else i do otherwise shadow her for considering she bears two persons the one of a most royal queen or empress the other of a most virtuous and beautiful lady this latter part in some places i do express in belphoebe fashioning her name according to your own excellent conceit of cynthia phoebe and cynthia being both names of diana this is all i remember to have met with of that poem  but this very year that ralegh was in ireland there was a book published by a learned and ingenious gentleman in which others of raleghs poems and perhaps that beforementioned are quoted with great commendation this treatise now very scarce is called the art of english poesy contrived in three books the first of poets and poesy the second of proportion the third of ornament london  to      i never saw but one of them and this is in the curious library of that worthy owner james west esquire of the middle temple there is a wooden print of the queen before it and though dedicated to the lord burghley the work is addressed directly to the queen therefore that passage in the first book cap    where the author is so luxuriant upon the epithalamies or poetical manner of celebrating marriages and that in the third book cap    where he makes the imperial ambassador a bohemian born so bluntly express in the french tongue what a gallant horsewoman the empress was will among some others be allowed very remarkable in a book so publicly and so particularly tendered to the perusal of our virginqueen  as if these few little pieces had before this time rendered him eminent and advanced his name among the prime wits or leading poets of the age not that we are sure they were now in common print or vulgarly known to be his for the said author speaking of the most considerable writers in english poetry says in her majestys time sprung up another company of courtly poets who have writ excellently well if their doings could be found out and made public with the rest of which number is edward earl of oxford thomas lord buckhurst when young henry lord paget sir philip sidney sir walter ralegh and many others some of whom he further names  then proceeding to give his judgment in short characters of them and having distinguished the earl of oxford for comedy buckhurst for tragedy sir philip sidney and the other gentleman who wrote the late shepherds calender meaning spenser for eclogue and pastoral he adds for ditty and amorous ode i find sir walter ralegh s vein most lofty insolent and passionate but it is in the chapter of sententious or rhetorical figures that this critic illustrates his observation by some examples out of sir walter raleghs poems which because rare to be met with i shall here rehearse that critic therefore where he is speaking of some elegant tautologies in poetry and particularly the excellencies of the anaphora or figure of report as he translates it gives us the following example written by sir walter ralegh whether in his cynthia i cannot yet tell but to his greatest mistress in most excellent verses says that author  in vain my eyes in vain you waste your tears in vain my sighs the smokes of my despairs in vain you search the earth and heavens above in vain you seek for fortune keeps my love further speaking of the epizeuxis which he englishes the underlay or cuckowspell another sort of repetition when in one verse we iterate one word without intermission he brings as an example that of sir walter ralegh very sweet says he  with wisdoms eyes had but blind fortune seen then had my love my love for ever been and in another place to distinguish that form of repetition called ploche or the doubler a speedy iteration of one word but with some little intermission he exemplies the two closing verses of a most excellent ditty as he calls it written by sir walter ralegh these two closing verses confirm the genuineness of those which precede them in a transcript of this very ditty i once saw in a noblemans library from the copy of a celebrated lady lady isabella thynne the same who is so finely celebrated by mr waller though her surname is no where to be found in any of the printed editions i have seen of his poems but i have had an old ms collection in which one poem is directed to the lady isabella thynne cutting trees in paper which poem is printed among mr wallers but her name left out in the print also we have only a fragment but my copy had it entire for the poem which follows it in mr wallers printed collection is a compliment to the same lady for restoring him this piece because he desired to print it though the last thought was torn off and lost which to his regret he never could recollect so was obliged to print it imperfectly in his own apprehensions at least though all the world besides have looked upon what is printed of it as a perfect masterpiece even of that great hand and for our consolation it may be observed if he had not lost this conclusion we should have lost that fine poem which was the consequence of it  who probably had it out of the family it is there entitled the excuse written by sir walter ralegh in his younger years and because by the foregoing parts of this admired ditty the conclusion will be best understood i shall here repeat the whole from the aforesaid transcript  calling to mind my eyes went long about to cause my heart for to forsake my breast all in a rage i sought to pull them out as who had been such traitors to my rest what could they say to win again my gra ce forsooth that they had seen my mistress face another time my heart i called to mind thinking that he this woe on me had brought because that he to love his force resigned when of such wars my fancy never thought what could he say when i would him have slain that he was hers  and had forgone my chain at last when i perceived both eyes and heart excuse themselves as guiltless of my ill i found myself the cause of all my smart and told myself that i myself would kill yet when i saw myself to you was true i loved myself because my self loved you there is one old collection i never saw printed about the time we are now upon with several of sir philip sidneys sonnets in it and therefore i think under his name which possibly may contain some also of sir walter raleghs but in that modern collection there is also printed not over correctly it seems another poem of his this i have likewise seen in manuscript where it is called the silent lover and have heard several lines in it applauded especially the beginning but the part which would be most agreeable in this place to an historical reader is that from which he might fancy he could make some further guesses at the object of raleghs address  but seeing that i sue to serve a saint of such perfection as all desire and none deserve a place in her affection i rather choose to want relief than venture the revealing where glory recommends the grief despair disdains the healing and a little farther very persuasively  silence in love betrays more woe than words though never so witty a beggar that is dumb you know may challenge double pity in short he has said such handsome things of silence that it were a pity any words even in its commendation but his own should break it but it will perhaps hereafter be thought he could break it himself with as much success as now he seems to have commanded the keeping it all that i have seen more of his juvenile compositions in this kind is a pastoral sonnet which old mr isaac walton reciting tells us was written by sir walter ralegh in his younger years see isaac waltons complete angler  th edition  vo      p    etc this walton was    years of age at raleghs death and lived  0 years besides that book for which he has been called the father of anglers he wrote five lives of learned and religious men excellently well being either from a personal knowledge of them or their intimate friends in answer to another famous also in those days composed by christopher marlow  there is another poet besides spenser who writ something of ralegh relating to these times though near twenty years after them and as on a different subject so with a different disposition toward him this poet was sir john harrington the translator of orlando furioso but that which he is here mentioned for is a little book in prose yet not clear of poetry though it was intended for a piece of church history and as a supply to dr francis godwins catalogue of bishops this at the time that ralegh was under royal displeasure in the next reign and in confinement but growing into favor with the hopeful prince of wales sir john harrington then a courtier presented to that prince it is full of little jests and tales against the married clergy and against some of the laity who had any controversies with them the better to insinuate with that young prince and engage his attention otherwise the author would doubtless have written it with a gravity suitable to the subject but he tells the prince he took some kind of pleasure with the pains of writing it supposing says he i was all the while telling a story as it were in your highness presence and hearing among the stories he tells there is one concerning dr thomas godwin bishop of bath and wells and sir walter ralegh it seems the relation of which because that bishop died about the latter end of    0 we shall not longer defer this bishop he tells us came to that see among his other good qualities unreprovable for simony and in the queens good opinion if he had held on as clear as he entered i should have highly extolled him says our author but continues he see his misfortune which first lost him the queens favor and after forced him to another mischief for being aged diseased and lame of the gout he married as some thought for opinion of wealth a london widow his second wife at least when a chief favorite of that time whom he had named before in this kind and therefore thought by some as perhaps it might be sir walter ralegh had labored to get the manor of banwell from this bishopric but disdaining the repulse and hearing of this intempestive marriage he took advantage thereof caused it to be told the queen knowing how much she misliked such matches and instantly pursued the bishop with letters and mandates for the manor of banwell for a hundred years the good bishop to pacify his persecutors and to save banwell was fain to part with wilscomb for    years and so purchased his peace and as he did not hold on so clear as he entered it might be with reference to the simony beforementioned the queen saw it not unreasonable but espoused the alienation so that it was her gift and the bishops own son dr francis godwin when he was bishop also and reviving his catalogue of bishops in the next reign before ralegh was out of prison makes no complaint against him in the account of his fathers life though he might safely if he could justly have done it and ralegh had been possessed of that for which this authors father had not according to the custom of those times received satisfaction on the contrary with much modesty rather laments that his father should take upon him the duties of ecclesiastical government when his infirmities had rendered him unable to discharge them  if this affair did any ways displease the hierarchy there was another occurrence fell out about this time in which ralegh by showing a generous and charitable instance of his power and interest might give some further umbrage for its displeasure it was in the case of mr john udall minister of the gospel a good scholar and a man of good parts but very zealous for the reformation even under the episcopal government for which he was reckoned among the nonconformists or rather puritans of those times he had been bred at cambridge was seven years minister of kingston upon thames and through the favor of the earl of huntington about a twelvemonth at newcastle upon tine here he was silenced sent for to london by letters from the lordchamberlain hunsdon in the name of the council and examined about a book he had newly published against the clergy entitled the demonstration of discipline which christ has prescribed in his word for the government of the church in all times and places until the worlds end  the horrible treason in this book it seems which was inserted in the indictment lay in these words to the bishops who can without blushing deny you to be the cause of all ungodliness seeing your government is that which gives leave to a man to be any thing saving a sound christian for certainly it is more free in these days to be a papist an anahaptist of the family of love yea any wicked one whatsoever than that which we should be and i could live these twenty years any such in england yea in a bishops house maybe and never be molested for it so true is that which you are charged with in a dialogue lately come forth against you and since burned by you that you care for nothing but the maintenance of your dignities be it to the damnation of your own souls and infinite millions more strypes life and acts of archbishop whitgift fol      p       but because contrary to the laws he would not betray himself he was committed close prisoner to the gatehouse debarred of all communication with his family or others thence conveyed to croydon in july this present year    0 brought to the bar in fetters and indicted for publishing a libel against the queen no evidence viva voce produced to attest it but only depositions taken in the high commissioncourt no court of record and hearsay reports urged against him his witnesses not being permitted to testify in his behalf because the court said it was against the queen the words of the statute being wrested says my author by baron clark and sergeant puckering as if the treatise called the demonstration of discipline for which udall was now indicted because written against bishops who exercised their government under the queen was therefore consequently written against her royal person so the said judges directed the jury to find udall author of the book without legal proof and to leave the felony to them  the jury did as they were taught being told it should be no further danger to the author but tend to his good of which verdict they afterward repented then he was kept half a year uncondemned in durance and at the assizes in february following at southwark not relinquishing his tenets he had the sentence of death pronounced against him by puckering but it seems before udall received this sentence he had procured a friend to solicit sir walter ralegh that the violent and aggravated constructions which had been made of his doctrine and principles might not be his utter destruction till a more unprejudiced judgment was made of them and immediately after the sentence was pronounced the sheriff brought him a reprieve from the queen then dr bond one of her chaplains came to him in prison with a form of submission for him to subscribe after two days conference they agreed upon another but says udall at the same time that dr bond was with me i received a letter from a friend of mine that did solicit sir walter ralegh for me this letter he then exhibits and thereby it appears ralegh had advised or encouraged udall to explain himself to him concerning those imputations which had been infused into her majesty which accused him with maintaining the church of england and its sacraments were no church and no sacraments that its laws and her government were against the word of god that all ecclesiastical matters ought to be governed by a presbytery and that she ought to be subject to the censures thereof for says that correspondent if ye will write half a dozen lines to sir walter ralegh concerning these opinions that he may show it to her majesty he hopes to obtain your life i know it is very easy for you to answer all those things therefore do it with speed and in your writing to sir walter take knowledge that he has sent you such word hereupon udall wrote a letter which he also sets forth directed to the right honorable sir walter ralegh knt lordwarden of the stannaries wherein after the remembrance of his duty and thanks for his great and honorable care over him and for his good he most humbly beseeches him to be a means to appease her majestys displeasure for the accusations untruly suggested against him  after this he remained according to his own expression without great hope of liberty yet without fear of further extremity whence it may be rightly observed by some historians that sir walter ralegh through his generous intercesnon did procure udalls reprieve or save him from execution till a few months after being further pestered with stricter forms of submission by dr andrews he was forced to make further applications not only by the earl of essex but sir walter ralegh again and dean nowell against the menaces of the approaching assizes at kingston about the same time the king of scots also wrote a letter to the queen in behalf of the said mr udall and other learned nonconformists herein his majesty tells the queen that hearing of the apprehension of mr udall mr cartwright and certain other learned ministers of the evangell within your realm says he of whose good erudition and fruitful travels in the church we hear a very credible commendation howsoever their diversity from bishops and others of your clergy in matters touching them in conscience has been a mean by their dilation to work them your misliking at this present we cannot weighing the duty we owe to such as are afflicted for their conscience in that profession but by our most effectual and earnest letter interpone us at your hands to any harder usage of them for that cause so requesting her earnestly to let them be released out of their present strait he concludes from edinburgh the   th of june       but this wrought only so far when udall was brought to kingston that he was immediately returned to prison before the first day of the trials and thereupon the unlucky disturbance of hacket the enthusiast ensuing udall was discouraged from making further solicitation till the lordchancellor hatton died the easter after which he sued for liberty to go to church which was denied him being a condemned man but by the lordtreasurers means getting a copy of the indictment and a pardon framed according to it he was referred therewith to archbishop whitgift unto whom says he i both sent diverse petitions and dutiful letters and also got many of my friends both honorable personages and others to sue to him yet could not his good will be gotten and when the turkey merchants applied to his grace that udall might go over to guinea he would not consent to that unless they would be bound he should not return till he had her majestys license but to this udall would not consent and though sir john puckering now lord keeper was at last moved to deal with the archbishop so that both promised to obtain udalls pardon of her majesty and liberty for the said voyage yet udall never enjoyed one or the other for he died in prison before they were fully confirmed of whom we have this tradition that he was the first man king james asked for when he came into england and being answered he was dead the king replied by my sal then the greatest scholar in europe s dead   here we may give another instance of raleghs friendly and generous exercise of his power and interest for an old officer in the army since there is no date to it that confines us to any particular year this officer had a sum of money long owing him it seems from the treasury and knowing how well ralegh was acquainted with the justice of the debt no less than what influence his applications would be of for procuring it prevailed on him to write to the lord treasurers secretary who was afterward knighted and well known by the name of sir michael hicks that he might obtain his lordships order for the payment of the money these are the words of his letter i am most earnestly to entreat you for this gentleman captain spring that partly for love partly for honest consideration you will further him with my lord treasurer for a debt of three hundred pounds which her majesty owes him it has been long due and he has got good warrant for it besides he has served her majesty very long and has received many wounds in her service these reasons delivered by a man of your utterance and having his good argel at your elbow to instruct you i doubt not but it will take good and speedy effect concluding i never wrote unto you for any man or in any matter wherein you shall more bind me unto you than for this bearer and so not doubting of your assured friendliness i leave you to god and remain your most assured loving friend in a postscript he says always remember you must deal conscionably for my sake and i will requite you examples of this kind show men worthy of the power they enjoy and shine brighter in their characters than many actions of a more public and magnificent nature power being so often corrupted with pride and other passions as frequently render the possessors of it mischievous rather than beneficial to their fellow creatures but ralegh in these and many other instances was so far from misusing that above the narrow apprehensions of repulse or laying himself under obligations he appears to have exerted it in the most strenuous and generous manner either for preventing or relieving the distress of others which moved the greater compassion when his own misfortunes brought him to need and yet to fail of the like liberal and successful mediation for himself the truth is ralegh was so famous in these days for such like good offices that the queen seems to have distinguished him by a title more honorable in the proper sense it is to be here taken than any other she conferred upon him for one day having told her he had a favor to beg of her when sir walter said she will you cease to be a beggar to which he answered when your gracious majesty ceases to be a benefactor with great justice therefore seems a certain noted author of these times to have adapted his work to a patron when he dedicated a discourse upon friendship which he published not long before this time to sir walter ralegh  but friendship made such a rare and lasting impression on him that it may be said to have extended beyond the life of the object and he well deserves to be remembered in his grave who could leave us such noble patterns in memory of the dead but this place requires only our notice of the memorial he wrote to clear from some spanish aspersions the fme and conduct of the valiant and renowned sir richard greenville in that bloody expedition where he made such a glorious though untimely end this brave commander was vice admiral in the lord thomas howards expedition to intercept the spanish plate fleet at the isles of azores in its return from america the english squadron consisted of six of the queens ships six victuallers of london with two or three pinnaces they set out early      and waited six months at flores one of those islands in expectation of the said fleet as there was besides the english ships before numbered one also of sir walters in this expedition named bark ralegh commanded by captain thynne and as he employed some time in the latter end of this year to describe that memorable engagement they had with the spaniards the brief abstract i shall give thereof from his own words cannot be arraigned of prolixity nor perhaps of digression since besides his gratitude for the past services of his heroic kinsman it so well displays his sentiments at this time of the religious hypocrisies and cruelties of their common enemy the king of spain therefore having had intelligence of their waiting thus for his indian fleet sent an armada to the azores of fiftythree sail to convoy it home under the command of don alphonso bacan this fleet was just in sight of the english by then they had any warning of it and they were so unprepared for its reception that many of their crew were on shore providing ballast water and other necessaries and those who were on board were half of them through sickness unfit for service the spaniards were now so near at hand that the english had scarce time to weigh anchor and greenville in the revenge was the last upon the place being desirous of receiving all his crew aboard from the island whereof he had no less than ninety who were sick and diseased so that unable to recover the wind and having but one hundred sound men he was persuaded to cut his main sail cast about and trust to the sailing of the ship for the squadron of seville was on his weatherbow but he through the greatness of his spirit utterly refused to turn from the enemy protesting he would rather die than be guilty of such dishonor to himself his country and her majestys ship assuring his company he would pass through the two squadrons in spite of them and force those of seville to give him way which he performed upon diverse of the foremost who as the mariners term it sprung their loof and fell under the lee of the revenge but while he had regard to those who were nearest the huge san philip being in the wind of him and approaching becalmed his sails in such a manner that the ship could neither make way nor feel the helm so large and high charged was the spanish galleon being of fifteen hundred ton carrying three tire of eleven pieces in each on a side and discharging eight foreright from her chase besides those of her sternports after the revenge was thus entangled with this philip four others loofing up also boarded her two on the larboard and two on the starboard the fight thus beginning at three a clock in the afternoon on the last of august the year aforesaid continued very terrible all that evening but san philip having received the lower tire of the revenge charged with crossbar shot shifted with all expedition utterly misliking her first greeting some said she foundered hereupon but this is uncertain the spanish ships were filled with soldiers some having two hundred besides mariners some five others eight hundred men in the english ship there were only mariners with the commanders servants and some gentlemen volunteers after many exchanges of great and small shot the spaniards many times attempted to board the revenge but were as often beaten back into their own ships or into the sea and when a london victualler who was under the lee of the revenge offered to undertake any service for her assistance greenville bid him save himself and leave him to his fortune the fight thus continuing while the day lasted and some hours of the night many of the english were slain some of the spanish ships sunk and in many others there was great slaughter greenville though wounded in the beginning of the close fight was never so disabled as to forsake the upper deck for eight hours together and then being shot into the body with a musket as the wound was dressing he was again shot into the head and his surgeon at the same time wounded to death still the fight continued and as fast as the spaniards were beaten off by the revenge others came in their places so that by morning she had sustained for fifteen hours together the vollies boardings and entries of fifteen several ships of war and repulsed them all besides the rest which battered her loose and at a distance but with the light increased the discovery of her dismal condition and the more irksome was the one in that it would not let her conceal the other from her surrounding enemies as for her friends the lord thomas howard and the other ships sir walter ralegh further says of them if all the rest had entered all had been lost for the very hugeness of the spanish fleet if no other violence had been offered would have crushed them into shivers of which the dishonor and loss to the queen had been far greater than the spoil or harm that the enemy could any way have received notwithstanding it is true that the lord thomas would have entered between the squadrons but the rest would not condescend and the master of his own ship offered to leap into the sea rather than conduct it with the rest to be a prey to the enemy where there was neither hope or possibility either of defense or victory which also in my opinion says ralegh had ill sorted with or answered the discretion of a general to commit himself and his charge to assured destruction without hope or any likelihood of prevailing thereby to diminish the strength of her majestys navy and enrich the pride and glory of the enemy the foresight of the queens continues he commanded by mr vasavour performed a very great fight and stayed two hours as near the revenge as the weather would permit not forsaking the fight till he was likely to be encompassed by the squadrons and with great difficulty cleared himself the rest gave diverse vollies of shot and entered as far as the place permitted and their own necessities to keep the weather gage of the enemy until they were parted by night thus in sir walter raleghs said report of this fight  now was to be seen nothing but the naked hull of a ship and that almost a skeleton having received  00 shot of great artillery and some under water her deck covered with the limbs and carcasses of forty valiant men the rest all wounded and weltering in or covered with their own blood her masts all beaten overboard all her tackle cut asunder her upper works razed and all in effect levelled with the water incapable of any further management or motion but what the billows gave her greenville now finding their distress irreparable commanded the ship to be sunk that the spaniards might not carry a splinter home as a trophy of their dearbought victory dearbought indeed the admiral of the spanish hulks and another great galleon called the ascension of seville being both sunk by the side of the revenge another also in the road of st michael and a fourth run herself aground to save her company there were besides slain and drowned in this fight two eminent spanish commanders and near a thousand of their men as one of their own officers who was severed from the fight by the ensuing storm and taken by a london vessel confessed sir richard exhorted the remainder of his company to trust in gods mercy and to none else and as they had thus long and resolutely repulsed so many enemies that they would not now lessen the honor of their country by any overtures to lengthen for a few hours or days their own lives several joined in opinion with him but the majority prevailed who urged the spaniard would be as ready to entertain a composition as they to offer it and that there were diverse valiant men yet living who might do their prince acceptable service and revenge this action upon the enemy that the ship could be of no use either to the one or the other for upon the first working of the sea she must needs sink being so crushed rived and leaky having six foot water in the hold that she could never remove out of the place  accordingly the spanish general don alphonso bacan yielded that all their lives should be saved the company sent into england and the better sort only to pay a reasonable ransom free from all galleys or imprisonment though the mastergunner would have slain himself when he found their resolution thus by reason overborne but that he was by force withheld then the general sent many boats aboard the revenge and diverse of the english suspecting sir richards desperate disposition to blow up or sink the ship stole away to the spaniards but the general prevailed upon him to remove out of the revenge being very unsavory filled as it was like a slaughterhouse with the bodies and blood of the dead and wounded sir richard told them they might do with his body what they pleased for it was now of no use to him and as he was carried out of the ship he swooned but revived again and desired the company to pray for him the general left nothing unattempted for his recovery highly respecting the unconquerable resolution in so rare a spectacle of consummate and approved intrepidity who could make such resistance for so long time and such havoc upon such an armada with a single ship and so few men sir richard lingered two or three days and then died aboard the general who greatly bewailed his loss linshten a dutch author though he mistakes in some particulars as making this engagement to have happened a fortnight later etc yet agrees with sir walter ralegh that sir richard made a wonderful opposition for he mentions no less than seven or eight ships boarding the revenge that she resisted them at least    hours that the spaniards lost above  00 men in the fight and that when sir richard was conveyed into the spanish admirals ship the st paul all the captains were astonished at his stout and courageous heart for he showed no sign of faintness nor change of color but feeling the hour of death approach said in the spanish tongue here die i richard greenvill with a joyful and quiet mind having ended my life like a true soldier that has fought for his country queen religion and honor etc he gives us further as an instance of his bravery that while he continued amongst the spanish captains and they were at dinner or supper with him he would carouse three or four glasses of wine and take the glasses between his teeth and crush them in pieces and swallow them down so that often the blood would run out of his mouth without any other harm to him  but the revenge with  00 spaniards in her being overtaken by the storms aforesaid was sunk with the others abovementioned at st michaels island in this manner did they honor the burial of that renowned ship and thus did she to the last make good her name upon them  ralegh had formed an enterprise upon panama with a design also of meeting the spanish platefleet the scheme he laid down appeared so feasible to her majesty having provided no less than    ships of his own and his associates all well manned and plentifully furnished with arms provisions and all other necessaries that she added to them two of her own men of war named the garland and foresight and gave him a commission constituting him general of the fleet the honor of lieutenant general was given to sir john burgh a gentleman altogether worthy of the command and indeed all his consorts officers soldiers and sailors were such as had given sufficient proof of their valor in diverse services with these ships thus equipped ralegh departed in february the year aforesaid to the west of england there to store himself with such further conveniences as he should need but the westerly winds blowing for a long time contrary bound him to keep harbor so many weeks that the fittest season for his purpose was expired and much of his provisions consumed the queen understanding how unluckily he was detained it being the  th of may      before raleigh could put to sea she sent sir martin forbisher after him who overtook him the next day with letters of revocation but ralegh finding his honor so far engaged in the undertaking of this voyage interpreting the queens letters as if her commands had been propounded in terms of latitude either to advance or retire at his own discretion would by no means consent to leave the fleet now under sail so he continued his course upon the seas till he met with a ship belonging to mons gourdon governor of calais in which was one mr nevel davies who was returned from a twelve years captivity in spain and who assured him there was little hopes of any success this year in the west indies for the king of spain had sent express orders to all the ports both of the islands and terra firma that no ships should stir that year nor any treasure be laid aboard for spain but neither this disagreeable news nor the other discouragements could deter him from proceeding till on the   th of may when he was off cape finister a most raging tempest arising so scattered the greater part of the fleet and sunk his boats and pinnaces that as the rest were driven and divided ralegh himself in the garland was in great danger of being swallowed up in the sea hereupon considering the season was too far gone for his enterprise upon panama and his victuals too much consumed that the same consumption might further disable him from lying upon the spanish coast or at the islands to meet with the indian fleet for which he had received such little encouragement to wait ralegh made a division of his fleet into two squadrons committing one under the charge of sir john burgh and the other to sir martin forbisher and gave his instructions for sir martin in the garland with capt gifford capt thin capt greenvill and others to lie off the south cape to terrify and keep the spaniards on their own coast while sir john burgh with capt cross thomson and others should lie at the azores for the carracks from india the success of these directions was answerable to the excellent judgment that contrived them for the spanish admiral receiving intelligence that the english fleet was cruising upon their coast gathered all his naval power to watch forbisher and defend the southern parts of spain while the carracks unguarded were left a prey to sir john burgh before the fleet separated they met on the spanish coast with a great biscayan called sancta clara a snip of  00 ton which after a fight for some time they mastered and found freighted with all sorts of little ironwork valued by the english at   or   thousand pounds but of treble the value to the spaniards this having cleared they sent to england then sir john burgh in a ship of sir walter raleghs named the roebuck coasting along toward the south cape of st vincent and by the way spying a sail gave her chase which being a flyboat and good sailor drew him far southward before he could fetch her at last she came under his lee and struck sail the master confessed a great fleet was prepared at st lucar and cadiz for the rumor of raleghs putting out strong for the west indies had so alarmed the king of spain that he raised this fleet to oppose and encounter him though looking for the arrival of his east india carracks he first ordered those ships to convoy them from the azores but persuading himself if raleghs fleet did make for the west indies that then the islands would be infested only by some small men of war which the carracks of themselves would be able to cope with his order was to don alphonso de bacan to pursue raleghs fleet and engage him what course soever he held and the english soon found this information true for sir john burgh as he returned to his company descried the spanish fleet to seaward of him which having likewise discovered him made full account to bring him into the spanish harbor but he dexterously escaped them and shaped his course to the azores according to raleghs directions here he took several small caravels but learnt little intelligence from them arriving at flores on the   st of june and making to the shore of santa cruz he found them all in arms but showing a white flag he was accommodated by the inhabitants with whatever he wanted here he learnt news of the east indian carracks one whereof had lately passed by for lisbon and that four more were behind he made after and soon discovered the oremost named the santa cruz which was pressed so close upon by the english that she fired her self but they took besides some spoil certain prisoners out of her who confessed that within fifteen days three other great carracks would arrive at the same island sir john having taken coel with his officers departed six or seven leagues to the west of flores causing the ships in his company to spread themselves north and south two leagues distant from each other by which extension they could discover two whole degrees thus they lay till the  d of august when captain thompson first saw that prodigious great carrack called the madre de dios or mother of god one of the greatest burden belonging to the crown of portugal captain thompson first attacked her but with the loss of several men then sir john burgh in the roebuck aforesaid entangled her and sir robert cross fastened himself to her at the same instant but sir john was forced to disengage awhile for fear of sinking being shot under water at last cross fell athwart her all alone prevented her running ashore to fire herself as the other had done and gave the rest time to come up to his succor which after he had fought with her three hours he received by the lord cumberlands ships and then having made a great slaughter of the spaniards they boarded and possessed themselves of her with little difficulty  this prize was reckoned the greatest and richest that ever had been brought into england and when the news of her being taken arrived ralegh after conultation with sir john hawkins wrote a letter to the lordadmiral in these words our very good lord we have conferred together about the eastindian ship to be brought to plymouth by sir john burgh and in our opinions she can be no less worth than  00000 l being a ship of so great burden and laden with so rich commodities as appears she is wherefore we have considered that the spanish men of war lying upon the coast of bretagne hearing of so great a prize taken from the king or the merchants of the country and envying that such a benefit should grow to us to their hindrance and dishonor will endeavor by all possible means being distant but a day or nights sailing either to recover the ship again or to burn her and all her lading rather than she shall be delivered here seeing that the places of defense where the ship may remain are not able to resist their power in our opinion therefore we think fit and do pray your lordship that the three ships of her majestys which are appointed to keep the narrow seas may by your lordships letter and directions be appointed to go westward and there to guard the indian ship for a time until the garland and some of the same fleet be returned whose arrival cannot be any long time expected or till some order may be taken for the unlading or keeping of her otherwise which we pray your lordship may be done with some expedition and so we humbly take our leave this   th of august      your lordships humbly at commandment w ralegh and underneath john hawkins by this means this mighty ship this carack was in burden no less than   00 ton whereof  00 were merchandise she carried    pieces of brass ordnance and between   and  00 passengers was built with decks seven story one main orlop three close decks one forecastle and a sparedeck of two floor apiece according to the observations of mr robert adams an excellent geometrician she was in length from the beakhead to the stern     feet in breadth near    feet the length of her keel  00 feet of the main mast     feet its circuit at the partners near    feet and her mainyard  0  feet was brought safe into dartmouth on the  th of september following where it daily drew vast numbers of spectators from all parts to admire at the hugeness of it being far beyond the model of the biggest shipping then known among us either for war or burden  but as to the lading though sir john burgh did prudently seize upon the whole to her majestys use to prevent all licentious spoil whereby the treasure brought home was sufficient to recompense the adventurers cost and the sailors peril however the dividends are not known more than that her majesty had the largest share and though through the varieties thereof our nation was let into the discovery of those merchandises whereof we had before but an imerfect knowledge yet the whole cargo when it came to belanded and valued in england fell short above two thirds of the computation which had been made by ralegh and hawkins as above as to her lading according to the catalogue taken at leadehall the   th of september this year the principal wares consisted of spices drugs silks callicoes carpets quilts cloth of the rind of trees ivory porcellan or china ware ebony besides pearl musk civet and ambergris with many other commodities of inferior value the cargason freighted ten of our ships for london and was by moderate computation valued at   0000 l sterling  for a large quantity of jewels were never brought to light and so much of her other goods was also purloind by the sailors soldiers and officers that at her arrival in england she drew five foot less water than she did when she was first freighted at cochin in the east indies and indeed the sailors boldly confessed they had rather trust their souls to a merciful god by perjury than their fortunes to the hands of unmerciful men  the latter end of this year and beginning of next we meet with sir walter ralegh in the parliament house whether returned for a county or a borough and for which does not at present particularly occur a late author of his life observes that his speeches were full of reason and eloquence no man in his days being more a master of language than himself and matter too he might have added none more satisfactorily confirming his arguments with facts and experience than he did even in his unpremeditated speeches no less than in the more deliberate compositions of his pen so full of observation he was upon all times and countries and so readily he could apply it upon all occasions which now won him great regard as a speaker in the house and afterward as an author to the whole world soon after the opening of the session we find him upon the committee for the liberties and privileges of the members to examine and make report of all cases touching the elections and returns during the said session of parliament also in another against popish recusants and when the bill for certain subsidies to be granted her majesty was in debate and some members were for having it expressly distinguished in the bill that the said subsidies should be for maintaining a war impulsive and defensive against the spaniard that the conquests we made over them might be legal and waarrantable sir walter ralegh seconded those speeches and said he knew many who held it not lawful in conscience as the time was to take prizes from the spaniard and he knew that if it might be lawful and open war there would be more voluntary hands to fight against the spaniard than the queen should stand in need of to send to sea accordingly he was appointed of the committee for drawing the articles and preamble of the said bill further when the necessity of the said subsidy came to be enforced ralegh spoke for it not only as he protested to please the queen to whom he was infinitely bound above his deserts but for the neeessity be both saw and knew he very well discovered the great strength of the king of spain and to show his mightiness he told how he possessed all the world as also that his malice and ill purpose was evident to this realm he showed how on every side he had beleaguered us that in denmark the king being young had corrupted the council and nobility so as it was very likely he would speed himself of shipping from thence in the marine towns of the low countries and in norway he laid in great store of shipping in france he had the parliament towns at his command in britany he had all the best havens and in scotland had so corrupted the nobility that he had promised them forces to assist the papists that they were ready to join with any foreign forces that would make them strong to be by themselves and resist others for as he thought there were not six gentlemen of that country of one religion in his own counry there is all possible preparing and he is coming with sixty galleys besides other shipping with purpose to annoy us we must then have no ships if he invade us riding at anchor all will be little enough to withstand him at his coming he fully resolves to get plymouth or at least to possess some of the havens this summer within our land and plymouth is a place of most danger for no ordnance can be carried thither to remove him the passages will not give leave now the way to defeat him is to send a royal army to supplant him in britany and to possess ourselves there and to send a strong navy to sea and to lie upon the cape and at lambuck to which places come all his ships with riches from all parts and then they may set upon all that come this we are able to do and undoubtedly with fortunate success if we undertake it but some division arising upon the question how they should make the motion for this supply to the lords ralegh made so judicious a distinction of the cause thereof and so clearly demonstrated the erroneous manner in which it had been propounded that it appears plainly the successful turn which followed thereupon was owing to him alone after this conference several forms of provision were proposed by way of treble subsidies and like proportionable fifteenths and tenths with other kinds of benevolence sir thomas cecil was for three subsidies to be paid in four years and to be charged upon men of ten pounds and upwards to spare those who were under sir henry knivet alleged the poverty of our country against the reasons used and imputed that poverty to the bringing in more foreign wares than we vented commodities whereby our money was carried out of our country which was thus become like a pond that was fed with a spring but having a breach through which more passed away than came in thereupon moved for a survey to be taken of all mens lands and goods in england and so much to be yearly levied as might maintain the queens wars the proportion being set  00000 pounds yearly or if that was misliked every man on his word should deliver in to his power the profits of his lands and goods so a proportion to be cessd accordingly to him who argued of the poverty of the land from the multitude of beggars ralegh gave these reasons that the broken companies in normandy and the low countries who returned maimed higher never went back again to the towns from whence they came for a multitude of clothiers taking their looms into their hands spun their wool themselves and except we would work for them cheaper than they can make themselves they will set none to work this engrossing of so many trades into their own hands beggars so many as usually lived by the trade as for the surveying of so many mens estates he thought it inconvenient for many being esteemed richer than they are would be found beggars and increase the opinion of their number by losing their credit which is now their wealth he further reported of his own knowledge that the westcountry since the parliament begun had taken from them the worth of   0000 pounds and that those of newcastle lay still for fear because the bourdeaux fleet was taken this year by the enemy for the enemy approaching us and being become our neighbor our trades will decay every day and so our poverty increases thus it is most certain the longer we defer aid the less able we shall be to yield it yet in the end the greater aid will be required so sparing them now we shall charge them when they shall be less able to bear it for it is most true  00000 pounds would have done the last year that which three will not now do and three will do this year that which six will not do hereafter in the conclusion he agreed to three subsidies in them the threepound men to be spared the sum which came from them to be lev upon those of ten pound and upwards and the payment to be speedy mr francis bacon assented to three subsidies but not to the payments under six years but to his reasons of difficulty and danger in a speedier levy which might hazard a double peril by making it four shillings in the pound a double payment ralegh answered i see no reason that the suspicion of coffeehouse should cross the provision for the present danger the time is now more dangerous than it was in eightyeight for then the spaniard coming from spain was to pass dangerous seas and had no place of retreat or relief if he failed but now he has in britany great store of shipping a landing place in scotland and men and horses there as good as any we have but for the difficulty in getting this subsidy i think it seems more difficult by speaking than it would be in gathering in the end it was carried agreeable to his propositions  soon after there was a bill read in the house against counterfeiting the hands of counselors or principal officers and upon the second reading it was committed to sir john woolley and sir walter ralegh with others but after a meeting in the middle temple hall sir john made report to the house that himself and the residue of the committee upon the end of their examination did think it a very dangerous bill and not fit to pass the house but the bill against aliens selling foreign wares among us by retail produced several weighty arguments and speeches in the house which have been transmitted to us these foreigners were dutchmen who had nestled themselves in st martins anciently allowed for a sanctuary and therefore still had this privilege here they practiced spinning and weaving to the great detriment and complaint of merchants and regular dealers in our own city insomuch that threescore english retailers had been ruined by them since the last parliament to the diminution besides their own private substance of the queens subsidy and the public treasure  0000 l a year at least having been carried out of the realm by them they had indeed some learned council who pleaded for them at the bar and some of the members spoke in their behalf other arguments were used but against these ralegh concurred with those who thought that denization ought not to circumvent birth right and that to behave ourselves like citizens to foreigners was but making ourselves strangers to our neighbors whereas it is pretended says he that for strangers it is against charity against honor against profit to expel them in my opinion it is no matter of charity to relieve them for first such as fly hither have forsaken their own king and religion is no pretext for them for we have no dutchmen here but such as come from those princes where the gospel is preached yet here they live disliking our church for honor it is honor to use strangers as we be used among strangers and it is a lightness in a commonwealth yea a baseness in a nation to give a liberty to another nation which we cannot receive again in antwerp where our intercourse was most we were never suffered to have a tailor or a shoemaker to dwell nay at milan where there are three hundred pound englishmen they cannot so much as have a barber among them and for profit they are all of the house of almoigne who pay nothing yea eat out our profits and supplant our own nation custom indeed they pay paying fifteenpence where we pay twelvepence but they are discharged of subsidies the nature of the dutchman is to fly to no man but for his profit and they will obey no man long now under spain now under mountfort now under the prince of orange but under no governor long the dutchman by his policy has gotten trading with all the world into his hands yea he is now entering into the trade of scarboroughfishing and the fishing of the newfoundlands which is the stay of the westcountries they are the people that maintain the king of spain in his greatness were it not for them he were never able to make out such armies and navies by sea it cost her majesty   000 l a year the maintaining of these countries and for all this they arm her enemies against her therefore i see no reason that such respect should be given to them and to conclude in the whole no matter of honor no matter of charity no profit in relieving them  this speech we may meet with in some modern writings quoted in sir walter raleghs praise both for his knowledge in the interest of his country and his unbiased affection in exerting it as for the bill he was one to whom it was committed and who after the travels of the said committee upon it offered it again to the house with the addition of a proviso on the   th of march following that is to say in the year      it was read the third time and after many long speeches which are not specified passed upon the question by the division of the house with the difference of fourscore voices the yeas being     the nos    about a week afterward there was a bill for explaining a branch in an act to retain the queens subjects in due obedience read and many speeches passed in the house before it was committed through the many imperfections in the preamble and body of the said bill for it pretended a punishment only of the brownists and other sectaries but alleging nothing against them in particular contained some ensnaring clauses that might comprehend more innocent persons as the speeches before sir walter raleghs on this occasion are not rehearsed we can only guess at them by what is preserved of his who said in my conceit the brownists are worthy to be rooted out of a commonwealth this sect was so called from robert brown son of anthony brown esquire of tolethorp in rutlandshire and grandson of francis brown whom king henry viii anno regn    privileged by charter to wear his cap in presence of himself his heirs or any of his nobles and not to uncover but at his own pleasure this robert studied divinity in cambridge and was soon discovered by dr still master o triniycollege to have somewhat extraordinary in him that would pro great disturbance to the church he traveled to zeland an etued as we are told confirmed in error and obstinacy which he first preached at norwith anno      and wrote a book to jusiy his doctrine for which bishop phreak of that diocese confined him but being related to the lord burge and he rather imputing it to zeal than malice interceded to have him caritably peraded out of his opinions and released the later being done he was sent home in      but remained incorrigible werefore his good old father would own him for his son no longr than his son owned the church of england for his mother but he chose rather to part with his aged sire than his new schism so with richard harrison a schoolmaster he set up for an orator against bishops and all ecclesiastical authority when gentleness was found ineffectual severity was so long and upon so many occasions exercised that this brown used to boast he had been committed to thirtytwo prisons and in some could not see his hand at noonday yet did he to the last save his life and living which was achurch in northamptonshire this favor is conceived to proceed from the promises he made of conformity together with the interest of his powerful kindre he allowed a salary for one to dischrge his cure and though he opposed is parishioners in judgment yet agreed in taking their tithes he was of a nature uncontrolable so far from the sabbatarian strictness afterward espoused by some of his followers that he seemed rather a libertine therein in a word he had says my author a wife with whom he never lived and a church in which he never preached though he received the profits thereof and as all the other scenes of his life were stormy and turbulent fo was his end for the constable of his parish requiring somewhat roughly the payment of certain rates his passion moved him to blows wereof complaint being made to justice st john he rather inclined to pity than punish him but brown at fair words also disgusted ceased not till he was sent to northampton jail on a bed in a cart being very infirm and aged above  0 years where soon after he sickend and died anno    0  but what danger may grow to ourselves if this law pass were fit to be considered for it is to be feared that men not guilty will be included in it and that law is hard that takes life and sends into banishment where mens intentions shall be judged by a jury and they shall be judges what another means but that law which is against a fact is but just and punish the fact as severely as you will if   or  000 brownists met at the sea at whose charge shall they be transported or whither will you send them i am sorry for it but i am afraid there are near  0000 of them in england and when they are gone who shall maintain their wives and children a committee was therefore appointed to revise and correct this bill among whom ralegh is the foremost named and being read the third time it passed upon the question  this year we met with a notable libel in print set forth by a lover of his country as he calls himself to expose certain ministers and counselors of state who had been instrumental in framing that searching proclamation against the seminaries which was published about two years before for the king of spain having lately founded an english cloister at valladolid as a nursery to supply us with treason and rebellion so many hopeful stocks of that species were soon transplanted into england as occasioned the said proclamation to extirpate them now this answer was published to calumniate the supposed authors of it and as ralegh appears among other very good company to have his share of the slander therein so he might probably have had a hand in those wholesome articles for the safety of the realm which occasioned it for after this libel has reviled the greatest and wisest ministers of the nation it seems to have reserved the quintessence for him who had the ability so many ways to crush the pernicious purposes which were daily hatching by the viperous brood which brought it forth for ralegh had given such proofs of his sound and sincere affection to religion that his sentiments were made use of to reform or regulate even the professors of it yet now his head must be turned so excessively to its detriment as to provoke this libellers pious spleen against nothing less than sir walter raleghs school of atheism compendiously insinuating as if truly he was not satisfied with being a disciple but set up for a doctor in his faculty and won young gentlemen into his said school wherein the old and new testament were jested at and scholars taught to spell god backwards then he complains what a miserable thing it is that her majesty should make laws and proclamations according to these mens senses and opinions but there may need little pains to blunt the point of this dart when we shall further consider that it came out of a jesuitical quiver for by whom should it be levelled against him but robert parsons the notorious traitor and incendiary however deeply he disguised himself into a lover of his country nevertheless some ten years after when ralegh was trampled down by the court and there was a turn of state to serve this might be a good serviceable obloquy enough to upbraid him with and depreciate him in the eye of the populace but these prejudiced representations will probably be thought of so little authority that the reasons and matter of fact which have been produced in a poetical performance may be sufficien to make those stains even befriend his reputation and brighten it in clearing them away the late dr george sewell in his tragedy of sir walte ralegh  vo      act i scene i makes the following reflection on the attorney generals starting from the question in bate at raleghs trial to upbraid him with this imputation atheism  sir julius caesar when prejudice and strong aversion work all whose opinions we dislike are atheists now it is a term of art a bugbear word the villains engine and the vulgars terror the man who thinks and judges for himself unswayd by aged follies reverend errors grown holy by traditionary dullness of schoolauthority he is an atheist the man who hating idle noise preserves a pure religion seated in his soul he is a silent dumb dissembling atheist  lord howard i had forgot it  yes the basetongud gownsman did call him atheist  so men judge at home who never traced a providence at sea and saw his wonders in the mighty deep the atheistsailor were a monstrous thing more wonderful than all old ocean breeds but i will witness for my raleghs faith yes i have seen him when the tempest raged when from the precipice of mountainwaves all hearts have trembled at the gulf below he with a steady supplicating look displayed his trust in that tremendous power who curbs the billows and cuts short the wings of the rude whirlwind in its midway course and bids the madness of the waves to cease o fellowsoldier were that folly thine though thou were dearer than the love of honor to this old bosom i would pluck thee hence though my heart cracked      indeed there is a traditional author who acunts for the grounds of this aspersion in the llowing words sir walter ralegh was the first s i have heard who ventured to tack about and il aloof from the beaten tract of the schools and ho upon the discovery of so apparent an error as torrid zone intended to proceed in an inquisition after more solid truths till the mediation of some whose livelihood lay in hammering shrines for this superannuated study possessed queen elizabeth that such doctrine was against god no less than her fathers honor whose faith if he owned any was grounded upon school divinity whereupon she chid him who was by his own confession ever after branded with the title of an atheist though a known assertor of god and providence that he was such assertor seems to be affirmed by an author of his acquaintance who introduces the apparition of sir walter speaking to him in this manner thou well know that the world has at sundry times cast a foul and most unjust aspersion upon me for my presumed denial of a deity from which abominable and horrible crime i was ever most free and not any man now living better knows the same than thyself in whose presence i was often accustomed highly to praise and esteem the book of lessius written in proof of the being of a deity so requests that he would translate the same into english which i myself says the ghost had done if cruel fate had not untimely cut off the thread of my mortality and let the title bear my name that so the readers may acknowledge it was done by my solicitation then the said translator of that book says in his own person to the reader it is well known that sir walter was a man of great natural parts and yet was suspected of the most foul and execrable crime of atheism how truly god and himself only knows yet i have reason to think it a false aspersion if thus much is said of ralegh by an author who knew him what credit shall we pay to another who wrote many years later never knew him produces no authority for the principles he charges upon him yet pretends to give us the tutors name from whom he imbibed them and that a man of no less learning and merit than the famous mr thomas hariot this was that english philosopher from whose illustrious discoveries he who was the glory of the french philosophers is not denied to have borrowed much of the light wherewith he shone this assertion will further appear to any who shall have the curiosity to consult the late learned dr john wallis in his treatise of algebra where he compares the improvements which hariot made with what descartes has advanced as his own without mentioning the name of this englishman in his geometry and gives it clearly on hariots side nay this pagiarism was so well known as to have been objected against monsieur descartes in his own country and the frenchman who has paid the singular honors to his memory of writing his life having confessed it was the opinion of some that he stole his method of algebra from one hariot an englishman does not go about to contradict it  this was that excellent mathematician who says our author wood aforesaid coming to the knowledge of this heroic knight sir walter ralegh was entertained by him in his family who allowed him a yearly pension and was instructed by him at leisure hours in that science this was that virtuous and religious man who being sent over by sir walter ralegh with his first colony to virginia but did not bear him company as the said author mistakes to survey the bounds of the english discoveries with the commodities and customs of the country did first communicate the gospel to those heathen inhabitants and in every town where he came explained to them the contents of the bible declaring that therein was set forth the true and only god and his mighty works that therein was contained the true doctrine of salvation through christ with many particulars of miracles and chief points of religion as i was able then to utter continues he and thought fit for the time and though i told them the book materially and of itself was not of such virtue as i thought they did conceive but only the doctrine therein contained yet would many be glad to touch it to embrace it to kiss it to hold it to their breasts and heads and stroke over all their bodies with it to show their hungry desire of that knowledge which was spoken of yet this is the man whom the above cited anthony wood charges with having had strange thoughts of the scripture with undervaluing the old story of the creation with never believing that trite position ex nihilo nihil fit with making a philosophical theology wherein he cast off the old testament so that consequently the new would have no foundation further with being a deist and imparting his doctrine to the earl of northumberland into whose service ralegh had recommended him and of whom he also received a yearly pension of   0 l lastly with infusing those principles likewise into sir walter ralegh himself when he was compiling his history of the world this last insinuation and probably all the rest is surely a manifest slander as wood himself must have owned if he had sufficiently read that history of the world where sir walter ralegh has in many places given stronger evidences of his christian faith than any of his detractors ever did of theirs  as for ralegh what might not a little sharpen these detractions against him was perhaps a grant about this time made him from the crown of some church lands a course of reward usual with queen elizabeth toward such as had performed any considerable services for the state the story as we are forced to gather it from those authors by whom it has not been overfavourably told is that about the year      the bishop of salisbury dr john coldwell who had been bred a physician gave his see a strong purge by alienating the manor of sherborne to sir walter ralegh sir john harrington speaks of an ominous presage to make his tale as affecting as he can to prince henry and insinuate the displeasure even of heaven against sir walter ralegh where he observes that sir walter using often to ride post in these days upon no small employments between plymouth and the court when sherborne castle being right in the way he cast such an eye upon it as ahab did upon naboth s vineyard and once above the rest being talking of it of the commodiousness of the place of the strength of the seat and how easily it might be got from the bishopric suddenly over and over came his horse that his very face which was then thought a very good face ploughed up the earth where he fell this fall was ominous i make no question says he as the like was observed in the lord hastings etc but his brother adrian would needs have him interpret that not as a courtier but as a conqueror it presaged the quiet possession thereof and this through the queens favor came to pass for after dr john piers was translated to york this dr coldwell was elected to succeed him in the sea of salisbury but it lay vacant three years in which dangerous juncture for denial all the doctors churchpreferments being disposed of yet before his election was confirmed sir walter ralegh importuned him to pass sherborne to the crown and effected it so shot the good old man as one of them phrases it between wind and water though indeed confessed a good round rent was reserved to the bishopric then sir walter begged the same of the queen and obtained it much after the same method that sir william killigrew got the manor of crediton from the church of exeter by the consent of bishop babington ralegh embellished his sovereigns bounty with great magnificence and commendation not that he was in danger thereby of falling under the remark he has made on common builders of sumptuous seats that men are rather known by their houses than their houses by them yet his elegant taste in building is sufficiently attested by an author who surveyed the improvements he made upon this estate when they were fresh and in their splendor and who tells us that the queen having granted the feefarm of sherborne to sir walter ralegh he began to build the castle very fairly but altering his purpose he built in the park adjoining a most fine house which he beautified with orchards gardens and groves of much variety and great delight so that whether you consider the pleasantness of the seat the goodness of the soil or other delicacies belonging to it it rests says he unparallele by any in these parts how he came afterward to be juggled out of it may also sufficiently appear when we arrive at the latter part of his life but here we may take an opportunity of remembering a plantation of his which is somewhat observable a late author mentions it with respect to him but in a distant manner where telling us that beddington near croydon in surrey is a neat curious seat built by sir francis carew he further adds the orchards and gardens are very pleasant and especially famous for the orange trees which have now grown there above these hundred years being planted in the open ground under a moveable court during the winter months they were the first that were brought into england by a knight of that noble family who deserves no less commendation than lucullus met with for bringing cherry and filberttrees out of pontus into italy for which he is celebrated by pliny and others addition to camdens britannia translated by the present bishop of london fol      page     upon which we may observe though the english have not been so grateful as the romans were in celebrating those worthy persons who have made the like beneficial importations to the lasting ornament and fertility of their country yet that we have had some authors not altogether silent in these vegetable antiquities from whom we learn that dr linacre first brought into this land that prince of flowers the damask rose that the perdigwen plum with two kinds more were first made natives of this soil by thomas lord cromwell when he returned from his travels and the apricock by a priest named wolf gardener to king henry viii in this reign were also first propagated among us hops and artichokes and then were cherry orchards first planted here about sittingborne in kent with a more improved kind of that fruit brought from flanders by one harris another of that kings gardeners but what effect cardans recommendation of olive trees had with king edward vi i find not in the reign of queen elizabeth when edmund grindal afterward archbishop of canterbury returned from exile he first transported the tamerick so useful in medicine against diseases of the spleen then also after our opening a trade with zant the shrub which bears the currants was first transplanted hither in      the tulip first showed her gaudy garment in english ground and lastly not to extend further on this subject now as for the profitable plant tobacco and that princely one the orangetree enough is said above in the body of this work to the honor of sir walter ralegh  now it has been a constant tradition at beddington that this knight of that noble family was sir walter ralegh who was allied thereto if not otherwise by the last of that sirnames adopting his near kinsman a throgmorton to be his heir on condition that he would assume the name and arms of carew and how ralegh became related to the throgmortons will in a little space appear but that we might not here want such further confirmation of the first planter of that famous orangery i have been obliged with the gentlemans answer to the enquiry who now dwells at the seat and his words are it is the common opinion of this family that sir walter ralegh who was related to it brought over and planted the old orange trees here but in the house they preserved a fine cabin bed which was his having furniture of green silk and legs carved like dolphins gilt with gold in short the seat was now so frequented that not only raleigh and other courtiers but the queen received here many agreeable entertainments sir hugh plat informs us that delicate knight sir francis carew once making a splendid entertainment for queen elizabeth at beddington led her majesty after dinner to a cherrytree in his garden which had on it fruit in their prime then above a month after all cherries had taken their farewell of england this retardation he performed by straining a tent or canvas cover over the whole tree and wetting it as the weather required with a scoop so by obstructing the sunbeams they grew both great and were very long before they gained their perfect cherrycolour and when he was assured of the time her majesty would come he removed the tent and a few sunny days brought them to their full maturity see his garden of eden    mo      page      for some of which she could not escape the censure of her jesuited enemies  as to the seat at west horseley in surrey there is good authority that it was in the possession of his son if not his own and in the hall of that house there are in several places of the walls and cieling the arms of ralegh still visible but there is a house no farther from london than islington about a bows shot on this side the church which though i think it has no such evidences remaining upon its walls cielings or windows that will prove him to have been its owner the arms that are seen there above a hundred years old being of a succeeding inhabitant is yet popularly reported to have been a villa of his for the present tenant affirms his landlord was possessed of some old account books by which it appears beyond all doubt this house and fourteen acres of land now let at about seventy pounds per annum did belong to sir walter ralegh and that the oldest man in the parish would often declare his father bad told him sir walter purposed to wall in that ground with intention to keep some of his horses therein further that some husbandmen ploughing up the same a few years since found several pieces of queen elizabeth s money whereof they brought whatever they might reserve to themselves about fourscore shillings to their master the said tenant in whose hands i have seen of the said coin as for the house it is and has been for many years an inn so that what it was is not clearly to be judged from its present outward appearance it being much impaired or very coarsely repaired and diminished perhaps from what it might be when persons of distinction lived in it however there are within fide some spacious rooms the parlour was painted round the uppermost part of the wainscot in about a dozen pannels with scripture histories but now so old and decayed as to be scarcely distinguishable there is also a noble dining room the cieling whereof is all over wrought in plastic or fret work with representations of the five senses and the chimneypiece with the three principal christian virtues but the arms in the window as well as in that of the hall are by the present inhabitants erroneously called sir walter raleghs there being a date under one of the coats which shows it was aneald six years after his death so that we are not sure the decorations aforesaid were done by his direction or that others more rich and elegant were not in their stead before them as for his dwellings in london we have read before that he had apartments in the court at somerset house and shall read hereafter of some acquaintance resorting to him at durham house in the strand that he had a house by the thames side which might be the same and another at st jamess or apartments also in the court there  the truth is sir walter ralegh did not live so long at court and so much about the dazzling beauties in it without having the wings of his glory at last somewhat singed in the flames thereof yet love which in some great courtiers of those times was the grand business of their life seemed only an interlude in his there was among the queens maids of honor a beautiful young lady as her picture represents her named elizabeth daughter of sir nicholas throgmorton an able statesman and ambassador whose negociations and characters are recorded both by the french and scotch as well as english historians of those times with this lady ralegh had it seems an amor and as he was a man of nervous address won her heart even to the last favor inclusive this intimacy came at last to the queens knowledge whether enviously betrayed by any female confident as some might apprehend from a character ralegh would bestow upon the ladies of the privychamber and bedchamber being wont to say they were like witches who could do hurt but could do no good or whether the intrigue could not be long concealed for the fruits of it as some who manifestly slander ralegh in other particulars have not scrupled to suggest the reader has it in his choice to believe but in such colors this matter of devirginating a maid of honor was heightened that ralegh was out of favor again also in confinement for several months and when enlarged forbidden the court whence the lady also was dismissed from her attendance yet as heinous as this misdemeanour was in ralegh her majesty did not punish it in leicester essex and other courtiers noted in their days for such intrigues especially the former who turned off douglas sheffield by whom he had a son to marry the earl of essexs mother but ralegh very readily made the most honorable reparation he could by marrying the object of his affection it appears they lived together ever after in the most exemplary degree of conjugal harmony and when he was in his greatest troubles there are testimonies from one who was otherwise none of his greatest friends of her extraordinary diligence and fidelity in making interest and applications to assuage them what his thoughts were of a married life in comparison with a single one may somewhat appear in that observation he made upon a certain noblemans growing plump after matrimony who was meagre before for another person in company remarking thereupon that it fared with him contrary to what it did with other married men who usually at first became lean after it ralegh very pleasantly obviated the rarity by saying why there is no beast that if you take him from the common and put him into the several but he will grow fat many years afterward when ralegh wrote his instructions to his son he sufficiently explained this sentiment in the grave and paternal manner he is then writing for his conduct in the choice of a wife which topic he concludes with advising him to bestow his youth so that he may have comfort to remember it when it has forsaken him and that his son would evermore care to be beloved by his wife than be besotted on her that if he cannot forbear to love yet forbear to link however approves of a mature and settled choice at last even while he is upon the stage of his virility for believe it the young wife betrayeth the old husband and she that had thee not in thy flower will despise thee in thy fall but not to marry for beauty only left thou bind thyself for life to that which perchance will never last or please one year nor yet an uncomely woman as much regard being due at least to our own issue as to any other race of creatures and comeliness in children is riches if nothing else be left them he remains pretty safe in this opinion from many censures by the hardfavoured part of the sex because he knew that few ladies would be positive upon this head in their right to reprove him nor will widows believe he has treated them with rigor while they remain in that state since he has said leave not thy wife to be a shame unto thee after thou art dead but that she may live according to thy estate especially if thou have few children and those provided for though he does also further say leave her no more than of necessity thou must but only during her widowhood for if she love again let not her enjoy her second love in the same bed wherein she loved thee nor fly to future pleasures with those feathers which death has pulled from thy wings not that he was averse to second marriages for he advised his own wife to marry again when he was in expectation of being suddenly divided from her for ever many other weighty admonitions may be found relating to that sex among his writings some of which we meet with quoted by our most accomplished humanists and critics in the manners and passions of life as from an author who had read their hearts through all their veils and disguises but one of those writers though he allows him all the advantageous views of life through such a variety of scenes as having lived in courts and camps traveled through many countries seen many men under several climates and of as various complexions yet thinks in which every body will not agree he speaks of our impotence to resist the wiles of women in very severe terms where ralegh has upon the solid ground of the greatest examples admonished us to what fatal inconveniences mankind is allured by their restless curiosity of knowing what is unfit for their knowledge and the prevailing expedients to gratify it of dissimulate sorrow and unquietness  while ralegh was under the displeasure aforesaid and in retirement he projected a further removal from the court the better by that distance and some memorable exploit to allay the malice of his enemies and recover his sovereigns love some thought this an impolitick course as if his foreign actions could not work so effectually to his advantage as the applications of his adversaries to his disparagement and hereupon sir robert naunton says that finding his favor declining and falling into a recess he undertook a new peregrination to leave that terra infirma of the court for that of the wars and by declining himself and by absence to expel his and the passion of his enemies which in court says he was a strange device of recovery but that he knew there was some ill office done him that he durst not attempt to mind any other ways than by going aside thereby to teach envy a new way of forgetfulness and not so much as to think of him howsoever he had it always in mind never to forget himself and his device took so well that at his return he came in as rams do by going backwards with the greater strength and so continued to the last great in her grace thus also says another author his enemies of greater rank kept him under sometimes in sometimes out and then he would wisely decline himself out of the courtroad and then you found him not but by fame in voyages to the west indies guiana new plantations virginia or in some expeditions against the spaniards and thus writes a third to the same purpose it is observable that sir walter ralegh was in and out at court so often that he was commonly called the tennis ball of fortune which she delighted to sport with his enemies perpetually brought him into disgrace with his mistress and his merit in a little time restored him again to her favor and as she always grew cold to the earl of essex after absence so she ever received ralegh with greater marks of her esteem and he was too hard for his rivals by the very means which they intended for his destruction certainly he deserved such good fortune beyond all others of a restitution to royal favor who could so much more hazardously and heroically than any of them aspire to earn it as now he abundantly manifested in that grand and gallant undertaking to discover and conquer the large rich and beautiful empire of guiana an enterprise which had baffled the repeated efforts of some of the ablest and most renowned captains and cavaliers in spain for near  00 years past for in one of their own authors we may read the names of many brave commanders and their commendations for the miseries they endured who within that space had trod this maze and lost themselves with some  00 some  000 men apiece in finding out this country and yet none of all their own authors have more nobly and liberally celebrated these and other such like adventurers of the spanish nation than ralegh himself has done  for ralegh industrious in diving into the causes of so many failures having informed himself what ambient courses the preceding adventurers had taken to arrive at the heart of the country they sought and which was the shortest way to make a successful discovery found that most of the spanish attempts in these parts had failed through the mutinies and discords which they had fomented among themselves as most of their conquests in others were much owing to the like factions among the americans and if there was not an expert soldier or seaman but he consulted as one author observes upon his character in general nor a printed or manuscript discourse but he perused whereby it came to pass there were not exacter rules or principles for both services then he drew much more may we believe he now particularly made use of these helps and lights to draw those rules and directions by which this year last mentioned      he gave to an old officer capt whiddon whose experience he had before tried for a voyage to the country aforesaid and this same year that captain also returned from thence with several inducing confirmations of the grandeur and opulency of guiana having learnt the same from some of the grand casiques or principal rulers upon the borders thereof but not without complaints of some barbarous treachery from the spanish governor who had then got some footing there and after promises of suffering the englishmen to furnish themseves with what supplies they wanted decoyed several of them to their destruction ralegh had thus more spurs than one inciting him to visit these regions in person and now this golden country made such invitations he cheerfully determined in quest thereof though through an ocean of difficulties to wash away the malice of his adversaries at court and render his character more impenetrable against the little censures which swarm in that theater of circumvention to sting and fester superior merit with such like views ralegh very speedily fitted the empire of guiana is directly east from peru toward the sea and lies under the equinoctial line was then governed by the same laws and under the same religion there are many attestations of the wonderful riches in these parts especially the imperial city which they called manoa where francisco lopez speaking of the magnificence of the emperors court says that all the vessels of his house table and kitchen were of gold and silver that in his wardrobe were hollow statues of gold which seemed giants and the figures in proportion and bigness of all the beasts birds trees and herbs that the earth brings forth and of all the fishes that the sea or waters of his kingdom breeds finally there was nothing in his country whereof he had not the counterfelt in gold further that city of manoa was by juan martinez the first christian who saw it called el dorado or the golden city upon seeing the guianians there and all about the borders in their drunken revels anoint themselves with a glutinous balsom and powder their naked bodies over with gold dust till they all glittered from head to foot out a fleet at a great expense though the lord admiral howard and sir robert cecyl were at the further charge of augmenting it  we may distinguish five ships under him besides barges wherries and other necessary tenders in his own excellent narrative of this voyage whence we understand the ship himself went in was his own which he does not name but the lions whelp which was the lord admirals was commanded by captain george gifford captain keymis had the command of a galego besides a bark which was committed to captain cross and another to captain calfield the whole number of men in this fleet is not mentioned but the select company of officers gentlemen and soldiers he used in his discoveries exceeded not  00 thus prepared he departed from plymouth on the sixth of february following and made to the grand canaries and so to tenerif where he waited awhile for the lions whelp and for captain amais preston but this captain disappointed him and went upon another adventure which proved some disadvantage in the prosecution of his discoveries after seven or eight days not seeing them he proceeded for trinidad with his own ship and captain crosss only for the galego which set out with them lingered behind on the coast of spain they reached that isle on the   d of march and cast anchor at point curiapan which the spaniards called punta de gallo situate in eight degrees or thereabouts in the four or five days he continued here he came not to the speech of any indian or spaniard on the coast he saw a fire but for fear of the spaniards none of the indians dared to approach him then ralegh in his barge coasted close along the shore and landed in every cove the better to know the island while his ships kept the channel from hence he removed in a few days up northeast to recover that place the spaniards call puerto de los espannoles but the inhabitants conquerabia and as before revictualling his barge he left the ships and kept by the shore that he might better speak with the inhabitants and observe the rivers wateringplaces and ports in the island of all which he took draughts as he passed along which he reduced at last to one general map at parico he found a fresh water river and at terra de brea another port called by the natives piche great quantities of very good oysters growing upon the branches of certain trees here so numerous that he traveled for a dozen miles together under them which enabled him afterward to rectify the ancient accounts of this tree and the fond conceits of some moderns that it was the tree of knowledge it is the indian fig which he curiously described and how it bears oysters by planting itself into the sea so that one stem soon becomes a grove see hist of the world lib   cap   sect   in short he coasted three parts of the isle of trinidad in the month he staid there for captain preston the more exactly to make his draught thereof aforesaid at puerto de los espannoles he met with his ships and found a company of spaniards keeping guard at the descent who in doubt of their own strength offered signs of peace he sent captain whiddon to parley with them whom he afterward left buried in the island to his great grief being a man says ralegh most honest and valiant from some of the spanish soldiers whom he found means to make free of their tongue by the help of wine and from one of the indian rulers named cantyman he gathered what strength the spaniards were of and how far it was to the city they had built under their governor don antonio de berreo here he found occasion of staying awhile both to have some reckoning with berreo for his treacherous dealings with the english under whiddon and to learn also the strength riches and passages to several other parts of the country but when ralegh was credidibly informed that the spanish governor had sent for a recruit of soldiers and how lamentably the natives suffered under his cruelties that the very lords of the country were made his slaves that he had put one of them named morequito to death that several others were then lying in chains and languishing under the most exquisite tortures he found sufficient occasion not only to revenge the loss of his countrymen but a good opportunity to gain the hearts of the indians by attempting to rescue them from this yoke of tyranny therefore he boldly set upon the corpse du guard in the dusk of the evening and having put them to the sword advanced with a hundred men and by break of day took their new city called san joseph which at the entreaty of the indians he set on fire then were the natives in confinement set at liberty among them were five casiques or petty kings in those parts these all bound together in one chain almost dead with famine and wasted with torments having had their naked bodies basted or dropped over with burning bacon ralegh also to his great reputation delivered from their captivity and several years after when this with raleghs other noble acts among these indians was mentioned by some of our english adventurers to guiana it was freshly retained and gratefully acknowledged by them to his honor when also one of their bravest princes who had been in england and christened ragapo came above a hundred miles to visit them for the great love he bore to ralegh manifestly showing how durably he had engaged their affection and desires for his return to be their ruler and protector but for the governor who had imprisoned so many of them he was now become a prisoner himself and ralegh by his courteous treatment of him reaped the fruit of that knowledge and experience he had gathered in the many years he had consumed with great sums of money upon the discovery of guiana the same day that ralegh made this conquest arrived captain gifford and captain keymis and in their ships diverse gentlemen and others which to his little army was a great succor and solace then proceeding upon his discovery ralegh first called all the chiefs of the island together who were enemies to the spaniards for some of them berreo had brought out of other countries and planted there to eat out and waste the natives then by his indian interpreter whom he carried out of england he made them understand he was the servant of a queen who was the greatest casique of the north and a virgin who had more casiqui under her than there were trees in that island that she was an enemy to the castellani in regard of their tyranny and oression and having freed all the coasts of the northern world from their servitude had sent him to free them also and withal to defend the country of guiana from their invasion and conquest then he showed them her majestys picture which they so admired and honored that it had been easy for him to have made them idolatrous thereof the like and larger speeches he made in solemn manner to the rest of the nations both in his passage to guiana and to those of the borders so as in that part of the world the queen of englands fame was diffused with great admiration this done ralegh returned to curiapan and though he had learned of berreo that guiana was some hundred miles further than the accounts he received of captain whiddon had represented it he kept the knowledge thereof from his company whom he feared would have been discouraged thereby from prosecuting the discovery when ralegh had further gathered from berreo the proceedings of the past adventurers and his own of all which he gives us a succinct and curious history he told him he was come upon the same design and was resolved to see guiana berreo used many arguments to dissuade him as that he must venture in very light and small boats to pass so many dangerous shallows and could not carry victuals enough above half the way that none of the country would speak with him and if he followed them would burn their towns besides the way was long the winter at hand and the rivers beginning to swell but above all that the kings and lords who bordered upon guiana had decreed that none of them should trade with any christians for gold because the same would be their own overthrow ralegh resolving however to make trial directed his vice admiral captain gifford and captain calfield to turn eastward against the mouth of the river capuri and gave them instructions to anchor at the edge of the shoal and upon the best of the flood to thrust over but they labored in vain nor did the flood continue so long but the water fell before they could have passed the sands then ralegh sent one king master of the lions whelp to try another branch called the amana if either of the small ships would enter but when he came to the mouth he found it as the rest after him went john dowglass who discovered four goodly entrances but all shoald and shallow in the bays leading to them in the mean time ralegh fearing the worst caused his carpenters to cut down an old galego boat to fit her with banks for oars and so as she might draw but five foot in this went ralegh with gentlemen and officers to the number of threescore in the lions whelp boat and wherry they carried twenty captain calfield in his wherry carried ten and a barge of raleghs ten more this was all the means they had having left their ships at curiapan to carry a hundred men with weapons and provisions for a month exposed to all the extremes of the weather all the hazards of the water to lie open to the air and upon hard boards by night in storms of rain or under the burning sun by day to swell the wet clothes of so many crowded together the dressing of their food and that mostly stale fish in the same place to be in such a labyrinth of rivers in such a remote and unknown region what prison could be more loathsome and unhealthy what prospect more fearful and desolate at first setting out they had twenty miles of a high sea to cross in these scanty boats so that they were driven before the wind into the bottom of the bay of guanipa inhabited by inhuman cannibals who shot poisoned arrows and from thence to enter one of the rivers of which dowglass had brought tidings after four days they were past ebbing and flowing and might have wandered a whole year about and never been able to extricate themselves in such a general confluence or rendezvous of streams were they now bewildered and so resembling one another as not to be distinguished but imperceptibly circulating and driving them about into the same places where they had been before passing between many islands and streights whose borders were so thickly arched and overshadowed with trees as bounded their sight to the breadth of the river and length of the avenue while the gloominess of the prospect added horror to the lonesomeness of the place at length on the   d of may      they fell into a river which because it had no name they called the redcross river these being the first christians who ever entered the same when they drew into the creek which led to a town upon this river their indian pilot named ferdinando landing was set upon by his countrymen who hunted him with dogs whereupon ralegh seized an old man passing that way and threatened to cut off his head if he would not procure his pilots liberty but he by his agility soon escaped them and swam to raleghs barge however they kept the old man and used him kindly assuring themselves of useful information from a native so long conversant in those parts and indeed but for this accident they had never found their way forward to the country they sought nor back to that where their ships lay the old man himself being often in the utmost perplexity which river to take so numerous and intricate they were those people who dwell in the flooded lands of this insular and broken world or in all the tracts toward guiana which the eight branches of the orenoque fashion into islands are generally called tivitivas but distinguished into two tribes a hardy and valiant generation who though they inhabited houses on the ground in summer yet in winter were forced to reside in the trees where they built themselves artificial towns and whose families were to be seen lodged in an arm or branch of those aireal or vegetable tenements for between may and september those islands are overflowed in some places twenty foot high by the said grand river of orenoque  departing from this quarter of the tivitivas which was under the division or tribe called ciawana he kept passing up the river with the flood and anchoring in the ebb yet the third day of his entering the river aforesaid his galley run aground and stuck so fast they all thought their discovery was at an end and that the greatest number of them must live like rooks and build their nests in the boughs but after emptying her ballast and much labor they got her a float at the end of the fourth day and struck into another river called the great amana spacious and without winding being one of the fairest branches of the grand orenoque but here the flood of the sea left them and every man from the highest to the lowest was forced to tug by turns at the oar for several days against a rapid current and in a most sultry clime for they were now in five degrees of the line many goodly rivulets they passed on either side which ralegh named in his map and showed their rise and descent when three days more were passed over his company began as well to despair at the length of the way as to languish through excessive heat and well might their courage now their provision also began to fail yet now had they most need of strength and vigor when the current of the river grew most boisterous and violent against them here ralegh had a great task to keep up the spirits of his disconsolate companions which could not be done without being ever foremost to endure labor and the last who gratified himself with refreshment he also strictly commanded his pilots to promise and end every next day which honest deceit he used so often they were forced to assure it would be at every reach  thus while he was giving them hopes of attaining the land where their patience should be rewarded with plenty providence seems to have rewarded his trust in her by happily shifting the scene and presenting the most beautiful landscape they had ever beheld for here mountains crowned with garlands of fruitful trees invited one sense and verdant plains of many miles extent enamelled with groups of odorous flowers regaled another birds of such sorts and colors as they had never seen tempted them to supply themselves by their fowling pieces and fishes of various kinds by their nets without which having little or no bread and less drink only the thick and troubled water of the river they had been in the greatest extremity now the old ciawanian they had taken as beforementioned persuading them he would lead them to a town up the branch of a river on the right hand where they might be supplied with all conveniences and return before night ralegh leaving his galley took eight musketeers in his barge and with gifford and calfield in their wherries having eight musketeers more entered the mouth of that river but rowed till sun set and saw no sign of the town even till they were forty miles distant from the galley and the rowers were ready to give up the ghost they had certainly hanged this pilot but that their necessities were his security for it was quite dark and they knew not their way back again but as they proceeded the river grew so narrow and was so overspread with trees from side to side that they were all forced with their swords to cut a way for their oars about one aclock after midnight they discerned a light and heard the barking of dogs soon after they found the village and there they were stored with provisions according to the promises of the old pilot in the mean time the company in the galley manned out a boat in search of them but next day they returned and continued their course after they had made this hungry and hazardous voyage for fourscore miles in that river which besides other strange fishes of mavelous bigness abounded with those ugly serpents called crocodiles whence the people named it the river of lagartos ralegh had a young negro attending upon him in his galley who leaping out to swim in the mouth of this river was in the sight of them all instantly devoured by one of these amphibious animals not long after being again in want of victuals they took two canoes laden with excellent bread being run ashore by the indians in them called arwacas who fled to hide themselves in the woods fearing through the prepossessions of the spaniards that ralegh and his company were canibals ralegh pursuing them in hopes of some intelligence found as he was creeping through the bushes a refiners basket there being in it quicksilver saltpetre and diverse other materials for the trial of metals and also the dust of some ore that had been refined but in two other canoes which escaped them they heard of a good quantity of ore and gold ralegh then landed more men and offered  00 l to any of his soldiers who should take one of the spaniards whom they thought to have also landed in these last canoes but they escaped while he was pursuing the former however while he was in search of the spaniards he found the arwacas hidden in the woods who had been pilots for the spaniards of which ralegh kept the chief for his pilot and carried him to guiana by whom he understood in what parts the spaniards labored for gold which he divulged to few of his company knowing both the season of the year and other conveniences would be wanting to work any mine himself therefore he hasted away from this place his purpose being at that time rather to discover what he could of the country and win over the people to subjection besides this restraint from all greediness after their gold there was another virtue he no less strictly observed which highly advanced him in the esteem of all those indians for whereas the spaniards were wont to satisfy their lusts without control upon their wives and daughters ralegh suffered not a man of his so much as to touch any of their women i protest says he before the majesty of the living god that i neither knew nor believe that any of our company one or other by violence or otherwise ever knew any of their women and yet we saw many hundreds and had many in our power and of those very young and excellently favored which came among us without deceit stark naked and because he found it a very troublesome work to keep the meaner sort from pilfering and spoil when they went to any of the indians houses ralegh caused his interpreter at every place when they departed to enquire after the losses or wrongs that had been done and if he found any thing had been stolen or taken by violence either the same was restored and the party punished in their sight or else it was paid for to their utmost demand  after he was recruited with bread and other provisions which greatly encouraged his men who now cried out let us go on we care not how far ralegh sent back in one of the canoes the old ciawan and ferdinando his first pilot giving them such things as they desired for their voyage and wrote a letter to his ships which they delivered and then he went on under the pilotage of one of those arwacas he had taken whom the spaniards had christened martin but the next or second day after they run aground again with their galley and she was very near being cast away with their new store of victuals they lay on the sand one whole night and were in far greater despair of disengaging her than before because they had no tide of flood to help them in the midst of their fears they bethought them of fastening an anchor upon the land and with main strength drew her off so the fifteenth day of their absence from their ships they discovered at a distance to their great joy the mountains of guiana and toward the evening were brought by a northerly gale in sight of the great orenoque which they soon after entered a river of vast extent and magnitude lying mostly east and west even from the sea to quito in peru thought to be  00 miles wide at the mouth  000 miles navigable for ships  000 for lesser vessels and discharging it self by sixteen arms into the sea whereby many parts of the spanish indies might most easily be invaded from other observations it appears in many places of the channel to be twenty fathom deep and in few that are shoally less than two and a half it was called by the succeeding voyagers to this place in honor of sir walter after his name one of them gives his reason for it in these words of the worthiness of this river because i cannot say enough i will speak nothing we have presumed to call it by the name of raleana because your self was the first of our nation who ever entered the same now when ralegh had procured one of the bordering princes named toparimaca a skilful old pilot who was his brother and who perfectly knew this river he sailed up a branch thereof having on the left hand a great island which they call assapana and thence along the banks of several other islands which they chose rather to anchor at than by the main land because of the tortoises eggs found there in abundance to their great relief and for the convenience of casting their nets from the rocks of a blue metalline color which looked like steelore so keeping always westward up the river there opened after a while a land on the right side which appeared a spacious champaign and the banks perfectly red ralegh sent captain giffard thynn calfield his cousins greenvil and batshead gorges also his nephew john gilbert and some others with a guard of soldiers to march over the banks and discover what prospect it afforded and finding it a level of an unbounded space it proved as their pilot informed them the plains of saima reaching to cumana and caracas in the west indies which are a hundred and twenty leagues to the north and inhabited by four principal nations whereof one were the aroras as black as negroes but of smooth hair a desperate people using the strongest and most deadly poison of all others on their arrows ralegh was most curious to know the composition of this poison and what remedies could be had against the dreadful effects of it for besides the mortality of the wound the patient is afflicted with most insufferable torment and accompanied with such irksome symptoms that the physician cannot abide the cure none of the spaniards could ever extort this secret either by kindness or cruelty and indeed but few of the indians besides their priests and soothsayers knew it whether the poison they used in guiana was the same with that in some other parts of the west indies ralegh has not told us but sir john hawkins informs us that about cumana where they are very expert archers their poison is of such force that a man being struck therewith dies in twentyfour hours and that in his judgment there can be no stronger using thereunto apples which are fair and red of color but are a strong poison perhaps the manchineil of which with venomous bats vipers adders and other serpents they make a medley and anoint their arrows ralegh was therefore more beholden to the guianians than any body for antonio de berrio told him that he could never attain to the knowledge thereof and yet they taught me says ralegh the best way of healing this as well as all other poisons then he tells us those medicines which are vulgar and serve for the ordinary poison are made of the juice of a root called tupara which also marvellously quenches the heat of burning fevers and heals inward wounds and that those of common poisoned arrows were wont to be healed by some of the spaniards with the juice of garlic but this he communicates as a general rule for all men that shall hereafter travel the indies where poisoned arrows are used that they abstain from drink for if they take any liquor into their body whereunto they will be exceedingly provoked by drought and drink before the wound is dressed or immediately upon it there is no relief but present death  after having passed the mountain aio and a great island which he mentions he reached on the fifth day of his entering the great river aforesaid as high as the province of aromaia and anchoring at the port of morequito which is  00 miles within the land upon the said great river orenoque he sent a messenger to the old king of aromaia named topiowary who came the next day before noon on foot from his house and returned the same evening being    miles backwards and forwards though himself was   0 years of age he had many attendants of both sexes who came also to wonder at the english and brought them great plenty of flesh fowl and fish with diverse sorts of fruits and among them abundance of pinas the most excellent of all kinds whether ralegh at his return brought of this fruit into england which is otherwise called the ananas and vulgarly the pe apple from some resemblance it bears in shape to the canes of the pine tree or any of that most delicious wine made thereof which he there also tasted has rather been suggested than confirmed but afterward when by a speedy voyage some of the fruit was brought over and presented to king james in greater perfection than we can conceive from tasting what is forced out of ht beds here he discovered one of the noble maxims in his king craft by declaring it was a fruit too delics for a subject to taste of  especially those of guiana besides bread wine and a sort of parroquites no bigger than wrens and one of them presented ralegh with a little beast which the spaniards call armadilla having his body scaled or plated over like the rhinoceros with a white horn growing in his hinder parts as big as a hunting horn this horn is recommended in medicine and the flesh for food since ralegh soon after made a feast of it  when the old king had rested himself a while in a tent which ralegh had caused to be pitched for him they entered by the interpreter into discourse about the murder of morequito his predecessor and the other violations of the spaniards then ralegh acquainted him with the cause of his coming thither whose servant he was and that it was his queens pleasure he should undertake this voyage to deliver them from the tyranny of the spaniards dilating at large on her majestys power justice and clemency toward all oppressed nations all which being with great reverence and attention received he began to sound the old man touching guiana as what sort of commonwealth it was how governed of what strength and policy of what extent with whom in alliance or enmity lastly the distance and way to enter the heart of the country the king gave such ample and perfect account of these particulars that ralegh wondered to find a man of such gravity judgment and good discourse without the help of learning or breeding after his departure ralegh sailed westward to view the famous river caroli both because it was so wonderful in itself and led to the strongest nations of all the frontiers who were enemies to the epuremei subjects to the inga or emperor of guiana and manoa even when he was short of it or lower down than the port of morequito he heard the roaring falls of this river but when he entered it with his barge and wherries thinking to have gone up some  0 miles to the cassipagotos he was not able with a barge of eight oars to row one stones throw in an hour and yet the river is as broad as the thames at woolwich therefore encamping on the banks he sent off an indian to acquaint the nations upon the river of his arrival and his purpose and that he desired to see the lords of canuria who dwelt in that province then one of the princes came down named wanuretona with many of his people and brought great store of provisions as the rest had done by him ralegh found the carolians were not only enemies to the spaniards but most of all to the epuremei who abounded in gold and that there were three mighty nations at the head of that river which would join him against them he was further informed by one capt george whom he had taken with berreo that near the banks of this river there was a great silver mine but the rivers were all now so risen that it was not possible for the strength of man with any boat to row against the stream therefore he dispatched a party between  0 and  0 to coast the river by land while himself with two or three officers and half a dozen shot marched overland to view the strange and wonderful overfalls of the said river caroli which roared at such a distance and the plains adjoining with the rest of the province of canuri when they had got to the top of the first hills overlooking the river they beheld that prodigious breach of waters which poured down caroli and how it ran in three streams for  0 miles together no less than  0 or    of these steep cataracts appeared in sight each as high above the other as a churchtower which rushed down with such violence that the very rebound of the waters made the place seem as if it had been all over covered with a great shower of rain and here ralegh says he never saw a more beautiful country nor more lively prospects the hills so raised up and down about the valleys the waters winding into such various branches the plains so clear of bush and stubble and covered all with fair green grass the ground of hard sand and easy for the march either of horse or foot the deer crossing in every path the birds toward the evening singing on every tree a thousand several tunes with cranes and herons of white crimson and carnation pearched along the river banks the air refreshed with gentle easterly breezes and every stone they stooped to take up promising either gold or silver by its complexion his company at their return brought several of these stones home which they rather found colored outwardly like gold than any of that metal fixed in them for those who had least judgment or experience kept only such as glittered and would not be persuaded but they were rich because they shone thereby bred an opinion that all the rest were no better yet some of these stones ralegh showed afterward to a spaniard of the caraccas who told him it was el madre del oro that is the mother of gold and that the mine was further in the ground  among the goodly rivers beyond the caroli there is one name caora upon this branch it was attested to ralegh by the most intelligent and credible chiefs of the adjacent parts there dwelt a nation of people whose heads appear not above their shoulders which because every body in the provinces of aromaia and canuri also affirmed he was inclined to believe they are called ewaipanoma and reported to have their eyes in their shoulders and mouths in their breasts or in a level with them it was further avouched to him they used bows arrows and clubs thrice as big as any of the guianians and that one being taken prisoner the year before was brought into aromata when ralegh doubted of such a race to the prince hereaftermentioned who came with him into england he answered it was no wonder among them for they had lately slain many hundreds of his fathers people ralegh observes that mandevill had before written of such a nation and that since the eastindian discoveries we find his relations true which were before held incredible further that when he afterward arrived at cumana he spoke with a spaniard eminent for his travels and withal for his credit and veracity who hearing that ralegh had been as far in guiana as caroli immediately asked him if he had seen those people and declared he had seen many of them then ralegh names some french merchants of london who were there present and heard what this spaniard had thus asserted whether it is true or no says he the matter is not great neither can there be any profit in the imagination for my own part i saw them not but an resolved that so many people did not all combine or fore think to make the report after all whether the observation of any garment loosely rising above the shoulders of these people or the crouching posture in which they were so much seen by their constant exercise of archery might not first give some rise to this report i leave for others more largely to explain mr theobald thinks we may be able to account in a few lines for the mystery of these supposed headless people for olearius speaking says he of the manner of clothing of the samojeds a people of north muscovy says their garments are made like those called cosaques open only at the necks when the cold is extraordinary they put their cosaques over their heads and let the sleeves hang down their faces being not to be seen but at the cleft which is at the neck whence some have taken occasion to write that in these northern countries there are people without heads having their faces in their breasts theobalds shakespeare  vo      vol  and how far the same person shall here be condemned for an implicit faith who was as we have read censured for the want of it this consideration may be further offered for what ralegh also repeats not only from the writers of all nations concerning the modern amazons in these parts but from their very neighbors for having told us that orellana first discovered marannon which is called the river of amazons and also after the said discoverers own name ralegh was inquisitive to know whether there were any of those warlike women from whom this river should be so called in these american parts who are so famed in ancient histories to have been in asia and africa and was assured by an ancient casique that there was such a nation of women on the south of the said river in the provinces of topago whose manners and customs as they described to him did somewhat conform with what is recorded of the ancient amazons as they cohabited with men but one month in the year sent them the male children and kept only the females but that they cut off their right breast says he i do not find to be true he was further told they scrupled not to accompany with the prisoners they took in war at any time but in the end constantly put them to death and that as others of the bordering nations these women wore certain plates of gold which they had sometimes exchanged with other countries for spleenstones which are of a green color and whereof says ralegh i saw diverse in guiana for every king or casique commonly has one which their wives chiefly wear and esteem as great jewels  when ralegh with his company lay at anchor on the coast of canuri and had taken knowledge of all the nations upon the head and branches of the caroli and found out many tribes who were enemies to the epuremei and the new conquerors having now wandered for near a month distant from his ships above  00 miles besides the long digressions up many arms and branches on every side by the way they found the winter season advance apace the winter and summer here as touching cold and heat says ralegh differ not neither do the trees ever sensibly lose their leaves but have always fruit either ripe or green and most of them both blossoms leaves ripe fruit and green at one time but their winter consists of terrible rains and overflowing of the rivers with many great storms and gusts thunder and lightnings of which we had our fill ere we returned and the orenoque threaten them with greater fury every day than other the time they spent at trinidad and the company they there in vain waited for being both wanted here to complete their enterprise for the most violent storms of thunder and lightning which now so frequently broke out poured down such floods of rain as made all the rivers rise and rage most fearfully so that if they waded them over shoes in the morning outward homeward they could not come even the same day without wading to their necks or swimming before they could reach their boats besides they all grew very uneasy to themfelves and one another for want of shifting no man having room to bestow any other apparel than what he wore on his back and that was washed through to his skin often ten times a day these inconveniences with those of having no instruments to try any mines or men sufficient to secure them against the guarded nations nearer the imperial city of manoa captain preston having failed them made ralegh conclude there was now no advancing thither or staying longer here but that he might well content himself for this voyage with the various discoveries of the situation products and riches of the country which he had thus far made with the interest and friendship he had thus spaciously procured and which no adventurer to those regions ever had in a much larger space of time with much greater aids and provisions the diligence and dexterity to equal  as he returned to the east he spent some time in discovering the river toward the sea which he had not surveyed in a days time he arrived again at the port of morequito for gliding down the stream he went without labor though against the wind little less than a hundred miles a day when he came to anchor he was very desirous of some further conference with old topiowari who soon upon notice came with a multitude of his people flocking down to raleghs tent upon the shore every one loaded with presents when the old king was refreshed and the crown retired ralegh by his interpreter entered into a long conference with him telling him that as both the epuremei and the spaniards were his enemies the one having conquered guiana already and the other endeavored to get it from both he desired to be instructed both in the best ways to the golden parts of guiana and the civilized towns or apparelled people of inga the king answered he could not perceive ralegh meant to proceed to the great city of manoa because neither the season of the year nor the strength of his company would enable him for he remembered that in the plains of maqureguarai the first civil town of guiana where all the gold plates were made which were scattered over the neighboring nations and about four days journey from his own  00 spaniards were destroyed who had no friends among the borderers therefore advised ralegh never to invade the strong parts of guiana without the help of all those nations which were their enemies ralegh asked if he thought the company he had with him were sufficient to take that town the king thought they were and proffered to assist him with all his borderers if he would leave him a guard of fifty men upon his departure but ralegh knowing if they should escape the guanians the spaniards expecting supplies would repay upon them this treatment at trinidad very plausibly excused himself hereupon the king desired he would forbear him and his country at this time for if the epuremei should know he had given ralegh any aid or intelligence he should soon be overrun by them nor could he avoid the spaniards if they should return who had before led him    days in a chain like a dog till he paid  00 plates of gold and several chains of spleenstones for his ransom but if ralegh would return in due season next year he would engage all the borderers in the enterprise for that he could not more desire to make himself master of guiana than they to assist him having been plundered by the epuremei of their women whom to recover they would willingly renew the war without hopes of further profit for the old king complained of it as a matter of grievous restraint that now they were confined to three or four wives a piece who were wont to enjoy ten or a dozen while the lords of their enemies had no less than  0 or  00 but they seem to have had a political reason for this recovery to strengthen their alliance and increase their forces these frontiers having been much depopulated between the subjects of inga and the spaniards ralegh finding it absolutely improper either to leave any of his company or attempt war upon the epuremei till the next year applied himself now only to learn how these people wrought those plates of gold which were dispersed about and how they divided it from the stone the king told him that most of their plates and images were not severed from the stone but that on the lake of manoa and many other rivers thereabouts they gathered the perfect grains of gold and mingling a proportion of copper the better to work it put it in a great earthen pot under which they increased the fire by the breath of men through long canes fastened to the holes round the said pot till the metal dissolved which then they cast into moulds of stone and clay and so made those plates and images whereof ralegh brought two sorts into england more to show the manner of them than their value for he gave more pieces of gold of the twenty shilling coin with the queens effigies upon them among these people to wear in honor of her majesty and to engage them in her service than he received so little did he make his desire of gold known to them he also brought over some gold ore of their mines whereof i know some is as rich says he as any the earth yields and of which i know there is sufficient if nothing else were to be hoped for but they wanted time hands and instruments to break the ground without which there could be no working of mines we saw adds he all the hills with stones of the color of gold and silver and we tried them to be no marquesite and therefore such as the spaniards call el madre del oro or the mother of gold which is an undoubted assurance of the general abundance thereof and myself saw the outside of many mines of the sparre which i know to be the same that all covet in this world and of those more than i will speak of now ralegh besides having learned the riches of the country having also won the affections of the people and received a faithful promise of the chiefs in those provinces of aromaia and canuri to become servants to her majesty took his leave of old topiowari and received his son prince cayworaco as a pledge betwixt them whom he brought into england where he was christened gualtero with great solemnity leaving with the old king two of his own people in exchange the one named francis sparrow who being a good draughtsman and could describe a country with his pen desired to be left for that purpose whom ralegh instructed to travel as far as he could to manoa with such merchandise as he committed to his care the other was a boy who waited upon him named hugh goodwin for whom he left orders to be taught the language of the country this done he weighed anchor and coasted the river on guianaside because he came toward it on the northside by the lawns of saima  there was a powerful casique named putijma who accompanied ralegh and his men from aromaia with promises to lead them to a mountain called iconuri which contained a mine of gold and which says ralegh he performed ralegh traveled a great way toward it himself along the river mana till through weariness he was forced with some of his attendants to rest on the banks of a lake in the delightful valley of oiana where one of his guides kindling a fire with two sticks succeeding voyagers have observed of the karaguata guacu a brasilian free about    or    foot high with yellow flowers on the top and large long thick leaves which yield an unctuous liquor serving for soap and strings for fishingnets that with the wood thereof and of another called imbaiba the inhabitants kindle their fires by striking them together as we by a flint and steel they stayed a while to dry their shirts sending captain keymis the while with a party under that casique to take cognizance of the said mine and promised to meet him at the river cumaca in his way to emeria the province of carapara one of the greatest lords of the orenoqueponi with whom he sought to establish a league and as ralegh returned by the river mana toward the said province he saw himself many rocks like gold ore and on the left hand a round mountain of mineral stone from hence returning down the stream he coasted the province of parino but the branches of the rivers he here passed with aio and other mountains he reserved to the representation in his map which for the numerous and distant rivers and countries therein occasionally referred to appears to have been a very accurate and comprehensive performance  in the river of winciapora he saw what they call the mountain of crystal which looked at a distance like a white churchtower of exceeding height over the top of which a mighty river rushed down with prodigious noise berreo told him there were diamonds and other stones of great value thereon which blazed at a great distance upon this river ralegh rested a while and marched to a town of the same name where he found the natives all as drunk as beggars it being the time of their festival here ralegh refreshed himself with the provisions of the place and the delicate wine of pinas but understanding that carapana was retired from emeria and imagining because he was an old subtle prince it was to wait till he should return next year then join him if the english were strong enough to tempt his alliance if not that he might excuse his retirement to the spaniards as though it were in fear of these new visitors ralegh spent no more time in seeking after him but making to the river cumaca he met with keymis and took his leave of putijma who of all others most lamented his departure for the orenoque was now swollen most dreadfully so that it was impossible to return by the way he entered for the river of amana could not be sailed back by any means the breeze and current of the sea were so outrageous therefore he followed the branch of capuri which entered into the sea eastward of his ships that he might bear with them before the wind and great need there was so to do having by that way as much to cross of the main sea in their little boats after they came to the rivers mouth as between gravelin and dover but when they arrived at the seaside and anchored in the mouth of capuri there arose a mighty storm and the rivers mouth was at least a league broad so that they run before night close under the land with their boats and brought the galley as near as they could which had much ado to live and was often near sinking with all her men ralegh was in the utmost doubt what course to take either to venture in the galley through six foot water on the sands for two leagues together and that in the channel when she drew five or trust in such a raging wind and sea to cross over in his barge at last seeing the tempest increase the longer he tarried he took gifford calfield and greenvil in his barge and about midnight thrust into the sea leaving the galley to come by daylight thus faintly chearing one another in show of courage says ralegh it pleased god by nine aclock the next morning we discovered the isle of trinidad so they kept along the shore to curiapan where they found their ships at anchor than which says he there never was to us a more joyful sight especially when they found upon meeting together they had lost but one man before mentioned through so many extremes of wet heat hunger want of rest sleep lodging and such like violent hardships in this toilsome and dangerous adventure as drove them to many unusual and unhealthy shifts especially in their diet such as feeding upon many strange and corrupted fruits upon fresh fish without seasoning crocodiles seacows of these sea monsters otherwise called manati by the spaniards ralegh says he had seen as big as a winepipe others describe its flesh to be like beef and to yield and excellent oil the hide being dressed makes good buff and dried good targets or armor wherefore we are told sir walter ralegh brought several of these hides into england antas and armed hogs upon all sorts of the land or water good and bad without order or measure and yet no calenture befell them or other pestilent diseases which are wont to infect all regions so near the line so wholesome was the country or so happily suited to their constitutions  in his return homewards he touched at cumana to store and refresh himself with such provisions as he wanted but the spaniards refused to supply him at which he threatened the town and upon their refusing also to save it by such reasonable ransom as they had just before offered captain preston he set it on fire the like he did at st mary and at rio de la hach as we are informed by camden and others some of whom affirm he got not only great glory hereby but riches the latter of which will be thought doubtful to those who have read the spaniards had removed their effects to the mountains before they entered into a capitulation with preston on the   th of july when the said captain preston with the rest of his company were under cape st anthony the westermost part of the isle of cuba we met says the writer of his voyage with the honorable knight sir walter ralegh returning from his painful and happy discovery of guiana and his surprise of the isle of trinidad so with glad hearts we kept him and his fleet of three ships company for he mentions no more till the twentieth day at night at which time we lost them  when ralegh was arrived in england he soon applied himself to digest the observations he had made in his discoveries and they were not many months after committed to the press several authors have bestowed characters in praise of this discourse which manifests such a wonderful genius in compassing the knowledge of so many places productions and people with so small a power and in so short a time  but ralegh with all his zeal and assiduity for the honor and advantage of his country could never induce the state to proceed in the plantation of guiana not so much through any real incredulity of the emoluments that would accrue from it as through that malignant jealousy which so eternally biased the domestic competitors for royal favor to curb the foreign services of enterprising men lest the atchievments of the one should outshine the administrations of the other whence we may here observe that he whose engaging qualities had gained him such influence such an ascendency over the most savage and uncivilizd nations found no dispositions so barbarous and intractable among those strangers as he did in his own country like hercules himself who having by his glorious labors showed his power of subduing and taming all other monsters found envy and detraction invincible at last that raleghs labors were attended with the same fate himself has sufficiently discovered in that dedication which with so much eloquence modesty and generosity he made of his discourse upon guiana aforesaid to the lordadmiral howard and sir robert cecyl for notwithstanding the difficulties and dangers of the voyage it appears says ralegh therein that i made no other bravado of going to sea than was meant and that i was never hidden in cornwall or elsewhere as was supposed they have grossly belied me that fore judged i would rather become a servant to the spanish king than return and the rest were much mistaken who would have persuaded that i was too easeful and sensual to undertake a journey of so great travel but as he generously continues if what i have done receive the gracious construction of a painful pilgrimage and purchase the least remission i shall think all too little and that there were wanting to the rest many miseries  but ralegh was in hopes it would appear there was now a way found out to answer every mans longing a richer indies than any the king of spain enjoyed which if the queen would patronize he was willing to end the remainder of his days in reducing it to a total subjection whatever he further advanced of this kind diffidence and detraction were so predominant that because some of raleghs company brought over marcasite for gold as he informs us a little further there were some who would not believe the real goldore which he brought and which he had helped to dig out of the rocks with his own dagger was of greater value nay when many trials had been made of this ore wherein some quantities were proved by one westwood a refiner in woodstreet to hold after the rate of twelve or thirteen thousand pounds a ton other parcels by mr bulman and dimock assaymaster found also to hold after the rate of twentythree thousand pounds the ton and a third sort tried by mr palmer comptroller of the mint and mr dimock in goldsmiths hall holding after the rate of twentysix thousand nine hundred pounds the ton who tried also some golddust of the same mine which held eight pound six ounces weight of gold in the hundred and an image of copper made in guiana which held a third part of gold when all this was proved there were those who would not yet believe it gold of guiana but that ralegh purchased it upon the african coast and carried it over thither surely the singularity of that device says ralegh i do not well comprehend for my own part i am not so much in love with these long voyages as to devise thereby to cosen myself to lie hard to fare worse to be subject to perils to diseases to ill savours to be parched and withered and withal to sustain the care and labor of such an enterprise except the same had more comfort than the fetching of marcasite in guiana or buying of goldore in barbary but i hope the better sort will judge me by themselves and that the way of deceit is not the way of honor or good opinion i have herein consumed much time and many crowns and i had no other respect or desire than to serve her majesty and my country thereby if the spanish nation had been of the like belief with these detractors we should little have feared or doubted their attempts wherewith we now are daily threatened  but if we now consider of the actions both of charles v who had the maidenhead of peru and the abundant treasures of atabalipa together with the affairs of the spanish king now living what he has added to the acts of his predecessors how many kingdoms he has endangered how many armies garrisons and navies he maintains the great losses he has repaired as in eightyeight above  00 sail of great ships with their artillery and that no year is less unfortunate but that many vessels treasures and people are devoured and yet that he begins again like a storm to threaten shipwreck to us all we shall find that these abilities arise not from the trades of sack and sevilleoranges nor from ought else that either spain portugal or any of his other provinces produce it is his indian gold that endangers and disturbs all the nations of europe it creeps into councils purchases intelligence and sets bound loyalty at liberty in the greatest monarchies thereof if the spanish king can keep us from foreign enterprises and from the impeachment of his trades either by offer of invasion or by besieging us in britain ireland or elsewhere he has then brought the work of our peril in great forwardness for those princes who abound in treasure have great advantages over the rest if they once constrain them to a defensive war where they are driven once a year or oftener to cast lots for their own garments for these and other substantial reasons which ralegh produces he declares he has labored all his life in the promotion of those attempts which promised either an enlargement of our own national interest or an abatement of the encroaching greatness of the spaniard who in his judgment is not to be more easily reduced than by such a war from so many weak nations are his treasures gathered and so far separated from mutual succor but because he thought such resolution and preparations were not to be hoped for in haste he doubted not if her majesty would embrace the offer of those provinces and that empire now by him discovered before they were engrossed by the enemy but it would yield greater quantities of treasure than all the king of spain possesses from the indies both east and west and he would be contented to lose her good opinion for ever and his life withal if the country should not be found to exceed whatever had been promised in his discourse of it though he has therein written he doubts not after the first or second year that the same should be colonizd but to see in london a contractationhouse of more receipt for guiana than that in seville for the west indies and is positive that if there was but a small army afoot in guiana marching toward manoa the chief city of inga he would yield to her majesty by composition so many hundred thousand pounds yearly as should both defend us from all enemies abroad and defray all expenses at home and that he would besides pay a garrison of   or  000 soldiers very royally to defend him against other nations for he cannot but know how his predecessors were beaten out by the spaniards and that they have ever since with the greatest cruelties sought the entry of his country wherefore he would doubtless be brought to tribute if not having neither shot nor iron weapon in his empire he might easily be conquered and in another part of the said discourse he has these words if it be my lot to prosecute the same i will willingly spend my life therein and if any else shall be enabled thereto and conquer the same i assure him thus much he shall perform more than ever was done in mexico by cortez or in peru by pisarro whereof one conquered the empire of mutezuma the other of guascar and atabalipa and whatsoever prince shall possess it that prince shall be lord of more gold and of more beautiful empire and of more cities and people than either the king of spain or the grand turk concluding his whole treatise of guiana with his trust in him who is the king of kings and lord of lords to put it into her heart who is the lady of ladies to possess it if not i will judge those men worthy to be kings thereof says he who by her grace and leave will undertake it of themselves  all this would not do to raise the saternine genius of the state to pursue this action and upon this occasion we might observe as ralegh did afterward upon another from a poet of his own time that some great men clothing their private envy in the fair colors of the public good curbed the most needful and noble undertakings with distrust through a specious care for the service of the state among these sage and skeptical politicians we may discern sir robert cecyl to be one who in his conferences with some of the speculative geographers of his time would show how careful he was not to be overtaken with any partial affection to the planting of guiana as we are told by one of them whom he would consult about the matter nevertheless raleghs advice was not wholly disregarded for that part of it proposing to drive the spaniards to a defensive war but upon their own proper coasts and harbors was approved of and ralegh himself chosen with other commanders to put it in execution in the latter end of january following he fitted out capt keymis with a couple of ships the darling and discoverer but provided rather to continue the correspondence and peaceful traffic with the indians than to strengthen them in a warlike manner with forces and accoutrements which was what they most desired and expected when keymis arrived at guiana he found his friends much dispersed but yet enquiring what was become of sir walter ralegh whom they had been prepared some months to join were mighty joyful to hear he was not slain at cumana as the spaniards now much increased among them had attested but sadly disappointed that he had not sent a larger fleet to expel them and conquer their neighboring enemies up to the imperial city keymis further learnt that berreo being left at cumana and lodged in the house of one fashardo the governors of the carraccas and margarita conspiring together had sent into spain to inform king philip that berreo being retired to spend the remainder of his declining days in privacy and ease was utterly unable to pursue the enterprise yet of what importance his majestys regard thereto was since so eminent an english cavalier as sir walter ralegh had by a vigorous progress and most artful address made such conquests and discoveries in some parts and rendered himself so extensively engaging in all wherever he came that unless they had power given them to undertake the charge all their past endeavors and future hopes in those parts would come to nothing but berreos campmaster having been long before sent into spain with gold enough gotten out of guiana to levy and furnish  00 men so effectually solicited berreos cause that present order was given for the victualling and manning of ten ships to be sent to him so well worth his care did the king of spain think this undertaking and further this gold bore such weight that the king commanded eighteen ships more to stop at trinidad and not follow their other directions before they saw that place secured from enemies but berreo himself suspecting that speedy dispatch returned to carapanas port with fifteen men the scattered remant that ralegh had left him those governors followed him and anticipating the authority they promised themselves from spain entered guiana with their men and determined to murder berreo who fled toward caroli expecting his son antonio de ximenes with succors from the new kingdom of granada and now topiowary who had fled to the mountains being dead where the english boy ralegh left was devoured by a tiger sanjago a spaniard in the faction of the governors aforesaid took francis sparrow prisoner who was also left by ralegh but having gathered great plenty of gold he ransomed his life therewith yet was kept in captivity by the spaniards some years as we may hereafter learn after this the faction returned to trinidad and begun to rebuild their town where unhappily to these new lawless rulers the twentyeight sail of ships arrived from spain in february following and took sanjago prisoner whom keymis found in chains expecting to be put to death the other actors in this interlude vanishing in canoes recovered margarita and cumana again when eighteen of those ships had left all things in good order they departed according to their instructions leaving the other ten to sortify at conquerabia for the reception of sir walter raleghs fleet nor was it above four months after the arrival of those ships from spain that the king had prepared several others it being in june      to transport a new supply of whole families to the number of  00 persons for guiana  when keymis was advanced to topiowary s port he found the spaniards under berreo had planted a village there and that a rocky island against the mouth of caroli was their fort or refuge but now leaving both town and island they gathered at the mouth of that river and had sent for cannon to defend the passage to those mines says keymis to ralegh from whence your ore and white stones were taken the last year adding we all not without grief to see ourselves thus defeated and our hungry hopes made void were witnesses of this their remove then keymis resolved to seek out putijma who with some friends was retired to the high lands not far from the mountain aio intending if the indians should think themselves too weak with his help to displant the spaniards to set some of them to work for hatchets and knives to return him grains of gold and white stones from such places as they should be directed to but when he came to the place of their abode they were fled apprehending him and his company perhaps to have been a party of spaniards here as keymis goes on gilbert my pilot offered to bring us either to the mine of white stones near winicapora or else to a gold mine which putiima had showed him being but one days journey overland from the place where we now staid at anchor i saw far off the mountains adjoining to this gold mine and having measured their paths near the same place this last year could not judge it to be    miles from us i do well remember how coming that way with putiima the year before he pointed to this same mountain making signs to have me go with him thither i understood his signs and marked the place but mistook his meaning imagining that he would have showed me the overfall of the river curwari from the mountains my indian showed me in what sort without digging they gather the gold in the sand of a small river named macawini which springs and falls from the rocks where this mine is and further told me that he was with putiima when morequito was to be executed by the spaniards and that then the chief of morequitos friends were in consultation to show this mine unto them if it might redeem their captains life but upon better advice supposing them in this case to be implacable and that this might prove a means to lose not only their king but their country they have to this day concealed it from them being of all others the richest and most plentiful and a little further among the reasons he gives for his not bringing proofs away from this mountain of his having known the contents of it this is one forethinking withal that there being no means but ourselves to make known our discovery if we returned not in our misfortune the hope of following this voyage would be buried and further still he says i could promise hope of gold mines and certain assurances of pieces of made gold of spleen stones kidneystones and others of better estimate but because our belief seems to be matted in these greater matters and a certainty of smaller profits is the readiest inducement to quicken our weak hopes i go not so far says he as my own eyes might warrant me these testimonies and others which may be produced francis sparrow above mentioned in the body of the work confirms this account of the mines in these words within six weeks after i departed out of the river orenoque i came to the rich country of curaa in guiana where are the mines of white stone in which is much natural and fine gold which the indians call callicurii the gold in this place runs between the stones like veins of which gold i had some store but now the spaniard is the better for it in curaa is also gold in small grains which lie in the sands in the little rivers or brooks i always took those grains for the finest gold in these rivers where gold lies are many aligators or crocodiles  will both show that ralegh was not more sanguine in his golden hopes and promises than the experience of other men as well as his own would justify  when keymis was arrived at the port of carapana this casique sent some of his people in canoes to assure him he would come down next day and have a conference with him but not coming in five or six days he at last sent one of his aged attendants to excuse the fatigue of such a journey so unfavourable were the ways and himself so disabled with years and infirmities this old envoy then enlarged upon the inconveniences they felt in using the spaniards assistance against their enemies especially when he compared their conduct with that of the queen of england s subjects under her great commander for said he the last year we doubted not but that he being able would have persecuted us as the supporters of your adversaries would have taken our towns and have made us ransom our wives and children but we found it far otherwise and that none of your wellgoverned company durst offer us any wrong no not when undiscovered they might have done it we then believed to be true what your grand captain reported of his princess took this for a good proof of her royal authority and wisdom that had framed her subjects to such obedience and of your happiness who enjoyed the benefit thereof wherefore carapana weighing the friendly course of these proceedings does humbly rave of her majesty for himself and his people that with the rest of the indians who wholly depend on her princely regard he also may enjoy her favorable protection not as a man forsaken by the spaniards but one that knowing their injustice hates their cruelties and takes it for the best course utterly to disclaim their friendship here keymis breaks off to consider it as a matter worthy of observation how this precedent of ralegh s moderation and good order which among them his countrymen who knew him was but his customary comportment or ordinary practice therefore of small regard with them had yet both alienated the indians hearts altogether from the spaniard and stirred up in them true love and admiration thereof after this he discloses his further knowledge of the indian wealth aforesaid in these words this old man showed whence most of their gold comes which is formed in so many fashions whence their spleenstones and others of all sorts are to be had in plenty where gold is to be gathered in the sands of their rivers from what part the spaniards both by trade and otherwise have returned much gold and doubts not but all this was divulged with the consent of carapana as an invitation to the further aid and protection he expected from the english  accordingly keymis finding it was in vain to hope for a conference with that wellwishing but wary casique and having sent him a present of iron gave assurance to all the indians who repaired to him of his speedy return with succors promising to make them all rich in hatchets knives these instruments were such preferable commodities among some of those indians that francis sparrow in his description of guiana beforementioned tells us he bought at camalaha to the south of the orenoque eight young women the eldest whereof was not    years of age for one redhafted knife which in england cost him one halfpenny  and beads if they would only reserve good store of their cassavi which they used for bread and some plates of gold for exchange and having further spent some time in the discovery of above  0 several rivers tribes or nations of people towns and casiques in this voyage he directed his course homewards and arrived at portland in the latter end of june aforesaid having spent five months in going staying and returning as soon as he got home he found ralegh had been gone upon a grand expedition out of the nation near a month therefore he had time to draw up his account of this voyage whence the passages which more immediately relate to our subject are extracted ready to present him with at his return into england which he did and dedicated it to the approved right valorous and worthy knight sir walter ralegh lordwarden etc  when keymis returned into england ralegh was gone upon that enterprise which proved the most renowned of any the english undertook in those days against the spaniards for the queen having heard they had received encouragement from tiroen the irish rebel to threaten her with a new invasion that because she had strengthened their enemies they would take the shortest course and begin with england therefore had made great naval preparations to which they might not be a little emboldened both by the death of her two brave old commanders drake and hawkins and again by their late success no further from her own coasts than calais which taking by storm under cardinal albert archduke of austria and governor of the netherlands the thunder of the spanish artillery alarmed her majestys ears in her palace at greenwich this posture of affairs made the queen determine to use the most effectual means for preventing the mischiefs of an assault by taking the start of them and sending a force sufficient to destroy the spanish shipping in their own harbors accordingly a powerful fleet was fitted out to the number of   0 sail according to camden from stow and speed from both but in the old manuscript list of this fleet which camden followed as to the number of men it appears there were no more than    ships of the english navy which were afterward joined by    sail of hollanders as i gather out of grotius and their other historians this english fleet contained about   000 men wereof  00 were volunteers now if to this number of men we add also that in the dutch ships which according to their own computation was near   00 men there might be enough to leave the whole fleet furnished with sufficient hands to guard and work it and allow of  0  0 men to land upon the spanish coast  the lord admiral howard and the earl of essex were joined in commission generals of this enterprise but the queen considering what there might be wanting to keep an old head and a young one a cool and a warm one in due temper and harmony allotted them a council of war in these words for the better and more orderly execution of this your commission and of those former articles comprised in these our instructions we do ordain that there shall be two persons serving for the seas and two that are appointed to serve for land service to be as counselors to you in our name that is the lord thomas howard and sir walter ralegh sir francis vere and sir coniers clifford and to these four we do add sir george carew lieutenant of our ordnance to make the number of five whom also we charge by these presents that they will as they will answer before god give their councils to you both without any private respect to either of you for love or fear in all actions to be put in question or taken in hand and the same deliberately to debate as the weight of the matter shall require before any resolution be made and before the putting of the matter in action there is further to be understood by those two persons serving for the seas that the lord thomas howard and sir walter ralegh were also constituted admirals in this expedition hence was the whole english fleet divided into four squadrons and so it appears in the list aforesaid wherein we find that which was commanded by ralegh consisted of    ships      mariners and      soldiers the dutch squadron was commanded by the admiral of holland named john duvenvord lord of warmondt how essex relished the division of authority may be somewhat guessed at by the queens answer to one of his letters it seems which she thought very strange you mention says she first a danger to commit authority to any other because you are referred to your commission and instructions formerly sent you which has no power of deputation as who should say that if you did follow the directions of our hand our great seal in this matter should be brought to dispute the validity of your warrant a little further it appears that he had been impatient to be gone for fear he should be detained for the queen had persuaded him to stay behind but not prevailing she at length told him though we meant to drive it to the last considerations and utmost debates as much as could be yet we compared times so sufficiently as a prince who knows what belongs to such a matter that nothing should be done to retard you being ready one hour for as we know ralegh not to be arrived so we know after it some time to embark such an army must be required but ralegh joined the fleet and the whole army was embarked within ten days after the writing of this letter for on the  st of june before mentioned the fleet set sail from plymouth when they came to the north cape of spain they called a select council by hanging out the flag of arms and then had the master and captain of every ship his sealed instructions given him or letters of rendezvous which were not to be opened till they were past cape st vincent unless separated by bad weather but to be thrown overboard in case of danger from the enemy and by which it appeared the voyage was determined for cadiz they had a fortunate progress both as to the wind and the taking of every ship which could give the enemy intelligence of their approach on the  0th of june the fleet came to anchor in the bay of st sebastians short of cadiz half a league the lordadmiral being careful of her majesty ships had resolved with the earl of essex that the town should be first attempted to the end that both the spanish galleons and galleys together with the forts of cadiz might not all at once beat upon the english navy ralegh was not present at this resolution as himself has declared in that account of this action which he dispatched soon after it was over to a minister of state in england which being the clearest i have met with and easiest to be confirmed not only by the more indifferent pens of foreigners but the most partial ones of our own country those of his competitors themselves for honor in this engagement will here be our best guide hence therefore we learn the reason of raleghs aosence at that resolution of first landing the army to have been because he was engaged the day before outward on the seas in stopping such spanish ships as might pass out from st lucar or cadiz along the coast when he returned two hours after the rest he found the earl of essex disembarking his soldiers having put many companies into boats with intention to make his descent on the west side of cadiz but the bilbows were so raging that the boats were ready to sink at the stern of the earl and diverse were lost with some armed soldiers in them but because this course had been resolved on and that doubting now in the danger might look like dreading of it the earl continued his purpose of landing when ralegh came aboard his ship and in the presence of all the colonels protested against the resolution giving him many reasons and apparent demonstrations that to the utter overthrow of their armies themselves and her majestys future safety he was running the way of a general ruin the earl excused himself and laid it upon the lordadmiral who would not consent he said to enter with the fleet till the town was first possessed all the commanders and gentlemen present besought ralegh to dissuade the attempt for they all perceived the danger and were convinced that the greatest part must perish ere they could set foot on ground and if any reached the shore yet would they surely have their boats cast on their heads and  0 men in such a desperate descent might defeat them all the earl hereupon prayed ralegh to go and persuade the lord admiral who being also by him made sensible that certain destruction would be the consequence of pursuing the former resolution consented to enter the port when ralegh brought essex the news of this agreement and called out of his boat entramos entramos as he returned toward him the earl threw his hat into the sea for joy and prepared to weigh anchor the day was now far spent and it required much time to return the boats of soldiers to their own ships so as that night they could not attempt the fleet although many seeming desperately valiant thought it a fault of mine says ralegh to delay it till morning though we had neither agreed in what manner to fight nor appointed who should lead and who second whether by boarding or otherwise neither could our fleet possibly recover all their men in before sunset but both the generals being pleased to hear me and many times to be advised by so mean an understanding came again to anchor and in the very mouth of the harbor so that night about  0 oclock i wrote a letter to the lord admiral declaring therein my opinion how the fight should be ordered persuading him to appoint to each of the great galleons of spain two great flyhoats to board them after the queens ships had battered them for i knew that both st philip and the rest would burn and not yield and then to lose so many of the queens ships for company i thought too dear a purchase and what would be termed but a lamentable victory  this method being agreed on and both the generals persuaded to lead the body of the fleet the charge of the van for putting it in execution was upon raleghs request granted and assigned to him the ship himself was in called the warspite was one of the queens and carried about   0 mariners the rest appointed out of her navy to second him were the maryrose commanded by sir george carew the lion by sir robert southwell the rainbow by sir francis vere the swiftsure by capt cross the dreadnought by sir coniers and alex clifford the nonpareil by mr robert dudley besides    londoners and certain flyboats thus the lord thomas howard because the mer honeur which he commanded was one of the greatest ships was also left behind with the generals but being impatient thereof he pressed them to have the service committed to him and to that end exchanged his ship with mr dudley hereupon ralegh observes for my own part as i was willing to give honor to my lord thomas having both precedence in the army and being a nobleman whom i much honored so i was yet resolved to give and not to take example for this service holding my own reputation dearest therefore with the first peep of day he weighed anchor taking the start of all others a good distance and bear with the enemy who was in the following disposition to receive him  under the walls of cadiz were ranged    galleys which lay with their prows to flank his entrance there was also a fort called philip which beat into and commanded the harbor besides the ordnance which lay all along the curtain upon the wall toward the sea and diverse other pieces of culverin which scoured the channel notwithstanding as soon as the enemy perceived an english admiral under sail approaching several of their galleons and other ships of war with  0 great vessels besides bound for mexico and other parts also set sail of all which the st philip matthew andrew and thomas being four of the capital galleons of spain came again to anchor under the fort of puntal in a straight of the harbor which leads over to puerto real on the starboard side of them they placed three frigates of war at their back two great galleons of lisbon besides two well furnished argosies and the    galleys by three and three were to interlace them as occasion should be offered the admiral vice admiral and rearadmiral of new spain with the body of the fleet were ranged behind them toward puerto real hoping with this great strength to defend the entrance the place being no broader from point to point than that their line did in effect stretch over the straight as a bridge and had besides the fort of puntal for their guard  ralegh as aforesaid advancing in the van was first saluted by fort philip sir walter ralegh afterward exemplifying how little a resolute and experienced man of war will fear to pass by the best appointed fort of europe with the help of a good tide and a leading gale of wind and how hard a matter it is to stop a good ship without another as good to encounter it says the fort st philip terrified not us in the year      when we entered the port of cadiz neither did the fort at puntal when we were entered beat us from our anchoring by it though it played upon us with four demicannons with in point blank from six in the morning till    at noon hist of the world lib   cap   sect  0  next by the cannon on the curtain and lastly in good order by the    galleys which lay near the town with all their prows bent against him as he entered ralegh answered the firing of their ordnance with a flourish of his trumpets and still kept driving forwards that he might draw up a sufficiency of the english fleet into play and to engage those he passed by while he was in action upon the body of the enemy accordingly the ships that followed beat upon the galleys so thick that they soon betook them to their oars and got up to join with the galleons in the straight as aforesaid then as they were driven to pass near him he bestowed his benediction from several broadsides among them but plied st philip the great and famous admiral of spain most constantly as being most worthy of his fire and being now resolved to repay the enemys former treatment of the revenge or to second her loss with his own life he came to anchor by the great galleons whereof the philip and the andrew were the two which boarded that brave english ship here he fell to battering of them very briskly expecting after awhile the flyboats to come up that he might board and take them and now began the engagement to be very desperate the lord thomas came to anchor on one side of him though pretty much behind with sir robert southwell sir george carew and the cliffords on the other and sir francis vere was toward the side of puntal at last the thunder of the ordnance grew so great about ten aclock in the morning that essex impatient to abide far off thrust up through the fleet heading all those on the left hand and on that side anchored next to ralegh afterward came in captain cross as near as he could but ralegh to his great honor held always single in the head of all now after they had beat as at two buts one upon another almost three hours so that the volleys of cannon and culverin came as thick as if it had been a skirmish of musketeers till raleghs ship was in danger of sinking in the place he made away to essex in his skiff to desire that he would enforce the promised flyboats to come up that he might board for as he rid he could not long endure so great a battery  essex was then coming up himself to whom ralegh declared that if the flyboats came not he would board in the queens ship for it was the same loss to burn or sink and one he must endure then the earl promised him that whatever he attempted he would second him in person upon honor in the mean while the lord admiral howard being also at first disposed to advance but the river was so choked that he could not pass in the ark came with the lord thomas in the nonpareil and while ralegh was speaking to essex the marshal vere who thought it some touch says ralegh to his great esteemed valor to ride behind me so many hours got up ahead of my ship which lord thomas perceiving headed him again myself being but a quarter of an hour absent at my return finding myself from being the first to be but the third i presently let slip anchor and thrusting in between the lord thomas and the marshal went further ahead than all of them before and thrust myself athwart the channel so as i was sure none should outstart me again for that day essex thinking his ship stronger than the rest thrust clifford s aside and still got next to ralegh on the left hand ahead of all that rank but lord thomas while vere secretly fastened a rope on ralegh s shipside toward him and drew himself up equal with him but some of his company advertising him thereof he caused it to be cut asunder so vere fell back into his place whom ralegh guarded all but his prow from the sight of the enemy  but now ralegh having no hopes of his flyboats and essex with the lord thomas having promised to second him he laid out a warp by the side of the philip to close the wind hindering him otherwise to board her and when the admiral thereof with the commanders of the other three wooden apostles found that essex and the lord thomas began to do the like they all slipped anchor and ran aground heaps of soldiers and mariners tumbling into the sea like coals out of a sack says ralegh into many ports at once some drowning some sticking in the mud he also tells us the philip thereupon burnt herself and another author more particularly in these words as ralegh thought to have boarded the great galleon st philip a negro gave fire to the powder and escaped by swimming it gave so great a crack that the mast was blown up into the air as if it had been an arrow a pinnace that lay near it was burnt but the men escaped in boats the other galleon called st thomas was likewise blown up but did no harm to the englsh he also mentions two easterlings which ran ashore and were burnt but says he the st matthew and st andrew of  0 or   00 ton apiece were saved from running aground and carried away however he does not inform us particularly by whom and others seem to have done ralegh more wrong in nominating other persons and omitting him in the performance since it appears under his own handwriting that he took them both himself and this agrees with the manner his letter of this action in print has expressed it where he says those galleons were recovered with our boats ever they could get out to fire them here he observes upon the enemies running to the shores and thus firing their ships that the spectacle was very lamentable on their side for many drowned themselves many half burnt leaped into the water very many hanging at the ropesends by the ships side under the water even to the lips many swimming with grievous wounds till struck under water and put out of their pain and withal such huge fires and such tearing of the ordnance in the great philip and the rest when the flames came to them that ralegh thought there was here to be seen the most lively figure of hell itself  thus the victory was obtained by sea and the bay resigned by two some say by four oclock in the afternoon though no more of the english were constantly and closely engaged than the ships and commanders beforementioned against the six great galleons    galleys with the fleet of new spain argosies and frigates to the number of    or    as ralegh himself reckons them besides the fort of puntal playing upon them all the while after the victory ourselves spared the lives of all says ralegh but the flemings who did little or nothing in the fight used merciless slaughter till they were by myself and afterward by my lordadmiral beaten off  then did they hasten to land the army and attempt the town cadiz was a large and beautiful city and being the chief see of the bishop had a good cathedral church abbey nunnery and fine college of jesuits was strongly situated both by nature and art the buildings of hard stone all flat roofd after the turkish manner so that having lodged heaps of great stones on the tops of their houses every woman could endanger the passengers in the streets which were very narrow perhaps to avoid the great heat all the houses had fair windowframes and large folding shutters but were barred with iron and none glazed except the churches they had few chimnies but in some lower outrooms for necessary uses seeming to be more careful of keeping themselves from roasting than to have much of any thing roasted  in which there were of all sorts above    0 soldiers in pay and about  00 horse of the gentry and caviliers of xeres gathered together upon the discovery of the english fleet two days before as they lay becalmed off cape st mary the horsemen sallied out to resist their landing but were so vigorously assailed and overpowered by the english that the greatest part made away to the bridge which leads to the main called puente de suaco the rest retreated to the town and were so eagerly pursued that they were driven to forsake their horses at the gate which the inhabitants durst not open to admit them so that they were forced to leap down an old wall into the suburbs which the english vanguard close at their heels perceiving with essex at their head followed them and so the town was carried with a sudden fury in a short space of time and with very little loss ralegh though he had received a grievous wound in his leg being much torn and deformed with a splintershot in the fight yet willing to encourage the army with his presence and desirous of seeing the actions and dispositions of the enemy he was carried ashore on the shoulders of his men where the lordadmiral out of his care and regard sent him one of his horses but his own being recovered in due time was made ready for him  the torment he endured and the fear he was continually in of being shouldered by the tumultuous soldiers abandoned to spoil and rapine without any respect of persons made him unable to abide above an hour in the town after the surrender was over order was given to transport the religious men and women merchants wives etc to port st mary that no violence might be offered them they had also liberty to take as many of their clothes or goods as they could carry with them which produced a remarkable example in a beautiful young spanish lady who leaving all that was precious and valuable bore away her old and decrepid husband upon her back whom before she had hidden from the danger of the enemy herein imitating the piety of the bavarian women after the conquest of their country by the emperor conrade iii the same night therefore he returned chiefly because there was no admiral on board to order the fleet or indeed few mariners left in the navy all to use his own words running headlong to the sack and also because he was fit for nothing but rest and retirement at that time otherwise he might like the rest of the commanders have rewarded himself for his services but leaving them in safe possession at his departure they promised to preserve for him his share of the booty and to give him a good quarter of the town of which as we have it under his own hand they defrauded him he had desired the consent of the generals that he might go and secure or destroy the indian fleet which was said to be worth twelve millions and lay in puertoreal road but they desired to consider on it till next morning at break of day ralegh sent his brother sir john gilbert and sir arthur throgmorton as also sir henry leonard to know their resolution but the generals sent back to desire he would come ashore into the town ralegh very favorable imputes these evasions to the great confusion in which it was almost impossible for them to order many things at once in the afternoon of the same day the merchants of cadiz and seville offered the generals by the committee of the contractationhouse with the purveyor corrigidor and other officers two millions of ducats to spare that fleet neither could this bring them to any resolution so that advantage was lost ralegh might possibly insist upon a larger composition by saying they ought first to be masters of the fleet and ransom it afterward for if they offered two millions already they would give four when it was taken but it appears plain enough that essex was not for having the fleet seized upon unless by sir christopher blunt sir edward conway sir thomas gerrard and other land officers which ralegh would not consent to for the honor of the sailors as it does appear from cambden that the lordadmiral would not consent to any composition for we came said he to consume them and not compound with them but they saved him the trouble for the next morning being the   d of june the duke of medina caused all that fleet of merchantmen to be set on fire because he was convinced from their being beset so vigilantly by ralegh who had the charge of them that they must needs fall into his hands thus both galleons frigates argosies with the fleet of nueva espana and all except the galleys which it seems escaped were consumed to ashes good store of the enemys ordnance was recovered out of their ships and great quantities of merchandise plate jewels and money out of the town their whole loss being computed at twenty millions of ducats the earl of essex in a brief narrative of the advantages accruing to england and losses to the spaniard by this expedition says the english took two galleons routed    galleys with an unequal number of ships freed many of their countrymen condemned to the galleys and released several spaniards from imprisonment took the best fortified city in all spain and stayed thirteen days in their country brought home besides the galleons aforesaid  00 brass guns with a rich booty and the sailors but especially the soldiers great plunder the enemy lost    of his most serviceable ships  0 indian merchantmen and   others besides vast quantities of ammunition provisions etc rendering it almost impossible he should in some time appear again at sea in a formidable manner many rich prisoners were given to the land commanders so as that sort were very rich says ralegh some had for their prisoners sixteen or twenty thousand some ten thousand ducats besides great houses of merchandise what the generals have gotten i know least concludes he they protest it is little for my own part i have gotten a lame leg and a deformed for the rest either i spoke too late or it was otherwise resolved i have not been wanting in good words or exceeding kind and regardful usage but have possession of naught but poverty and pain  it was long disputed whether the town should be held or no say sir francis vere who adds that my lord of essex seemed to affect to remain there in person as we may add vere did too because he says he offered to defend it with  000 men till her majestys pleasure should be known when in truth the queens pleasure in this particular was known before they left england for essex himself informs us he sent letters from plymouth before they set sail by his secretary edward reignold to the council at greenwich wherein he purposed to dwell in a port of the enemys and to make a continual diversion of the wars but says he my letters were neither answered nor liked of and much less was the same proposal now relished in cadiz when so many wanted to guard and secure the treasures they had got and it was computed they would all soon grow in want of provisions nay one of his own knights advised him to master and destroy ships rather than towns as what would make the enemy more unable to molest them and procure him wealth and solid honor without riot and ruin of the innocent besides the riches in ships could not be so easily concealed and conveyed away as in towns also they might be brought into england and would be visible monuments to his glory but towns though soon won could not be long enjoyed  for these and other reasons essex was prevailed upon to leave cadiz but they first of all caused the city to be razed and with the castles and fortifications fired all but the churches and religious houses together with all the naval tackle and provision they could meet with which they either needed not or could not conveniently carry away their courtesy however to the people especially of distinction and all who had made no opposition was such that at their departure the spaniards did the english the justice to say though they were heretics as to religion yet as to the rest they had behaved themselves with generous bravery  on the  th of july the army embarked and in council it was insisted on to lie out at sea for intercepting the westindian fleet but the scarceness of our victuals says vere overthrew that purpose so resolution was taken to make for england and visit the spanish coasts in the way to destroy their shipping the first place they made to was faro a good large populous town but unfencd and a bishops see of portugal here the english landing and marching up to the town the inhabitants deserted it and left them in full possession who after having rested and refreshed themselves five or six days brought good store of provisions to the ships also some pieces of artillery and the valuable library of the late famous bishop osorius this was hieronymus osorius a native of lisbon and bishop of sives and algarva uncharacterized by foreigners to have been a man of strict virtue in his morals and master of a florid pen in his writings which were published at rome in four volumes by his nephew who also wrote his life see more in thuanus anno    0 when he died aged    years and in anthony tessiers additions to that historians eloges des hommes scavans etc  vo vol   utrecht      p  0  this bishops was for none of his writings more noted with us than his epistolary admonition to queen elizabeth and his controversy with that learned orator and civilian dr walter haddon who dying in the year      before he had completed his last book against osorius it was finished and published by john fox the martyrologist in      and four years after translated into english wherein fox charges the bishops book against the doctor with being full of lies calumnies and errors and the lord bacon where he notes among the distempers of learning that luxuriancy of style which began to prevail in luthers time with the causes thereof which introduced an affected study of eloquence and grew to such excess that authors regarded a roundness of period more than richness of invention soundness of argument or depth of judgment and were charmed rather with softness than strength sweetness than solidity and fullness of words than weight of matter he instances among others then growing into esteem the flowing and watery vein of osorius de augment scientiarum lib   there is another author who mentions the taking of this town and consequently that library among raleghs victories describing the buildings to have been left so demolished as to yield no covering for their idols but since that library is observed by camden to have been thought by right essexs prize as if this earl had somehow contended to engross it to himself it may somewhat direct us to whose greater value for the labors of the learned and more public spirit in this particular it is owing that it was more commendably bestowed being brought into england says monson and made it seems an exemplary foundation of the public library which was begun by sir thomas bodley the ensuing year at oxford what share ralegh had in this disposal toward the said renowned undertaking of that learned knight his countryman and acquaintance authorities are wanting further than by surmise from these premises to certify but this we have expressly enough transmitted to us of him by bodley himself even in the next reign about nine years after this time when ralegh was under great misfortunes and therefore when an act of munificence must shine with the greatest splendour that he generously contributed toward the improvement of that library the sum of  0 l for which says sir thomas bodley i will entreat the vicechancellor to move the university for their letters to him and the other benefactors mentioned with him of public thanks  when the forces were got again on board they failed to the groyne and looked into the bay but the wind being unfavourable they thought it dangerous to enter therefore and because the victuals daily grew more scarce so that in some ships there was already extreme want says sir francis vere it was resolved to make homewards however sir william monson in favor of essexs impatience to go upon fresh exploits computes they had enough provision to supply them seven weeks monson also imputes the general declension of the officers from any further invasion of the spaniards at this time to the covetousness of those who wanted to secure the treasures they had amassed and indeed vere discovers not any concurrence now with essexs new schemes of adventure as might have been expected toward a patron who had shown him so much favor and countenance but visibly hastens home upon the complaint of the scarcity aforesaid and yet that which might be thought veres true motive for returning was never imputed to the lordadmiral nor sir walter ralegh though both by speech and writing they argued for it as much as any for they had engrossed no booty that might be endangered by entering upon further engagements abroad yet had they other objections to these inconsiderate projects than the want of victuals or sickness of men for after both these inconveniences in raleghs ship were proposed to be redressed by essex as monson tells us ralegh was as resolute against hazarding the honor as others the riches that was got at cadiz and in this entirely agreed with the lordadmiral who persuaded them to consider how subject they might be to great losses in little enterprises which would not add much to their praise if they succeeded but surely would to their discredit if they failed this being the sense of the greater or the wiser part most of the fleet returned with the lordadmiral to plymouth on the  th of august following and the rest with the earl of essex two days after who thence took his journey to court as ralegh probably did at the same time on the   th of the same month we find by a letter from the council of state to the lordadmiral then advanced with the fleet to the downs that ralegh as well as essex had been with them and probably with the queen from whom we hear of no objections made to raleghs conduct in the whole action therefore probably he was among those principal actors therein whom she distinguished with liberal praises and rewards yet that letter does discover her majestys dissatisfaction toward the lordadmiral that he did not lie in wait for the carracks or the westindian fleet as essex had entreated him to do and whereas sir francis vere says that when essex landed in the west and left orders with him for dissolving not only the landforces but the shipping there arose much strife between the said mariners and his low country troops at their parting the sailors being determined to share in the chests and packs wherewith the soldiers had most unproportionably enriched themselves in the late spoil at which vere complained to the lordadmiral for redress adding that some other principal officers of the fleet took the sailors part and as if they thought them unreasonably dealt with who had made way by the sea fight for the soldiers to get those riches by land asked him whether the mariners should have nothing to which he answered their hopes in the indian fleet were more to be desired than that trosh as he calls it which the landmen had got in the town so as they had none to blame but their officers and their bad fortune which answer says he was taken to heart and is not forgotten to this hour of which i feel the smart if ralegh was one of those principal officers here pointed at who thus stood the sailors advocate as he might be notwithstanding his expeditious progress to court the indifferent manner wherewith vere has treated him is very accountable to me but vere has further betrayed his partiality in not telling us the consequence of his said application to the lordadmiral which appears in that letter and others from the council aforesaid to have procured the disposal of the spanish plunder toward the payment of the english navy and that veres low country regiments should not return before they were searched both in ships and person as for essex he wrote a censure of the omissions in this voyage which he imputes to the dissensions of his council and colleague whence the common historians have been led indiscriminately to arraign the setting forth such expeditions under commanders of equal authority and have so much neglected giving these their distinct commendations for what they did as to cavil at them for what they left undone while others more gratefully observe that never was so much riches and renown acquired with the like naval success well justifying the honors which were paid to sir walter ralegh both by the authors who dedicated books to him this year the painters and sculptors who have appropriated this sea fight to his portraits and those other advancers of the like honorary arts who in their discourses of medals and intagias have thought him worthy for this among his many other actions and excellencies of that metallic commemoration which is more usually among us confined to princes and crowned heads mr evelyn in his book of medals gives us the sculpture of a large one that was struck this year having the arms of england france and holland in a threefold knot on one side representing a triple league against spain with this inscription rumpitnr haud facile and on the reverse a navy of great ships at sea under the name of jehovah with this epigraph quid me persequeris      hence thought by some to have been in memory of the victory at cadiz but as he tells us it was struck upon the alarm menacing those three nations on the surprise of callais this year therefore where he is speaking of those adventrous argonauts in these times who deserved the honor of medals for their exploits at sea among whom he reckons chiefly those who found out new worlds planted colonies and enlarged the british empire he adds i know not whether there was any medals of the earl of essexs expedition to cadiz and of the heroes who accompanied him so recommends sir w ralegh to that distinction as being a person of extraordinary merit for his learning and experience and who is he continues my author that deplores not his being so happily cut off and our since want of such as ralegh was to gratify the crafty and malicious further where he is subsiding from arms to arts he mentions ralegh again among the foremost of those illustrious persons of whom he says how should one rejoice to find in more lasting matter than painted cloth the true effigies of such as were famous for both numismata fol      p      0       about two months after raleghs return from the conquest of cadiz we find him making a new attempt to continue the interest and correspondence he had so hopefully begun in guiana to this end he manned out and stored with all proper conveniences and merchandise for trade and discovery in those parts a handsome pinnace which had been with him in the late engagement called after his own name the watt therefore probably one of his own ships the command of her he committed to captain leonard berrie but through contrariety of winds and other accidents they made it the latter end of december following before they got out of weymouth in the beginning of march they discovered the coast and fell into the river wiapouco a river almost in four degrees north of the line and about sixteen leagues in length but not being able to find the head of its falls nor meeting with any of the inhabitants to supply them with provisions they returned and made toward the great town called aramatto where they stored themselves to their desire after this several of those natives came in canoes and traded with the english in their ships then captain berrie hired some of them with a present of knives to go back unto the river cawo and invite the ruler of that place named ritimo on board who accordingly came to them in the river chiana where he and his train were feasted and traffickd with the english much to their satisfaction and thither also flocked from their several towns great numbers of a civilized race of carribes who brought great plenty of victuals and tobacco which they exchanged for such commodities as the english were well instructed to carry thither after they had declared their unanimous desire to have the english come and rout the spaniards take command of the orenoque and dwell in the bordering nations they departed and the english made away to the careres or triangular islands and kept trading on with the people of the neighboring towns who familiarly resorted to them then they passed along through the river marawin to quiparia and macirra for about  0 or  0 leagues upward to the falls of that river and to the sight of a rich country above where the people were of an extraordinary stature and carried bows hafted with gold but were forced to return without completing that discovery for want of provision though my author one of the adventurers thought the palmitos and other trees in the woods would have supported them till they could have rewarded themselves with what might have done us good says he as long as we had lived on the   th of april      they returned from that river and wandered through several others till about four days after they fell into the coritine in this river they met a bark called the john of london commanded by captain leigh the same i suppose who afterward made other voyages to guiana and took further possession of the country not by force the spaniards title but consent of the people though for a prince indeed who deserved no right there which he had not the spirit to maintain and falling down some five leagues from the mouth thereof upon intelligence that the dessekebe with which that river meets would lead them within a days journey of the lake perima whereon manoa was suppsed to stand they meant to discover a passage to this rich city but having rowed in their boats about fifty leagues from the mouth of the coritine to the falls of the said river where having been credibly informed that five days journey further there was a fall impassable and finding withal some of the towns bordering thereon so importunate to engage them in wars against their enemies the waccawaes which would turn greatly to the disadvantage of the english when sir walter ralegh should again return thither because he would have occasion to pass that river which was reported to have gold in it they therefore were constrained to return so clearing themselves of this coast they took their course to the islands of the west indies here my author who was a gentleman of the company after having spoke in praise of the climate how temperate and wholesome it is though within the tropic and so near the equinoctial as also how docible the natives and humane especially to englishmen though a savage and uncultivated people he proceeds to speak of their riches in these words in the upper countries they go appareld being as it seems of most civil dispositions having great store of gold as we are certainly informed by the lower indians of whom we had some gold which they brought and bought in the high country of wiana being able to buy no more because they wanted the things which now we have left among them that there are many rich mines and minerals in guiana as well as mountains and rivers impregnate with gold is not only thus constantly intimated by the english travelers thither of these times but attested by the spaniards themselves in their further discoveries many years after as may be seen in father dacunas relation of the river of amazons and other spanish authors but as for the rich city of manoa just before spoken of which they had called el dorado it seems now to have been invented by these indians as a gilded bait to draw the spaniards into league with them against their enemies and propagated by the spaniards themselves to inhance the merit of their travels and sharpen the appetite of their successors to pursue the enterprise for no such city having been found it has been reputed a kind of philosophers stone in cosmography yet like that in chemistry though undiscovered itself it was and may further be the means of many profitable discoveries if such a metropolis had been distinctly ascertained by antonio de herera and john de laets excellent accounts and maps of these parts and had not appeared doubtful even to father dacuna himself i see not how monsieur sanson who in    0 graved a little map to explain the french translation of the said jesuits discourse could have omitted it and for the new edition published in      another map was graved by mr de lisle which though more copious and complete is not as i can hear more particular in this respect then having taken a little further notice of their manners with the plenty and variety of their provisions he shows what course his company took homewards and how they arrived safe at plymouth on the   th of june following  thus have we abstracted all the voyages sir walter ralegh set forth for discoveries as well as the warlike expeditions in which he was engaged as far as they have been preserved in hakluyts collections nor was it without just reason that his said naval enterprises were thus carefully gathered therein since raleghs encouragement was such of this extraordinary undertaking to raise a grove of laurels in a manner out of the sea that should overspread the island with glory and might be still made to shoot more spaciously afresh were the author and his work revived in a manner suitable to their deserts that when even the first edition of these english voyages was published and before they could receive any luster from the guianian discoveries the said author in his preface ackcowledges sir walter ralegh to have been one of those benefactors from whom he had received his chief light into the western navigations nor did he only oblige hakluyt with communicating diverse maritime adventures in which he himself and countrymen were concerned but procured for him at no small expense some very scarce voyages and discoveries of foreigners which were unprinted and was moreover at the charge of rewarding some persons of learning and leisure to translate them into english for the further enrichment of the said collections one instance of this kind he slightly mentions himself for in his learned enquiries into the name of the red sea he speaks of a voyage made thither by the portugal viceroy of the east indies named stephen gama the narrative whereof was written by castro one of his principal commanders which discourse says he i gave mr richard hakluyt to publish further we might expatiate upon this care he had for the preservation of other mens fame but here a gallant exploit sollicits our regard by which he much increased his own  for the earl of essex grown discontented to see his party of such little power at court and the cecilians carry all before them that he could not advance several of his friends and followers to certain posts in the army not even sir thomas bodley to the office of secretary whom he had perhaps prejudiced with his prodigal praises to the queen she having preferred sir robert cecyl to that place in his absence at cadiz whom he had as intemperately traduced sir thomas bodley informs us that before he returned from the united provinces in      and after the earl of essex used him so kindly that though he meant to settle his dependence only on the lord burghley as best able and most willing to work his advancement with the queen yet the earl who sought by all devices to divert her liking both from the father and the son especially did often to withdraw his affection also from both entertain the queen with prodigal speeches of his sufficiency for a secretary which were accompanied with such words of disgrace against the latter that neither she herself took any great pleasure to prefer me the sooner says bodley for she hated his ambition and would give little countenance to any of his followers and both the lord burghley and his son waxed jealous of my courses and a little further when i had thoroughly bethought me first in the earl of the slender holdfast he had in the queen of an endless opposition of the chiefest of our statesmen likely still to want upon him of his perilous feeble and uncertain advice as well in his own as in all the causes of his friends and when i had fully considered how untowardly these two counselors were affected to me how ill it became my natural disposition to become a stickler in public faction and how well i was able to live of my self etc i was resolved to take my farewell of state employments and so retire from courts resolved to seek by further services abroad to strengthen that interest at home which he now found so weak and unserviceable for the king of spain enraged at the late overthrow and destruction of cadiz had immediately thereupon mustered up the naval powers from all his ports at lisbon for a new expedition upon england and ireland but his old enemies the winds and the waves so speedily disabled and dispersed them that the queen heard of their fate before she had any advertisement of their design and as she then took care to fortify such castles as lay most obvious to any such invasion so now that she heard the storm was gathering again by the repair of the said shattered fleet and recruits added to it threatening a new descent upon ireland she resolved also to recollect her forces by sea at first indeed before she was well informed of the enemys strength she had only armed and victualled ten of her best ships and caused the low countries to provide the like number under admiral duvenvard but when the lord thomas howard and sir walter ralegh who were pitched upon for the command of this fleet declared their hopes of doing any great service with it to be weak and uncertain and the news of the adelantados stronger preparations at feroll and the groyne were daily confirmed a new council was called in which it was resolved that this naval force which the queen had appointed was too great for a discovery and too little for an attempt as in the earl of essexs apology is rightly observed therefore passing over the addition so unaccountably deficient in the said apology there were added to the first prepared fleet about ten ships more of the royal navy which with the other men of war victuallers transports and many stout vessels belonging to the nobles knights and gentlemen who were adventurers in this voyage amounted to about   0 sail as we are informed by sir arthur gorges an officer in this enterprise these ships then being all sufficiently manned with sailors received an army of  000 soldiers with ten pieces of artillery for the field and  00 volunteers most georgeously equipped the proportion of victuals was for four months at large allowance and double apparel both for the soldiers and mariners the lordadmiral howard being indisposed declined the command which therefore was granted in chief to the earl of essex but the lord thomas howard was made vice admiral and sir walter ralegh rearadmiral in the expedition and these three with four others made up the council of war the purpose of this grand preparation was to defeat and destroy the spanish fleet aforesaid at ferroll as well as in other ports of the enemy also to seize upon such indian fleets of treasure as they should meet with belonging to the king of spain but especially to conquer retain and engarrison most of the isles of the azores these islands are situate in the atlantic or western ocean between    and  0 degrees and distant from england about  00 leagues they were so named by the portuguese from a kind of hawks called by them asores by the romans accipitres and by us goshawks these islands breeding abundance of those birds though ortelius derives the name from a french word signifying to dry or wither without giving reason for his etymology they are nine in number and named st marys which is near the coast of spain st michaels which is the largest of them being about  0 miles long the terera so called because lying the third from spain is the strongest gratiosa from the fertility of the soil and pleasant temper of the air st georges like the two first from the saints name on whose day it was discovered the pike from the wonderful sharp mountain thereon which rises steeplewise three miles high is six or seven miles in circuit at the base and reported to have vulcanos in its bowels disgorging flakes and stones of fire fayall was so called from faya the beech tree which grew in plenty there flores from the abundance of flowers which overspread the island and cuervo from the vast flocks of crows or ravens which were observed to breed therein and above all the tercera wherefore this enter prize was called the island voyage  about the  th of july following the whole fleet set sail from plymouth and for two days had a fair leading wind in which time all the ships received their directions from the council of war with the meetingplaces from time to time in case of separation by tempest fight chase or any other accident but being now advanced about sixty leagues there arose such an exceeding high storm full in their teeth and continued for four days together that all the ships were driven with great detriment to several back into plymouth and many died of the sickness it had brought upon them while they lay here windbound for a month and their provisions much damaged and consumed essex in company with sir walter ralegh rode post to court the earl was very forward in his proposals to set out again with the fleet as soon as it should be repaired or at least one half of it being sure the enemy should have felt the weight and charge of the journey but her majesty not accepting his offer it was more advisedly resolved to proportion their expedition to the opportunities which remained the season being so far elapsed and their provisions so much exhausted therefore essex had orders from her majesty to discharge the land forces all but the thousand low country soldiers then thought the best and most experienced of this army whereby though they were disabled of disembarking at ferroll and attacking the enemy there by land yet essex offered to send certain fireships into the bay and second them with the two spanish galleons last year taken with some great flyboats and merchantmen to destroy their shipping and leave the queens own english built ships at the mouth of the harbor with a principal commander to secure their retreat and this was allowed of but with some limitations as essex confesses in one place which in another we find to be an absolute bar to hazard any other of the ships and as absolute a restraint of the earl himself from going into the harbor to put this project in practice but that it should be done by that principal commander he would have left behind whether through care of his person as a nobleman or to have it attempted by one of the greatest abilities and experience for such a naval exploit i cannot say but sir walter ralegh was preferred to the execution of this service and as sir francis vere observes the charge of firing the fleet was undertaken by him  during this absence of essex and ralegh at court which was not above seven days there fell out such exceeding tempestuous weather as very much distressed the fleet both at plymouth road and cawater insomuch that one of raleghs own ships the roebuck of  00 tons burden ran aground and bulgd herself so became unserviceable for that voyage though much pains and care were taken by all hands and especially the lord thomas howard himself in person to have preserved her on the   th of august following they weighed anchor and with much labor set sail again being becalmed but the weather growing afterward somewhat favorable they held their course for the northcape six days afterward they fell across the bay of alchaser or biscay and at last bore full into it much to the dislike of raleghs pilot a skilful mariner named broadbnt who thought it very perilous for so great a fleet so wilfully to imbay there and upon an enemys coasts yet as it was the generals course they complied the next day they were here for several hours beaten and scattered about by a prodigious storm wherein one of the late taken prizes named st matthew falling into a headsea and having her sprit sail out broke her boltsprit and foremast overboard close to the partners the fall of masts also broke two anchors and carried the third away and her mainmast with her rolling and tumbling had so loosened itself that it was in danger of breaking in the step whereby she would soon have been sunk had not her captain sir george carew with great resolution and hazard carried her into england and exchanged her for another in the same storm the other spanish prize the st andrew spent her maintopmast and lost company for some days but all the rest of the fleet kept laboring in the bay till first ralegh and some ships of his squadron which happened to carry the low country soldiers cleared out and made the best of their way to the next rendezvous and afterward several of the earls losing him sailed thither also in search of him this gave rise to a misrepresentation by raleghs adversaries that he had designedly withdrawn himself and that part of the fleet while essex himself incurred a most just censure throughout the whole fleet by making the high land of portugal and bearing in so close to the shore that he alarmed all the country to make defense against him afterward as the fleet being joined again was passing toward the south almost as far as the isles of bayon raleghs ship the warspite being then in the center of them on the   th of august broke her mainyard asunder in the very midst by the parrel essex discovered in his ship a desperate leak by which he had muchado to escape drowning here it was agreed that till raleghs ship should be repaired he might keep cruising about the height of the rock where they were to unite and pass the south cape yet the next morning before that reparation could be made raleigh had a message to attend essex with all speed that they might put in with the land which was impossible for ralegh to do being unable to work upon a wind as having but a foresail and mizen and the wind almost off the land besides if he could have made the land with that sail it was thought madness to put upon the enemies coast in that condition when if the wind should change to the west he must in want of his mainsail have yielded or perished so found himself necessitated to ply up and down for two days till the said fraction was mended in this distress there was no direction given for any other of the fleet to attend upon ralegh yet sir william brook in the dreadnought tarried with him also lord thomas howard very affectionately offered all the assistance he could give and several other of the sea captains voluntarily did the like but ralegh would admit of no more than three or four small men of war to accompany him and ordered the rest even of his own squadron to repair to the admiral so far was he from projecting a division of the fleet by entreating any to forsake essex and abide with him as it was afterward very falsely represented to incense essex against ralegh for contriving the frustration of their first resolved attempt and as ralegh himself when they met at the azores so satisfactorily made evident that the said imputation turned only to the shame of its contrivers  when ralegh had repaired the damages of the storm he here in with the coast making all the enquiry he could after essex and the fleet but could hear no tidings of them he sent into the isles of bayon and toward the south cape well knowing the earl could not then put into feroll or the groyne as was afterward colourably pretended he would have done had they united the wind being flat against him and the whole fleet having overshot that coast near  0 leagues before the mainyard of raleghs ship was broken and besides that they could not recover it again both those spanish prizes were wanting which only were to have been ventured in the service hereupon ralegh shaped his course to the rock which was appointed for the general rendezvous expecting not only with good reason to meet essex there but with great desire his own force being so small and the enemy as he heard out at sea with a powerful fleet yet those who could suspect ralegh would prefer a separation dangerous and disadvantageous as it was now would needs have had it thought there was much more reason for that suspicion when there came to ralegh at the rock near  0 sail more most of them his own victuallers and transports but the truth is that having lost essex during the storm in the bay and missed him also at the northcape they came hither according to their instructions where casually meeting with ralegh he held them together and conducted them to essex at the islands otherwise they had all returned home after they had failed at the south cape which was the third and last meeting place of some admiral to command them and of whom they would have failed since none of the fleet went so far southward  soon after he had determined in search of the fleet to pass on toward the southcape he was traversed by an english bark which assured him they had learned from an english man of war which had lately taken an indiaman that the adelantado was gone for the islands to convoy the indian fleet safe home this seeming very probable and no one suspecting that any of their countrymen would traitorously delude her majestys fleet with any false informations in a pursuit of this consequence ralegh earnestly besought the captain of the said bark to hunt after essex and apprise him of this intelligence but he answered in the hearing of the whole company that the captain who had taken that india man had already sent a letter to essex thereof ralegh doubting it might have miscarried or that none was sent commanded one of the small men of war attending upon himself with all diligence to seek out the fleet and make report of what they had heard this ship by good chance met with the fleet next day and delivered the news two days after ralegh received two letters from essex which somewhat taxing his absence and not writing required that he would presently follow him to the islands whereunto the earl said he was hasiening to find the adelantado not doubting but to give his mistress a better account of that service than he should yield his master  in passing to the islands ralegh was so much in danger of losing his mainmast that he was forced to send the ships in his company before because he thought essex might be in want of them if he should meet the enemy and if they had joined the fleet without ralegh who was princpially depended on in case of any engagement it would have strengthened the misconstructions that had been nourished against him but ralegh so speedily and effectually repaired his crazy mast and so briskly plied his sails that he overtook his consorts next day and on the  th of september they all made the island of tercera yet here could they meet with no news of the fleet though they enquired of an english merchant who had traded about these islands above six weeks and though it had passed that way but two days before by this merchant ralegh wrote into england to acquaint the state in what situation they were then passed on to st georges island where they found the weather exceedingly hot and were vexatiously becalmed for a day or two before they could get forward to gratiosa here as they coasted along on the  0th of september about midnight they saw a large and perfect rainbow by moonlight in the sape and bigness of those formed more commonly by the sun though in colors not so various but chiefly inclining to a pale or whitish flame this made the generality of the seamen expect some extraordinary tempestuous weather but it fell out on the contrary to be very calm and hot this rainbow by the light of the moon is the rather to be observed because pliny in his natural history speaking of meteors denies any rainbow to be seen but opposite to the sun and never in the nightseason yet tells us aristotle reports for a rarity that in his time there was a nocturnal rainbow seen but withal that it could only be at the full of the moon nevertheless in these parts they are very ordinary as well when the moon is not at full as otherwise for no longer than a week after this time ralegh and his company observed another lunary rainbow as they rode at anchor before flores and there could not be two full moons in seven days which makes it probable these islands were not known to the greeks and romans or those meteors not sufficiently observed by them the same night they also espied by the light of the moon then upon the border of the horison some sail of ships gliding toward the east of gratiosa at which ralegh hung out two lights for his company to follow him in chase of them but they not taking his course and the moon being soon after quite shadowed and intercepted by the earth he was left in darkness and solitude having lost all sight both of the newdiscovered ships and those of his own company till in the space of four days more a leisurely breeze of wind brought him after all these impediments to the rest of the fleet then gathered at the isle of flores  as soon as ralegh had descried the fleet he took his barge and with sir arthar gorges as also some other of the officers and gentlemen in his company went aboard the earl of essexs ship with whom they all nd and who seemed says gorges to be the joyfullest man living for our arrival protesting that he never believed we would leave him although diverse persuaded him to the contrary and acknowledged that he was sor for a letter which he had written by mr robert knolles into england against us promising presently to make a dispatch on purpose contrary to the former further when essex had fully satisfied himself that all the transports and victuallers which returned with ralegh had not been inveigled away by him and how commendably he had thus drawn them to the islands against their inclinations being most of them in great distress he opened himself to him in a very amicable and communicative manner he told him how he had spent the time of their separation wholly in ranging the seas to meet with the adelantado he acquainted him with the many conjectures and surmises that had been vented of his absence and withal named to him some of those men who had taxed him secretly with strange reports yet pretended to love him which he protested he never believed but thereby the better observed their scandalous and cankered dispositions in this manner did the earl of essex receive and welcome sir walter ralegh with the greatest kindness and familiarity as well as all the gentlemen of his company to the great dislike and heartburning of some who much envied that liking which of his own disposition essex bore to ralegh for though the earl had many doubts and jealousies buzzed into his ears against him yet i have often observed says gorges that both in his greatest actions of service and in the times of his chiefest recreations he would ever accept of his counsel and company before many others who thought themselves more in his favor it is true the earl of his own unperverted nature was a man prone to gracious and generous principles but no less easily blown up to prejudice and indignation against his real friends by his pretended ones whence we may conceive as sir arthur gorges has well observed upon giving an instance of his moderation and bounty to some of the islanders though he was endowed with many good gifts how it came to pass that he at last failed in the use of them  here as they lay before the isle of flores they held a council of war to conquer and possess or lay waste some of these islands they being the chief places of retreat and refreshment for the king of spains indian fleets by the treasures whereof his boundless ambition so much disturbed and so tyrannized over europe in this council the admirals and commanders had their charge allotted after the following manner essex and ralegh were to undertake the island of fayall the lord thomas howard and sir francis vere were to secure gratiosa the lord mountjoy and sir christopher blunt were to attempt st michaels and the netherland squadron was quartered to pike where grew the greatest store of wines therefore presumed no unwelcome portion to them and these places were the first resolved upon that they might afterward attack the tercera itself for raleghs arrival gave their resolution upon this stronger island a second life but it was first thought expedient to strengthen and supply themselves with whatsoever those weaker ones would afford and to this end the fleet was divided into four squadrons  but raleghs mariners having obtained leave to go ashore at flores to water and furnish themselves with such other necessaries as they wanted while he himself attended by several other of the commanders and gentlemen walked a mile or two into the island to stretch their legs and refresh themselves where they all dined in a little village the barelegged governor having caused such fare to be brought them as the country afforded which they very honorably paid for without offering them the least injury because the earl had before given them an indemnity under his own hand from all manner of violence when essex impatient to be in action all of a sudden and before the sailors could get their casks of fresh water aboard sent on the   th of september capt arthur champernon to tell them that the general was borne up for fayall meaning presently to take it in therefore required them to follow him instantly and though they should not overtake him yet to find him there as soon as they could and there they might supply their wants hereupon they hastened away with all the sail they could make after him but no general could they overtake the next morning they got sight of fayall and missed of essex also there to their great dissatisfaction he being six leagues nearer that island when he sent for them and set sail thither six or eight hours before them  being entered the road they beheld before them a very fine town pleasantly seated along the shore from whence the people upon sight of their ships began to pack away both bag and baggage their friars nuns other women and children they also sent away in carts and carriages so continued transporting all up into the country for two days together there was besides a strong fort at one end of the town and another on the top of a very high mountain near adjoining by nature very inaccessible and artificially fenced with flankers rampire and a ditch also six pieces of artillery and  00 spaniards in garrison not reckoning others quartered about the island they fired upon raleghs ships as he anchored in the road though without much damage and set a great red standard up in defiance before his eyes they sent moreover six companies with their colors to entrench upon the shore in order to oppose his landing however ralegh in his barge accompanied with sir arthur gorges and captain william morgan rowed close along the shoreside and by the high fort toward the town to acquaint himself with the most proper place for making a descent when essex should arrive from whence they were saluted with diverse musket shot which they very fortunately escaped having with them neither targets nor armor for their safeguard  upon these provocations and the want they grew in of those necessaries wherewith they were both lately hurried from accommodating themselves and promised they should be supplied here ralegh called a council of the captains and officers to consult about taking of the town if essex arrived not thinking it a shame to forbear so fair a prize so near at hand till they had carried all off especially since the enemy had begun the war upon them and so proudly dared them to their own defense further these bravadoes with the hopes of wealth in this goodly town and the ransom of houses and prisoners made all the mariners and soldiers not only ready to mutiny that they were so long restrained but reflect on their commanders as if this forbearance was the effect only of their fear and what made them the more eager was that they saw no likelihood of other benefit by this voyage than what was thus to be gotten ashore notwithstanding these murmurs and that they heard no news of essex in two days the council was divided and some of the captains who were his most flattering and servile dependants as sir guilly merrick sir nicholas parker and others were by no means for landing without his knowledge but ralegh with sir w broek sir a gorges sir w harvey and many other commanders and gentlemen of his own squadron were of a contrary opinion judging the general would repute them idlers and cowards to lie so long before so good a town with so many ships and men and do nothing but let them convey away their effects this was the general voice both of the land and seaforces yet the violent persuasions of merrick did so prevail that they agreed to delay the enterprise one day longer when if the earl did not come they all agreed to land together  now the wind tacking about somewhat unfit for the road they lay in ralegh and diverse of his squadron with many other of the ships after him weighed and coasted about the the point to the northwest side of the island some four miles further from the town than they were before and there let fall their anchors being a better road than the first as the wind sat but merrick with some five or six ships of his consorts would not advance with them they were now in the fourth day of their arrival before fayall and no general appeared but the prospect of a most inviting country full of little villages and fruitful fields which sharpened the general desire of landing to supply their want of victuals and especially of water wherewith they had not been recruited since their first setting out from plymouth therefore by agreement they manned out a barge a longboat and pinnace with  0 muskets and  0 pikes rather to guard themselves in watering than in expectation of any encounter from the town or forts on the other side of the island but they were no sooner ready to put off from the ships than they discovered six ensigns of foot and some dozen horsemen marching down speedily from the town and forts to meet them and made such haste that they soon possessed the trenches toward the shore where the english lay and where with brandishing swords and waving colors they stood daring them to a rencounter hereupon ralegh found it necessary to augment his force which brook harvey and other seaofficers readily supplied to the number of   0 men more then said ralegh to them seeing these spaniards and portuguese are so gollant to seek or follow and keep us from watering we will try our fortunes with them and either win our landing or gain a beating as ralegh then rowed along by his ships he was greeted by bret sidney white berry and other captains of the low country soldiers who called out and advised him to take them and some of their companies with him for if he ventured to make the shore only with mariners and his own attendants without their landsoldiers he might receive a discreditable repulse but ralegh excused himself saying he did not know for what service the earl might design them and therefore was resolved with his own company to make the descent and then should send for their recruits by which he would undertake to lodge them that night in the town and the next in the forts besides he was willing to make the attempt with those of his own squadron that neither the general nor his train should have cause to be ashamed of them for undertaking that in the face of their enemies which they durst not of themselves follow and perform  then ralegh having thus a party of   0 men not half the number of the enemy made forward and while some ordnance he had judiciously placed before him in pinnaces as close along the shore as they could lie were beating upon their trenches he rushed through or under them as fast as his oars could ply to the landingplace which was guarded first with a mighty ledge of rocks  0 paces long into the sea and afterward trenchd and flanked with earth and stone having only a narrow lane between two walls for their entrance but now as they approached still nearer to the shore the enemies shot flew down so thick upon them that not only several of the common men but of those who would before have passed for very forward and valiant leaders were much dismayed insomuch that ralegh who most gloriously approved himself no less their chief in courage than he was in command did not spare openly to rebuke them aloud with many reproachful words at last when he saw them still linger through consternation as much to their danger as their disgrace he commanded with a loud voice his watermen to row his own barge full upon the rocks and bade as many as were not afraid to follow him hereat some boats ran in with us says my author and out of them were landed mr garrett then a pensioner afterward earl of kildare sir w brook sir w harvey sir john scott captain henry thynne captain white captain arthur radford captain w morgan mr duke brook mr thomas rudgeway mr walter chute mr henry allen mr charles mackart and diverse other gentlemen so clambering over the rocks and wading through the water he made his way pellmell through all their fire with shot pike and sword up to the narrow entrance where he so resolutely pursued his assault that the enemy after a short resistance gave ground and when they saw his forces press faster and thicker upon them suddenly retiring they cast away their weapons and betook themselves to the hills and woods the like also did those who were entrenched higher and thus did he win this difficult and dangerous landing together with the trenches of the enemy a few of his men indeed were drowned and slain more hurt and a couple of longboats sunk yet was not his loss so considerable as to detract from the justice of those congratulations which were paid him by the officers of the low country forces when with some of their companies they arrived upon the island and found the footing he had won so strongly fortified and guarded  ralegh thus recrulted being now near  00 strong thought best to go through with the matter and prepare the town in readiness for essex therefore he appointed bret to the office of serjeantmajor directed the other captains to advance their colors marshal the companies and so in order marched to the town about four miles distant from the landingplace in their passage diverse of the enemy who had before braved them with the greatest insolence came with white napkins at the end of staves and voluntarily abased themselves to offices of the greatest servility there was indeed a way two miles about by which they might have passed to the town and avoided the high fort where the spaniards lay in garrison but ralegh considering the trouble of their march the sultry heat of the weather the hazards of delay and above all the necessity they were under of immediate supplies took the shortest course resolving to bring fort and town all into one days work thus at the head of about  0 gentlemen of the best rank ralegh led on the companies in a gentle regular manner full in the face of the fort having only his leadingstaff in his hand and no other armor on but his collar for which he was somewhat censured by his friends for when they came within reach of the fort they were shrewdly encountered with several fierce storms of great and small shot which came thundering down upon them from all parts of it wounding several among the rest there was one captain william morgan a brave old soldier in this march who being reproved by our author sir a gorges for coming to the field only in his doublet and hose without either armor or target answered that his flesh was of musket proof immediately after a musket ball struck him point blank upon his belly and with the force of its own blow fell flat at his feet leaving only a black spot or bruise upon his skin  thanks to the buckle that joined his girdle deserving to be reposited among those trophies in the temple of mars which witness he wants not one brother soldiers impenetrable suit of mail nor the sevenfold shield of another who can encounter his enemy behind the curtains only of a pair of proverbs attesting how little armor will suffice that is wellplacd and how much fortune favor the bold killing some and putting most of his men into disorder insomuch that ralegh himself with his little vanguard was no sooner passed and entered under the covert of their trenches and barricadoes at the declivity of a little hill but the rest composing the main body of his forces which till now that they found themselves under the mercy of the enemies fire advanced in good order begun to break their ranks and from marching fell to running on in a straggling and confused manner till they were under the walls and trenches almost as soon as their leader who came some twelvescore yards before them in a steady and deliberate march ralegh was somewhat moved to see this tumultuous and timorous course and more to think that the enemy saw themselves were the occasion of it therefore he cried out to bret berry and other captains demanding if these were the men that should have done him such service in landing and saved him from dishonor or this the manner of their low country troops to show such base cowardice at the first sight of an enemy and at the musket shot so far off from a fort the captains who were themselves brave enough knowing the truth would be the best apology answered that these companies who had behaved themselves with such irresolution were indeed men taken out of flushing and brill the cautionary towns so were raw soldiers who had ever lived in a safe garrison and seldom or never seen an enemy or encountered with shot in the field  being thus got under covert of the trenches and walls which the spaniards had abandoned and retired to their fortifications on the top of the hill ralegh commanded capt bret to appoint a sergeant or two with a few shot to go view and discover the way to the town which in many places lay open as well to the high fort here in the way toward it as to the other fort at the end thereof and where the ways were fenced they were still more dangerous it being with lowpiled walls of looseragged stones which ralegh justly suspected would increase rather than obstruct the mischiefs of their enemies artillery bret brought word of a general unwillingness in the lieutenants and sergeants to undertake this discovery so much under the command of the fort and hill and that the troops were rather desirous of slipping by in the most hasty dispersed and unobserved manner they could which ralegh would by no means suffer through consideration of their safety without urging the regard he had to their credit in this enterprise for being by this time wellinformed the island could raise  000 armed men and reasonably believing they would gather their greatest strength for the defense of their best town toward which he was now marching he concluded they would have it more in their power to defeat him advancing in little disorderly and scattered parties than in a regular united body bret did make some offer himself to go and survey these passages if he should be expressly commanded but indeed it was found he could not be wanted or spared among his own raw and unexperienced troops  when ralegh therefore saw all men so scrupulous of this undertaking and especially those garrisonsoldiers he told them that he would not offer that to any man which he would himself refuse that though it were not the duty and office of a chief commander to undergo so ordinary a service but what duly appertained to the inferior officers and soldiers and notwithstanding said he that i could therefore enforce others to do it they shall well perceive that i myself will do that which they dare not attempt wherein i am ashamed on their behalf that our general and we are thus abused in our opinion of these low country soldiers then he called for his cuirass and his cask and said he would both go view the way for them which they made so nice of as also the passages and ascents to the hilltop and as well as he could observe the strength and fortifications thereof for their better direction the next morning hereupon capt berry was very ready to go and earnestly desired me says our author to divert our rearadmiral from undertaking it and i thereupon continues he did openly dissuade him who commanded in chief from putting his own person to these inferior offices of hazard fitter for a lieutenant or sergeant than himself to perform knowing that all the direction as well of those troops as also of a whole squadron of the navy did at that time only rest upon him in the absence of the admiral and vice admiral notwithstanding he was obstinate therein as well in scorn of those who had refused as also indeed out of a desire to be better informed of the strength and fortifications of the high fort when i saw him resolved i told him that i would out of the love of a kinsman in particular and also out of an honest regard take such part as he did from whom i had received many kind favors and accompany him but not out of any great desire i had to go about a piece of work which consisted of much danger and little honor in the performance he thanked me for my offer but yet wished me not to go if it were against my will notwithstanding i accompanied him and so did some eight or ten more of our servants and followers but i say truly and so afterward it was much spoken of that there was not any one more of quality that did accompany him in that business  in this manner and with this number did ralegh in person go the only one it seems who despaired not of success to discover the ascents to the hill the cannon shot of the enemy and thereby the stones of the battered walls flying on every side thick about him all the while he still proceeded with an undaunted pace to compass this knowledge of the safest way by which he was to lead the rest though he perceived wounds and death dealt on either hand and his own danger at every step more unavoidable some of his company in the march were hurt and two had their heads taken from their shoulders sir arthur gorges had his left leg shot through with a musketball who without remembering any pain it gave him observes the bullet burnt both his silk stocking and buskin as if they had been singed with a hot iron i was then hard by the rearadmiral continues he who also was shot through the breeches and doubletsleeves in two or three places and still they plied us so fast with small shot that as i well remember he wished me to put off a large red scarf which i then wore being as he said a very fair mark for them but i not willing to do the spaniards so much honor at that time though i could have wished it had not been on answered the rearadmiral again that his white scarf was as eminent as my red and therefore i would now follow his example  having by this time made a sufficient discovery both of the way for his troops to pass as also of the avenues to the high fort on the mountain which he intended to attempt after he had secured the town capt berry with allen and some others advanced to him hereupon he sent some guides to capt bret with orders for him also to march up with the companies that they might unite before they came to the town because he there expected an engagement or at least some salley out of the fort at the end thereof which they must needs pass before they could get at the town and which seemed to threaten resistance being a very fine fortification all of stone work with curtain flankers and ditch very artificially cast but immediately upon raleghs approach with the body of his men the spaniards it seems abandoned it for when he entered it he found they were newly departed in like manner as he marched on he found the inhabitants had also forsaken the town and left him in possession of it with such wares and stores as could not suddenly be removed thus though with much danger indeed and some loss of about half a score men with the hurt of little above double that number ralegh made himself master in effect of the whole island which supplied him from his own experience with an example to confirm the assertion he afterward took occasion to maintain and which we have in part touched upon before alleging that a country cannot prevent an enemys fleet from landing its army without as good a fleet to oppose it and this example in his own summary account we have here subjoined as what may give the reader a double satisfaction both in confirming the veracity of that which has been here extracted thereof from sir arthur gorges and adding to the many other instances of raleghs modesty and restriction who could in the recital of this action be so much less particular in the brave steps he took to this victory with the dangers and difficulties he surmounted by sea and land than that honorable historian has been who was a witness of them  this town of which ralegh was thus possessed was called villa dorta as i find in linscthoen who also informs us the people were mostly of the dutch offspring yet using the portuguese language others who likewise describe it reckon that it contained even some years before this time at least  00 houses built all of sone with tiled roofs and disposed into fine streets besides a handsome church nunnery and friery interspersed with many pleasant gardens of delicate fruits and wells of fresh water insomuch that for bigness it has been compared to plymouth or yarmouth but in situation to dover and might probably now have been of as good advantage to sir walter ralegh as it was eight years before to the earl of cumberland had he not in compliment to the earl of essex obliged himself to so disadvantageous a delay in the conquest of it however because the town was unwalld and he was to expect if he lay there open and carelessly refreshing himself while his soldiers were scattered about in quest of provisions he might easily be surpised without some good orders and directions given before they fell to rest and repast he issued forth at his entrance a proclamation that none should straggle twentyscore yards from the town without leave of an officer and then go upon their guard with fit weapon and company he then made some strong barricadoes planted a good watch in proper stations and a strong corpse de guard in the marketplace that others might in safety bring together such booty as the inhabitants had left behind  thus having refreshed and reposed themselves all night the next morning being the   d of september even before break of day they discovered bearing with full sail toward the road of fayal the earl of essex and his fleet he having been all this while making a kind of wildgoose chase after indian fleets and the adelantado who it seems never stirred out to sea this year with other like uncertain adventures now sir guilly merrick sir christopher blount sir anthony shirley and some other fatal friends and cherishers of the earls infirmities soon interrupted by their aggravating and distorted representations all raleghs further intentions to secure the island they presently possessed his lordships head that ralegh had taken this opportunity to play over his parts and show the world how well he could act the conqueror only to steal honor and reputation from the general they knew the earls temper was as ready as tinder to catch fire at the least suggestion for as no man alive was a more passionate courtier of fame or more desirous to be reputed matchless for magnanimity and enterprise so none was more jealous of rivals than essex or could less endure that any man should obscure his glory how highly soever he might otherwise be in his favor but in diverse other disagreeable colors this gallant action was further disfigured to the earl as the contempt and violation of authority from whence they infused that the presumption of landing such forces without his lordships leave was not to be passed over without severe punishment and that it was fit a court martial should be called to censure the offense and breach of order and discipline in short the unpardonable crime was that raleigh dared to render himself more conspicuous than any body else and he had been less culpable had he been less successful they seeming rather willing to have endured blame for any ill success which might have occurred to him by their absence and restraint of aid than allow of any praise for his being victorious without them nay there were not wanting some among essexs commanders who would needs show the volence of their zeal for his lordship in such extremes as to throw out that ralegh was well worthy of losing his head for his labor all which might well inspire those solid and durable exposures which he has in several places made of such envious and insolent usage  essex thus exasperated spent all the forenoon in reprehending displacing and confining all the land captains and officers who accompanied ralegh whilst he expecting rather thanks than such a perverse interpretation of his services made ready his barge to go on board the general and guide him to land but being entered his ship he found all mens countenances estranged as he passed through them and when he came to his cabin the earl after a faint welcome began to accuse him with the breach of orders and articles ralegh answered he knew not wherein he had been guilty of such a breach essex replied there was an article that none should land any of the troops without the generals presence or his order ralegh desired leave to defend himself by those laws which himself as well as others had made and his lordship with the council of war had authorized then he should find that no misdemeanor had been committed for said he there is an article indeed that no captain of any ship or of any company if he be separated from the fleet shall land any where without direction from the general or some other principal commander upon pain of death but i take my self said ralegh to be a principal commander under your lordship and therefore not subject to that article nor under the power of the martial law because a successive commander of the whole fleet in her majestys letters patents your lordship and my lord thomas howard failing besides you agreed i should land at this island with you lordship whom i have attended these four days and finding that you came not though your were half a dozen leagues before me in your way thither i weighed anchor and could not but conclude both that you thought me strong enough to take this island and were gone yourself to take in some others yet i refrained so long from landing at sir guilly merricks entreaty that i heard my own company even at my back murmur and say that i durst not attempt it and to tell you the plain truth my intent at first was only to water till i saw them follow me in that braving manner which with our reputations we could not then shun and give over being already in our boats for that purpose for if i had intended the taking of the town i would never have removed so far from our first road which lay right before it as for those officers and gentlemen who had been committed ralegh desired they might receive no hard measure in his cause whatsoever his lordship conceived to be misdone he he must take it wholly on himself to answer being at that time commander in chief  with these and other arguments essex was so well pacified that he went ashore into the town and rested himself in raleghs lodging there ralegh invited him to supper and offered if he meant to call the matter further in question to claim no privilege or favor but would answer for himself more amply in the morning sir christopher blount taking the earls answer from him said he thought my lord would not sup at all to which ralegh replied that for his own appetite he might when he was invited disable it at his own pleasure but if the earl would stay he should be glad of his company in the mean time the lord thomas howard very nobly taking care that no disrespectful treatment should be offered to ralegh by the practice of his enemies dealt with essex to find how he stood resolved and the next morning assured ralegh that his lordship sought only some acknowledgment because the rest would think him a weak and tame commander if he had not satisfaction ralegh considering he had done nothing unjustifiable and very certain that he was successively in the commission for the whole command of the fleet therefore not subject to any corporal danger as also of the lord thomas howards sincere and honorable dealing came again in the morning to visit essex otherwise remembering the little trust that men ought to repose in such reconciliations and the strong malice borne him by others in greatest favor with his lordship had designed to betake him to his own squadron and so to have defended himself or forsaken the earl but the lord thomas after having given his honor with great kindness and resolution that he would make himself a party if any wrong or violence were offered contrary to his lordships promise persuading him to go and satisfy the earl ralegh took his counsel and all things after a little debate came to a calm and quiet conclusion  the promoters of this disturbance however thus disappointed of their end scrupled not to share in the benefits of this reproved victory by lodging and refreshing themselves not only that night but three or four days after in the goodly town aforesaid yet were they justly punished for their envy and ingratitude for had that time which they spent in carping and cavilling at raleghs conduct throughout this brave action been employed according to his measures in pursuing it the birds which thereby they suffered to fly out of their cage had well rewarded their unanimity in taking them and they would not have lost as now they had the ransom of so many spanish prisoners out of the high fort nor the spoil which they had conveyed out of the town for safety to that place so that instead of assistance to advance the profit of this conquest essexs arrival brought only means as far as in them lay to destroy the honor of it  after the army had plentifully regaled themselves with the best provisions the island would afford and the disgraced captains were received again into favor and command they hoisted sail having first in honor of their lost men made the town itself their funeral pile and carried all the artillery and other stores they found therein or in their forts to their ships on the   th of september they cast anchor at graciosa where the chiefs of the island coming on board the general submitted themselves with very acceptable humiliation and willingly brought such provisions as were required for their composition this homage of those people banished all thoughts in the earl of further repairing in that place the great charges he principally had created by this voyage for he seemed so charmed with submission as to have disregarded the advantages it might have yielded and fonder of having a power over his enemies than of making any effectual use of it when they came to st michaels they heard tidings of the indian fleet at which most joyful acclamations rung through all their ships within few hours after they encountered and took three spanish prizes bound from the havanna the greatest of them being about  00 tons burden was a very rich ship as well for the lading as the passengers in her and this if not the other two was taken by ralegh who being nearest gave chase caused her to strike and to yield these three ships especially the last were laden with cocheneal and other profitable merchandise besides the silver gold pearl civit musk ambergrease found among the passengers and acknowledged by the merchants in them to be richly worth above  00000 ducats when ralegh had enquired from the gallery of his own ship of those who had computed the value of these commodities and been satisfied it would at least amount to that sum he said although we shall be little the better for these rich prizes yet i am heartily glad for our generals sake because they will in great measure give content to her majesty so that there may be no repining against this poor lord for the expense of the voyage these ships made a discovery of forty sale of spanish indiamen whereof some were freighted with the king of spains treasure and it was reported that while three or four of the english fleet which were fallen among them were rifling one that foundered the rest escaped and recovered the tercera essex upon this mischance called a council of war and some of the colonels with other land officers made liberal professions of the daring feats they would attempt if boats pinnaces and men were allowed how vain and impracticable soever they seemed to the sea commanders for they offered with   00 men to take both that island and the forts but these knowing the difficulty of landing them with their artillery on so dangerous a place in so bad a season besides the strength of the fortifications so well furnished by this new arrival could not cordially and seriously give their consent but urged many reasons to the contrary yet when the lord thomas howard perceived this incompliance would be used as a handle at home for their losing the spanish fleet and treasure he told essex that if he was so forward to have it attempted both himself and sir walter ralegh were ready to venture as far as any of them and that they would undertake to spare  000 able men out of the fleet for the service but this second offer thus absolutely and solemnly made though of double the number cooled their courage upon a little deliberation who had made even the first and so the vapor was dispelled  hence they returned again to st michaels island which they had left upon the intelligence aforesaid and in this road essex with a great number of his officers coming on board raleghs ship hung out the flag of council wherein they considered about landing and taking of the fair town which lay so temptingly before their eyes being unwalled and having but a slight fort for its defense by the seaside essex was for landing all the companies immediately but ralegh desired that himself might first go and survey the place because the billows were here in some parts no less dangerous than where he had made the experiment at fayal the earl at first consented but as ralegh was putting off essex standing in his gallery with sir christopher blount called him back in great haste and said he would go himself as he was descending into his barge ralegh seeing him altogether unarmed except with his collar and sword called aloud to him and desired him to take his cosk and target of proof with him if he designed to approach the shore seeing so many muskets above  00 lying there on the rest to oppose him but essex answered that he would have none because he disdained to take any advantage of the watermen who rowed him for which our author censures him in my opinion says gorges though that answer much showed his valor yet became it not the place that my lord held for in truth a general ought not to be so adventurous and careless of himself upon every slight occasion nor to go unarmed to places of imminent peril homer describes the valiant heroes and brave leaders of the greeks to be best armed as achilles ajax etc  insomuch that their very arms are famous to these days the use whereof we make now scornful but they are no beaten soldiers in the wars who held these opinions for it is truly said that a great and wise general should die old and i have read that epaminondas was fined by his countrymen the tbebans for being too forward and serving in a battle unarmed though he won the victory  as he had before done sir walter ralegh however in viewing of those landingplaces essex and his officers kept cautiously enough beyond the reach even of culverinshot therefore no such temerity in leaving the armor behind thus after many offers and surveys made aloof says gorges the conveniences of that place for landing were excepted against  this descent being thus disliked it was resolved that ralegh should with all the great ships lie as near before the town of st michael as he could to keep them in continual alarm while essex in a pinnace of raleghs called the guiana with about  000 men in boats should by night convey themselves about six miles further than their first determined landing to the town called villa franca accordingly they all landed the next morning at this town without any manner of resistance while the fleet kept the other in such constant dread and confusion that they could not regard their neighbors to the end that the english army having secured those might the better fall on the back of these but in vain did the fleet look over the hills and plains in expectation of them for that other pleasant town of villa franca had so enchanted the army being full of fruits wines and fresh victuals that the commanders as well as their soldiers were content there to take up their quarters without further thoughts of st michaels town and for six days together lay feasting and carrying on board the wheat salt woad and other merchandise into certain private mens ships that followed the fleet for such purposes while ralegh lay thus at anchor there came into the road a ship of brasil laden with the woods of that name and of fernambuc with sugars as well as other merchandise and anchored full in the midst of the english fleet this ship as sir francis vere also informs us was taken by sir walter ralegh and her cargo when brought into england was very faithfully disposed of by our author gorges to defray the expenses of all the men in raleghs own ship to the number of  00 reckoning soldiers as well as mariners soon after a huge carrack of   00 ton burden and infinite wealth says gorges being laden with the riches of the east and west came bearing in with all her sails also among them whom she mistook for the spanish armada for the king of spain s men of war when he made fleets were compounded of shipping of diverse nations and therefore more difficultly distinguished from ours sir walter ralegh in his discourse touching a war with spain and our protection of the netherlands has discovered many other disadvantages in the spanish fleets of these times through this medley of shipping whereof they were composed as the diversity of conduct and swiftness in them whereby they could not either assail or defend in gross as the english or dutch could also the confusion among their mariners of so many different countries and consequently languages so as not to understand directions and take them in general or even mistake them to the loss of their ship besides being of such strange nations unconcerned in the quarrels they were forced into they fought with their hands but not their hearts and desired liberty rather than victory see raleghs three discourses  vo   0  p        which at that time consisted of english and holland bottoms besides a great galleon before named and other spanish vessels they had taken at sight of this carrack ralegh gave orders throughout his fleet to take in all their flags also that none should weigh anchor fire a gun or put off a boat without leave but as she was bearing in one of the holland squadron contrary to direction and to an discretion suddenly weighed anchor hoisted top sail and as she approached made two or three shot at her whereupon perceiving her mistake she nimbly changed her course at which instant the wind changing also so that he could not escape outward she with the help thereof and with the fear of falling into our hands says gorges run herself a ground close under the town and fort here finding ralegh follow her and her danger inevitable she discharged her men in the boats that flocked about her with some of her wares and was then instantly set on fire in many places at once ralegh and his men still pursued to board her and prevent her loss though not without great danger in his rowbarge as he was the surge being very outrageous but by then he could get up to her she was all over thunder and lightning her ordnance discharging from every port and her whole hulk masts cordage and furniture sunk overrun with such a thorough yet distinct and unconfusd blaze as represented the figure of a ship more perfectly in fire than could be done by any painter with all his art and colors and when she was consumed even to the surface of the water she exhaled as her last breath such clouds from her spicy entrails as for a great way and for many hours perfumed the air and coast around had the army then been at st michaels town as was expected it might have secured this ship before she could have disembarked her men or if it had terrified her back to sea she must have been taken by the fleet and then the treasures she contained with those in this town might probably have reimbursed the charges of their voyage since our author laying this loss upon the said landforces thought it so much to be lamented that they were not to be excused  neither essex nor his army being heard of in all this time ralegh was in a consultation about drawing up the fleet toward him when he perceived the earls ship by her flag turning out from the point of villa franca then ralegh taking capt morgan in his barge rowed to him and the same night sent the captain back with directions in the generals name to command all the fleet to weigh and come to that town it much grieved the mariners to see the unprofitable measures which were thus taken and that they must relinquish the advantages they might have made of the town before which they lay when the fleet was got up to the army at villa franca a general command was given that all the companies should repair to their respective ships for the time of year approached that the winds and waves began to rise too high for them to ride on those coasts any longer so they left this town also entire upon what considerations our author knew not but thought the woadmongers and cornmerchants might be most likely to resolve the question  on the  th of october they set sail for england and after three or four days were violently tossed about and dispersed in a most tempestuous sea raleghs ship was near being stemmed by the shock she received from another that was driven against her whereby she became so leaky that he had much ado to keep her above water he was further in such great distress for want of drink that sir arthur gorges proffered one of the victuallers six chests of sugar for six hogsheads of fresh water but could not obtain it insomuch that they were forced to set their great stills on work to furnish themselves in the best manner they could during this storm it is also observed many sorts of birds flew into his ship and the dove that came among them was looked upon to presage the calm that ensued two days after when they began to meet again they descried at a great distance the earl of essex accompanied with only two little barks who about a week before was attended with  0 sail of good ships  after hailing and saluting one another they consulted with their masters and pilots about the best course homewards wherein they of raleghs ship varied much from those who guided the earls and though essex had the directions of john davis a navigator of much experience and repute who could have carried them without error to any distant parts of the world yet in conducting the ships home to their own coast did he strangely fail in his pilotage and conjecture for the sleeve however all followed the admiral and when he thought he was not far from the entrance of the channel all hands fell to sounding for ground and at last found it though indeed i saw few the wiser thereby says our author or the more assured of the coast this sounding of ours so much in practice continues sir arthur gorges and yet many times bringing no great certainty makes me call to mind an odd conceit and speech of a spanish prisoner which the general gave me in this journey he was a gentleman a soldier and of late years traded to the west indies with whom i one day talking and discoursing of their voyages wherein he was very well experienced he told me that in their navigation from the indies they sought out spain in a more certain and gallant manner than we did england for said he we seek out our coast aloft with our eyes by the heavens by the sun or stars and with the use of art and instruments which seldom or never fails but you said he that seek for england when you are forced to run into narrow seas are forced for your surest directions like men blindfold to search under the water and scrape with lead and tallow to the bottom for banks sands and shallows as if you would rake hell for instructions to find out the channel which you call the sleeve and yet for all your soundings are oftentimes mistaken i answered him indeed it was true that our humility taught us to go by the ground whereas their pride led them to gaze above the clouds and thereby so dazzled their eyes that they often stumbled upon those men of war which now used as well to sound the spanish pocket as the english sleeve exeept the skilful master of ralegh s ship old broadbent who knew it to be the banks of scilly but there was no convincing of essex so all followed his erroneous light yet ralegh kept at some distance behind all night long at break of day though it was close and foggy he perceived how providentially he had escaped destruction in the dark and dangerous passage he had made close by those fatal rocks called the bishop and his clerks soon after he also discerned essex and many with him about three leagues before bearing in with all their sail northeast instead of east and by north full upon the sands of the welsh coast on which in that gloomy weather he had certainly stuck and perished had he held on a little longer and had not sir a gorges who was then upon the latter watch ralegh being retired to rest forced the mastergunner of his ship to discharge a warningpiece three or four times much against his will and that of the master himself who contrary to all duty and humanity said they deserved to taste the peril of their own wilfulness having brought themselves and all the fleet clearly out of their way into such danger  upon this admonition essex with all his train soon tacked about and afterward confessed his error with much ado they beat up to double the cape of scilly and entered the sleeve ralegh by this time was shot along the northside of cornwall for his ship was so crazy and his provisions so scanty he durst not put again to sea but stood along the coast and that night anchored before st ives where he found the cornish people all in alarm several spanish caravals and flyboats which lay there having made some descents by stealth and put them into great fright and confusion for essex because he met not with the adelantado had both believed and reported into england that he never stirred out to sea this year whereas indeed while the strength of the english navy lay before the islands he had set out with a puissant fleet for the invasion of england and these lesser vessels which were sent before did here attend his coming but that storm which so roughly scattered the english dispersed this spanish armada utterly disabled for the intended enterprise ralegh arriving at this juncture gave great joy to this part of the kingdom and being landed he immediately took such order for the safeguard of the county whereof he was her majestys lieutenant as soon dispelled the fears of its inhabitants then having supplied his ship with proper necessaries he sent her round to the fleet and she was paid off at bristol with the profits that arose from one of the prizes he had taken beforenamed had as good an account been given of the other prizes this expedition for all the casualties and oversights which happened in it would have returned her majesty double the charge she had been at in setting it sourth  ralegh took his journey to plymouth where a commission came down from the state to lord thomas howard lord mountjoy himself and sir f vere with moneys for repairing victualling and sending about the fleet to chatham and for maintaining  000 low country soldiers which were now quartered along the coast of cornwall and afterward sent into ireland essex in the mean while posted away to london but whatever advantage he might have in first shaping out the story of their adventures to the queen it little availed him for sir francis soon after arriving also at court understood his lordship was retired to his house at wansted in great coffeehouse for the queen was so incensed against the earl that she laid the whole blame of their evil success on his lordship both for not burning and spoiling the spanish fleet at feroll and missing that which came from india vere says he justified his lordship and laid the blame upon those who deserved it with such earnestness that the standersby her majesty then walking in the garden at whitehall might hear him insomuch that he quieted the queen as he tells us who then discoursed with him of the earls humors and ambition and at last construed all so graciously that she fell into commendation of him so that he soon after came to court but he staid not long there nor with any ease or content so insupportable was it to find cecil made master of the wards the lordadmiral howard created earl of nottingham for his services against the spanish invasion and at cadiz and now raleghs actions at the islands esteemed also more considerable than his own though indeed by the fewer number for the populace were easily led to believe the late disappointment of essexs great expectations was owing to raleghs regard of his own glory more than that of his country whereby ralegh lost their opinion even though victorious against their enemies while essex was sure to return with triumph however he miscarried in his attempts and was always received by them with such joy as if his great fleets and armies came laden with sufficient spoil and conquest if they only brought him safe home again still both enjoyed a liberal share in the queens favor but it only ratified the veneration of the multitude to one and their disaffection to the other yet was their esteem more fatal to essex at least more speedily so than their prejudice to ralegh however the queen was little influenced with their partiality to either till essex too zealously cultivated that which so unreasonably increased in his favor for she loved her people without jealousy nor was offended at his being the darling of their eyes till she found him inclined to be the darling of their hearts and as for the blame which camden says they now laid on each other of the late misadventures and which he informs us grew to a more open rupture it seems to have fallen most upon essex and that raleghs conduct was approved because essex was never after trusted with the command of any naval expedition but ralegh was yet whatever misconduct in others ralegh might be now driven to object in his own defense his generosity to essex and some of his followers whom he might have laid it upon many years after their death when there was little fear of being controverted is so much above most of theirs to him while they were alive that having then occasion to mention this voyage he does not drop the least inuendo against any of them but ascribes their disappointments in it to the most unblameable cause  before ralegh could well arrive i think at london to give an account of this expedition the parliament was met at westminster for we read that the queen went thither in an open chariot all covered overhead canopywise with silver tissue and begun the sessions on the   th of october this year ralegh making but a short stay in town went to his seat at sherbourn of which he must have had but little enjoyment for two or three years past toward the latter end of november following we find mr adrian gilbert now a burgess for bridport in dorsetshire obtained license of the speaker that he might retire to his brother sir walter ralegh in that county for the benefit of his health about a month afterward that is on the  0th of december we meet with ralegh in the house for what place returned i find not and that day the parliament was adjourned till the   th of january when they met again ralegh appears frequently in committees upon several bills of the greatest consequences that were then read as that against lewd and wandering persons pretending to be soldiers or mariners another for an act to increase people for the service and strength of the realm one to explain an act for the maintenance of the navy one for paying the queens debts one for erecting houses of correction and punishment of rogues vagabonds and sturdy beggars besides many others whose titles are more proper to be sought in the parliamentary journals of this reign than here barely to be recited for the clerk of this house seeming to have melted down most of the speeches in this session for brevity into a narrative of its proceedings little or nothing of sir walter raleghs arguments is to be particularly extracted  the parliament being dissolved on the  th of february ralegh seems not to have resided long in town for soon after some regulations being made for the public good of those people over whom he presided by his offices of power in the west of england we find him celebrated for his exercise thereof among them as a very worthy patriot in several instances the lord burghley is mentioned in one of them who died about six months after the said parliament broke up that is to say in august      therefore we must here relate it as occuring before this time it concerned the restoration of certain manors to their ancient tenure in cornwall for there are    appertaining to that duchy which took or renewed their holdings as they call it every seven years of certain commissioners for near three centuries past whereby the tenants reckoned a kind of inheritable estate accruing to them but notwithstanding this long prescription a bold and busy person in these times getting an exchequerlease of one or two such tenements called the whole right in question but failing of success another soon after resumed the broken title and prosecuted it even to a nisi prius hereupon the tenants deputed certain gentlemen among whom was the author of this passage richard carew of anthony esquire one of the deputy lieutenants of the county to repair to london with a petition to the said lordtreasurer burghley who calling to him the chancellor and barons of the exchequer found besides this long continuance and the importance thereof as touching the ruin of above  000 inhabitants that her majesty possessed no lands which yielded her so fair a benefit as these in rents fines heriots and other perquisites these reasons found favorable allowance but did not procure an effectual remedy till the said gentlemen became supplicants to her majesty in person who then having been prepared it seems by raleghs applications and interest testified her dislike of the attempter and expressly ordered the cessation of his attempt for says this author herein we were beholden to sir walter raleghs earnest writing who was then in the country also to the advice of sir henry and the solicitations of mr w killegrew another example of his zealous affection for the ease and advantage of these people under his jurisdiction appears in his lightning them of a certain burdensome tax which carried many other inconveniences with it for as the products and commodities in those western parts had been anciently very much oppressed with tributes to the earls of cornwall whereby the condition of a cornish inhabitant and a french peasant differed very little so latterly while ralegh was lieutenant of that county there wanted not some who through favor at court and plausible representations to her majesty did in part revive the same and under pretext of restoring a rent decayed ever since the ninth of king henry ii to the pretended detriment of the crown procured letters patent that none should salt dry or pack any fish in devonshire or cornwall without their license or warrant the ill consequences whereof grew so apparent as being what would have made that patentee an absolute disposer of all the western shipping and traffic with their sea and landdependants that the cornish justices whereof mr carew aforesaid was one made suit to the privy council for redress and through the never failing forwardness and backing of sir walter ralegh obtained a revocation thereof here we may also add raleghs good offices the two following years for freeing the inhabitants of these parts from those heavy impositions with which the trade and manufacture also of their tinworks were very much embarrassd these impositions were occasioned by the merchants and usurers who advanced money to the tinners upon whom their encroachments were now grown so exorbitant that ralegh was importuned to revive the privilege of preemption founded on that clause in the charter of king edward i allowing them to vend their tin to their best behoof nisi nos ipsi emere voluerimus it had been attempted by others before him who alleged many reasons how it might prove advantageous not only to her majesty but the country and prejudicial to none but those extortioners who practiced a far worse kind of preemption when any western gentleman says mr carew wants money to cesray his expenses at london he resorts to one o the tin merchants to borrow some but shall as soon wrest the club out of herculess fist as one penny out of their fingers unless they give bond for every  0 l so taken in loan to deliver  000 pound weight of tin at the next coinage which shall be within two or three months or half a year at farthest at which time the price of every thousand will not fail to be at least    perhaps    pounds yea and after promise made must be driven with some indignity to make three or four errands to his house before he shall get the money delivered thus some one merchant will have  00 pounds out beforehand reaping thereby a double commodity both of excessive gain for his loan and of assurance of being served with tin for his money this they say is no usury forsooth because the price of tin is not commonly known before hand for once only within these    years on purpose to escape the penalty of the law they brought it a little under  0 l the thousand but if to take above fifty in in the hundred be extremity whatsoever name you list to give it this in truth can be no other than cutthroat and abominable dealing survey of cornwall p    b    but though this means of redress was by those persons hotly begun and a reasonable price offered it soon cooled again till it received a new life in michaelmas term      for then the cornish men being in london were called before the principal lords of her majestys council and the matter was there debated by sir walter ralegh in behalf of the country against those advocates deputed for the merchants who had promoted this suit and he brought it to such a conclusion that articles were signed indeed it did not immediately take effect yet it seems the privilege was afterward invested in ralegh and that he put his power in execution in november the year following he held a court at lostwithiel the usual place for stannary causes where having signified her majestys pleasure for a new tax of six pounds on every thousand weight of tin that should be transported besides   l    s already payable he told them also that her majesty had been prevailed on so far to disengage them from dealing with the merchants and usurers that she would disburse  000 l in loan to the tinners for a years space and was contented to be repaid in tin and lastly what appears totally to have excluded those merchants from the exercise of their impositions is that by the time of the ensuing parliament ralegh appears to have had the power of preemption granted him because in a speech of his having justly maintained his title thereto from the charter beforementioned he yet no less generously offers to resign it as indeed he not long after voluntarily did if those who had privileges of far less ancient establishment would follow his example  but to return a little into the more open and public current of action we must here observe that king henry iv of france having about the end of the last parliament informed the queen of england by an ambassador that he had held some conferences with the spanish ministers about a peace but would come to no conclusion without her consent and that of the united states her majesty sent some commissioners over and while they were negotiating this business in france she had the argument very closely debated in her council at home here essex was one of those who would by no means listen to any manner of accommodation and while the matter was upon the carpet was so expeditious as to produce a formal apology in writing for his reasons it being dated in      and written before the king of spains death in the beginning of september the same year yet upon this topic there ensued a warm dispute says camden between the queen and essex as also upon her choosing some able minister to superintend the affairs in ireland she looked upon the earls uncle sir william knolles as a proper person for that charge essex preferred sir george carew perhaps on purpose says camden to get rid of him and when the queen would not be persuaded to approve his choice he quite forgetting all duty turned his back upon her in a contemptuous manner the queen unable to bear his insolence dismissed him her presence with a box on the ear the fury this threw the earl into is better conceived than expressed but having with his hand on his sword told the queen he would not have taken such a blow from her father he retired from court the lord keeper egerton sent him a prudent and pacifying letter in which among other wholesome motives to submission and complacency he says in this course you hold if you have any enemies you do that for them which they could never do for themselves while your friends you leave to scorn and contempt the earl returned a long and passionate answer as camden calls it in which it appears he had also suffered some imprisonment and wherein he makes this reply to those objections in this course do i any thing for my enemies when i was present i found them absolute and therefore i had rather they should triumph alone than have me attendant upon their chariots or do i leave my friends when i was a courtier i could sell them no fruit of my love and now i am a hermit they shall bear no envy for their love to me but the lord keeper soon brought him out of his hermitage and he was in a little time readmitted into the queens favor however his friends according to camden were apt to date his ruin from this unlucky circumstance and indeed it hence appears he had no enemies so great or who so much conspired to his fall as his own passions his unreasonable expectations of an absolute conformity to his own will and impatience to behold any body aspire to distinction who did it not through his patronage and protection of this he gave a most notorious example about this time in which he made ralegh a public object of his opposition though it ended in his own disgrace and his relapse into the queens displeasure which he might have prevented had he kept his word to the lord keeper and suffered ralegh to have triumphed alone for during this reconciliation or last blaze essex made with any credit at court this memorable contest seems to have been promoted by him at the martial exercises performed on the queens birthday which was the   th of november  these martial exercises were the justs or tournaments wherewith the most active nobles and cavaliers of those times celebrated the queens birthday every year in the tilt yard near her palace at whitehall here her majesty was commonly herself a spectator of them with her attendants of both sexes as likewise all the foreign ambassadors and a numerous concourse besides both of the court and city history has not been very particular of raleghs appearance at those assemblies as by what color or impresses he distinguished himself with what success he ran the carreers or what favors he bore away but as upon all other public occasions he made a most rich and splendid figure so we find upon these days of triumph none surpassed him in military bravery i have somewhere read of his curious fine armory and as i remember that part of it is or was preserved in the tower of lodon but it is more apparent that probably for some of these grand entertainments he either made himself or was presented by his royal mistress with a suit of armor all of solid silver for there are still in being not only ancient paintings representing him about this part of her reign in that glittering and warlike habiliment but mention is also made in some writings of his being thus armed at all points and shining in those polished plates of silver yet who were his competitors and what his success in these robust exercises there is little i fear remaining to satisfy us more than those dark and dispersed hints of that extraordinary opposition or contention which essex raised against him about this time as was observed and this being the original or copy of a like contrivance practiced not long before or after it in france by marshal biron as i remember to have read may from thence and the corresponding testimony of an author whose credit and intelligence are not to be doubted be presumed to have happened in the following manner  about the time that essex by other like instances of his incurable humor to monopolize the multitude fell into or confirmed the queens displeasure he had by some of his followers learnt that sir walter ralegh with a very gallant train gorgeously accoutred was to make his appearance the next tilting day in orange color plumes hereupon essex provided a much more numerous cavalcade and decked them out exactly in raleghs colors then the earl himself appearing at the head of all armed cap apee in a complete suit of orangecolour not only passed for the sole knight or champion of that distinction by drowning all distinction in sir walter ralegh but thereby incorporated him and his train only as so many more of his own esquires pages and other retinue or servants who made up the parade upon these ocsions the earl of clarendon certainly points at this malignant stratagem where speaking of those dangerous indiscretions which were the harbingers of essexs ruin he mentions among them his glorious feathertriumph when he caused  000 orangetawney feathers in despite of sir walter ralegh to be worn in the tilt yard even before her majestys own face but it must have been somewhat surprising to see them enter the lists and orangetawney running against itself yet the earls success which is also come to light seems not to have been much regretted being so agreeable to the merit of usurpers insomuch that it proved raleghs feather triumph in the conclusion for though the lord bacon might have reason not to mention the earls name where he tells us a gentleman who came to the tilt all in orangetawney and ran very ill came again the next day all in green and ran worse yet another author instead of this gentleman names essex and goes on as the lord bacon does with observing that one of the spectators hereupon asking why this tilter who seemed to be known in both habits changed his colors another answered surely because it may be reported that there was one in green who ran worse than he in orangecolour  such like disturbances and ill blood as these contests must have bred might well make the queen weary of having essex any longer about the court and desirous of removing him to some employment where he might more commendably exercise his martial qualities a good occasion offered itself in ireland where tir oens rebellion had now overspread almost the whole kingdom a consultation was therefore held for sending over the fittest person to suppress it the lord mountjoy was first proposed but essex himself made exceptions against his want of experience and activity alleging ireland required a person of the first rank who was an old general and considerable for honor interest and estate to gain him respect and influence there by which camden thinks he would have recommended himself and adds that when the queen therefore resolved on essex he slightly refused it advising her to some abler person though continues that historian he had an objection ready against any person she should have have named notwithstanding this authority and that essexs smooth tongued adversaries were for lending spurs to the ambition that wanted a bridle he seems to me by a letter of his own genuine style in prose and verse to the queen at his going over in the end of march      to have looked upon the government of that kingdom as the most irksome kind of banishment and to have entered upon it with the utmost aversion to the queen from a mind delighting in sorrow from spirits wasted with passion from a heart torn in pieces with care grief and travel from a man that hates himself and all things else that keep him alive what service can your majesty expect since any service past deserves no more than banishment and proscription into the cursedst of all slands it is your rebels pride and succession must give me leave to ransom myself out of this hateful prison out of my loathed body which if it happen so your majesty shall have no cause to mislike the fashion of my death since the course of my life could never please you  happy he could finish forth his fate in some unhaunted desert most obscure from all society from love and hate of worldly folk then should he sleep secure then wake again and yield god ever praise content with hips and haws and brambleberry in contemplation passing out his days and change of holy thoughts to make him merry who when he dies his tomb may be a bush where harmless robin dwells with gentle thrush your majestys exiled servant robert essex     his conduct in it was answerable to the expectations of judicious men and one of his own servants who attended him thither says it was his blackest employment that ireland was ordained to be the sepulcher of his father and the gulf of his own fortunes  about four months after essex was thus disposed of there were great apprehensions in england of an invasion but from what quarter is not well distinguished  000 soldiers were suddenly raised to guard the city and queens person chains were drawn across the streets of london watches set and lights hung out at every mans door for above a fortnight by sea    or    ships of the royal navy were fitted out with wonderful speed under the command of the lord thomas howard as admiral in the elizabeth jonas and sir walter vice admiral in the arkroyal whether occasioned by any mistrust the english and spaniards had of one another or a policy held on both sides to make peace with sword in hand my author does not resolve but is sure the preparation on both sides was very great as if one expected an invasion from the other and yet it was generally conceived not to be intended by either but that our fleet had only relation to the earl of essex then in ireland as if he had some desperate design to try his friends in england and to be revenged of those he thought his enemies however it was the care and cost was not so great as necessary for it was known that the adeantado had drawn both his ships and galleys to the groyne which was not usual but upon some action intended for england or ireland and seeing we were not to be surprised he diverted them afterward to a different use another benefit that arose to the nation by putting it into this sudden posture of defense was the great dexterity and expedition wherewith it was taught to spring into arms for the incredible speed and order of the commanders in raising such a land army and fitting out such a royal navy was so admired both by spain france and holland that all foreigners confessed her majestys deeds in war were not heretofore more dreadful to her enemies than now only her preparations for it insomuch that it is said an envoy was sent by the archduke from brussels with overtures of peace though they did not then succeed whether a designed invasion from spain was hereby blown over or her majesty was better satisfied about the earl of essex we find not but she commanded her fleet home after it had been about a month at sea  near a month after this essex returned privately out of ireland with some of his choice friends one whereof named sir christopher st lawrence offered to murder the lord gray whom they met upon the road and to dispatch secretary cecyll when they came to court but essex would not encourage so base an act the queen was now at nonsuch hither essex hastened to present himself on his knees before her in her privychamber early in the morning and when her majesty least dreamt of him says camden who adds that she entertained him with some marks of her grace and favor though not with that freedom he used to find the queen indeed ordered essex to his apartment and there to continue as camden goes on for the earl had not only disobliged her before but now given fresh provocation by leaving ireland without her permission and for shuffling up a truce there which might be broke at a fortnights warning whereas he might have made an effectual composition with the rebels and was empowered to give them a general act of indemnity the excuses he offered before the council were so unsatisfactory and his behavior so contemptuous that the queen thought proper to commit him to custody but appointed it to be in the lord keepers house rather than a common prison chiefly to obstruct the infusions of his pernicious adherents to whom he was so infatuated that he could not relinquish them though one of the objections which would be raised against him was by his own hand presupposed to be the leaving of that kingdom in such an unsettled posture and returning into this with such a pack of swordsmen at his heels  while essex was thus in restraint commissioners were sent over to bulloigne to negotiate the peace with spain this was in may   00 and about the same time we find sir walter ralegh was also sent with the lord cobham upon an embassy concerning the same into flanders their business was kept very secret yet albert archduke of austria and governor of the netherlands having charged the queen of england it seems with relieving the hollanders and being likely to take some umbrage at so many persons of considerable rank going over volunteers to prince maurice as the lord of northumberland lord rutland and others secretary cecyll wrote to the said commissioners at bolloigne that if the archduke should object in the like manner to cobham and ralegh they were to return answer that these had no charge nor carried either horse or men except some half dozen of their own attendants and finding the queen so resolved to have a peace if good conditions could be had they obtained leave with importunity to see that one action then expected before they might despair of seeing any more of the like kind in her majestys time thus much of this matter we have in a letter of secretary cecylls to those commissioners in another written by sir henry neville who was one of those commissioners to mr winwood he mentions it as a report that cobham and ralegh were gone over upon pretext to see the camp and siege of fort isabella near ostend before which prince maurice lay but thinks they had some other end and that in england there was some alarm taken at these matters although he was not worthy to know it the said sir henry in another letter to mr winwood says that the journey of cobham and ralegh was not upon curiosity only but that they carried some message to prince maurice it seems which did no harm and that he would reveal the particulars when he was better informed of them these three letters were written in july this year and in the first of them we perceive ralegh was returned into england by the fourteenth day of the said month  when he arrived at court the government of jersey was it seems vacant by the death of sir anthony son of sir amias paulet the queen had many addressors for this preferment but she thought none so worthy of it as sir walter ralegh about six weeks after that is in the latter end of august his patent was passed with grant of the manor or lordship of st germain in the said island and all the lands and tenements therein there is a learned inhabitant of this island who in his curious and exact history of it giving us a succession of the governors says sir walter ralegh came in after the paulets the year only before his royal mistress queen elizabeth died and was attainted the first year of king james so that we were soon bereaved of the happiness we promised ourselves under so excellent a person his bare name in the list of our governors does honor to the island yet as the same author further observes out of the said patent when sir walter raleigh himself had this government given him by queen elizabeth she struck off  00 l a year from it which she took into her own disposal and made that great man so renowned for his eminent services to her and to the whole nation be contented with the remainder  essex had now been called before the council at the lordkeepers where for the matters laid to his charge he was suspended from some of his offices but the course of penitence and resignation which he held for a while gave great hopes after he had obtained his liberty that he would recover himself also at court till his creatures blew him up again with their poisonous counsels and led him to expect not only a restoration to favor but with unreasonable interest insomuch that he neglected the queens pardon because it came not accompanied with a new grant of his lease for the farming of sweet wines as a noble author observes who adds if ever that uncouth speech fell from him of the queen which is delivered to us by one who was then much conversant in the secrets of the court that she was as crooked in her disposition as in her carcass all my wonder at his destruction is taken from me after this speech the queen did as good as deny him the wine licenses aforesaid as camden relates then essex threw himself open to all ill impressions renewing the project he had begun in ireland of removing by force his enemies at court he curried favor with king james in scotland by several respectful letters wherein he labored to prejudice the king against those who had any influence in the english court and was very particular in acquainting him with the interest of his adversaries as one of whom he failed not to set forth sir walter ralegh with the formidable power he had in the west of england and now again in the isle of jersey that cobham was warden of the cinque ports lord burghley president of the north and sir george carew president of munster in the south of ireland that those were places commodious for the spaniards to land and these persons well affected to the king of spain and altogether with the lord treasurer admiral and secretary steered the helm of government then he practiced with the said king to send ambassadors into england to press a public declaration of his title to the succession prepares instructions for that purpose still instancing the exorbitant power of his enemies their disaffection to the king of scots and great veneration for the infanta these proceedings were outwardly varnished over all this while with the gloss of conscience and religion he won over the puritans and their preachers to his party commiserated the afflicted condition of the papists retained a crew of desperados to guard his house and left none uncountenancd who had nothing to hope for but changes and revolutions  thus these ill humors kept gathering till sunday the  th of february following and then broke out as may be seen at large in our histories of these times at court the guard was doubled being apprisd of this eruption and the morning it happened sir walter ralegh sent out of particular kindness to sir ferdinando gorges one of essex s adherents and governor of plymouth fort to come in all haste to him at durhamhouse to speak with him and as the more private way that he would come by water gorges in the manuscript he writ to vindicate himself from the imputation of betraying essex by this meeting avers that he advertised his lordship of this message and that upon council the earl was willing he should go but directing him to appoint his meeting with ralegh upon the thames and not to land at durham house also to take with him a guard for securing his return the conference that passed between them as gorges relates it was only this when sir walter raleghs boat came to me he being all alone and i having two gentlemen he told me that he had sent for me to admonish me to make all haste out of the town down to my charge there being a warrant out for the sending me to the fleet for his kind advertisement i gave him thanks but told him withal because i knew the present occasion would soon discover itself that it came too late for i had engaged myself in another matter he further inquiring of me what it was i told him there were  000 gentlemen who had resolved that day to live or die free men he protested unto me he heard not of it until that morning but did not see what they were able to do against the queens authority my answer was it was the abuse of that by him and others which made so many honest men resolve to seek a reformation thereof his reply was that no man is without a color for his intent and advised me to look to myself and to remember my duty and allegiance i answered that i knew not any man who did not more respect his allegiance than his life as the end would make apparent and thus we parted he to the court and i to essex house in the confession made by this gorges eight days after that of their insurrection abovenamed before some of the privy council it appears sir christopher blount had persuaded him to murder or seize sir walter ralegh at this meeting upon the water for not doing either gorges apologizes in the manuscript aforesaid after this manner if it be demanded of me why i did not then take sir walter ralegh first it was not a matter i ever proposed though many persuaded me so to do secondly i never held it an act fitting among men to betray any that repose trust in us and he putting himself into my hands with what honesty could i have avowed so barbarous a deed unless he had given me the first occasion by violent deeds or unkind words for either of which i was both resolved and prepared and at my return i delivered unto my lord what had passed between sir walter ralegh and my self which he received with applause as may be testified by those who were present and yet alive lastly in another part of the said manuscript gorges says the reason why i acknowledge i had means to have taken or killed sir walter ralegh was the better to make it appear that there was neither malicious or butcherous course intended to him or any and also to give him cause to acknowledge himself in that respect beholden unto me whereby to take from him occasion to exercise his power which i knew to be great at that juncture to my ruin for i did believe he could not in reason be so void of human respect as not to requite one courtesy with another and also it was no matter of treason against her majesty but rather a manifestation of the contrary approving this intent to be particular against sir walter ralegh and others this is the conference which passed between them a few hours before the insurrection as gorges has represented it  after essex with his party had made several excursions and some persons had been slain both on his side and the queens after he had been proclaimed a traitor by the king of arms in several parts of the city and was driven by water to seek garrison in his own house we find ralegh mentioned among the several nobles and knights who invested it though he appears in no particular action against the said earl or his company but when the earl soon after surrendered himself and was brought to examination he professed that he was to have been assaulted or assassinated by his private enemies of this we have the following account published by authority as in all former discontentments he had gone the beaten path of traitors turning their imputation upon counselors and persons of credit with their sovereign so now he was forced to descend to the pretext of a private quarrel giving out how that evening when he should have been called before the lords of the council there was an ambuscade of musketeers placed upon the water by the device of my lord cobham and sir walter ralegh to have murdered him in the way as he passed a matter of no probability continues my author those persons having no such desperate estates or minds as to ruin themselves and their posterity by committing so odious a crime on the contrary it was certain sir ferdinando gorges accused blount persuading him to kill or at least apprehend sir walter ralegh and that gorges rejecting this advice blount sent four shot after him in a boat which blount denied not and asked ralegh forgiveness for it at the time of his death but there were other improbabilities to discredit this slander as we may safely call it since the state called it by a grosser name besides that the persons so accused had reputations and estates better established than to overthrow them by such a detestable deed as essexs declining to produce or name any author of such an information besides his varying from himself like the judges in the story of susannah from one another in the place as one while he was to have been murdered in his bed and another on the water also in the time and persons as that it was to have been done by jesuits and some days before so that in the end this accusation by essex was resembled to the action of pisistratus who proceeded so far in this kind of fiction and dissimulation that he lanced his own body and came wounded before the people as though he had been assaulted by his private enemies thus obtained a guard about his person whereby he afterward usurped upon the state further what may perfectly clear up the innocence of cobham and ralegh from this unworthy calumny is the acknowledgment which blount made at his own trial when being asked by secretary cecyll whether he thought my lord cobham and sir walter ralegh intended any such assassination of the earl he answered that he did not believe they ever meant any such thing nor that the earl himself feared it only it was a word cast out to color other matters and lastly what may tend to prove that ralegh did rather compassionate and incline to befriend the earl than harbor any enmity that was implacable against him is that one of the earls own faction capt thomas lee should have such hopes that ralegh might be persuaded into the danger of disobliging the queen by importunity or other violent means for retrieving both essex and southampton from the jaws of death as by way of proposition to tell sir robert cross who had been an old officer under ralegh in several engagements at sea that sir walter ralegh might get himself eternal honor and love more than ever he can otherwise if he would procure her majestys warrant to free the lords which he might compass by undertaking her person for this does not only show the opinion that was held of ralegh s power with the queen but the probability that he might be induced to exert it for the rescue of those noblemen we find he did use his interest for some who were drawn in unawares and got a pardon for sir edmund bainham also for john littleton and orell a brave old soldier the two former were men of fortune and their purses might bleed or be threatened upon this occasion but as camden observes few paid the fines laid on them  on the   th of february essex was arraigned at westminster and we find in his trial that sir walter ralegh with  0 of the queens guard was as captain thereof there present upon duty ralegh was here examined about the conference beforementioned and all he said was that gorges told him on the water essex had put himself into a strong guard at his house and this would be the bloodiest days work that ever was wishing he would speed to court for the prevention of it and that he himself wished gorges to refuse their company else he would be undone this is all ralegh said of that conference which gorges here also in court confirmed but essex seems to charge gorges with prevarication where he replies whatsoever sir walter ralegh has said differs altogether from that which sir ferdinando told us at essexhouse upon his return from the water and indeed it is not likely he should tell essex he advised ralegh to go to court and prevent the insurrection six days after essex was beheaded in the court yard of londontower among the many persons of distinction there present was sir walter ralegh probably in his charge again as captain of the guard he stood near the scaffold according to his own assertion that he might better answer if essex should be desirous of speaking to him but his enemies expounded his presence there in such a barbarous sense says camden as if he had pressed near the place of execution ouly to feast his eyes with the tragedy of the earls sufferings and the greatest or most notorious of raleghs enemies who is known to us he who betrayed him to his untimely end as will be observed did after raleghs death when he could not answer for himself insinuate that he not only insulted upon essex being dead but even plotted his downfall as that he had called the earls saintship in question had writ in some letters that the great boy died like a calf and like a craven and that soon after the execution a gentleman returning from spain touched at sherborne who being asked by ralegh what they said in spain of essex s death answered they had not heard of it but he was sorry to bear that in the island voyage the earl had brought him to his mercy to which that ralegh answered but i trust i am now quit with him and as a more evident demonstration says that the night before the earls suffering ralegh gave instructions to the lieutenant of the tower for the execution of the warrant which surely he did not do without authority but these particulars it must be observed come from the person stigmatized with having ensnared ralegh to his destruction and to the person who destroyed him with endeavor to palliate the conduct of both to the world and as we find those obloquies gave not satisfaction to their authors cotemporaries so we have produced them that they may not escape the reception they deserve of posterity as for raleghs comportment to essex we may guess what it was while the earl was alive since he made no exceptions to it at his death when he had free liberty of speech and when ralegh came to the same end it appears by his last words that he had relented more at the earls fate than any thing were hear of in his pretended friends and that he retired from the sight of the earl at the time of his death in compliance with the misconstruction of the populace though he afterward repented it since the earl had a desire to see and speak with him before he took his farewell of the world  this desire was in all probability to ask ralegh forgiveness for having so dishonourably treated and traduced him to countenance his own rash purposes for just such a desire had sir christopher blount when his own execution approached on the   th of march following at tower hill where understanding that ralegh as captain of the guard was near the scaffold he said sir walter ralegh i thank god that you are present i had an infinite desire to speak with you to ask you forgiveness ever i died both for the wrong done you and for my particular ill intent toward you i beseech you forgive me ralegh answered that he most willingly forgave him and besought god to forgive him and to give him his divine comfort protesting before the lord that whatever sir christopher blount meant toward him for his part he never bore him any ill intent and further said to him i pray you without offense let me put you in mind that you have been esteemed not only a principal provoker and persuader of the earl of essex in all his undutiful courses but especially an adviser in that which has been confessed of his purpose to transport a great part of her majestys army out of ireland into england to land at milford and thence to turn it against her sacred person you will do well to tell the truth herein and to satisfy the world blount replied when i was brought from reban to dublin and lodged in the castle his lordship and the earl of southampton came to visit me and he began thus plainly with me that he intended to transport a choice part of the army of ireland into england and land them in wales at milford or thereabouts and so securing his descent would gather such other forces as would enable him to march to london i answered i would that night consider of it next day the earls came again i told them such an enterprise as it was most dangerous would cost much blood so as i could not like it but i rather advised him to go over himself with a good train and make sure of the court than make his own conditions and though we never resolved to hurt her majestys person yet i know and must confess if we had failed of our ends we should rather than have been disappointed even have drawn blood from herself then giving a few farther hints of their progress in general he leaves the rest to his confessions made before the privycounsellors whom he names and to whom he beseeches sir walter ralegh to commend him for their favorable and charitable dealing lastly having also declared he died in the catholic faith and bid farewell to the lords gray compton and the rest he made a decent end thus have we connected all the passages of essex s insurrection wherein we have found ralegh any ways mentioned or concerned which with several other remarkable parts of his story those authors who had read many of the tracts letters records and other manuscripts whence it is here drawn out have visibly curtailed and suppressed in their annals and chronicles of this reign which were published in the next  the following summer in the year   0  it appears that ralegh attended upon the queen in her progress and when the king of france came to calais on the alarm of the archdukes besieging of ostend her majesty was at dover ambassadors were sent over to each other on this occasion and in that private dispatch of the marquis of rosney afterward duke of sully related only by himself we find that upon his landing at dover he was received by ralegh in company with the lords cobham sidney and others the interview then expected between these two princes was not brought to pass nor seem the proposals made to her majesty about the war with spain to have had the full effect that was hoped for because not long after on the  th of september there arrived at london another ambassador from france named the duke of biron with a very noble numerous and stately equipage to the number of   or  00 persons the queen was then in hantshire and during the    days she was entertained at bosing the marquis or winchesters seat the duke of biron with his retinue was brought to the vine a fair house in the said county of the lord sandys which was furnished with   0 bds by the neighboring gentry and with all other accommodations from the queens palaces for the reception of the said ambassador i leave this entertainment to the description of the french and english historians who observe it as one discontinued festival and that the lik was never made by any of our princes in a progress it is more particularly to be expected that ralegh did here attend upon the court because he was commonly appointed to entertain the foreign ministers especially of france or the states being so well acquainted with those people and their policies and when the queen left the country we find among the ten persons she there knighted a greater number than ever she had conferred that honor upon at one time that one of them was carew john stow annals edit      fol    this is that sir carew ralegh who appears in the courtrolls of gillingham in  to have been one of the stewards his brother sir walter ralegh being the other of that manor in these times belonging the crown as i have it from a letter of some obliging remarks upon the family of the raleghs written by william nicholas esquire of westhorsely in sussex this must be also the same sir carew ralegh who had in      for what consideration is not mentioned  00 l paid him from the government as i find in an abstract of the state of his majestys revenue reprinted  vo      p  0 likewise the same who sold widdycombe ralegh to one of the martyns as is before observed and the ancient patrimony of fardel to walter heal esquire of brixton as john prince informs us in the worthies of devon fol  0  lastly the same sir carew ralegh who married dorothy daughter of sir william wroughton and relict of sir john thynne by whom he had gilbert hier of downton and he by lucy daughter of sir gilly wroughton of broadbinton in wilts had several children as gilbert george walter katharine anne etc this i gather from a pedigree of the raleghs in the possession of brown willis esquire mentioned at the beginning of this work wherein it farther appears the said sir carew his son and grandchildren were all alive in      and hence the wiltshire raleghs have flourished to these latter times the brother of sir walter ralegh but as for that passage in a french historian lately quoted between the queen and the ambassador when they were in london of her showing him among the heads of those rebels which were stuck upon the tower that of the earl of essex it has been proved fabulous by camden whereas certain french writers have mentioned says camden that the queen showed to biron the earl of essexs skull in her closet or according to others sixer upon a pole it must needs be a story as ridiculous as false since that was interred with his body annal eliz   0  who would doubtless have detected other such falsities in the said french author relating to our english history and in particular to sir walter ralegh had his annals extended to the year in which we shall be obliged to take notice thereof  soon after the queens return from this progress her last parliament met at westminster and that was on the   th day of october this was a session full of important business and ralegh appears frequently engaged in it the first or most ancient list of the members of the house of commons at least extant is as i have been told by an eminent antiquary that which we have of this parliament and herein it appears that sir walter ralegh was one of the knights of the shire for the county of cornwall john arundell esquire being the other and that sir carew ralegh was one of the burgesses for foway in the same county the first speech we have of sir walter s upon record in this parliament was on november the  th and in opposition to the act for sowing of hemp for my part said he i do not like this constraining of men to manure or use their ground at our wills but rather let every man use his ground to that which it is most fit for and therein use his own discretion for halsiers cables cordage and the like we have plentifully enough from foreign nations and we have countries here in england that make use thereof in abundance and the bill of tillage may be a sufficient motive to us in this case not to take the course that this bill intends for where the law provides that every man must plough the third part of his land i know diverse poor people have done so to avoid the penalty of the statute when their abilities have been so poor that they have not been able to buy seedcorn to sow it withal nay they have been fain to hire others to plough it which if it had been unploughed would have been good pasture for beasts or might have been converted to other good uses  upon this motion all the house bid away with the bill but it was put to the question whether it should be committed or no some doubt arising the house was divided and the yeas were  0  the nos     so the bill was not committed it was afterward put to the question for engrossing and notwithstanding mr comptroller s speech for the weight of it which is not preserved it was denied and so absolutely rejected three days after sir walter ralegh was at the committee in the house touching the subsidy here he moved them to consider for what intent they came thither and now in their coming what was to be considered for the subsidy said he the manner and quality thereof i will now only intimate thus much to you that the last parliament only three subsidies were granted upon fear that the spaniards were coming but now we see they are come and have set foot even in the queens territories already therefore are the more of us to be respected and regarded and seeing the sale of her majestys own jewels the great loans her subjects have lent her yet unpaid the continual selling of her lands and decaying of her revenues the sparing even out of her own purse and apparel for our own sakes will not serve but she must yet be fain to call her court of parliament for our advice and aid in this case i wish for my part as a particular member of the commonwealth that we may not do less than we did before and that we may also bountifully according to our estates contribute to her majestys necessities as they now stand this speech was confirmed by many other members and met with no opposition that we read of but the manner of raising this subsidy created some short debate in which sir francis hastings moved that the three pound men might be exempted and all others above that rate to pay according to the rate to make up a full subsidy to this sir walter ralegh answered if all pay none will be aggrieved if any be exempted doubtless it will breed much grief the feeling will be great to those three pound men that will feel any thing but it will be nothing to them that know any thing sir edward hobby who it seems sat near the door not hearing well this speech said you should speak standing that the house might hear you ralegh answered that being in a committee he might speak sitting or standing so without rising repeated his former words in the end this proposal was agreed to and secretary cecyll reported to the whole house that most voices concluded there should be no exception of the three pound men because according to their rate some were assessed under value besides separation might breed emulation suspicion of partiality and confusion yet when cecyll among those who launched out of whom none more remarkable than sergeant heal who marvelled much the house should demur upon granting this subsidy or in the time of payment when all we have said he is her majestys and she may lawfully at pleasure take it from us yea she has as much right to all our lands an goods as to any revenue of her crown at which the house hummed and laughed well all your humming said the sergeant shall not put me out of countenance so to mend the matter he told them he could prove his former position in the time of king henry iii king john king stephen etc at this the house was louer than before till they hummed the sergeant into his seat but he was afterward more particularly exposed for these slavish principles  carried the matter so high as to say that neither pots or pans nor dish nor spoon should be spared when danger is at our elbows nor would by any means have the three pound men excluded because he would have the king of spain know how willing we are to sell all in defense of gods religion our prince and our country and when mr francis bacon in his speech concluded it was dulcis tractus pari jugo therefore the poor as well as the rich not to be exempted ralegh did answer i like it not that the spaniards our enemies should know of our selling our pots and pans to pay subsidies well may you call it policy as an honorable person alleged but i am sure it argues poverty in the state and for the motion that was last made dulcis tractus parijugo call you this par jugum when a poor man pays as much as a rich and peradventure his estate is no better than it is set at or but little better while our estates are three or four pounds in the queens books and it is not the hundredth part of our wealth therefore it is neither dulcis nor par this might flow as well from the natural source of his own benignity as from any compliance with the queens inclination to favor the poorer sort for whom ralegh seems by her command to have before indeed been a chosen advocate sir walter speaking of a parliament in the reign of king richard ii wherein a subsidy was given only by the better sort and the commons spared says in the person of a justice of peace i myself once moved it in parliament in the time of queen elizabeth who desired much to spare the common people and i did it by her commandment but when we cast up the subsidybooks we found the sum but small wheu the  0 pound men perhaps the cipher is added by mistake were left out see raleghs prerogative of parliaments  but he knowing as well as the rest of the members by former experience that such a supply as her majesty now wanted being no less than  00000 pounds according to cecyll s representation could not be raised if such an exemption were admitted of the former proposition prevailed and the three pound men were necessarily included  when the complaint against monopolies was made on the  0th of november and dr bennet mentioned that of cards i cannot perceive how it could be justly observed in the journals to make any change in the countenance of sir walter ralegh since in the same journals it is also observed that the patent for cards was now granted to edward darcy but when mr martin spoke of a country that groaned nnder the burden of monstrous and unconscionable substitutes to monopolitans of starch tin fish cloth oil vinegar salt and what not sir walter ralegh replied i am urged to speak in two respects the one because i find myself touched upon in particular the other in that i take some imputation and slander to be offered unto her majesty i mean by the gentleman who first mentioned tin for that being one of the principal commodities of this kingdom and being in cornwall it has ever so long as there were any belonged to the dukes of cornwall and they had special patents of privilege it has pleased her majesty freely to bestow on me that privilege and that patent being word for word the very same the dukes is and because by reason of my office of lordwarden of the stannaries i can sufficiently inform this house of the state thereof i will make bold to deliver it unto you when the tin is taken out of the mine and molten and refined then is every piece containing  00 weight sealed with the dukes seal and by reason of this privilege which i now have he ever had the refusal in buying thereof for the words of the patent are nisi nos emere voluimus now i will tell you that before the granting of my patent whether tin were but at    shillings and so upward to  0 shillings a hundred yet the poor workman never had but two shillings a week finding himself but since my patent whosoever will work be tin at what price soever they have four shillings a week truly paid there is no poor that will work there but may and have that wages but notwithstanding his merit as well as right ralegh concluded saying yet if all others may be repealed i will give my consent as freely to the cancelling of this as any member of this house it is noted that a great and uncommon silence followed this speech at last sir francis hastings said in respect thereto i joy to see so great a reformation that we may speak quietly and be heard peaceably every man has not alike sense or judgment neither is every mans memory alike i wish that if any gentleman who speaks of this or any other subject as curious shall let fall any word amiss or unpleasing that it may be attributed rather to earnestness than want of duty throughout the further proceedings against the numerous monopolies now in force we find not any mention made of his patent aforesaid among those which were particularly promised to be revoked or abolished as grievances to the state on the   th of november sir edmund morgan and mr pemberton both members of the house being served with subpoenas to appear in the court of chancery the same day at the suit of sir walter and sir carew ralegh they had the privilege granted them the officers who served those subpoenas were taken into the custody of the sergeant but soon released upon pleading they knew not those gentlemen to be members of parliament this is all i find of that suit concerning sir walter ralegh on the  d of december he spoke against the defects and hardships in a bill that was read for reformation of abuses in inns as that it would deprive those who by their lordships or manors had right to enquire into the default of selling liquors by full measure of their privilege that by disabling a man for ever after of being an innkeeper how detrimental it might be to the inheritance of those who had inns some at  00 pounds per annum and how dangerous to innkeepers who might by the negligence of a servant suffer all which he left to the discretion of the house after other like objections by another member or two we hear no more of it soon after the means of suppressing the pirates of dunkirk now grown strong both in arms and shipping came under the consideration of this house as one remedy against them it was proposed to restrain the transportation of ordnance and a bill to prohibit the same was read a second time on the  th of december but before it was committed there passed many speeches upon this important argument it seems a patent for transporting them had been granted to sir henry nevill and the queens duty thereby rose to  000 l a year yet this profit no ways balanced the inconveniences for being carried into all countries that were friends with dunkirk and confederates with spain the spaniards had such plenty that they now usually sold  00 weight of iron ordnance for seven ducats and a half the laws were moreover urged in    of henry viii and   of edward vi which prohibited the transporting of gun metal and though guns were not then made of iron they now were therefore it was within the power of those laws sir walter ralegh in approbation of this motion said i sir walter ralegh has also written upon this subject in two or three places in his discourse touching a war with spain and the protecting of the netherlands written not long after he made the aforeaid speech having told king james how he remembered that within these  0 years two of her majestys ships would have commanded  00 sail of theirs and that when he w s a captain in ireland  00 foot and  00 horse would have beaten all the force of the strongest provinces he adds but of late i have known an easterling fight hand to h nd with one of her majestys ships and  have in this last war overthrown with even or far less number the netherlands continues he in those days had wooden guns and the irish had dar but the one is now furnished with as great a number of english ordnance as ourselves and the other with as good pikes and muskets as england has see raleghs three discourses  vo   0  p    in another discourse he afterward writ touching a marriage between prince henry of england and a daughter of savoy speaking of the netherlands he has these words whereas in my time i have known one of her majestys ships command  0 of theirs to strike sail they will now undertake us one to one and not give us a good morrow they master us both in their number and in their mariners and they have our own ordnance to break our own bones withal we had reason to help them but not to help them up to that height as to make them able to tread upon our own heads thus in the old ms of that discourse communicated by the noble earl of oxford lastly in another discourse sir walter ralegh wrote after this i mean that on the invention of shipping he has more copiously argued upon this head these arguments i shall here also annex both as what will exemplify the constancy of his judgment and prove the genuiness of these discourses though two of them are posthumous publications and the other was never published there is no state says he grown in haste but that of the united provinces especially in their seaforces and by a contrary way to that of france or spain the latter by invasion the former by oppression for i myself may remember when one ship of her majestys would have made  0 hollanders strike sail and to come to anchor they did not then dispuce de mari beo but readily acknowledged the english to be domini maris britannici and a little further but whence comes this dispute not from the increase of numbers not because our neighbors breed more mariners than we do nor from the greatness of their trade in all parts of the world for the french creep into all corners of america as they do and the spaniards and portuguese employ more ships by many fishing trades excepted than the netherlands but it comes from the detestable covetousness of such particular persons as have gotten licenses and given way to the transporting of english ordnance fuit haec sapientia quondam publica privatis secernere sacra profanis and that in so great abundance that not only our good friends the hollanders and zealanders have furnished themselves and have them lying on their wharfs to sell to others but all other nations have had from us not only to furnish their fleets but to garnish all their forts and other places fertifying their coasts without which the spanish king durst not have dismounted so many pieces of brass in naples and elsewhere to arm his great fleet in      but it was directly proved in the lower house of parliament anno  of queen elizabeth that there were landed in naples above   0 culverins english since which time and not long since it is lamentable that so many have been transported into spain but those belike who then determined it and the transporters have now forsaken the country and though the procurers remain i am resolved they also have forsaken the care of his majestys estate and the honor of this nation i urge not this point as thinking it unfit to furnish his majestys good friends and allies who have had with us one common enemy for many years but all politic states have well observed this precept ut ic tractarent amicum tanqnam inimicum futurum for what are all the ships in the world to be valued at other than a company of floating tubs were they not furnished with ordnance either to offend others or defend themselves if a ship of  000 tons had in her  000 musketeers and never a great gun with one crumster carrying  0 or    culverins she may be beaten to pieces and her men slaughtered certainly the advantage which the english had by their bows and arrows in former times was never so great as we might now have had by our iron ordnance if we had either kept it within the land kept it from our enemies or imparted it to our friends moderately for as by the former we obtained many notable victories and made ourselves masters of many parts of france so by the latter we might have commanded the seas and thereby the trade of the world itself but we have now to our future prejudice and how far to our prejudice i know not forged hammers and delivered them out of our hands to break our own bones withal see judicious and select essays by sir walter ralegh  vo    0 p       etc am sure heretofore one ship of her majestys was able to beat ten spaniards ut now by reason of our own ordnance we are hardly matched one to one and if the low countries should either be subdued by the spaniard or yield unto him upon a conditional peace or shall join in amity with the french as we see them daily inclining i say there is nothing does so much threaten the conquest of this kingdom as the transportation of ordnance and therefore i think it a good and speedy course to proceed by way of petition lest we be cut off from our desires either by the upper house or before by the shortness and sudden ending of the parliament the generality agreed with him in the needfulness of restraining this privilege however they proceeded by way of bill which passed the commons but not the lords for other business interfering it fell asleep till the end of the session and then the speaker crook who was to represent it to her majesty forgetting his promise it came to nothing  on the  th of december the dispute was renewed whether the statute of tillage should be continued this statute was made in the time of dearth and sir walter ralegh agreed with those who were for having it now repealed his reason for it was because many poor men are not able to find seed to sow so much ground as they are bound to plough which they must do or incur the penalty of the law besides all nations abound with corn france offered the queen to serve ireland with corn for sixteen shillings a quarter which is but two shillings the bushel if we should sell it so here the ploughman would be beggared the lowcountryman and the hollander who never sow corn have by their industry such plenty that they will serve other nations the spaniard who often wants corn had we never so much plenty would never be beholden to the englishman for it neither to the lowcountryman nor to france but will fetch it even of the very barbarian and that which the barbarian has been suing for these  00 years i mean for traffic of corn into spain the king in policy has set at liberty of himself because he will not be beholden to other nations and therefore i think the best course is to set it at liberty and leave every man free which is the desire of a true englishman after other speeches it was put to the question whether the bill of tillage should be committed and it passed in the affirmative but it having pleased her majesty to license mr dormer under her letters patent with a nonobstante this statute to enclose  00 acres of ground he prayed the house to admit of this proviso therefore it was put to the question and carried the nos demanded a division of the house whereupon mr richard martyn observed the nos had always carried it in this parliament when they came to a division many staying with the yeas because they would not lose their places sir walter ralegh rose to answer him but many hurrying out to the division he and cecyll it seems took some displeasure for after the division when mr dormer s proviso carried it again by a majority whereby the house was set quiet sir walter ralegh said i thought i had deserved of the house to have been heard to speak as well as he that spoke before the division and in that i offered to speak and was not heard i had wrong for him that last spoke it was out of humor and not out of judgment notwithstanding i think it a monopoly and the speech to be both persuasion and to lay a great imputation upon the house and this is all i would have said before  next day came on the question whether the tax for doverhaven should be continued by force of the statute which was three pence a ton for the burden of every ship one member mr swale objected that the charge amounted to at least a thousand marks a year yet the haven was never the better and that it was grown a proverbial wish of any tax that it would not continue like that of doverhaven but mr john boys showed the convenience of this haven and how many hundred pounds worth of stones were ready to repair it sir john fortescue also observed what large ships of burden it would receive how necessary it is for the passage of all merchants as also that the tax was small and the time might be when it would need a great tax at one time lastly mr comptroller having likewise expressed how imprudent it was to take away this tax now they were debating how to defend themselves from the dunkirkers which would weaken the most necessary haven of england sir walter ralegh was more particular in these words there are diverse havens which have been famous and now are grown to decay as tinmouth seaton and winchelsey rye is of little receipt sandwich as a burgess of that town mr peak said this parliament is even a going the tax being employed as it should be i hold it both good and necessary and there is no trade of fishermen to newfoundland but by this haven of dover which if the tax be taken away and that go to decay her majesty shall lose one of the best and most necessary havens of england which has all the commodities that mr comptroller showed and lies opposite to all our enemies countries who may soon be with us and we not able to resist them or help ourselves should we want this haven i think it therefore fit this matter should be considered of and committed and so it was  the   th of december was read the third time a bill for the more diligent resort to church on sundays which produced several speeches in the house the recusants were very numerous at this time no less than   00 in yorkshire as dr bennet affirmed which might be one reason for now urging this bill but those who were no ways popishly inclined perceived several insufferable defects in it as mr john bond who among other arguments was not for exposing the ecclesiastical authority among their enemies as more impotent than a twelvepenny fine at last there was a proviso added to it that if any man came eight times a year to church and said the usual divine service twice every sunday and holy day in his house with his whole family that should be a sufficent dispensation but the bill weak enough of itself was overthrown by this conjunction after sir walter ralegh had showed that all the churchwardens of every shire must come to the assizes to give information to the grand jury say then there be   0 parishes in a shire there must now come extraordinarily   0 churchwardens and say that but two in a parish offend in a quarter of a year that makes   0 persons with the offenders to appear what great multitudes this will bring together what quarrelling and danger may happen besides giving authority to a mean churchwarden how prejudicial this may be with diverse other reasons against it and instances of the ambiguities and equivocations in it and as for the proviso newly added it was a plain toleration from coming to church and the parson could not prevent or constrain any if they read service at home hereupon it was put to the question and the house was divided the yeas went forth and were  0  and the nos within were  0  so it was thrown out by one voice but the yeas urging they had the speakers voice which would make it even this grew a question whether he had a vote sir edward hobby thought he had one but sir walter ralegh argued that he was foreclosd of his voice by taking that place which it had pleased them to impose upon him and that he was to be indifferent for both parties withal showed that by the ol order of the house the bill was lost the speaker himself confirmed his observation and confessed he had not by custom any vote then mr byer secretary to the lord treasurer bukhurst would have retrieved it by suggesting there was some foul play deelaing a member was pulled back by the sleeve as going out and charged mr dale of the middle temple to which sir walter ralegh answered in a humorous manner why if it please you it is a small matter to pull one by the sleeve for so i have done myself oftentimes which though a familiar phrase for checking or reproving ones self for any weakness or error yet a very disingenuous and incongruous construction was forced upon it by the comptroller and cecyll as if large was his conscience or very flexible that in a matter of this consequence would be drawn backwards or forwards by the sleeve ralegh took no notice of them and the speaker being allowed to have no voice the bill was thrown up and they took their leave of it besides the speeches ralegh made in parliament which we have thus drawn together as far as they are upon record he appears in the committees of many other bills and in several conferences with the lords as may be seen in the journal books of both houses but being only mentioned in general we need not here be so particular as to recite them therefore shall only observe that the commons having granted the queen a liberal subsidy and her majesty given her royal assent to nineteen public and ten private acts this last parliament in her reign was dissolved on the   th of december  in the beginning of the year   0  mr carews dedication of his survey of cornwall is dated as was before intimated wherein that author has with such energy copied forth the most amiable distinctions of raleghs mind this agreeable picture thereof and the many other noble attitudes in which we have seen it displayed have made me inquisitive what portraitures remained of his person that we might better judge of the correspondence between them how well in one aspect the sprightliness of genius consorted with the solidity of judgment how well in one figure the roughness of war with the splendour and magnificence of courts i have at last had the satisfaction of seeing these characters united in that portrait of sir walter ralegh still remaining with the descendants of his family it is in the possession of captain william elwes nephew of the lacy elwes grand daughter of sir walter ralegh and to that gentleman we are obliged for the liberty of bringing the same into pr nt it is a half length representing him in the silver armor beforementioned and richly adorned in the skirts the sword and belt with diamonds rubies and pearls it seems by the darkness and fullness of the hair with the freshness and clearness of the countenance to have been the picture of him before his guianian expedition above related but the inscription upon another very old draught in the same posture and habit mentions his government of jersey among the collections of his grace the duke of dorset at knowle in kent farther to describe this piece here will be needless since it is now brought into sculpture by an excellent hand and ready to be made public another painting i have also seen of him and this is at full length probably an original it agrees very well with the foregoing in the form of the face and color of the hair and beard at least as far as may be expected from the hands of different artists some alteration perhaps by repairs and some difference of years in the object whereby he seems in this last more ruddy and tanned than the other for by the inscription thereon partly still legible it appears that this picture was painted in this last year of the queen abovementioned and that his son walter who is likewise here drawn by him was then eight years of age further in this picture the stature of sir walter ralegh measures about six feet is wellshaped and not too slender he is apparelled in a white satin pinkd vest closesleevd to the wrist and over the body of it a brown doublet finely flowered and embroidered with pearl his belt of the same color and ornament in which hangs his sword and on the other side over the right hip is seen the pommel of his dagger in his hat which he has on is a little black feather with a large ruby and pearl drop at the bottom of the sprig in place of the button his trunks or breeches with his stockings and ribbongarters fringed at the end are all white and buffshoes tied with white ribbons his son standing under his left elbow is fair and prettily featured dressed in a blue silk jacket and trowsers guarded down with narrow silver galloon stockings blue and white shoes gloves in the right hand hat or cap in the left and a silver sword by his side this picture of sir walter and his son did belong to the carews of beddington whence by marriage with a daughter of the late sir stephen leonard baronet it was removed to westwickham in kent near which place at a gentlemans seat where there is a copy that was taken from it i lately saw it   a year before this the lady raleghs picture was also painted as appears by the date upon it it is a halflength like the first but painted on board a high finished piece in the labored manner of those times by some masterly hand has been well kept and is doubtless an original it represents her a fair handsome woman turned perhaps of thirty she has on a dark colored hangingsleeve robe tuffted on the arms and under it a closebodied gown of white satin flowered with black with close sleeves down to her wrist has a rich ruby in her ear bedropd with large pearls a laced whisk rising above the shoulders her bosom uncovered and a jewel hanging thereon with a large chain of pearl round her neck down to her waist these are all the paintings i have seen of them that i can count authentic or most likely to bear any true resemblance but have been credibly informed of a picture of sir walter ralegh in miniature taken not long before his death and another at large representing him also in a white suit which he had beset with jewels to the value of threescore thousand pounds and that one diamond thereof worth a hundred pounds remained in the family till the beginning of the late queens reign in this picture there is a ribbongarter fringed at the ends tied about his left arm this according to the tradition that remains in his family was his ladys otherwise might be thought one of the queens favors at the tiltyard which he brought one morning when he was obliged to attend her majesty early as a token that for dispatch he had rode   0 miles since he took leave of her late the night before but such a number of jewels which might be called extravagance in others was no expense to sir walter ralegh who had many other kinds of treasure as well as this in spanish prizes or otherwise in traffic with foreign nations and as for his stately appearance in by wearing of them upon some special occasions it is not only confirmed by circumstances in part beforementioned but also by some authors who are not expected to take notice of it with great commendation yet the jesuit drexelius might perhaps have found more dazzling examples to dress out his dialogue upon attire nearer the time he wrote it as lord hay and others in king jamess reign but above all the duke of buckingham with whom it was common at an ordinary dancing to have his clothes trimmed with great diamond buttons and to have diamond hatbands cockades and ear rings to be yoked with great and manifol ropes and knots of pearl in short to be manacled fettered and imprisoned in jewels insomuch that at his going over to paris in      he had    suits of clothes made the richest that embroidery lace silk velvet silver gold and gems could contribute one of which was a white uncut velvet set all over both suit and cloak with diamonds valued at fourscore thousand pounds besides a great feather stuck all over with diamonds as were also his sword girdle hatband and spurs this from a ms in the harleyan library b h  0 c   fol     and to have parelleld with the roman emperors he produces than ralegh even though sir walter might upon some great assemblies at court have this very shoes bedecked with precious stones that exceeded the value of six thousand six hundred pieces of gold as that author relates all i think here further observable upon the pictures of sir walter ralegh is that after so many which may be called genuine and many more pretended to be so still in being there have been such frequent occasions of engraving his effigies for his books yet we have never had till now more than two sculptures which can pretend to have taken from any paintings that even these are different from any above described and that all the rest of the copper prints we have of him whereof near half a score might be reckoned are copies only from the last of those two of these two sculptures or prints of sir walter ralegh the first is an extraordinary rarity insomuch that many virtuosi and antiquaries who have searched after and collected the graved heads of eminent persons for many years together have not so much as ever heard of it the felicity and the favor are therefore the greater that i have been obliged with the sight of it by general dormer who has procured a fresh and fair impression of it from france into his choice and costly collections for it is a french piece in the octavo size and graved by thomas leau an artist who was encouraged by some of our nobility in these times for the excellence of his hand it represents him in a closebodied silk coat laced agrees pretty well in the features with those before described especially the high forehead and cornering up of the hair above the right temple it has a compartment or group at the bottom displaying his victory over the fleet in the bay of cadiz yet in the large latin inscription expressing his titles and offices of command there is mention made of his government of jersey so i conclude it was graved between his preferment thereto and the queens death the other print of him is that which we see prefixed to most of the editions of his history of the world whether to the first edition i am not yet certain the oldest that i have seen being among the heads annexed to henry hollands basilogia was graved by simon pass in the year      representing him in a closebodied suit thickly laced a full laced ruff and truncheon in his hand also when he was more aged and corpulent than we see him in any of those before mentioned by the visible erasement of a long inscription that was at the bottom for the substitution of that which is more brief the plate should seem to have been graved before that year but by the truncheon in his hand not till he had his command as general for his last expedition yet being probably taken from some anthentic painting it lay most ready to be copied when any print was wanting for his lesser works this is all i shall here observe upon the pictures of sir walter ralegh and for much of this we are obliged to the knowledge and industry of the ingenious mr virtue   among the ret of the particulars we shall briefly relate of sir walter ralegh in this last year of the queens reign a voyage which he now set out for the supply of his colony in virginia is principally to be remembered for though he had made an assignment of his patent to other undertakers as was before observed yet they making no successful progress he was so regardful of the english he had planted there that he sent to them almost every other year even from the time of the said assignment for besides the five voyages before epitomized which himself chiefly was at the expense of for the first plantation of virginia we are well informed of five voyages more which since those he set forth thither for the relief of his countrymen as well as for further discoveries of those parts and alliance with the people and that the last of these voyages under the command of captain samuel mace was made this year in all which sir walter ralegh might very well have disbursed forty thousand pounds as was before observed since in a french author i have found the two first voyages only to virginia cost him and his friends threescore thousand crowns yet were not the english so securely established in this most promising plantation as sir walter ralegh would have had them for from the short account we have of this last voyage and other circumstances we may observe the said colony was much impaired by the barbarous indians as indeed raleghs purse seems also to have been by these frequent communications to it nor was it without much blood as well as money that this settlement was at last fixed by the succeeding undertakers in the next reign and all owing to the want of that timely and competent assistance from the queen or state whereby the most worthy attempts for the public good were even in these as well as other times so generally starved but ralegh afterward gave some emphatical reasons for this unhappiness whence we may evidently perceive it was to the queens consulting so much and relying upon the persuasions of her scribes men unexperienced in all warlike or adventurous enterprises narrow domestic politicians or mere courtiers who were most constant at her ear that she so frequently did things by halves as well in conquests and discoveries as in rewards and preferments especially of military men that her majesty in her advancement of her men of war says sir walter ralegh did sooner believe other men than herself a disease unto which many wise princes besides herself have been subject i say that such a confidence although it may eem altogether to excuse her noble nature yet can it not but in some sort accuse her of weakness and exceeding strange it were were not the cause manifest enough that where the prosperous actions are so exceedingly prized the actors are so unprosperous and neglected the cause i say which has wrought one and the same effect in all times and among all nations is this that those who are nearest the person of princes which martial men seldom are can with no good grace commend or at least magnify a profession far more noble than their own seeing therein they should only remind their masters of the wrong they did unto others in giving less honor and reward to men of far greater deserving and far greater use than themselves history of the world lib   cap   sect    thus those speculative counselors though they could not hinder brave and active spirits from budding out into noble beginnings of most hopeful benefit to the commonwealth yet could by stopping the channel of supplies or encouragements blite them from advancing to any fruitful or profitable conclusions and this only to bring down those of superior service and merit to a level with themselves  whether the expense of those voyages was the cause of sir walter raleghs selling about this time his estate or some part of it in ireland is not so expressly told us as that it was become less advantageous to him since the late rebellion in that kingdom but we find that a little before sir george carew now president of munster took the castle of carigfoyl kerry mr richard boil afterward earl of cork not only bought a ship of sir walter raleghs called the pilgrim but soon after the said president conquered berehaven castle he having advised the said mr boil to buy also sir walters lands in munster sent him into england with two letters the one to secretary cecyll giving an account of mr boyles abilities desired that he would introduce him to sir walter ralegh and recommended him to this great man says my author as a proper purchaser of his said lands the other letter was written by sir george carew to sir walter ralegh himself acquainting him that the bearer was capable of making the purchase and that he thought he might be willing to dispose of it since the management thereof in those turbulent times gave him a great deal of trouble and the income it produced was very inconsiderable so after a meeting the bargain was struck up and conveyances executed these lands soon after in the peaceable times became a great estate to mr boil and this purchase as he afterward gratefully remembered in the memoirs he wrote of his own life when he was earl of cork was the third addition and rise to his estate see an extract of the said memoirs in the life of the late earl of orrery by eustace budgell esquire  vo      p          but it seems the said earl of cork was afterward sadly plundered of his great estate for at the breaking out of the civil wars he wrote these words in a letter to another nobleman thus your lordship sees in what miserable condition we are fighting night and day to preserve ourselves and our castles for all we had without doors is lost and poor i that besides my house demesne parks ironworks fishings and other commodities had a revenue of fifty pounds per diem cannot now truly say that i have fifty pounds per ann in certain revenue thus in the earl of corks letter to the lord newbourgh chancellor of the exchequer in ireland ms in the harleyan library b h  0 c   sol  0    as for the estate at sherborne it appears he now settled it upon his son walter and that the deeds were drawn in midsummer this present year for so we have it from has own words this settlement as i understand it was of the remainder of the lease for    years for though the bishop of sarum dr henry cotton had the last year assigned over to the queen the fee and inheritance also of the said premises and her majesty granted the same by her letters patent to sir walter ralegh before her death yet he did not make them over to his son till the seventh year of her successor the reason of settling his estate upon his son at this time appears also to have risen from a challenge which he had lately received from sir amias preston who had been knighted at cadiz by the earl of essex since we last spoke of him and which ralegh says himself he intended to answer the cause of their quarrel i never could meet with in print or manuscript yet conceive ralegh had good reason on his side because he afterward showed publicly himself how deliberate he was in his preparations for it by sorting his writings and how resolved by settling his estate but from what excellent hands soever dr fuller received his information that upon some distaste sir amias sent ralegh this challenge we may be pretty certain from what ralegh has mentioned that the said information or this authors account of it is erroneous where he adds that sir walter declined it indeed i agree he might do so with ut any abatement to his valor wherein he had abundantly satisfied all possibility of suspicion and with great advancement of his judgment for having continues fuller a fair and fixed estate with wife and children child he should have said being a privycounsellor here he mistakes again and lordwarden of the stannaries my said author thinks sir walter looked upon it as an uneven lay to stake himself against sir amias a private and single person though of good birth and courage yet of no considerable estate but if ralegh did accept of the challenge as it appears plainly he did when he might have had such fair reason of evasion those inequalities in preston will either prove sir walter a generous adversary or that the injury he received from sir amias was indispensable now this representation seems to have been officiously and unnecessarily shaped to make raleghs actions conformable with his writings for continues our said author this is consonant to what he has written so judiciously about duels condemning those for ill honors where the hangman gives the garland this curious and copious digression against duels which that author alludes to is in sir walter raleghs history of the world lib v cap iii s xvii sect   sir walter has also in his instructions to his son written a chapter against private quarrels in which he no less wisely than bravely says thou shall be in as much danger in contending with a brawler in a private quarrel as in a battle wherein thou may get honor to thyself and safety to thy prince and country but if thou be once engaged carry thyself bravely that they may fear thee after and a little further i would not have thee for any respect lofe thy reputation or endure public disgrace for better it were not to live than to live a coward if the offense proceed not from thyself if it does it shall be better to compound it upon good terms than to hazard thyself for if thou overcome thou art under the cruelty of the law if thou art overcome thou art dead or dishonored etc  however they were afterward reconciled as fuller concludes and upon the whole sir walter ralegh seems to have shown a much more creditable conduct herein than sir francis vere a little while before had done in the difference between him and a certain nobleman  but here we are no longer to take notice of such open adversaries for now in the very close of this year on the   th of march ends the long reign of glorious elizabeth and now sets the sun of raleghs external honor and felicity yet like that ever active planet will shine resplendently to the heavens when he is clouded or eclipsed to mankind how he fell into this eclipse record the only luminary of time past does but dimly or doubtfully discover all we can do is diligently to assemble every unextinguishd spark which darts any light this way then see if they will afford that guidance to the truth by being congregated which they have not yet been observed to yield asunder and first we may remember to have before read of the prepossessions which essex is affirmed to have instilled unto king james against ralegh and after the earls death there are several circumstances employing that cecyll did the like for though cecyll and ralegh joined against essex and his faction yet when these were overthrown they divided and seem to have had a trial of skill with one another and one author says that ralegh wanting strength though not wit to be the treasurers rival perished because not thought to own humility enough to be his servant it being more safe at court to have many enemies of equal power than one false ambitious friend that has attained to the absoluteness of command in short cecyll seems to have used those arts of insinuation with king james before his coming into england to which ralegh could not bend himself that he then held clandestine correspondences with scotland is apparent from that story in sir henry wotton who tells us that her majesty taking the air on blackheath attended by cecyll when the post rode by and hearing he came from scotland she called for his packet cecyll though he knew it contained letters which to discover were as so many serpents yet making more show of diligence than doubt to obey called in great haste for a knife to rip it up but approaching at some distance with it he told the queen it looked and smelled so illfavourdly coming out of the filthy budget that it must needs be aired first because he knew how offensive ill scents were to her majesty so got opportunity to separate what he would not have seen and she smelt nothing of the matter one talent above the rest cecyll was not wanting in to recommend him to this new sovereign and this was such a faculty of discovering plots as if he thought he should be looked on as useless without them  for as a noble author observes it seemed as necessary for him that there should be treasons as for the state that they should be prevented and though he created none yet he fomented some conspiracies that he might give frequent evidences of his loyalty having not the advantage of others in person to gain estimation therefore did it by these eminent services and as for king james he was so apprehensive so susceptible of such impressions that when he was but crossed or disturbed in his sports he would charge people with treason nay we are particularly told by those who were otherwise friends to his memory that his carver once at table giving him accidentally a nick on the finger as he was routing in the dish his majesty at the sight of his own blood could not forbear calli ng out treason and that gustavus adolphus king of sweden was wont to make himself merry with this expression and all this instanced by my said author to show that for any clamor of this kind king james s word was no slander but more directly to our purpose there is another writer who making some critical enquiry into the preliminaries of sir walter s fall says sir robert cecyll principal secretary of state fearing the great abilities of ralegh and being wearied with the troublesome impertinences of gray and cobham all which had joined with him in design against the earl of essex their common enemy had done their errand to king james whose counsels he desired to engross to himself alone before his coming into england and when the king was arrived there was matter enough to exasperate cecyll against ralegh if through any design of recrimination sir walter did present to his majesty a memorial wherein he reflected heavily upon cecyll in the matter of essex and vindicating himself threw the whole blame upon the other further laying open at the end thereof the conduct of cecyll and his father also in the matter of the queen of scots his majestys mother bitterly charging the death of this unfortunate queen upon them however says my author this had no influence over the king and only irritated cecyll the more against ralegh  but what seems sufficient to have incensed the king also against ralegh was his being of that party who in regard of the inveterate feuds between england and scotland desired the king might be obliged to articles for as another writes among these noble and public spirits were sir john fortescue sir walter ralegh the lord cobham etc all frowned upon after by the king who had yet the luck to live so long as to change his opinion and wish the number of his countrymen had been limited and they not suffered like locusts to devour this kingdom there were not wanting still other particulars which might render ralegh obnoxious to a man of the kings jealous disposition for he had at the time of his majestys accession to the throne the daughter and heir of basset to his ward who was to be married to his son walter her estate worth  000 l per annum but she was after his condemnation we suppose taken from him and married to mr henry howard who died suddenly at table and she was afterward married to the earl of newcastle who professed he would never have wedded her if young walter ralegh had been alive conceiving her before god to be his wife for they were married as much as children could be now these bassets as we find elsewhere were those of umberlegh and heanton court in devonshire who being descended from the plantagenets laid some claim at this very time of the kings entrance to the crown of england sir robert basset by his grandmother descended from the plantagenets and of the blood royal in the beginning of king jamess reign made some pretensions to the crown of england but not being able to make them good was forced to fly into france to save his head to compound for which together with his generous way of living he greatly exhausted his estate selling off no less than  0 manors of land though there is now a fair estate belonging to the heir of the family princes worthies of devon fol     see also woods ath oxon vol i col       but whatever discountenance ralegh might receive at his first meeting of the king in his journey from scotland sir richard bakers chronicle also sir john hawles in his reply to the magistracy and government of england vindicated etc fol      more expressly says cobham and ralegh were not permitted to come at the king upon his journey into england and had word sent them they might spare their labor but stow says when the king came toward york his train increased by such numbers of gentleman from the south as made provisions so dear that he was fain to publish an inhibit on against the inordinate access so that many were stopped in their way thus perhaps the countermand might not be particular of any person however some as we see apply it to ralegh as others have also done to cobham affirming the king checked him for his absence from his charge at that dangerous time being then lordwarden of the cinque ports whence he set out on the  th of april   0  and arrived at theobalds which was cecylls seat on the  d of may and at london four days after it seems not to have amounted to a peremptory dismission from his majestys service or presence for we are told the king used ralegh for some weeks with great kindness and was pleased to acknowledge diverse presents which he had received from him being in scotland for which he gave him thanks but finding him a martial man addicted to foreign affairs and great actions he feared left he should engage him in a war that ralegh was in company with the king and that some of his conversation turned upon this subject we have from his own words where he says i offered his majesty at my uncle carews to carry  000 men to invade the spaniards without the kings charge and this agrees with his writing a discourse which he did or intended to deliver to his majesty against the peace with spain now in treaty which seems to be the same that was  00 years afterward published by his grandson herein he advised his majesty to protect the netherlands for says he a poor neighbors house set on fire is to be better guarded or watched than a great city afar off herein he persuades the king to deliberate and not come to a hasty conclusion of peace with the spaniards for when the house is built it is ill mending the foundation herein he says i dare not write all i desire for i know not to whose hands these may come this i beseech your majesty to know that it proceeds from an humble and a faithful heart which your majesty cannot beat from the love of your royal person and good estate and lastly i shall observe that herein he also mentions another discourse how war may be made against spain and the indies which i will says he also present your majesty if you will vouchsafe the reading thereof but this i think has never appeared in print the former of these discourses is humbly and discreetly addressed with variety of arguments and observations from his own knowledge and experience also strengthened with many historical examples of foreign countries and political maxims or sentences from the ancient classicks all which he had plentifully at command in any topic he undertook to write or even speak of such the extensiveness of his remarks and his reading such the felicity of his memory and talents of application but if reason would have prevailed it was not wanting also from other hands so that sir walter ralegh was not singular in his dissuasions of the king but had the satisfaction of seeing foreigners as well as his own countrymen subscribe to his senitments and the lord henry howard though otherwise brought into the courtmeasures yet could not it seems consent to these of a general pacification therefore was as well as ralegh excluded from the benefit of those rich presents which the marquis of rosny ambassador from france made to all those courtiers who promoted the same insomuch that howard being asked by the king how it happened he had not a jewel as well as the rest answered in allusion to esops fable non sum gallus itaque non reperi gemmam the causes which moved the king of spain to sue for this peace ralegh did afterward with great perspicuity lay open ralegh lays down five reasons for the king of spains making this peace with england and the netherlands as first his having so exhausted his treasure that he was no longer able to maintain the archdukes army secondly the great interruption of his trade and losses of his merchants to the breaking of both his banks at seville thirdly his fear that the english and netherlanders would plant in the west indies fourthly to recruit his coffers and enable himself to break into war again fifthly that the english may decline and forget the passages and pilctage to the west indies and their seaofficers may be worn out for except a little trade for tobacco there is not a ship that sails that way and seeing the spaniards may hang up the english or put them to death by torments as they do and that the english dare not offend the spaniards in those parts a most notable advantage gotten in the conclusion of the peace it is certain that the english will give over that navigation to the infinite advantage of the spanish king both present and future for these causes of importance it was that the catholic king sought the peace of england and the netherlands and so much all men of judgment discern see these reasons more at large in sir walter raleghs dialogue between a jesuit and a recusan among the genuine remains published at the end os an abridgment of his history of the world by philip ralegh esquire  vo   00 but his present opposition of it and the consequences of that seem to have been the hinges upon which his whole fortune now turned i say the most apparent cause to me of all those sorrows and sufferings which fill up the melancholy remains of his story this unfortunate event which he was above shunning by trimming and temporising in a matter which he knew so highly concerned the honor and advantage of his country he has himself so excellently accounted for where he shows the ill success which attends such sincere conduct and how prosperity is the fruit of slavish or hypocritical compliances in a curious discourse where he learnedly and religiously reconciles fortune with reason and providence ralegh has these words but may it be objected that if fortune and chance were not sometimes the causes of good and evil in men but an idle voice whereby we express success how comes it then that so many worthy and wise men depend upon so many unworthy and emptyheaded fools that riches and honor are given to external men and without kernel and so many learned virtuous and valiant men wear out their lives in poor and dejected estates in a word there is no other inferior or apparent cause besides the partiality of mens affection but the fashioning and not fashioning ourselves according to the nature of the times wherein we live for whosoever is most able and best sufficient to discern and has withal an honest and open heart and loving truth if princes or those who govern endure no other discourse than their own flatteries then i say such a one whose virtue and courage forbids him to be base and a dissembler shall evermore hang under the wheel which kind of deserving well and receiving ill we always falsely charge fortune withal for whosoever shall tell any great man or magistrate that he is not just the general of an army that he is not valiant and great ladies that they are not fair shall never be made a counselor a captain or a courtier neither is it sufficient to be wise with a wise prince valiant with a valiant and just with him that is just for such a one has no estate in his prosperity but he must also change with the successor if he be of contrary qualities sail with the tide of the time and alter form and condition as the state or statesmaster changes otherwise how were it possible that the most base men and separate from all imitable qualities could so often attain to honor and riches but by such an observant slavish course a little further having quoted out of menander that every fool is won with his own pride and the flattering applause of others he infers that whosoever will live altogether out of himself study other mens humors and observe them shall never be unfortunate on the contrary that man who prizes truth and virtue except the season wherein he lives be of these and all sorts of goodness fruitful shall never prosper by the possession or profession thereof so after other learned authorities and proper examples concludes with the following ingenious allusions whosoever therefore will set before him machiavels two marks to shoot at riches and glory must set on and take off a back of iron to a weak wooden bow that he may fit both the strong and the feeble for as he who first devised to add sails to rowing vessels did either so proportion them as being fastened aloft and toward the head of his mast he might abide all winds and storms or else he some time or other perished by his own invention so that man who prizes virtue for itself and cannot endure to hoist and strike sail as the diverse natures of calms and storms require must cut his sails and his cloth of mean length and breadth and content himself with a slow and sure navigation to wit a mean and free estate sir walter raleghs history of the world lib i cap   sect    that i could not but from the said occasion of the greatest vicissitude in his life form the introduction to this account of it  thus have we seen several circumstances and these are all i have met with in this interval whereby ralegh might undesignedly and unluckily become disagreeable to a man of king jamess temper but on the other side little or nothing that could so inflame ralegh against the king as to make him run headlong into such violent conspiracies as could only end in his own ruin suppose the king did discourage raleghs attendance upon him at his entrance dislike his patent for wines or removed him from the guards to oblige sir thomas erskine his countryman and favorite whom he afterward preferred to higher dignities and this is all i have met with that could give offense on the kings part will this be thought sufficient provocation for a man of raleghs reason and judgment so tender of fame and reputation so settled in family so well situated in his fortune no less than  000 l a year as was confessed at his trial besides many other profitable and i may say princely possessions on the seas as well as the land to plot commotions or insurrections yet enervate himself for the execution of them by resigning as he says himself he did his office of chiefest power the wardship of the stannaries nay further to herd with a motley and disjointed crew of priests also with professed enemies to himself not to mention knaves and fools and on a sudden resolve to turn rebel ruian and cutthroat to be the coryphaeus to murder the king with his own hand and all his innocent progeny for this is the charge that the fertile pens of french writers have heaped upon him indeed i was somewhat startled when i read it in a history that bears the name and character of thuanus though i thought he might possibly come at it by ministerial direction to an english resident till at last i found his author to be no other than one of his own countrymen whom camden as i have before observed has refuted in other passages that are even more credible now these tell over this desperate story thus in the month of june sir walter ralegh a man equally dexterous at consultation or action says thuanus and famous for his memorable expeditions to the indies taking leave of his sister at london entreated her to commend him to god in her prayers for he was going to a place from whence he expected never to return she suspecting that he was going to fight a duel with the same levity dispersed it among the ladies of her acquaintance till the rumor came to court then raleghs friends and relations flocked about him to know this enterprise he apprehending himself detected readily made a whole confession and discovery of the matter the king was informed and greatly astonished but would needs have ralegh before him who then asking his pardon acknowledged that seeing his majesty give more countenance to the scots than the english and had deprived him of his command in the guards and that many great men expected when he was established on the throne he would be revenged for the death of his mother he had therefore entered into a conspiracy with others whom he named to shed his royal blood and that they had unanimously deputed him to be his majestys executioner when he rode a hunting hereupon the said conspirators were taken up and tried as these authors proceed to relate if there had been any truth in this ridiculous story which i think no one before has taken the pains to relate in english that confession had neither escaped the attorney general coke at raleghs trial when they were so lamely put to it to bring him in guilty without sufficient proof nor king jamessapologetical declaration after raleghs death in which his majesty and his council together have no less lamely offered weaker reasons for taking away his life as will be fully represented in its proper place  by our english accounts it appears there was somewhat of a plot but it was never proved that ralegh was engaged in it however his great enemy the attorney general coke affected to compare him with the conspirators to sampson s foxes which were joined in the tails though their heads were severed what share he had in that plot may further be judged by the promotions which the conspirators intended themselves upon the success of it for whereas one was to be lordchancellor another lordmarshal this lordtreasurer that master of the horse and the other secretary of state how comes it as one author well observes that ralegh able to officiate any had no office in the state assigned him but perhaps the best means to clear him may be the very trial by which he was condemned it is too common and too tedious to be thought needful of transcribing it here at length not to say so full of barbarous partiality and foul language especially by coke himself that he was exposed for it upon the public theater and those who revere the laws of our country have been so ashamed of it as rather to wish the proceedings have been falsely related than believe such a sentence could pass upon such insufficient evidence but the character of this trial and of that attorney general i leave to others and shall here only from the several copies or accounts of it i have met with draw out a short regular narrative of the most material matters of fact wherein ralegh appears any way concerned and it is as follows  there was one matthew de laurencie a merchant of antwerp attendant on count aremberg who now about the beginning of june came over ambassadorextraordinary from albert archduke of austria to congratulate king james and assist in composing the general peace with this merchant the lord cobham had held intelligence some years before upon matters of state with license five days after arembergs arrival that is to say about the  th of the same month cobham repaired to him with laurencie and that night cobham supped with sir walter ralegh at durhamhouse in the strand whereby ralegh came to understand that cobham had fresh negociations with aremberg and was as the chief of those who refused the peace offered a sum of money by cobham to be a promoter of it though that offer also made to ralegh before aremberg came was afterward pretended as will appear to have been for treasonable purposes in the next month those persons with whom cobham transacted the conspiracy or part of it then on foot were discovered either by the spanish faction in revenge to ralegh the greatest enemy of spain alive thinking he was then too far hampered in or acquainted with it to escape or by some one of the english conspirators to secure himself and when the lord cecyll for he was lately made baron of essenden found upon the first news of anthony copley one of these conspirators who was apprehended the  th of july that the kings person was to be surpised by the lord gray of wilton and george brook brother to the lord cobham he suspected cobham himself was in the secret and cobhams great intimacy with ralegh at this time who was now buying an estate for him and settling his household affairs drew ralegh also into suspicion  hereupon cecyll meeting ralegh upon windsor terrace tells him the lords of the council had something to say to him so he was examined about the surprising treason and particularly about cobham as appears from his own words whom he fully cleared after examination ralegh further said whatsoever correspondence there was between cobham and aremberg laurencie might be better able to give account of it therefore advised to the calling upon him though as he further explained he knew of no intelligence between them but such as might be warranted and that advice he wrote also in a letter to cecyll when ralegh returned from examination a private prisoner to his own house cobham sent him to know what had passed ralegh writ an answer by capt feymis that he was examined and had cleared him of all and keymis bid cobham be of good comfort for one witness could not condemn him this precaution to arm cobham against making discoveries was after his confession of it objected against ralegh but he utterly denied that he sent any such verbal message now when cobham was brought to his examination at richmond one date whereof appears to have been july    and after he had by a constant denial cleared both himself and ralegh of all that was questioned against them cobham was by device says my author in an epistolary narrative of his trial at which he was present induced to think that ralegh had first impeached and betrayed him for that part of raleghs letter aforesaid to cecyll referring the lords to laurencie for cobhams transactions with aremberg being showed to cobham and accompanied it seems with such artful suggestions as were proper to inflame a man of cobhams weakness had the desired effect for he being led thereby to imagine that ralegh had accused him of all or more than he knew burst out into vehement exclamations against ralegh and in his rage or madness made the following confession that having a passport to go to the spanish king he intended first to confer with the archduke and because he knew he had not money to pay his own army meant from thence to go to spain to deal with the king for  000000 crowns then to return by jersey and that nothing should be done about the distribution of that money to the discontented in england till he had spoken with sir walter ralegh further that he had never entered into these courses but by his instigation he spoke also of plots but of the particulars could give no account yet acknowledged he was afraid that ralegh upon his return to jersey would have him and the money to the king after all this before cobham departed to the stairfoot he retracted his confession and professed he had done ralegh wrong nor does it appear says my author that he did subscribe it in another branch of his examination cobham said he had of ralegh a book written against the kings title which he gave to his brother brook and that ralegh said it was foolishly written but this he also retracted as we shall hear upon this and other parts of his confession more foreign to ralegh concerning the advancement of lady arabella stuart to the crown as also from that of george brook a known enemy to ralegh as cecyll could not deny asserting his brother cobham told him though cobham in his confession refused to own it the lord gray and others were only on the bye but he and ralegh were on the main thereby meaning said brook the taking away of the king and his issue together with what ralegh acknowledged in his own examination that cobham offered him  000 crowns for his furtherance of the peace though the lord cecyll and earl of northumberland were to have the same proffers and that in some discourses he might have said the way to invade england was to begin with stirs in scotland upon these circumstances i say ralegh was indicted at stanes on the   st of september following and from hence that heavy indictment appears to have been accumulated upon him which we see prefixed to his trial three days afterward cobham and gray were also indicted at the same place and not long after this they were all three returned prisoners to the tower of london when the time of their trial drew nigh that is to say in the beginning of november ralegh got a poor fellow in the tower to cast up a letter fastened to an apple in at cobhams window while the lieutenant was at supper to entreat him because he then knew not but cobham might be arraigned before him for gods sake to do him justice by his answer and signify to him that he had wronged him in his accusation and cobham did by an answer under his hand confess the same which not being perhaps so full and expressive as ralegh expected he afterward sent cobham another letter desiring he would publish his innocence at his arraignment but notwithstanding that ralegh did not now request any further justification under his hand cobham sent him another answer clearing him in the most solemn and perfect manner as will presently appear now by reason of the plague which raged so violently in and about london the term having been proclaimed to be held at winchester the state prisoners who were thus indicted for the plot were conveyed thither in great pomp i find that ralegh went in his own coach under the custody of sir robert mansell on the  0th of november to bagshot in surrey twenty four miles from london and two days after from thence the other thirty miles to the castle at winchester the conspirators conducted thither at the same time were george brook under the charge of sir william wade sir griffin markham under sir robert worth besides sir edward parham bartholomew brookshy anthony copley also william watson and william clark two priests underwardens of the tower and the keeper of the gate house together with a guard of fifty light horse as for cobham and gray they set out six days and arrived three days before at the said castle under the like guard  and here cobham having been prevailed on to make fresh accusations in a letter to the lords at least subscribed with his name which will be produced a little further raleghs trial was first brought on and this was on the   th of the month aforesaid he excepted not against his jury being all strangers but we are told by one who seems to have had good intelligence of this matter that there was appointed for ralegh another jury the foreman of which was sir michael stanhope the next sir edward darcy the next sir william killegrew all men of honor and near servants to the late queen elizabeth but these being found not for their turn they were all changed over night and those others named in the common printed trial put in their places after the indictment had been opened and aggravaed sergeant heath and attorney coke in speeches manifestly fathering the treasons of the rest upon ralegh for no other reason that i can see but because he was a man of wit and a swordsman cobhams examination was read as before quoted here ralegh first showed the unreasonableness and improbability of the accusation therein against him as follows it is strange for me said he to devise with cobham that he should go to spain to persuade the king to disburse so much money he being a man of no love in england and i having resigned my room of chiefest command the wardenship of the stannaries it is strange for me to make myself a robin hood or a ket or a cade i knowing england to be in a better state than ever it was i knew scotland united ireland quieted denmark assured which before was suspected i knew that having a lady whom time had surprised we had now a lawful successor the state of spain was not unknown to me i had written a discourse which i intended to present unto the king against the peace with spain i knew the spaniard had six repulses three in ireland and three at sea and once in      by my lordadmiral also at cadiz i knew he was discouraged and dishonored i knew the king of spain to be the proudest prince living but now he comes creeping to my master for a peace i knew whereas he had before in his ports six or seven score sail of ships he has now but six or seven i knew of twentyfive millions he had from his indies he has scarce one left i knew him so poor that the jesuits in spain were fain to beg at the churchdoor was it ever read or heard that any prince should disburse so much money without a sufficient pawn i knew her own subjects the citizens of london would not lend her majesty money without lands in mortgage i knew the queen did not lend the states money without flushing brill and other towns for a pawn and can it be thought he would let cobham have so great a sum i never came to the lord cobham s but about matters of his profit as the ordering of his house and i had of his when i was examined four thousand pounds worth of jewels for a purchase a pearl of three thousand pounds and a ring worth five hundred pounds if he had had a fancy to run away he would not have left so much money to have purchased a lease in feefarm i saw him buy three hundred pounds worth of books to send to his library at canterbury and a cabinet of three hundred pounds to give mr attorney for drawing the conveyances and god in heaven knows not i whether he intended to travel but for the practice with arabella or letters to aremberg or any discourse with him or in what language he spoke unto him if i knew any of these things i would absolutely confess the indictment and acknowledge myself worthy of a thousand deaths and a little further concerning cobhams examination he that has been examined has ever been asked if it be according to his meaning and then to subscribe methinks my lords when he accuses a man he should give some account and reason of it it is not sufficient to say we talked of it if i had been the plotter would not i have given cobham some arguments whereby to persuade the king of spain and answer his objections i knew westmoreland and bothwell men of other understandings than cobham were ready to beg their bread here being obstructed by other matters the attorney fell at last into that passage of cobhams telling brook you are on the bye ralegh and i are on the main but cobham would not confirm his ever having said such words brook who had pretended he did say them was allowed to have been raleghs enemy so the expression was not proved another matter they kept some coil about was the book cobham said he had of ralegh written against the kings title this was nothing more than a defense of the queens proceedings against mary queen of scotland written by one robert snag a lawyer and found by ralegh in the library of the late lordtreasurer burghley which he had liberty of searching for some geographical descriptions of the west indies ralegh had declared to cobham that it was foolishly written but denied that he gave it him and though cobham in his examination said it was given him by ralegh he revoked that confession upon being further questioned about it as one of the lords of the council owned and said the truth was he took the same of himself out of sir walter raleghs study when he was asleep so much to be depended on were lord cobhams accusations but there was nothing acted thereby to the kings prejudice for the book was burnt as for the evidence of a rumor in lisbon brought into court by one dyer a pilot who answering to a question when the king would be crowned made by somebody or other there that he hoped twould be shortly was told again it should never be for don ralegh and don cobham would cut his throat first ralegh made light of it as of such a rumor and such a witness he might and said if cobham had practice with aremberg it might well be known abroad and that the duke of buckingham was named with jack straw s treason to countenance it but none of these little circumstances were much insisted on and we are told by one who was present that touching the setting up of arabella nothing at all was proved nor touching the invasion here or sedition in scotland or even the destruction of the king etc the proof against ralegh as the same writer continues a little further did rest only upon cobham s accusation and some presumptions whereof that only was the ground therefore ralegh spent most of the time in disabling that accusation as being only uttered in fury and passion through the device aforesaid of making cobham believe that ralegh had first accused him besides that he had renounced and repented it and although afterward by practice says my said author he did affirm it yet would he never be brought to set his hand to the examination all which was clear then ralegh seeing this retraction so unjustly overlooked labored to prove these two points out of scripture civil law statute law common law and conscience in every of which he had been plentifully read as the same auditor of his arraignment goes on first that there ought to be produced against him two witnesses secondly that his accuser might be brought to accuse him face to face agreeable here to are raleghs own words after he had urged the statutes of edward iii edward vi and queen elizabeth produced the opinions of judges in the law and precedents from their writings besides testimonies from the old and new testament where he says if by the statute civil law and gods word it be required that there must be two witnesses at least hear with me if i desire but one but truly it was an unreasonable request those statutes were repealed and the law would not allow of it now though we are informed that king james himself taking notice how cobham was withheld should say if he could have spoken any thing against ralegh they would have brought him from constantinople to have accused him well therefore might he desire the jury to consider there is no cause so doubtful which the kings counsel cannot make good against the law these men do usually defend bad causes every day against men of their own profession and as able as themselves if they can do so what may they not do with me who never studied law till i came into the tower of london who have been practiced in other affairs am weak of memory and feeble as you see for he was fain to have a pen and ink to help him in the long speeches that were made against him then said he more closely to them if you would be content to be judged upon suspicions and inferences if you would not have your accusation subscribed by your accuser if you would not have your accuser brought to your face being in the same house too where you are arraigned if you would be condemned by an accusation of one that has recanted and is truly sorrowful for it if you in my case would yield your bodies to torture lose your lives your wives and children and all your fortunes upon so slender a proof then am i ready to suffer all these things or as the common trial has it if you would be contented to be so judged judge so of me now though ralegh at last put himself on it that if cobham would only speak before god and the king that ever he knew either of arabella s matter or the money out of spain or of the surprising treason or would accuse him with things equivalent in any main point or any ways to have been an instigator of him to deal with the king of spain yet would they not let cobham confront him or give his testimony viva voce and though ralegh did not directly consent to be determined by cobhams accusation if they should now produce it justified under his hand yet he was forced to submit to what they had in reserve of this kind which was the letter above mentioned written to the lords at winchester the day before the trial some say this letter was not written by cobham himself but that sir william wade one of cecylls creatures tampering with his weakness got cobham to write his name to a blank to which says my author wade no question wrote the accusation others imply that cobham did himself write it though after he was instructed by a letter from his lady that there was no way to save his own life but to accuse ralegh and that it was so reported upon the going together of the jury this letter was read with great triumph and exultation by coke as follows i have thought it fit to set down this to my lords wherein i profess on my soul to write nothing but the truth i am come now near to the period of my time therefore i confess the truth before god and his angels ralegh four days before i came from the tower caused an apple to be thrown in at my chamberwindow the effect of it was to entreat me to right the wrong i had done him in saying that i would come home by jersey which under my hand to him i have retracted his first letter was thrown in the same manner wherein he prayed me to write him a letter which i did he sent me word the judges met at mr attorney s house and that there was good hope the proceedings against us should be staid he sent me another time a little tobacco at aremberg s coming ralegh dealt with me to procure him a pension of fisteen hundred pounds a year for which he promised that no action should be against spain but he would give knowledge beforehand he told me the states had audience with the king he has been the original cause of my ruin for i had no dealing with aremberg but by his instigation he has been the cause of my coffeehouse he advised me not to be overtaken with preachers as essex was and that the king would better allow of a constant denial than to accuse any but this advice to a denial and by that example and the desire of any such pension from spain ralegh protested to be false and further to show them what a base dishonorable recreant cobham was he pulled out the letter which cobham a few days before wrote to him voluntarily in the tower desiring the lord cecyll to read it because he knew his hand and that the jury would observe if cobhams testimony were of any credit with them how much more solemnly it was writ to clear than the other to condemn him being in these words seeing myself so near my end for the discharge of my own conscience and freeing myself from your blood which else will cry vengeance against me i protest upon my salvation i never practiced with spain by your procurement god so comfort me in this my affliction as you are a true subject for any thing that i know i will say with daniel purus sum a sanguine hujus so god have mercy on my soul as i know no treason by you this was the last evidence given yet the jury brought in their verdict guilty this letter last produced to acquit ralegh not prevailing with them so much it seems as the letter before which was last though less forcibly written by cobham to accuse him which all things considered says the person who heard the whole trial was no more to be weighed than the barking of a dog and i would not continues he for much to have been of the jury to have found him guilty some of his jury we are further told were after he was cast so far touched in conscience as to demand of him pardon on their knees and even coke the attorney himself being retired into a garden to take some air when his man brought him word that the jury had condemned ralegh of treason answered surely thou art mistaken for i myself accused him but of misprision of treason and this relation upon the word of a christian i have received says my author from sir edward cokes own mouth sentence being given ralegh humbly desired the king might know the proofs against him that he still persisted in his loyalty notwithstanding that verdict which he would pray that his said jury might never answer for and only craved pardon for concealing lord cobhams offer to him which he did through a confidence that he had diverted him from those humors so accompanied the sheriff to the prison with admirable erection yet in such sort as a condemned man should do  thus was he tired out of his life as one observes by the bawling of the kings counsel on one side and the benchs insisting on a confession extorted from the lord cobham out of fear on the other rather than convinced and thus did his adversaries reap dishonor and reproach in their victory while he received triumphant applauses in his overthrow like some flowers which are sweeter in their fall than others in their bloom he stood at a bay with them from morning till night to the great admiration of the hearers who all thought that a man of such understanding and experience would hardly be drawn into a plot so soul and so foolish diverse who went thither his enemies went away with commiseration of his injuries and misfortunes thinking never man spoke better for himself one of his auditors says he behaved himself so worthily so wisely so temperately that in half a day the mind of all the company was changed from the extremest fate to the extremest pity and another says that sir walter ralegh s carriage was most remarkable first to the lords humble yet not prostrate toward the jury affable but not fawning rather showing love of life than fear of death toward the kings counsel patient but not insensibly neglecting not yielding to imputations laid against him in words and it was wondered that a man of his heroic spirit could be so valiant in suffering that he was never overtaken in passion etc on the other side as to cokes behavior we shall to what has been said only observe as one means to account for it that it essex was known to have ever been in any wise a friend or patron to him as it appears he was in a private memorial of an honorable person who was of the same college in oxford with ralegh and almost of the same standing then coke might perhaps think of retrieving himself in the eye of the world and making atonement for his ingratitude to the said earl also at his trial and to his memory after his death by his inhumanity now to one of the contrary faction cecyll on the other side played a smooth edge upon ralegh throughout the trial his blade seemed ever anointed with the balsam of compliment or apology whereby he gave not such rough and smarting wounds though they were as deep and fatal as the other but ralegh could distinguish crooked friendship and perhaps the grounds of it in this place as well as he has done crooked wisdom in another when to those speeches where cecyll said my affection to you sir walter ralegh was not extinguished but slaked in regard of your deserts and excepting your faults i call them no worse by god i am your friend he answered whoever is the workman it is reason he should give account of his work to the workmaster as to any impertinences that occurred in the trial they appear no where so much as in the personal reflections made by the said attorney coke and the lord chief justice popham whom camden justly calls a censorious man they being foreign to the matters ralegh was charged with therefore he wisely looked over them but these and the other irregularities throughout the whole proceedings which have left men so unsatisfied in the justice of them against sir walter ralegh and so little inclined to believe him the criminal his enemies made him being summed up by an able hand and one whose province it more properly was to judge of them i shall take my leave of the said trial with a reference to his observations on it sir john hawles solicitor general to the late king william in his reply to a sheet of paper entitled the magistracy and government of england vindicated printed in fol      having observed that the accusations of sir walter ralegh did not amount to a legal proof says further p    as follows not to mention all that might be excepted to in the trial of the case cited i would know by what law is the deposition of a person who might be brought face to face to the prisoner read as evidence i would know by what law it is forbidden that the accuser should be brought face to face to the accused i would know by what law brooks deposition of what the lord cobham told him of ralegh was evidence against ralegh i would know by what law the story dyer told of what an unknown man said to him at lisbon of don ralegh was evidence against ralegh i would know by what statute the statutes of the   th of edward iii and the  th of edward vi are repealed this trial was so very irregular throughout that i would willingly believe it was not so as it is related but if it were so i am sure none can defend it and even for that reason if any such resolution was in the case as is cited i am sure it ought to carry no credit with it and there is no reason to believe there was any such resolution there being no occasion for it the question being only fact which sir walter denied the circumstances of his trial in which the court always overruled the prisoner were somewhat like the lord russels he complained of the ill usage of the kings counsel as well as the lord russel and both had reason so to do hearsay was admitted to be given in evidence against both all that either of them said for themselves though very material was slighted the one was put in mind at his trial of the death of the earl of essex as the other was of the death of the viscount stafford both in their dying speeches vindicated themselves of those aspersions the principal witnesses in both cases had before the trials asfirmd they knew nothing against them they were both accused with having heard what other persons had said in their company and had not discovered it they both gave the same answer that they could not help other mens talk i think it is plain at this day that of sir walter ralegh is thought a shamplot what the lord russels is thought let the author say   that ralegh expected nothing less than this kind of treatment from those hands is plain by the letter which he wrote to the king himself just before his trial wherein having said i know that among many presumptions gathered against me your majesty has been persuaded that i was one of those who were greatly discontented and therefore the more likely to prove disloyal but the great god of heaven and earth disclaim me from both worlds if i were not the contrary and if i took not great comfort to behold your majesty always learning some good and bettering my knowledge by your majestys discourse and having humbly beseeched him not to believe any of those who under pretense of offenses to kings do easily work their particular revenge he says a little further for my part i protest before the everliving god that i never intended treason consented to treason or performed treason against you and yet i know i shall fall into their hands e quibus non possum evadere unless by your majestys gracious compassion i be sustained another letter which he wrote to the lords gives us some further light or assurance that the offer made to him for one intention and to others for another was construed as made to him for both where speaking of the two principal accusations against him he says the first was that money was offered me with a pretense to maintain the amity but the intent was to have assisted his majestys surprise the other that i was privy to my lord cobhams spanish journey for the first it seems this money was offered to others long after it was offered to me and upon other considerations than it was to me for myself i avow upon my allegiance that i never knew or suspected either the man or the new intention to me it was but once propounded and in three weeks after i never heard more of it neither did i belive that he had any commission to offer it for it that word amity had been used to me colourably i must have been also made acquainted with the true end for which it should have been given which it seems was for the surprise but of any such horrible purpose if ever i had so much as a suspicion i refuse your lordships favor and the kings mercy i know your lordships have omitted nothing to find out the truth but as you have not erred like ill surgeons to lay on plasters too narrow for so great wounds so i trust that you will not imitate unlearned physicians to give medicines more cruel than the disease itself for the journey into spain i know i was accused to be privy thereto but i know your lordships have a reputation of conscience as well as industry by what means that revengeful accusation was stirred you my lord cecyll know right well that it was my letter about keymis and your lordships all know whether it be maintained or whether out of truth and out of a christian consideration it be revoked a little further he says as the kings counsel in raleghs trial used arguments grounded on presumptions to prove him guilty so did he there also use others to clear himself grounded on these of his great expenses against the spaniards and his having always been such a noted enemy to their faction but the sum of  0000 l in this letter above is only called so many crowns in the said common trial god knows and i can give an account of it that i have spent  0000 pounds of my own against that king and nation that i never reserved so much of all my fortunes as to purchase forty pounds per annum land that i have been a violent prosecutor and furtherer of all enterprises against that nation i have served against them in person and how my lord admiral and my lord of suffolk can witness i discovered myself the richest part of all his indies i have planted in his territories i offered his majesty at my uncle carews to carry two thousand men to invade him without the kings charge alas to what end should we live in the world if all the endeavors of so many testimonies should be blown off with one blast of breath or be presented by one mans word think therefore says he a little further i beseech you on my great affliction with compassion who lost my estate and the kings favor upon one mans word and as you would that god should deal with you deal with me he concludes in this manner your lordships know that i am guiltless of the surprise intended you know or may know that i never accepted of the money and that it was not offered me for any ill and of the spanish journey i trust your consciences are resolved keep not then i beseech you these my answers and humble desires from my sovereign lord qui est rex pius and misericors and non leo coronatus in another letter which he wrote to the king after his trial he has these words lost i am for hearing a vain man for hearing only and never believing or approving and so little account i made of that speech of his which was my condemnation that i never remembered any such thing till it was at my trial objected against me this letter he nobly concludes with a desire only to repay a lent life with a love and affection equal to the goodness wherewith his majesty should please to bestow it  if these letters had any good effect it appeared not immediately ralegh being kept near a month at winchester after he was condemned in daily expectation of death we find that when the report of the arraignments was made to the king in his privychamber at wilton he carried himself so reservedly that no body could guess how well he was satisfied with the equality of condemnation till he made himself a difference in the punishment the two priests were executed on the   th of november and george brook on the  th of december following his majesty also signed warrants for cobham gray and markham to be beheaded on the  th day of the said month but in the particular narrative of this proceeding to execution ralegh is not so much as mentioned and this might be owing to the extraordinary disappointment of that purgation which was expected from one of those three next to be executed for the day aforesaid being come markham was first brought to the scaffold and having ended his speech prayers with all he had to say and being on his knees ready to receive the stroke of the ax up steps john gibb groom of the kings bedchamber to sir benjamin tichbourne the sheriff of hampshire with his majestys warrant to stay the execution so markham was told he must withdraw a while into the hall to be confronted by the lords then lord gray was brought upon the stage and he is said to have poured out his prayers and his confession though not one word of them recorded in our narrative aforesaid then was he also called aside lastly cobham was brought and exposed in the same manner and his devotions to god are mentioned but not a word of the treason his guilt or innocence or concerning any promoter of his disloyalty or discontent so when he had done the sheriff found it time to unravel the plot by proclaiming and magnifying his majestys mercy as we have it in the same author who yet cannot forbear comparing his own relation to a comedy representing so many lively figures of justice and mercy in a king of terror and penitence in offenders and of so great admiration and applause in all others as appeared in this action carried on only and wholly by his majestys own direction but whereas coke had after his outrageous manner charged ralegh in the trial frequently with being the chief plotter and traitor in all this conspiracy we now see the king in his warrant aforesaid contradicting him where he says to use his own dialect that the tuo priestis and george brook vaire the principal plotteris and intisairs of all the rest to the embracing of the saidis treasonabill machinations and yet you find in the trial again that brooks treason was distinct and to be kept secret from ralegh because there brook tells markham take heed how you make lord cobham acquainted for whatever he knows ralegh the witch will get it out of him in short the whole proceeding is so full of inconsistences slanders and other like odious effects of a false and malicious prosecution that we may well conclude with that historian who says the king had ground enough to show mercy which some of the condemned party obtained  but ralegh it seems did last taste of it and for no other apparent reason but because he was the only one whom his enemies still wanted matter to exclude from it as may be gathered from what cecyll wrote to a correspondent three days after the kings warrant of suspense to the others before mentioned where among these wonderful instances of his majestys clemency we are told he pretended to forbear sir walter ralegh for the present till the lord cobham s death had given some light how far he would make good his accusation and though we hear not that he ever did make it good yet was the pretended time of raleghs execution so determined however we find not that he like the rest was ever brought to the place that he wrote what he intended for his last words to his wife the night before he expected to be put to death in a very moving letter full of the most generous acknowledgments of the wisest most religious and affectionate advice to her no less than of the most heroic and magnanimous sentiments in regard to himself and to that suffering which ordinary souls so naturally shrink at it is too long to recite in this place besides has been often printed and may be easily met with in his works the historical passages in it acquaint us that his lands were conveyed to his son as is before mentioned that he intended his wife the profits of his wineoffice half his goods and all his jewels except some one to his son that baily owed him two hundred or as other editions have it  000 pounds and his brother adrian gilber six hundred that he had also much money owing him in jersey besides the arrearages of the wines which would pay all his debts toward the conclusion he entreats her to get those letters if it be possible which i writ said he to the lords wherein i sued for my life god is my witness that it was for you and yours that i desired life but it is true that i disdain myself for begging it for know it dear wife that your son is the son of a true man and one who in his own respect despises death and all his misshapen and ugly forms i cannot write much god knows how hardly i steal this time while others sleep and it is also high time that i should separate my thoughts from the world beg my dead body which living was denied thee and either lay it at sherborne if the land continue or in exeter church by my father and mother i can say no more time and death call me away and as in the former part of this letter he trusts that his blood will quench their malice who had thus cruelly murdered him so in the conclusion he prays to god that he may forgive his persecutors and accusers  but after all this usage cobham never confirming his accusation of sir walter ralegh they both were with the rest of the prisoners returned on the   th of december to the tower of london those of whom the least profit was to be made were either acquitted or did afterward get their liberty among whom was markham who traveled abroad but endured greater distress in his state of freedom than he had in his restraint james wadsworth in his english spanish pilgrim  to    0 p    speaking of the state and demeanor of the english fugitives under the king of spains dominions says this sir griffin markham at his first arrival in bruxels being kept under by the jesuits was driven to such an exigency that he was constrained to pluck out the inlaid silver of the hilts of his sword to buy flour to make a hastypudding for his dinner but he afterward says the same author took the best way to raise his fortunes having got into favor with the duke of nubuge who gives him the surest pension of all but gray it seems died in the tower and with cobham it went nigh to fare still worse for he would have starved there being so closely fleeced as he was by the courtbeggars of his great estate had they not also laid thereby a kind of a fine upon his majesty for his offenses the crown being imposed upon to support him in his many years confinement as ralegh himself has sufficiently discovered and here to dispatch what more remains of this lord relating to our present history we may observe that some years after their confinement ralegh is said to have himself procured a reexamination of cobham and to have been absolutely cleared by him  but the practices which were used against him therein are represented so foul and wicked  the lord cecyll who was created earl of salisbury in   0 and lord treasurer upon the death of buckhurst earl of dorset in   0  did very much engross the revenues of the crown as ralegh made appear to the king himself in an excellent dialogue he dedicated to his majesty where among the particulars of cecylls neglecting an increase of  0000  to the kings estate the conferring a  0000 l fine upon devonshire and his mistress the engrossing to himself many goodly manors and the exchange of theobalds for hatfield which the greatest subject or favorite queen elizabeth had never durst have named to her he farther instances that it had been an honest service to the king to have also added  000 l lands of the lord cobhams with his woods and goods worth  0000 l more for those lands remaining with george brooks children but during their lives had been the kings for ever in effect but to wrest them from the king and draw the inheritance upon himself the treasurer persuaded his majesty to relinquish his interest for a petty sum of money and that there might be no counterworking he sent brook six thousand pounds to make friends whereof lord hume had two thousand pounds back again buckhurst and berwick had the other four thousand pounds and the treasurer and his heirs the mass of land for ever what then came to the king by this confiscation says one of the correspondents in the said dialogue his majesty answers the other by all those goodly possessions woods and goods loses five hundred pounds a year which he gives in pension to cobham to maintain him in prison see sir walter raleghs prerogative of parliaments in his remains last edit p     etc as to have given some whose interest it was to favor the administrations of these times occasion to suspect the assertion though it is corroborated by several material circumstances as well as the testimony of coeval writers the author in whom we first meet with this passage and whose shorter account of it is before related to show that raleghs life was surreptitiously taken away gives it us again more circumstantially and has a true story thus queen anne that brave princess was in a desperate and some believed incurable disease whereof the physicians were at the furthest end of their studies to find the cause at a non plus for the cure sir walter ralegh being by his long studies an admirable chemist undertook and performed the cure the author of aulicus coquinariae thinks he sufficiently answers this passage where he says p    the queen was never cured of her disease but by death that ends all maladies now the disease which this queen anne died of was a dropsy but not till after sir walter raleghs death and above fifteen years after this his imprisonment whereas the disease from which ralegh recovered her was a fever as dr welwood informs us in his notes on wilsons history of king james in the same place he says it was some time before the illness of prince henry and camden in his annals of king james telling us when sir julius caesar was made a privycounsellor we may conclude this cure was performed between the years   0  and      for which he would receive no other reward but that her majesty would procure that certain lords might be sent to examine cobham whether he had accused sir walter ralegh of treason at any time under his hand the king at the queens request and in justice could do no less sends some lords and others of the council which as our author goes on were the duke of lenox salisbury worcester suffolk sir george carew and sir julius caesar to demand of cobham whether he had not under his hand accused sir walter ralegh at winchester upon that treason he was arraigned for cobham did protest never nor could he but said he that villain wade did often solicit me and not prevailing that way got me by a trick to write my name upon a piece of white paper which i thinking nothing did so that if any charge came under my hand it was forged by that villain wade by writing something above my hand without my consent or knowledge an author has attempted to disprove this particular thus how could wade tamper with cobham to write his name to a blank to which wade framed the accusation against ralegh when it appears cobham never signed at all to his examinations aulic coquin p   0 but it is plain this trick of wades if such he committed could not be meant of cobhams examinations for they were taken at richmond and at london but the question here put was whether cobham had not under his hand accused sir walter ralegh at winchester which could relate only to this letter of accusation before quoted which was subscribed with cobhams name and pretended to be written by him the night before raleghs trial there these six returning to the king the rest made salisbury their spokesman who said sir my lord cobham has made good all that ever he wrote or said where it is to be noted that this was but an equivocating trick in salisbury for it was true that cobham had made good whatever he had writ but never wrote any thing to accuse ralegh by which you see the baseness of this lord the credulity of the king and the ruin of sir walter ralegh as for the miserable end this lord cobham made the same author relates it he tells us that as lord gray died pitied cobham died scorned and his death as base for he died lousy for want of apparel and linen and had starved had not a trencherscraper some time his servant in court relieved him with scraps in whose house he died being so poor a house as he was forced to creep up a ladder into a little hole to his chamber which was a strange judgment and unprecedented for a man of seven thousand pounds per annum and of a personal estate of thirty thousand pounds of all which the king was so cheated or of what should have escheated to him that he could not give him any maintenance as in all cases the king does unless out of his own revenue of the crown which was the occasion of this lords want his wife being very rich and would not give him the crumbs that fell from her table and this was a just judgment of god on him thus weldon p    etc osborne also much to the same sense tells us from the authority of william earl of pembroke that cobham died in a room ascended by a ladder at a poor womans house in the minories formerly his laundress rather of hunger than of any more natural disease thus miserable was his fate in meeting with a prince so inconsiderately profuse to strangers that he forgot the owner not leaving him wherewithal to buy bread an impiety not found among infidels who ever deemed it less injustice to take away life than the means to maintain it and it is also confirmed by others who were well acquainted with the history of these times and from whom we learn that cobham survived not sir walter ralegh above two or three months  but to return to more early passages in raleghs imprisonment and to consider his state as it appears at his entrance therein we may very easily believe he was at first in very great trouble to be so suddenly and in such a manner deprived of power fortune liberty and reputation but find nothing to confirm the extraordinary dejection one writer describes him under where he says in the public joy and jubilee of the whole realm when favor peace and pardon were offered even to offenders he who in wit in wealth in courage was inferior to few fell suddenly he cannot tell how into such a downfall of despair that his greatest enemies would not have wished him so much harm as he would have done himself for we have seen he had enemies who would have done him the injury that could not be exceeded had not the king in some degree of justice rather than mercy to him interposed and secured him as well from being quite destroyed by as taking revenge on them besides that letter to his wife beforementioned when his fate appeared nearest and most unavoidable to him demonstrates the firmness and fortitude of a man who could receive death as an acquaintance rather than a stranger or one who having so often gone to face him among the foes to his country abroad could with equal steadiness and composure of mind meet him from those at home indeed the affairs of a person who had such various and extensive dealings or commerce with mankind could not but be somewhat perplexed and embarrassd upon a fall so sudden and precipitous therefore to find him employing agents for collecting in debts and satisfying creditors is to be expected thus in one of his letters to sir michael hext he desires him to spare john shellbury for a little time he being bound for him in a sum of fifteen hundred pounds and if he was restrained so that he could not recover the winearrearages which as we find from raleghs letter before to his wife would clear all his debts they must remain unpaid the date endorsd upon this letter probably by sir michael himself is november      0  in the middle of february following we find a grant made by the king to that john shellbury and another person to this effect that sir walter ralegh late of sherborne etc being attainted of high treason whereby all his goods and chattels real and personal moveable and immovable debts duties sums of money bonds etc are forfeited his majesty therefore in consideration that the said debts which sir walter ralegh did truly owe before the said attainder and conviction may be justly and truly paid as also for the help and maintenance of dame elizabeth his wife his child and family and for other considerations grants to john shellbury and robert smith of london gentlemen all the said goods etc  thus we see a great distinction made already between him and cobham and shall find more favor extending toward him in a little while it is said to be much owing to the earnest and unwearied intercessions of his lady at court who that she might be more serviceable to him soon after he was committed to the tower petitioned the king that she might be a prisoner with her husband or live with him there in his confinement and her request was granted here manifestly after the grant aforesaid to raleghs trustees because that mentions but one of his sons she was delivered of the other and he was christened carew who was yet born as authors compute within the year abovementioned to this satisfaction ralegh had others afterward which greatly alleviated the loss of his liberty so that his restraint which was intended as a mortification his prudence in time so converted that it proved only a retirement or the quiet enjoyment of a domestic life and he felt certain comforts arise from the constant company of his little family which in the pomp of courts the pride of conquests the glory of discoveries and the sweetness of freedom itself he had never tasted but this tranquillity appears not to have suddenly arrived being for a while divested of all his estate and having some contentions at law with those who were considerably indebted to him and could not otherwise be brought to account one instance whereof we have in william sanderson the elder who was of kin to ralegh for the said william sanderson the elder who was much engaged among the merchantadventurers in queen elizabeths reign and one of her commissioners for the spanish prizegoods also of note for the great globes which by his encouragement were brought to perfection married about the year      margaret snedale or snowdale the daughter of sir walter raleghs sister mary by her husband hugh snedale a commander in the queens royal navy and as we are told in the time of his prosperity and greatness was his servant entrusted with receiving great sums of money for him out of his office of wines and his other places by which he became in arrear to ralegh in diverse great sums which after his troubles he sent for to sanderson who was so far from paying them that he pretended ralegh should owe him  000 pounds whereupon sir walter in great anger commenced a suit against sanderson which was managed by his servant and solicitor john shellbury and sanderson being overthrown and found in arrear to ralegh in very great sums was cast into prison where he died a beggar hence sprung all the spleen and malice of william sanderson the younger in his history of king james s reign toward sir walter ralegh now this exposure both of that authors father and his own history so enraged the son that he forthwith published an answer to the said pamphlet in which he not only endeavors to support what he had written of sir walter ralegh in his history though with no authorities or satisfactory reasons but falls most foully upon carew ralegh as if he was the author of the pamphlet aforesaid against his history and that with such womanish spleen and slander as might have betrayed had not himself owned that his wife had a hand in writing it but of the passage here last quoted though he contradicts several particulars he does not deny the main point which is that sir walter ralegh now after his reprieve did commence suits by shellbury against his father which might naturally sharpen the sons pen and warp his impartiality when he was representing him in his history and the rather if ralegh was such a debtor besides to his father as he describes him but whoever was the author of those observations on the said history he has not more unfavourably treated it than others who examined it dr welwood in his notes on wilsons history of king james says nothing could inhance the value of it more than a most wretched one published by one william sanderson who pretends in several places to some secret memoirs or discourses with great men to make good the passages of his history but the truth is the whole is nothing else but an illcompild collection out of other authors wherein he for the most part mistakes or perverts their meaning in cursorily reading over this history i have sometimes taken notice of above four or five gross errors either in names things or chronology in one single page   when ralegh had got over these troublesome contests all things appeared for a while about him as serene as in such a gloomy state could be hoped for and he who lately was upon the very brink of dissolution had all his offices lands and goods seized upon and was himself committed a close prisoner had not only his life reprieved and his confinement sweetened with some degrees of latitude but even his estate also restored to him for these lands were actually made over by sir walter ralegh to his son both inheritance and fee before queen elizabeth died as formerly was also the lease for years so that as he observes again in another place being entailed on sir walter s heirs he could not forfeit them but during his own life and the king finding in himself the iniquity of sir walter s condemnation gave him all what he had forfeited again herewith agrees likewise sir john harrington who not only tells us by whose mediation ralegh recovered his said estate and his enlargement in prison but how laudably he employed himself there at the time of this authors writing which might be about the year   0  where he says god put it into the kings mind against mans expectation to save his life and since by the suit of his faithful wife both to preserve his estate and to ease his restraint in such sort as many who are at liberty taste not greater comforts than he does in prison being not barred of those companions meaning books that he may and perhaps does take more true comfort in them than ever he took of his courtly companions in his chiefest bravery  but this prospect was soon overcast for there was a young scotchman named robert car who soon after the said restitution sprang up in great favor at court and having no fortune of his own it was contrived by those who had gaped in vain for raleghs estate themselves to lay the foundation of this favourites future greatness upon his ruin for being thus frustrated of the effects of sir walter raleghs attainder they pretended to find a flaw in his last conveyance of the fee and inheritance of sherborne to his son and to this purpose an information was exhibited in the exchequer by the attorney general hobart to which ralegh put in his answer and therein the said grant or conveyance was set forth to be made over as above yet for want of a single word which was found notwithstanding in the paperbook and was only the oversight of the clerk they pronounced the conveyance invalid and sherborne absolutely forfeited to the crown a judgment to be foreseen without witchcraft since his chief judge was his greatest enemy and the case argued between a friendless prisoner and the king of england  then was sherborne given to this car afterward earl of somerset the lady ralegh and her children earnestly petitioned the king for compassion but could now obtain no other answer than he mun have the land he mun have it for car and she a woman of high spirit on her knees prayed to god that he would punish those who had thus wrongfully exposed her and her children to ruin we have an elegant letter of ralegh s extant to car himself upon this occasion but having been corruptly printed it may appear from several ancient manuscriptcopies more correct as follows after some great losses and many years sorrows of both which i have cause to fear i was mistaken in the end it is come to my knowledge that yourself whom i know not but by an honorable fame has been persuaded to give me and mine our last fatal blow by obtaining from his majesty the inheritance of my children and nephews lost in the law for want of a word this done there remains nothing with me but the name of life despoiled of all else but the title and sorrow thereof his majesty whom i never offended for i ever held it unnatural and unmanly to hate goodness stayed me at the graves brink not as i hope that he thought me worthy of many deaths and to behold all mine cast out of the world with myself but as a king who judging the poor in truth has received a promise from god that his throne shall be established for ever and for yourself sir seeing your fair day is but now in the dawn and mine drawn to the evening your own virtues and the kings grace assuring you of many favors and much honor i beseech you not to begin your first building upon the ruins of the innocent and that their sorrows with mine may not attend your first plantation i have been ever bound to your nation as well for many other graces as for their true report of my trial to his majesty against whom had i been found malignant the hearing of my cause would not have changed enemies into feiends malice into compassion and the minds of the greatest number present into the commiseration of my state it is not the nature of foul treason to beget such fair passions neither could it agree with the duty and love of faithful subjects especially of your nation to bewail his overthrow who had conspired against their most liberal and natural lord i therefore trust sir that you will not be the first that shall kill us outright cut down the tree with the fruit and undergo their curse who enter the field of the fatherless which if it please you to know the truth is far less fruitful in value than in fame but that so worthy a gentleman as yourself will rather bind us to your service being sir gentlemen not base in birth or alliance who have interest therein and myself with my utmost thankfulness will ever remain ready to obey your commandments this letter in one or two old copies is dated december   0  but this so little prevailed upon car or any other applications ralegh might make to the king with his majesty himself that besides sherborne and the manors belonging to it those other lands which ralegh himself had purchased called pinford and primesly barton and the manors appertaining also thereunto forfeited with the rest by his attainder were also granted the following year   0  or the seventh of his majestys reign to the said favorite  but now or not long after ralegh was grown into high esteem with that great hope and heir of these kingdoms prince henry frederick the kings eldest son who being satisfied of his loyalty and well informed of his great qualifications and experience in civil and military affairs with his hazardous services for the honor and defense of his country no less than his many publickspirited adventures both to enlarge and enrich it testified not his own merits more in any one particular than in distinguishing those of sir walter ralegh and notwithstanding the many little envious detractions of some undermining courtiers about him did both encourage his epistolary addresses to him from the tower and send for his counsel or opinion upon several emergent occasions it was perhaps one of the brightest rays in the shining orb of this rare princes actions that he never left invading the king with the most persuasive solicitations that he would bestow sherborne upon him with full design to return it to its just owner till his majesty at last granted his request but by what cruel fate raleghs hopes were eclipsed again and indeed those of the whole kingdom we shall suddenly hear  in the mean time we must hear endeavor to give such light of that intercourse which passed between the said prince henry and sir walter ralegh as those letters and discourses which he addressed to his highness and are extant will afford and first when he found how commendably the prince was inclined to the studies of navigation how much delighted he was with a view of the fleet at chatham how inquisitive or deous to inform himself by consultation with the most experienced commanders in the knowledge of building ships most artfully fitting them out most commodiously sailing them most dexterously and fighting with them most successfully in order to execute those great designs he had upon the west indies and spain itself whenever the king thereof should give cause of public hostility as of his own servants acquaints us and would have done more distinctly had he not been manacled in in a courtly maxim so discrepant with all personal narrative that to publish particulars agrees not with rules of state ralegh composed and communicated to his highness several tractates upon these subjects such was his letter touching the model of a ship which the prince intended to build and such his discourse of a maritimal voyage with the passages and incidents therein which he seconded with some necessary observations on the royal navy and sea service also dedicated to his highness and wherein he appears to have been a most worthy and earnest counselor of the prince to a due regard and regulation thereof for says ralegh to him in answer to any objection that might be made to the maintenance of so great a fleet in the perfection and readiness which he recommends now in times of peace tho the sword is put into the sheath we must not suffer it to rust or stick so fast that we shall not be able to draw it readily when needs requires and a little further we may be assured that if those powerful means whereby we reduced our enemies to the courtesy of seeking peace of us were neglected so as we could not again upon occasion readily assume the use and benefit of them as we have done those proud mastering spirits finding us at such advantage would be more willing to shake us by the ears as enemies than to take us by the hands as friends therefore far be it from our hearts to trust more to that friendship of strangers which is but dissembled upon policy and necessity than to the strength of our own forces which has been experienced with so happy success i confess that peace is a blessing of god and blessed are the peacemakers therefore doubtless blessed are those means whereby peace is gained and maintained for well we know that god works all things here among us mediately and by a secondary means the which means of our defense and safety being shipping and seaforces are to be esteemed as his gifts and then only available and beneficial when he withal vouchsafes his grace to use them aright to this end ralegh also wrote another discourse for the said prince of the art of war by sea but the untimely death of his highness as we shall too soon find deprived both him and posterity of the advantages which a subject so useful and uncommon from an author so able and experienced did promise  there is nothing in these discourses or any other i have met with which show ralegh any ways concerned in writing those propositions or arguments for foreign wars which were delivered to prince henry by some of his military servants and which were afterward abstractedly published together with an answer at large written very conformable to the taste of king james by the learned sir robert cotton though to the first edition of this treatise the bookseller having prefixed sir walter raleghs picture have thereby misled some writers of his life carelessly to insert this book into the catalogue of his writings it is true ralegh has obliquely and subordinately touched this branch of the subject in some of his discourses upon war but in other arguments than are here answered nay after this answer was written nor are they addressed to the prince but indeed written also after his death in some places he has given the greatest discouragements to a military life from knowing how many are deluded to be the executioners of other mens ambition and to lay down their lives for what they should not venture them his words are it may be affirmed the number of those that have been slaughtered by their fellow creatures exceed the number of all the inhabitants that ever were at one time living upon the face of the earth yet very few of this infinite number thus untimely slain were ever masters of the grounds of the disputes for which they suffered or the true reason of their being led to the battle the truth with much artifice being kept from all but what were parties to the design resolved on what deluded wretches then have a great part of mankind been who have either yielded themselves to be slain in causes which if truly known their hearts would abhor or been the bloody executioners of other mens ambition it is a hard fate to be slain for what a man should never willingly fight yet few soldiers have laid themselves down in the bed of honor under better circumstances raleghs three discourses p   0  yet withal the greater disproportion of honor and reward which attends that profession than others of less personal hardship and danger as was before partly observed in other places he has written against wanton and causeless invasions for the mere sake of brutish and vainglorious victory against waging war with our enemies till we beat the art of it into them till cowards are learnt to be courageous and defenders become assailants yet has elsewhere in a very ingenious similitude shown that martial policy is one of the principal supports of government it is as follows they say that the goodliest cedars which grow on the high mountains of libanus thrust their roots between the clifts of hard rocks the better to bear themselves against the strong storms that blow there as nature has instructed those kings of trees so has reason taught the kings of men to root themselves in the hardy hearts of their faithful subjects and as those kings of trees have large tops so have the kings of men large crowns whereof as the first would soon be broken from their bodies were they not underborne by many branches so would the other easily otter were they not fastened on their heads with the strong chains of civil justice and martial discipline raleghs remain last edit p      however when a prince has thereby got authority or the sharpest means in his power he would have the mildest use and the one acquired in full strength only that the other may be exercised with perfect safety for he ever preferred reason and love as stronger chains of government than constraint or violence and thought that royal dealings was ever surest of meeting with royal success such were the principles sir walter ralegh infused not only into the prince of wales but all other readers throughout his writings and agreeable hereto is the tenor of that letter he wrote to the said prince august the   th      concerning the most eligible power in an english sovereign where he has with the spirit of a true patriot said let me not doubt but all plans which do not carry in them the mutual happiness of prince and people will appear as absurd to your great understanding as disagreeable to your noble nature  but now raleghs pen was engaged upon a different subject in the princes service and by his command for the first overtures of a marriage between this prince and the eldest daughter of spain being put off the like motion was now made by the savoyan ambassador not only for a marriage between prince henry and a daughter of the duke of savoy but for another of his son don phillibert prince of piedmont with princess elizabeth the daughter of england ralegh wrote two discourses upon this occasion in the year last mentioned and that he particularly was requested by the prince to give his opinion of the said offers appears in his introduction to the first of those discourses inscribed to some minister of state about his highness in which ralegh has so notably discovered what a tool for avarice and ambition most of the catholic princes in europe had made of this sacrament of matrimony and how notoriously the castilians with those of whom these princes are descended have gotten no less by the traffic of their marriages than they have done by the trade of their indies that i wonder these excellent political discourses were never made public for the more easy advertisement of our succeeding princes upon this topic the second of them upon the match for prince henry is treated under eight heads and in the fourth page of it ralegh has these words there is a kind of noble and royal deceiving in marriages between great kings and princes yea it is of all others the fairest and most unsuspected kind of betraying it has been as ordinary among them to adventure or cast away a daughter to bring some purpose to pass as at other times for saving of charges to make them nuns a little farther having represented the duke of savoy so tied to the sea of rome both by religion and benefit that he could no more be separated and subsist than if his soul was divided from his body he goes on thus more directly concerning the marriages what then remains of profit to our prince by this alliance a sum of money and a beautiful lady for beauty says he it was never more cheap in any age and it is ever better loved in the hope than when it is had for the million of crowns offered which makes but two of our subsidies i speak it confidently that when those dukes lords and great ladies who will attend the princess in her passage hither shall be all presented with gifts according to their degrees and the kings honor when the preparations triumphs and feastings are paid for there will nothing remain but a great increase of charge and perchance a great deal of melancholy and a little further ralegh comes closer still to the prince himself in these words now if by these dislikes of the former alliances you make judgment that it is my desire that the prince should not marry at all i say my desire is not that the prince should not marry at all but not as yet and i am exceeding sorry that the prince has not the same desire for seeing his majesty is yet but young and by gods favor like to live many years and that his highness if he should now marry may have many children born to him before he be  0 years old and seeing all his children shall be princes and must be provided for as princes i think it will much perplex him to find himself so environed till his majesty has somewhat repaired his estate and provided beautiful gardens to plant these olive branches in while the prince is unmarried all the eyes of christendom are upon him for with what king soever he shall be balanced he will cast the scale but to have him weighed with a little prince i should be sorry and he himself will be as sorry after all the princes in christendom wooed charles duke of burgundy while his daughter was unmarried and while our prince is free our enemies not knowing upon what ground to build their practices his majestys safety is in the mean while infinitely assured but the prince once disposed of they will presently muster our forces measure our fortunes sound us to the bottom and make their approaches accordingly they will then say we have seen the utmost of the prince of wales then having observed that since there is none but a catholic lady for us let us have a king on our side says he to boot so in consideration of the many motives to enmity between france and spain which he enumerates as also the many obligations which france then lay under of gratitude to the crown of england and the advantage of retaining the netherlands he proposes the daughter of the french king on the other side that it would be a needless hazard both to neglect this love and union and sustain withal the hatred of the archduke the pope and the king of spain together however disunited they were not to be feared for then if they should combine against us from whom should we hope for help if it be from savoy or florence god help us our friends inhabit beyond the mountains our enemies at hand we leave those that are strongest and nearest us for those who are weakest and furthest off we leave those that can help us or harm us for those that can do neither those we leave who depend on themselves to wit the french for those who depend on others to wit the savoyans and florentines thus ends sir walter ralegh s discourse upon the marriage proposed for prince henry  in his other discourse on the match that was offered for the ingenious and accomplished lady elizabeth that princes sister having copiously exemplified as we have observed what mercenary sacrifices had been made by crowned heads of their children in this grand market of matrimony and answered the objection he foresaw some espaniolized courtiers might make that seeing the kings of france and especially of spain had so often matched themselves with the dukes of savoy why should not the king of england also accept of their alliance he proceeds to examine what increase of honor and dignity or what great comfort or contentment this excellent young princess could expect or hope for by this match for the first to wit honor and dignity says he as she is born the eldest and now only daughter of one of the mightiest kings of christendom so is she thereby of higher place and state than the wife of a duke of savoy besides in her birth and blood both of father and mother descended of such royal races as savoy cannot add any greater grace or glory to and by nature and education endowed with such princely perfections both of body and mind as may well deserve to be reputed a worthy spouse for the greatest monarch of christendom especially considering the possibilities of a daughter of england whereof we have had many precedents and at this time is happily manifested in the kings majesty our sovereign being descended of a daughter of england whereby the whole island formerly divided is again now made one great britain to the mutual strength of either now to confer the possibility of such a fortune upon a poor popish duke of savoy that can return no recompense of benefit to this state were greatly for his glory though little for the advancement of this noble princess and less for the safety of this kingdom considering the dangers that it may draw upon our worthy magnanimous prince and the noble duke of york if the ambition of this match should tickle the savoyan to look after possibilities wherein there would want neither means persuasions nor pardons from rome to practice any villainy in that behalf whereby to benefit or strengthen an appendix of spain and so devoted a son to the romish see for the second namely the comfort and contentment of this worthy young lady by this match as there is little in appearance presently so there is less to be hoped for in the future for as first she must be removed far from her nearest blood both by father and mother into a country far estranged from our nation as any part of christendom and as far differing from us in religion as in climate and what true correspondence or matrimonial affection there can be maintained between those persons whose minds are different and opposite in the religious points of their christian faith is greatly to be doubted moreover it is greatly to be feared with what safety and security she can long live free from secret practices and treacheries in a country so near the popes jurisdiction environed with the plots of the jesuits who we see do daily traffic the lives and fortunes of all princes who are not wholly devoted to the romish obedience and therefore how they will entertain or tolerate the race of our king were too great an error and presumption to trust to so as when the worthy lady hereafter by her children or otherwise has furnished their desire and fully served their turn she shall be then either forced to wound her conscience by forsaking her faith or else to undergo the scorns and danger which shall be daily cast upon her and her family for the exercise of her religion and this also we may be well assured of that if she shall have any issue by the prince of piedmont they must all be bred and brought up contrary to her conscience which can be no small grief to a virtuous and natural mother and as little comfort to our just religious king their grandfather lastly the very binding cause of amity between all kings princes and states is their trade and intercourse of their subjects now there is not any prince or state of europe the inland countries of hungary and transylvania excepted but the english have trade withal yea even with the turk barbarian persian and indians only with the subjects of savoy i do not know that we have any meddling or interchange at at all for the duke has no port his ditch of villa franca excepted which is only capable of a few galleys either to furnish ships from or to receive them being strangers and therefore for his majesty of england to match his eldest and only daughter with a prince who has his dependence on other kings a prince jesuited who can neither head us in time of war nor trade with us in time of peace a prince by the situation of his country every way unprofitable to us and that no less perilous for his majestys daughter to live in i resolve myself that he is of too excellent a judgment ever to accept of it and his honorable council too wise and provident to advise the prosecution thereof now if his highness should be pleased to ask my opinion with what christian prince he should match his sister were it in his own power and choice to make election i humbly desire to be excused herein for would it become me to presume so far it is true i have heard it that some overtures have been made for the prince palatine of the rhine certainly he is as well born as the duke of savoy and as free a prince as he is the nation is faithful he is of our religion and by him we shall greatly fasten unto us the netherlands and for the little judgment which god has given me i do prize the alliance of the palatine of the rhine and of the house of nassau more than i do the alliance of tn dukes of savoy and thus ends his discourse on the marriage of princess elizabeth  what followed was that about a twelvemonth after the writing of those discourses the said princess was married to frederick elector palatine of the rhine this marriage was celebrated on the   th of february      in such pomp and splendour that the jewels only which were worn by the king queen and prince were valued that day by his majesty himself upon occasion of discourse happening of the bravery then appearing at  00000 l sterling sir john finets observations touching foreign ambassadors  vo      p     afterward king of bohemia a match which might have well answered all the advantages expected from it at least one that had never been attended with such a series of calamities were king james to have been moved if not through honor and power as a sovereign yet through nature and affection as a father to have granted them a seasonable supply against their enemies instead of which his indulging beyond all apprehension of possibility at least all production of precedent a blessed peaceable temper as his flatterers called it to the sitting down a quiet spectator of his childrens overthrow and their fortunes occasioned not only all the lamentable wars which succeeded throughout germany to the utter ruin of his said soninlaw and all the princes who assisted him but also those of his successor at home throughout his own dominions for daring not to draw his sword through fear of offending the spaniard he sat musing at home one while how to raise money by privyseals benevolences crown lands and woods either to cram his insatiable favorites or else to fit out more prodigal and frivolous embassies than would by arms have settled his children unmoveably in their throne and at other times how to improve his sovereignty or pick quarrels with his parliaments and entail them to his heirsgeneral  as for the prince of wales he is said to have first encouraged the prince elector to attempt his sister desiring more to head an army in germany than he durst make show of and would no doubt have been bravely followed but alas that fate which so often suffers the unworthy to flourish deprived this kingdom of prince henry in less than a month after the arrival of the said elector some have insinuated as if the spaniards because his highness approved raleghs discourse touching a war with spain had a hand in his untimely end alleging that if philip the second cut off his own hopeful son charles for but pitying the people of flanders it can be no wonder he or his son should promote the destruction of a stranger who did so far applaud the advice of ralegh as to say no king but his father would keep such a bird in a cage but from more intestine and unnatural sources his sudden death is surmised by others to have sprung the disease being so violent that the combat of nature against it in the strength of youth he being almost    years of age lasted but few days here it is somewhat remarkable that after sir theodore mayerne with dr butler hamond and other most eminent physicians had used the utmost of their skill in vain and had the least hopes imaginable left of the princes recovery that these should be at last centered in some relief that might be had from sir walter ralegh and that a cordial from him a stateprisoner should be sent for and with consent or approbation administered when all other means had failed and were given over as we may gather from sir william cornwallis and other historians of those times as to the effect though it came too late so that it might rather prolong pain than life for a few hours and truly must have been a kind of miracle to have restored one so far exhausted and on the point of expiring for he died the same evening being the  th of november      yet to observant readers it is enough to manifest first what high reputation sir walter raleghs medicinal knowledge through this cordial had now gained and it afterward increased insomuch that there has been a distinct volume written upon this cordial whereby i find it is not to be taken for that which is called sir walter raleghs cordial in a book entitled as i remember the ladys closet opened for that is only a simple strawberrywater but this here meant was his great cordial as i find ralegh in one of his manuscripts has styled it himself this cordial rose into such high repute for its sovereign virtues in the reign of king charles ii and was so much recommended to and admired by him that he commanded nicholas e febvre the royal professor in chemistry and apothecary in ordinary to his majestys household to prepare a quantity of this precious remedy after the exactest manner which the said chemist not only did but composed in french also under his majestys auspices and command a treatise entitled discourse sur le grand cordial de sir walter ralegh which he dedicated to the said king and this was at the same time translated into english by peter blon student in chemistry for there were both licensed on the   d of april      though the translation appears to have been printed first because it is dated that year and the original the year after the french is in   0 the english in  vo after the dedication follows this introduction of the recipe  eximium cordiale regium multis rebus necessariis auctum secundum consilium and approbationem

discourse with examples among the ancients of those who have made themselves famous by their remedies as mithridates etc and among the moderns matheolus b valentine paracelsus and others but finds none more worthy in this particular than sir walter ralegh because he has not only selected most judiciously whatever is most choice and sovereign in the animal vegetable and mineral world but has also manifested so much art and experience in the preparation of this great and admirable cordial as will of itself render him immortal wherefore he says he could not restrain the applauses owing to his honor and glory which he has more than merited by that noble labor and profound study that acquired him the sublime knowledge he had in the virtues and qualities of all those ingredients which unite to the composition of this incomparable remedy so he proceeds to explain first the virtues of every individual drug which together cause those rare effects this cordial daily produces says he as well toward the healthful as the sick secondly he specifies how art helps nature in the harmonious and exquisite method of the preparation thirdly distinguishes the efficacy of it in maritime or islandic and northerly countries lastly what a preservative it is as well as restorative and concludes with the exposition of the dose the quantity time and method of using it thus much concerning this discourse on sir walter raleghs great cordial of which the following particulars may be here farther observed that the author le febvre acknowledging he had inserted two ingredients by the counsel and approbation of the abovesaid sir kenelm digby and sir alexander fraiser which were not mentioned in the first prescription and which i have marked before in a different character being the flesh hat and liver of vipers and the mineral unicorn which some would have to be the white loadstone it may induce the curious to enquire whether more liberties have not been taken with sir walter raleghs own genuine recipe to this end should be consulted the english copy thereof in sir kenelm digbys collection of receipts printed a few years after le febvres book also sir walter raleghs book of chemical receipts an original ms in sir hans sloanes library marked b     in which book all written with raleghs own hand there are p    b these words our great cordial and underneath several ingredients set down though not near the number above cited but scored out again with a pen though not llegibly the next leaf is torn out where it is supposed ralegh had writ it more completely and that from this leaf le febvres copy was taken lastly there is a receipt of this cordial remaining with a lady who is a descendant from sir walter ralegh but whether agreeing with those in print i have not at this juncture the leisure for making a request to be satisfied  among the most skilful of the faculty and secondly the unsteady and incoherent opinions which were entertained of one and the same mans loyalty that he who was accused at his trial of a plot to extirpate the royal family should yet be so far relied on to save it as to have the lives first of queen anne as was before related and now of prince henry trusted to his experiments but in a modern author we have some further circumstances of this passage which i have not elsewhere met with for having spoken of the particular esteem which prince henry had contracted for sir walter ralegh the constant correspondence he kept with him by letters and messages and of the solicitations he had so repeatedly made to the king for his liberty as what might contribute toward his majestys personal prejudice against ralegh he adds when the prince fell into his last illness the queen sent to sir walter ralegh for some of his cordial which she herself had taken in a fever some time before with remarkable success ralegh sent it together with a letter to the queen wherein he expressed a tender concern for the prince and boasting of his medicine stumbled unluckily upon an expression to this purpose that it would certainly cure him or any other of a fever except in case of poison the prince dying though he took it the queen in the agony of her grief showed ralegh s letter and laid so much weight on the expression about poison that to her dying day she could never be dissuaded from the opinion that her beloved son had foul play done him if this was true there might be a stress too confidently laid on this medicine in supposing that nothing but poison could relesist the power of it and perhaps some inadvertency in starting such a suspicion in a fond mother which in the said modern writers opinion there might possibly be no ground for and might in the consequence prove fatal to ralegh himself though the same author also knew ralegh was not the only man who started that suspicion for he knew what the princes domestic chaplain preached at st jamess on the dissolution of his highnesss family and he knew what the lord chief justice coke not long after said in open court about the poisoning of sir thomas overbury that it was to prevent the discovery of another crime of the same nature committed upon one of the highest rank whom he termed a sweet prince and indeed several histories of these times make no secret of it where they show the bickerings between prince henry and the aforesaid favorite car in regard to the countess of essex not to mention other motives however the physicians about the prince gave it under their hands which was spread abroad in several copies that he died of a strong malignant fever after they had anatomized him to amuse the world says another writer and clear the suspicion of poison as if no venoms could produce the like effects while the king to dispel the clouds and monitors of sorrow commanded that no man should appear at court in mourning  whatever was the cause of this excellent princes death ralegh had no common share in the loss of him his highness having but a few months before he died obtained sherborne with intention to return it him as is already observed and we are further informed that king james to satisfy his favorite car who was now viscount rochester gave him instead thereof   000 l in money so far was the crown from gaining by this purchase but now after the princes death this rochester got sherborne of the king again however as some kind of composition or amends his majesty we are told by ralegh himself also gave his wife and son  000 l for the said estate but how it thrived with rochester is evident enough in the histories of those times where it appears that in little more than three years from this princes death the said favorite by the title of earl of somerset was arraigned and condemned for that black and shameful business of poisoning sir thomas overbury whereby he not only lost sherborne but all those other possessions which the king had so lavishly heaped upon him for what merits or services may better appear in those histories than it is needful they should do here as to sherborne on whom it was next bestowed and upon what consideration with the attempts made after raleghs death by his son carew to recover it since the accounts thereof would carry us too far beyond the period in these sheets proposed and indeed do more properly relate to the story of the son than the father i shall here refer to an abstract thereof in a brief memorial of the said carew ralegh at the bottom of the page carew ralegh was born as is before observed in the tower in the latter end of   0  or beginning of the next year being aged about    years at his fathers death as he tells us himself became a gentlemancommoner of wadham college in oxford in    0 as anthony wood informs us but indeed rather sooner because carew raleghs own words are that after having been five years at oxford he came to court and by the favor of william earl of pembroke his noble kinsman hoped to obtain some redress in his misfortunes but the king not liking his countenance said he appeared to him like his fathers ghost whereupon the earl advised him to travel which he did till the death of king james which happened about a year after then returning and a parliament sitting he according to the custom of this land petitioned to be restored in blood that he might be enabled to inherit whatever lands might fall to him as his fathers heir or any other way but his petition having been twice read in the house of lords king charles sent sir james fullerton then of the pedchamber for mr ralegh who being brought into the kings chamber by that knight his majesty after using him with great civility told him plainly that he had formerly promised sir john digby now earl of bristol to secure his title to sherborne it being conferred on him   th of june against the heirs of sir walter ralegh whereupon digby had given him being then prince ten thousand pounds so that now he was bound to make good his promise being king and therefore unless he would quit all his right and title to sherborne he neither could nor would pass his bill of restoration mr ralegh urged the justice of his cause that he desired only the liberty of a subject and to be left to the law which was never denied any freeman but the king was positive and so left him after this sir james fullerton used many arguments to persuade submission as the impossibility of contesting with kingly power and the many inconveniences of not being restored in blood all which considered together with splendid promises of great preferment in court and particular favors from the king not improbable wrought much in the mind of young mr ralegh who being not full twenty years old as he says himself left friendless and fortuneless it prevailed so far that he submitted to the kings will whereupon there was afterward an act passed   0 caroli for his restoration and together with it a settlement of sherborne to the earl of bristol and in show of some kind of recompense four hundred pounds a year pension during life was granted to mr ralegh after the death of his mother who had that sum paid during her life in lieu of jointure about a twelvemonth after this mr carew ralegh married the lady philippa relict of sir anthony ashley a rich young widow by whom he had two sons and three daughters and was not long after at least before the year      made one of the gentlemen of the kings privychamber among the ingenious poems of thomas carew esquire who was another of those gentlemen printed  vo    0 p  0 there is a compliment to his cousin c r marrying the lady a by which letters are to be understood this mr ralegh and that lady ashley as for the kind token which anthony wood says the king honored him with at his majestys leaving hampton court and going into the isle of wight anno      it was no more than a picture of the lady stanley as i remember which was mr raleghs own property therefore she king among the letters he left on the table desired in one of them the said picture might be returned him as may appear by those letters which were then printed or the extract of them in heaths chronicle in the year    0 and afterward several little tracts of his fathers were published and dedicated to him in      there was a committee for the sale of delinquents estates and about that time the earl of digby being fled to france mr ralegh had a fair prospect to recover his estate therefore delivered his case in to the said committee and it was ordered that this case be reported to the house with the opinion of this committee that they conceive him a sit object of their mercy he also about the same time drew up a brief relation of sir walter raleghs troubles and addressed it to the parliament but whether printed before his death i know not the edition here used being dated three years after nor wherefore his case and petition were laid aside in      came out the observations on sandersons history of king james which this historian supposing to be writ by carew ralegh published an answer to it the same year with some scandalous and unworthy reflections therein upon him but no one has given heed to them he certainly made his court to the commons of england in hopes of getting sherborne by their means  hence wood says he cringed to men in power and was made governor of the isle of jersey by the favor of general monk in the latter end of january      as whitlock has recorded at the restoration of king charles ii his majesty would have conferred some personal honor upon him but he declined it in hopes of something better the king therefore knighted his eldest son walter who died soon after at west horsels in surrey his fathers seat which had i think been the earl of dorsets for his will is dated from thence as a friend who has seen it informs me this was sold after mr raleghs death to sir edward nicholas secretary to king charles he had another seat at kenton park near hampton court which i think he sold himself and dying in      was buried in the month of december according to a wood in his fathers grave who further says he has seen some sonnets of his composition and certain ingenious discourses in ms also a poem set to music by mr henry laws sir henry wotton in his letters gives him the character of a gentleman of dexterous abilities and he is by others mentioned with honor but far god wot says wood was he from his fathers parts either as to his sword or pen    for as to his elder brother walter whose right it had first been to have pursued whatever prospect there was of retrieving the said estate he died before their father as will be more particularly remembered toward the conclusion of this work  but which of these two sons was attended on in his adventures by ben johnson is not easy to distinguish from the words of an author who writes that johnsons mother having married to her second husband a bricklayer took her son from westminsterschool where he had made a hopeful progress under the learned camden and made him work at her husbands trade till being pitied by some generous gentlemen camden got him a better employment which was to attend or accompany a son of sir walter ralegh in his adventures whereby gaining experience he made his company acceptable among many now if this happened before ben johnson took to acting or writing of plays as our said author relates it did then sir walter raleghs eldest son was scarce old enough to go to school much less upon adventures besides this son never made that we can hear of more than one adventure abroad from which he never returned therefore he could not part with his attendant or companion ben johnson in the manner our said author intimates he did after their return then if we suppose it the other brother carew he never made any adventures at all nor stirred out of england till six years after his fathers death and then only upon a short tour for about a twelvemonth which was near thirty years after ben johnson became a dramatick poet or writer for the stage and when he seems rather to have wrote himself into his pension from the crown or otherwise into such easy circumstances as render it unlikely he should attend even on carew ralegh in those sorrows and difficulties he was then under and consequently in the whole that either one or other should part with him not in cool blood as our said author thinks after their return had the time of his going abroad with the younger or the elder brother been better adjusted that particular of their parting would need no regard seeing by what trifles what misunderstanding between themselves or misrepresentations by others such divisions are made between persons who would or might otherwise be most serviceable and beneficial to one another  if ben johnson was of such a surly and hypercritical disposition as some mens writings and indeed some of his own have represented him as it makes such parting the more plausible if there had ever been any such meeting so it is probable it would have distilled with more acrimony from his pen when he was giving a character of ralegh as an author than that he could find nothing to condemn either in his judgment or his style  but as for raleghs temper to all who had dependence upon him and they were very numerous in the time of his felicity especially toward those of any liberal knowledge and education it appears to have been of singular candor and benignity there are examples further than what have been beforementioned of his courtesy superior to that of many other great persons in his time toward such men of parts as any ways relied on his patronage or protection and publicly asserted by those themselves who had tasted the benefits thereof he has also under his own hand recommended such generous treatment as most coercive especially to such as live under the power or command of others and exploded the austere the imperious regimen as what is liable to betray its practitioners no less into peril than disdain where he shows how contemptibly the vain with effectual sourness counterfeit the gravity of the wise because the shadow of reverence thereby obtained has power to delude the eyes only of underlings and how thus the time wherein by using it well men might attain to be such as they ought they usually mispend in seeking to appear such as they are not yet withal not only how deceivable but dangerous a course this is procuring instead of the respect that was hoped for more indignation than was feared many other weighty counsels and useful precautions to this purpose are dispersed up and down his writings both in print and manuscript which for brevity i forbear here to recite  but here as ralegh has been occasionally mentioned in the character of an author we are reminded that it is high time he should be considered more particularly in that light which cannot in any place more properly be done than in this sedentary part of his life when most of his works were written here then we are arrived at that part of his story wherein he will appear rather a collegian than a captive a student in a library than a prisoner in the tower on this occasion we cannot but reflect how well such productions in such a situation such spacious exercises of genius in such a contracted state will prove that though the soul of man by a fly or a hair may be separated from the body tyranny itself cannot confine it to the body and at the same time how trifling a calamity confinement must be to those who have well employed their liberty some men impatient under so many years restraint would have pined obscurely away by despair and others with rage have made their bonds more galling but ralegh as in many other disasters so in this has left us no common example of an heroic mind in him we may observe there is no levelling a sublime spirit with the subalterns of nature press it on one part it will still rise in another and be like some hardy plants we have seen whose heads will shoot forth and flourish in the sight of mankind though their roots are closely fettered in walls of stone happy then are they who in their youth have so fortified themselves with knowledge and attained to such a relish of literature that wheresoever they are driven by the persecutions of power they can make the contemplation of wisdom beguile the sense of their sufferings who out of the most prevailing examples in all ages of patience and prudence in all exigences can set themselves lessons of fortitude and tasks of imitations who can out of the misfortunes of others extract consolations for themselves or partake in their prosperity and make it tributary to their own contentment such carry with them an infallible an undeprivable solace which can relieve them in poverty with inestimable treasure manumise them in prison with intellectual liberty for the multitudes of anxieties which surprise illiterate and uncultivated minds even in the midst of the most splendid affluence or adulation are inaccessible to them under the darkest clouds of indigence or reproach  that ralegh in his greener years did attain to such a taste of letters as all his succeeding avocations could never remove and which proved not only an ornament to those his earlier and happier days but a relief in his age and afflictions even so as to render him under his darker fortunes and condition more illustrious than he was in his brightest prosperity may appear by a survey of his writings from the juvenile productions of his pen to the more numerous and mature offsprings of his present confinement but in this survey we think not the simple chronological method will be either needful or acceptable which though easiest and readiest for transcribing would be most crude and disjointed in reading and yet be incapable of admitting all into their true order because we have not the time that several of his pieces were written therefore that we may carry on our discourse with some coherence we shall attempt at such a digestion as upon a little review will naturally arise or most conveniently at least in this place lead us as out of a flow arden into the high road again of public action for i might perhaps recommend some variation in this arrangement of the same pieces if they were to be revived in a uniform and methodical edition of sir walter raleghs works so that the junior efforts of his muse or more extemporary products of his epistolary correspondence might not as here for dispatch lead up the rest  now as for these productions of his muse since several of them are mentioned in the former part of these sheets they need be here only recapitulated as his poem on gascoigns steeleglass the excuse the silent lover the answer to marloe s pastoral with his poem of cynthia and two more on spencers fairy queen since the time that these seven were before spoken of i have met with four other such like poetical pieces which seem also to have been composed by the same hand from those elegant taulologies or retornellos wherein his sonnets and madrigals are usually so correspondent with one another these were all written long before this his imprisonment as were probably some also in the ashmolean library namely erroris responsio and his answer to the lie etc besides we find there is a satirical elegy on the death of the treasurer cecyll earl of salisbury written within this period likewise ascribed to him and we have still three pieces more of his poetry written afterward and but a short time before his own death these are of a solemn nature as his pilgrim his epigram in allusion to the snuff of a candle lastly a divine stanza which is called his epitaph  next we might speak of those shorter pieces also in prose his letters and these being written in all parts of his life cannot perhaps be improperly  this i have seen of them in print and manuscript to the number of twentyeight fourteen or fifteen of them have already been made use of in the foregoing sheets and the rest as they likewise are of personal import will be serviceable in the remainder so they need not be more particularly distinguished in this place  but those more continued compositions which were the result of experience and occasion in his several public professions or engagements of life will perhaps first demand our observation such as relate to his character as a warrior a sailor a discoverer of unknown countries and a politician versed in the interest of nations and the arts of government among these we may first mention his military discourses and these concern either a defense of england in particular or contain general arguments and examples of the causes and reasons of war among mankind on the former subject he seems to have drawn up several remonstrances which are but sparingly and slowly come to light however from what has before been observed of his having had a principal hand in the determinations of the grand council of war for putting the nation in arms when it was under immediate apprehensions of the spanish invasion there is good reason to believe he was also the author of a treatise containing notes of direction for such defense of the kingdom written three years before when the said enemies were beginning to show their designs to this treatise was also joined a direction for the best and most orderly retreat of an army whether in campaign or straits and these were then presented in ms to the privy council herein one advice is since frontier forces are unlikely to prevent an enemy from landing that if they should land through the deficiency or absence of our shipping for this is the force ralegh was ever for having first used against such foreign invasions it were better by driving or clearing the country of provisions and temporising to endeavor at growing stronger and rendering the enemy weaker than to hazard all by a confused and disorderly descent of the populace to oppose the first landing as their custom heretofore was but this chiefly among the said reasons and positions for preventing an invading enemy was a little before the approach of the spanish armada oppugned by thomas gibbes esquire mustermastergeneral of her majestys forces in the low countries in a discourse of the best order for repulsing a foreign force etc which he then exhibited in print this produced an answer which having been found in an old manuscript copy among others of sir walter raleghs discourses has lately been published and which by several circumstances therein agreeing with many in his life as well as with several orders in the aforesaid council of war several passages in his history of the world and his other writings offers may reasons to believe it was written by him  but if we would see his opinion upon this subject in a more extensive and universal manner it must be in his discourses of the original and fundamental cause of natural and necessary arbitrary and customary holy and civil wars which though also published several years after his death have sufficient marks of genuineness upon them there are other writings of his besides which relate to this topic but as war in them is treated of subordinately and rather with respect to some national advantages wherewith it might have been maintained against our enemies as the posture of affairs then was or the personal behavior of some particular men so we may think it more proper to speak of them under other divisions  among these that which admits of his maritime discourses may not perhaps be least observable being a subject so scarcely handled by men of such learning and experience yet of such importance to a people in our situation and under this head that which should here be perhaps first spoken of though indeed one of the last pieces he wrote in this state of durance is his discourse of the invention of shipping etc wherein he treats of the use defects and improvements thereof the strength and deficiency of the seaforces of england france spain and venice with five causes of the rise of the hollanders his encouragement of a mutual friendship between them and england as also of the newcastle trade this might lead us more particularly to his excellent observations and notes concerning the royal navy and sea service which he dedicated to the prince of wales as is beforementioned therefore all we need observe more of it in this place is that herein he discourses under distinct heads of the officers of the navy of some errors to be reformed in shipbuilding and others in harboring and manning the fleet of surcharging them with great ordnance the defects in sheathing and calking the abuses in victualling inconveniency of the cookrooms of mustering and pressing mariners of arms and munition and lastly of captains to serve in his majestys ships with the second head or chapter in this tract agrees his letter to prince henry before spoken of concerning the model of a ship and in his introduction to the said observations as was also said our author mentions a discourse of a maritimal voyage with the passages and incidents therein which he had formerly written to that prince this if it is now in being must i think remain still in manuscript for no other knowledge of it have i elsewhere met with therefore it has i fear endured the same fate with that other work probably more copious and considerable and to which as what might seem designed to bring the others into practice they may appear only preparatory this work though taken notice of by no other author who has written of him is thus mentioned by himself of the art of war by sea i have written a treatise to the lord henry prince of wales a subject to my knowledge never handled by any man ancient or modern but god has spared me the labor of finishing it by the loss of that brave prince of which like an eclipse of the sun we shall find the effects hereafter impossible it is to equal words and sorrows i will therefore leave him in the hands of god that has him curae leves loquuntur ingentes stupent this may lead us up to such of his discourses as represent this art in execution particularly those two gallant naval actions wherein sir richard greenvil lost his life and himself won a most signal victory of which his own pen has preserved the faithful memorials in his report of the truth of the fight about the isles of azores and his epistolary account of the action at cadiz both of them before abstracted into this work nor did his care terminate in the best advice for the regulation and maintenance of our shipping or in recording some of the most notable achievements performed therewith but extended to the choice and reparation of the most convenient harbors for their reception and that not only by his speeches in parliament as we have already seen but also by a memorial he presented to queen elizabeth touching the port of dover in particular declaring how honorable and profitable to her majesty how necessary and commodious for the realm the rebuilding it would be with the least expensive and most perfect manner of performing the same  but if we advance to his more extensive pursuits and performances relating to that topic they will lead us into a new geography into discoveries and descriptions of unknown countries with the voyages which himself and others under his charge and directions made to that purpose and under this head would fall those papers and discourses of his concerning the discovery plantation and settlement of virginia which were in the possession of sir francis walsingham as was before observed but whether now recoverable i know not nor what is become of his treatise of the west indies which seems to have been a very comprehensive work by the short sketch himself has given of its contents before quoted  better luck seems to have befallen his writings upon guiana for we have at least four of his discourses on that country in being though they probably are not all he writ thereon as first his considerations on the voyage for guiana which i never saw in print secondly his discovery of the large rich and beautiful empire of guiana which he printed himself and being before largely used and spoken of the less need be said of it here thirdly his journal of his second voyage to guiana this remains still in manuscript and perhaps should do so it being unfinished and full of chasms seeming to contain only notes and observations for his own memory when he should have leisure at his return into england to digest and fill up the particulars in a continued discourse accordingly it seems to have supplied him therewith when he wrote his apology for the said voyage but as both these will be made use of in the subsequent part of our narrative twill be then time enough to speak more distinctly of them and there also will be mentioned the four or five letters we have of his extant concerning the said last expedition  after his writings becoming the character of an able commander both by land and sea if we look for him as an author in the civil or political capacity we may find him there also no less eminent we may behold him in this light no less qualified to govern nations than in the other to conquer and defend them some of his compositions under this distribution are of a general nature as that called the seat of government showing it to be upheld by the two great pillars of civil justice and martial policy and how this is framed out of the husbandmen merchants and gentry of the realm the rest of these ranks or degrees he calls the fruit trees of the kingdom or those who gather the honey yet hardly enjoy the wax and as these feed so the second sort enrich it nourishing such trades as have assisted our kings with great sums of money and great fleets upon occasion while the third sort our gentry he calls the garrisons of good order throughout the realm or means rather they have been or should be such more than they were in these latter times to agree with a note he has elsewhere dropped upon them but this little essay appears by one expression toward the conclusion mentioning something to be hereafter proved which is not to be no more than a fragment the like we apprehend of his observations concerning the causes of the magnificency and opulency of cities from a word in the very first paragraph referring to such people as seem to have been before mentioned though in the main this is a general discourse it bears some particular references to a rude and barbarous people and might possibly be the result of such considerations as must have engaged his mind when those propositions were on foot for founding the city of ralegh in virginia as was before intimated in this little essay after having spoken of the means to civilize and reform such a people he proceeds under distinct heads to treat of the best situations of cities for safety and plenty of the multitude of inhabitants religion academies courts of justice artificers privileges and triumphs so concludes with those three causes of confirming a city in her greatness justice peace and plenty of a more extensive nature still is that treatise we have of his called maxims of state being a methodical compendium of government in all or most of its forms and branches with many of its chapters analytically digested for the sake of brevity and perspicuity herein having explained and defined the words government policy state and the office of sovereignty he proceeds to distinguish the feveral sorts of monarchy aristocracy free state tyranny oligarchy and commonwealth then of the founding a state with its parts and of preserving it under those several forms by mysteries or sophisms rules or actions lastly the conversion of states general and particular by foreign invasion domestic sedition or alteration without violence thus ends this treatise to which is joined as a kind of corollary for the better use of the book two or three passages in the story of david from whence an inference is drawn that old age is not always unfit for government and also a defense of that prince for marrying abishag so closes with a portrait of political nobility in the story of adonijah aspiring to the kingdom with observations of the marks to discern such practices and another of the political prince in a farther example of the said king david who though aged deserted and rebelled against by many of his nobles stirred up himself to public action and thereby showed his vigor and sufficiency to manage the affairs of his kingdom herewith may be mentioned that larger treatise bordering upon these subjects which is called the arts of empire etc this was first published with the title of the cabinetcouncil containing the chief arts of empire and mysteries of state discabineted etc by the ever renowned knight sir walter ralegh published by john milton esquire   vo      who prefixed this motto quis martem tunica tectum adamantina digne scripserit the editors opinion of this book and its author he farther offers to the reader in these words having had the ms of this treatse written by sir walter ralegh many years in my hands and finding it lately by chance among other books and papers upon reading thereof i thought it a kind of injury to withold longer the work of so eminent an author from the public it being both answerable in style to other works of his already extant as far as the subject would permit and given me for a true copy by a learned man at his death who had collected several such pieces john milton in the second edition it was titled the arts of empire and mysteries of state discabineted etc  vo land      containing     pages and beginning with these words a commonwealth is a certain sovereign government of many families etc but handled in a different manner it is divided into twentysix chapters defining public weals and differencies of sovereignty more particularly the three kinds of monarchy and how to perpetuate them also of councils and counselors officers commissioners magistrates and ministers of state of justice treasure and war of neighboring princes the character of an excellent prince art of ruling of princely authority power and force of conspiracy and treason public hatred diffidence and dissimulation of war defensive and invasive law of arms soldiers and their discipline of generals and commanders councils of war directions tactic and stratagemic with advice how to make an honorable peace of civil war with the causes and remedies thereof and the two last chapters contain a collection of political observations and maxims of state or prudential grounds and polemical precepts concerning all states and forms of policy etc confirmed by select narrations and historical precepts  but if we descend to those political writings of our author which were occasionally composed and with more particular regard to the exigents of state in his own time through the virtues of a penetrating eye into the drifts of every neighboring nation and an undiscourageable heart for the security and interest of his own we shall find them still more numerous and these as they most of them have a special regard to spain might proceed from the perfect knowledge he had of that kingdom and its tyrannical practices one instance hereof we have in that discourse of the spaniards cruelties to the english in havanna which is ascribed to sir walter ralegh with other tracts in a volume among the manuscripts of a late person of honor his many other observations of this kind might well produce his consultation about the peace with spain and our protecting the netherlands of which some account has been before given as also that other treatise how war may be made with spain and the indies mentioned in the same place directions for such an enterprise may be easily presumed to have been effectually enough given by the same hands that was also author of the present state of spain with a most accurate account of his catholic majestys power and riches also the names and worth of the most considerable persons in that kingdom a manuscript which i have not hitherto been so successful as to meet with yet take it to be a different performance from that also written by our author and entitled the present state of things as they now stand between the three kingdoms france england and spain whereof there is a copy in being in the harleyan library no    b   it is a tract of about three sheets and a page in folio copied as appears about the reign of king charles i and begins with these words the three great kingdoms france england and spain as they now stand may be compared to the election of a king of poland where there are three factions and in the end two of them joined together are able to overcome the third further it was this intimate knowledge he had in the state of all the european princes which so well qualified him to give the approved advice he did in those two discourses he wrote upon the match propounded by the savoyan between the lady elizabeth and the prince of piedmont and that between prince henry of england and a daughter of savoy of which we have several manuscript copies and as i have heard the original also extant the same knowledge likewise enabled him so dexterously to eviscerate the corrupt doctrines and pernicious designs of the papists in his dialogue between a jesuit and a recusant showing how dangerous their principles are to christian princes another excellent tract we have of his in this way of writing is his dialogue between a counselor of state and a justice of peace better known in the printed copies by the title of his prerogative of parliaments dedicated with a true and generous spirit of wisdom and loyalty to king james these two dialogues will give a perfect taste of our authors manner in these his lesser compositions and are answerable to the character before delivered of his consultation about the peace abovementioned the last tract we have to speak of under this partition except perhaps a short unprinted discourse of the words law and right also ascribed to him and to be found in the ashmolean library is entitled observations touching trade and commerce with the hollander and other nations as it was presented to king james wherein is proved that our sea and land commodities serve to enrich and strengthen other countries against our own but as there are some reasons to doubt whether sir walter ralegh was the author of this treatise i need say no more of it in this place yet shall throw them into a corner of the page roger coke in his detection of the court and state of england during the four last reigns printed  vo the third edition      speaking of ralegh page    fixes these observations on trade and commerce upon him in these words while he was thus confined he was the first who made public the growth by sea of the dutch and the riches they derived from their fishing upon the coasts of england and scotland and the consequence which would necessarily follow not only to the loss of the kings sovereignty of the british seas but to the trade and navigation of england otherwise after that one tobias gentleman set forth another treatise of this nature and how this fishery might be carried on from the ports of england and dedicated it to the king but the king wholly giving himself up to pleasure neither minded one nor regarded the other that gentleman was a fisherman or other like seafaring man and i have seen his treatise but published long before this i think was which that historian ascribes thus to sir walter ralegh the first edition of these observations i could ever meet with in print is in    mo      and it was bound up with the second edition of raleghs remains      its anonymous publisher appears to be the bookseller who had no other authority for appropriating it to sir walter ralegh but the opinion of a person who recommended it to him as a genuine piece of his writing it is true our author has touched after a different manner upon the topic in some of his tracts and particularly at the end of his discourse of shipping where he laments that strangers should be permitted to eat us out by exporting and importing both our own commodities and those of foreign nations  but i think no treatise of his will be found that descends so much into minute examples calculations etc however not to except at this because a treatise upon trade may require observations suitable to the subject it does not appear probable that the author of these observations whose project was as he tells us to erect twenty busses in some seaports town so by degrees to extend a thousand or two over the nation who was one that had traced this business made his endeavors known not only to the king but his noblemen merchants and others who had made him subscriptions to disburse large sums of money for building up this great and rich seacity should be a prisoner all this while in the tower of london no this projector further proposing to constitute a statemerchant for these purposes and praying in the conclusion that the king would give him leave to nominate the commissioners for conferring upon and making report thereof to his majesty seems to have been some manufacturing or mercantile man one ambitious of that office himself and consequently none of sir walter ralegh but if from the subject whereon we bend our consideration to the time when this tract was written we shall find further objection against entitling our author to it for the very first words of the dedication are according to my duty i am emboldened to put your majesty in mind that about    or    years past i presented you a book of such extraordinary importance for honor and profit of your majesty and posterity and doubting it has been laid aside etc i am encouraged to present you with one more etc now if we allow the first book to have been presented in the very first year of the kings being in england then this second must have been presented in      or      when sir walter ralegh was out of england or his thoughts far differently engaged but the greatest objection of all is that there are several manuscripts of this treatise in the libraries of our nobility and gentry more ancient than the earliest edition in print which as i have observed do all entitle it to one john keymer possibly the merchant or vintner of that name whom ralegh many years before had licensed to retail wine in cambridge as is related in the foregoing part of this life with one of these manuscripts the most ancient i have seen among the collections of the late mr granger there was another written also in the same little neat old hand ascribed to the same keymer and which i take to be that first mentioned in his dedication last quoted and also to agree in its contents with john keymers observations made upon the dutch fishery about the year   0  demonstrating there is more wealth raised out of herrings and other fish in his majestys seas and the neighboring nations in one year than the king of spain has from the indies in four and that there were twenty thousand ships and other vessels and about four hundred thousand people then set on work by sea and land and maintained only by fishing upon the coasts of england scotland and ireland printed   vo land from the original manuscript for sir edward ford in the year      whoever has read these two pieces will allow that one hand writ them   where they may least interrupt the progressive view of his remaining writings  these we shall divide but into two parts and then perhaps one of them may be best comprehended under the topic of philosophy this way seems to look by its subject that short treatise of the soul ascribed to sir walter ralegh whereof there is a copy preserved among the ashmolean manuscripts it was never published i think and i have not yet seen it therefore can say no more at present of it but we have in print another treatise which may be admitted under this head being built on the doctrine of pyrrho the greek philosopher entitled sir walter raleghs sceptick or speculations this doctrine showing how much may be said for and against the same things such an ingenious exemplification of it as this little tract contains may if discreetly used prevent many rash dogmatical determinations and inure us to a wary or prudent suspense of judgment for the sceptick as our author describes him does neither affirm nor deny any position but doubts of it and opposes reasons against that which is affirmed or denied to justify his not consenting because he may report how things appear but whether they are so he knows not this little tract as it is here handled relates chiefly to our senses but another we have upon a more dignified topic as concerning our manners or virtues and vices therefore what might be more particularly subdivided under the distinction of moral philosophy and it is called instructions to his son and posterity a treatise well becoming an author who had seen the world in so many climates and life in so many changes it is written in a perspicuous style with forcible arguments and on the most practical subjects these are interspersed with several memorable admonitions the fruits of his particular experience therefore may claim a part in his personal history and being apt to rivet in the mind may prove of constant use and service as touching upon the most incidental engagements in life thus in his first chapter upon the choice of friends he says though i persuade thee to associate with thy betters or at least with thy peers yet remember always that thou venture not thy estate with any of those great ones who shall attempt unlawful things for such men labor for themselves and not for thee thou shall be sure to impart with them in the danger but not in the honor and to venture a sure estate at present in hopes of a better in future is mere madness besides great men forget such as have done them service when they have obtained what they would and will rather hate thee for saying thou have been a means of their advancement than acknowledge it i could give thee a thousand examples i myself know it and have tasted it in all the course of my life from his next chapter on the choice of a wife we have before given extracts in this work his third against flatterers ends with this reflection thou may be sure that he who in private will tell thee of thy faults is thy friend for he adventures thy mislike and hazards thy hatred few can endure it every man for the most part delighting in selfpraise one of the most universal follies which bewitches mankind from the fourth chapter on private quarrels we have already given a taste and here the chief caution he further urges to prevent the inconveniences thereof is ever to beware of unadvised speech he that cannot refrain from much speaking says he is like a city without walls and a little further in all that ever i observed in the course of worldly things i ever found that mens fortunes are oftener made by their tongues than by their virtues and more mens fortunes overthrown thereby also than by their vices in the fifth chapter among the rules recommended to preserve an estate the most pressing is against suretiship advising rather to give a part of what a man has than live in continual apprehension of losing both it and his friend if thou art bound says he for a stranger thou art a fool if for a merchant thou put thy estate to learn to swim if for a churchman he has no inheritance if for a lawyer he will find an evasion by a syllable or a word to abuse thee if for a poor man thou must pay it thyself if for a rich one he needs it not therefore from suretiship as from a manslayer or enchanter bless thyself for the best profit and return will be this that if thou force him for whom thou art bound to pay it himself he will become thy enemy if thou shall choose to pay it thyself thou will be a beggar and believe thy father in this and print it in thy thoughts that whatever virtue thou have be it never so manifold if thou be poor withal thou and thy qualities shall be despised in the sixth chapter upon servants he has this advice if thou trust any servant with thy purse be sure thou take his account ever thou sleep for if thou put it off thou will then afterward for tediousness neglect it i myself have thereby lost more than i am worth whatever thy servant gains thereby he will never thank thee but laugh thy simplicity to scorn besides it is the way to make thy servants thieves who else would be honest the seventh chapter is only a word or two against exceeding in the bravery of gay garments as what will soon wear out of fashion when money in the purse will always be in fashion the eighth is upon riches and as it seems by the beginning should follow the fifth herein exhorting against the attainment of them by base or evil means he charges his son as never to destroy any man for his wealth so by no means further to impoverish the poor but above all things to exercise compassion toward them as the best way to prosperity and peace of mind use says he thy poor neighbors and tenants well pine not them and their children to add superfluity and needless expenses to thyself he that has pity on another mans sorrow shall be free from it himself he that delights in and scorns the misery of another shall one time or other fall into it himself the ninth is against the inconveniences of delighting in wine as being the greatest enemy to health trust honor and preferment and the last chapter begins thus now for the world i know it too well to persuade thee to dive into the practices thereof rather stand upon thy own guard against all that tempt the thereunto or may practice upon thee in thy conscience thy reputation or thy purse resolve that no man is wise or safe but he that is honest so concludes with advising him to make god his director in all his actions  with these instructions to his son which have i think been oftener printed than most other of our authors lesser pieces there is usually joined in all the editions i have seen the dutiful advice of a loving son to his aged father it is a religious and rhetorical exhortation to prepare for his latter end written in a general manner but how probably by our author or by either of his sons it is left to the critical and discerning reader all the works i have met with further ascribed to sir walter ralegh bearing any affinity with this class are two manuscripts which might be distinguished under the branch of natural philosophy  the first is his treatise of mines and the trial of minerals a subject on which he very probably might write both from his own observations in the west indies and those engagements he might also have in his native county of devon with his brother sir adrian gilbert who first in queen elizabeths reign begun to work the long neglected mines in combmartin whence king edward iii had supplied his wars against france and was followed by sir beavis bulmer who from those mines recovered a great quantity of silver out of which he caused two massy goblets to be made one whereof was presented to the earl of bath and the other weighing one hundred thirty seven ounces to the lord mayor of london in the   th of the queens reign so that what cicero says to his friend of this island that it yielded not a dram of that metal was false in raleghs time and what he could not be sure was true in his own but whether the said treatise is so particular as to mention any thing of this i know not having never seen it the second manuscript is sir walter raleghs collection of chemical and medicinal receipts for fixing mercury preparing antimony and for the cure of several diseases his application to studies of this kind may perhaps be somewhat accountable from the patronage which as in a note before cited it appears he had shown to john hester the famous chemist with the conversation there might probably pass between them and the knowledge he had learned from the guianians of curing all manner of poisons etc it is apparent that he bestowed some portion of his time upon the use of lembicks and crucibles while he was in the tower and seems to have had a kind of laboratory there for his said operations a view of him in this light will explain the expression in a character of him given by dr joseph hall the venerable bishop of norwich whom sir h wotton calls the english seneca where he speaks among other things which will be hereafter observed of sir walter raleghs philosophical experiments in the tower and other authors might be produced who in their character of him also refer to his profound knowledge in the mysteries of nature or his investigations thereof through the animal vegetable and mineral world for the benefit of his countrymen notwithstanding some memorable attempts to advance their prosperity in the political world had met with much discouragement as if though he could not absolutely recover them from some indispositions or corruptions of the mind he was hereby resolved to try how serviceable and successful he could be against the maladies of their body  how elaborately soever many of these pieces are allowed by others to have been written our author looked upon them but as little excursions or sallies as he calls them from his grand labor i mean that ocean of history wherein he has outdone all that went before him and given such lights to futurity as must ever be grateful a voyage which if begun even in the dawn of his day when the light of knowledge first broke out upon his younger years and before any wound received either from fortune or time he might yet well have doubted as he observes himself that the darkness of age and death would have overtaken him long before the performance but being undertaken as it was in the evening of a tempestuous life a life so far run out in travels and considerations of such opposite nature for one under the soulpiercing privations of honor fortune freedom one buried alive to attempt such a universal revival of the dead and while his body under all those pressures was so long incarcerated for his brain to be delivered of that minerva as one calls it his history of the world is an example that might puzzle such an historian even as ralegh himself to parallel for beginning at the creation he has given us the flower of recorded story down to the end of the second macedonian war thus having reviewed the three first monarchies of the world he leaves rome in the fourth triumphant about a century and a half before the birth of christ comprehending a period of near four thousand yeas this work was divided by our author into five books who annexed to it a very copious and useful chronological table and it was with the further decorations of maps tables of genealogy etc published in the month of april just before the meeting of the parliament in a large volume folio      the approbation it has met with since the authors death has been so universal that if they are different editions of the book to which we may see different dates printed we may venture to say no work of any author in england has been so often reprinted that is of equal size and antiquity the several characters and commendations which have been bestowed on this history as well by miscellaneous writers who have frequently quoted it with great deference and respect as by historians and critics who have closely traced and thoroughly examined it and as well in verse as prose would be too numerous to be here inserted could they be recovered to provide therefore as well against the ignorance as the satiety of those readers who have not met with them a few are presented in the annotation here directed to this may not perhaps be better introduced than in the reflection of bishop hall who in his ingenious book of consolations has these words a wise man as laurentius the presbyter observed well does much in solitude so may thou employ the hours of thy close retiredness and bless god for so happy an opportunity how memorable an instance has our age afforded us of an eminent person to whose imprisonment we are all obliged besides many philosophical experiments for that noble history of the world now in our hands the court had his youthful and freer years and the tower his latter age the tower reformed the courtier in him and produced those worthy monuments of art and industry which we should have in vain expected from his freedom and jollity it is observed that shining wood when it is kept within doors loses its light it is otherwise with this and many other active wits which had never shined so much if not for closeness thus in a treatise called balm of gilead or comforts for the distressed both moral and divine by dr joseph hall bishop of norwich   mo      afterward reprinted under the title of the art of patience etc  vo      in the familiar letters of james howel esquire speaking of this rare and renowned knight he says his fame shall contend in longaevity with this island itself yea with that great world which he historises so gallantly in another wellknown book of his called dodonas grove or the vocal forest discoursing of ralegh and describing him to have been a cavalier of a spacious understanding and of no vulgar reach in policy scientifical and full of abstruse notions he adds that though his body was under restraint and coffined up so many years yet he never traversed more countries than then for his brain ran over all the world as appears by that famous monument he transmitted to posterity and hung up in the temple of fame while he was as it were buried alive but in the life of the lord stafford written by anthony stafford esquire  to    0 this author goes so far as to say that if sir walter raleghs history of the world had been written in the indian tongue we should not have scrupled or avoided the pains of learning that language only to read it if we consult what character the historians give it we may find many of them who never name it without some epithet or sentence in its praise thus dr heylin in one place calls it an excellent history in another the first or chief of histories and thus in the preface of dr william howells universal history who must have had continual occasions of inspecting our authors it is said that sir walter ralegh is never to be mentioned without honor shirley in his life of our author gives it as his judgment of his history that for the exactness of its chronology curiousness of its contexture and learning of all sorts it seems to be the work of an age and a little further that a man who had been the greatest part of his life taken up in action should write so judiciously so critically of times and actions is as great a wonder as the book itself and it still remains in doubt whether the age he lived in was more obliged to his pen or his sword the one being busy in conquering the new the other in so bravely describing the old world and mr echard in the preface of his roman history admires that part of raleghs history which treats of the roman story especially the last hundred years which says he are written with very much spirit and judgment and all of it with as much skill and clearness yet that all before the first panick war is not proportionably copious to the rest but how duly it was considered by this particular historian whether that was not a judicious disproportion in our general historian may be left to the examination of others  to this we may join the character of dr henry felton in his dissertation upon the classicks where he says sir walter raleghs history of the world is a work of so vast a compass such endless variety that no genius but one adventurous as his own durst have undertaken that great design i do not apprehend any great difficulty in collecting and commonplacing an universal history from the whole body of historians that is nothing but mechanic labor but to digest the several authors in his mind to take in all their majesty strength and beauty to raise the spirit of meaner historians and to equal all the excellencies of the best this is sir walters peculiar praise his style is the most perfect the happiest the most beautiful of the age he wrote in majestic clear and manly and he appears every where so superior rather than unequal to his subject that the spirit of rome and athens seems to be breathed into his work     he took no ordinary care to deserve these encomiums for besides his own learning knowledge and judgment which many would have thought sufficient for any undertaking he with that caution wherewith we have beheld so many others of his great enterprises tempered would suffer no part of this history to pass his own hand before some of the most able scholars whom he assemhled it seems for this purpose had debated the parts he was most doubtful of and they most conversant in before him thus in the mosaic and oriental antiquities or fainter and more remote footsteps of time he would sometimes consult the learned dr robert burhill in all parts of chronology geography and other branches of mathematical science he wanted not the opinions of the learned hariot and the earl of northumberlands three magi long his neighbors in the tower and wherever he scrupled any thing in the phrase or diction he would hear the acute and ingenious sir john hoskyns sometime also resident in these confines who viewed and reviewed the said history as we are told before it went to the press and whom ben johnson proud of calling others his sons could gratify that humor in calling father thus having spared no labor and neglected no means to bring this work to the perfection wherein we behold it it is no wonder that some scribbler or other should upon finding it so universally read endeavor to raise himself a little profit or credit from it by pretending that the world needed an abridgment of its history as if that wherewith sir walter ralegh has presented us either is or was intended for any thing more but this more specious kind of detraction meeting with no countenance the author of it threw out another of animadversions upon this history but as insignificant and no less disregarded than the other being agreeable to that unhappy spirit of contradiction which ever harrassd him to oppose the greatest writers in his time  but that which is more considerable concerning this history is whether our author ever continued it down to his own times and whether on some pretense that this first part did not meet with encouragement he ever destroyed the said continuation himself as we have it in the mouths of every body when they speak of him but in the belief of nobody who knows any thing of his story or his character all that he says himself in the least glancing this way is first in his preface that he proposed to confine his discourse with this our renowned isle of great britain and that he forbears to promise a second or third volume which he intends if the first receives grace and good acceptance for that which is already done may be thought enough and too much lastly in the conclusion of the history he says whereas this book by the title calls itself the first part of the general history of the world implying a second and third volume which i also intended and have hewn out besides many discouragements persuading my silence it has pleased god to take that glorious prince out of the world to whom they were directed whose unspeakable and neverenough lamented loss has taught me to say with job versa est in luctum cithera mea and organum meum in vocem flentium from hence it seems plain enough that our author had only some plan or perhaps a few rough draughts of some succeeding parts of the history at this time drawn up and that he was discouraged from making any further progress in them allowing his mind might change and that there was time enough to finish the remaining volumes between this year and that of his death which is scarcely allowable yet as we know how most of that time was employed by him it will admit of no room for any such performance for in      the year which followed that wherein he published his history two at least of his most elaborate tracts beforementioned were written the same year he was also busy in writing letters and making other interest for his releasement which he obtained before it was quite expired after this it will no less appear that he made himself too eminently the subject of modern history to be any further an author of that which is ancient there is indeed a little intimation of the design he had upon some ancient part of our english story preserved in a letter of his own written it seems though undated before his great work was published to that acquaintance whose library was most likely to accommodate him with those uncommon books which he wanted for his purpose this letter is as follows sir robert cotton if you have any of these old books or any manuscripts wherein i may find any of our british antiquities if you please to lend them me for a little while i will safely restore them and think myself much beholden unto you or if you have any old french history wherein our nation is mentioned or any else in what language soever so subscribes himself your poor friend w ralegh but this does not sufficiently assure us whether the use of these books was to continue his general history or furnish him upon some more particular subject however we may incline with the writer of sir robert cottons life to the former opinion and as for the reasons of one ingenious author why sir walter ralegh was the most proper person to write the history of his own time and the opinion of another that his admirable performance already published sufficiently shows that if he had attempted the history of his own country or his own times he would have excelled even livy or thucydides and that the annals of queen elizabeth by his pen without diminishing from the serious and judicious camden had been the brightest glory of her reign and would have transmitted his history as the standard of our language even to the present age these are still no affirmatives that he did finish such a second part so that his own intimations in the first part reserved and inconclusive as they are seem to have been the only foundation of that formal story how sir walter ralegh a few days before his death sent for walter burre the bookseller who had printed his first volume and taking him by the hand asked him how that work of his had sold who answered so slowly that it had undone him hereupon ralegh stepping to his d sk reached out the other part of his history which he had brought down to the times he lived in then saying with a sigh ah friend has the first part undone thee the second volume shall undo no more this ungrateful world is unworthy of it so stepped to the fire threw it in and set his foot on it till it was consumed but as we observed before ralegh had no leisure to finish such a second part of his history down to his own time in the next place it is no ways probable that he who in regard to the first part could follow the rule of seneca that he who having satisfied his own conscience could disregard the censure of others should sacrifice so great a part of his labors or any part in such a rash and inconsiderate manner to the sudden representations of a bookseller without ever suspecting any mercenary ends in him further it does not appear true that the first part did sell slowly for there was a second edition of it set forth by that very bookseller within three years after the first and lastly the first man we can meet with who reports the same is a trifling and superficial writer who produces no authority for his assertion  as to the unfinished parts he might have of such a continuation to admit that they were thus destroyed would moreover in no wise agree with an account we have more satisfactorily attested of that great quantity there was in being of sir walter raleghs unprinted writings several years after his death for it is affirmed to us that the famous mr hamden a little before the civil wars was at the charge of transcribing      sheets of sir walter ralegh s manuscripts as the amanuensis himself told me says my author who had his close chamber his fire and candle with an attendant to deliver him the originals and take his copies as fast as he could write them yet what is become of this treasure now i have not been able to learn for if we suppose that mr hamden would not be at the trouble and charge of transcribing any of our authors writings which had then been printed and grant that all of his which have been printed since that time as well as all we can hear of remaining in ms which are allowed to be his were part of that collection or quantity they will not both joined together as might be computed from what is here observed of them amount to a fourth part thereof though we should admit two or three pieces more also ascribed to him which have not yet been named and happen to fall under his historical division the first of them is called a notable and memorable story of the cruel war between the carthaginians and their own mercenaries gathered out of polybius and other authors by that famous historian sir walter ralegh the other two pieces might seem to fall within the intended continuation of his universal history but the first of them called the life and death of mahomet the conquest of spain together with the rising and ruin of the saracen empire ascribed to sir walter ralegh near twenty years after his death by the bookseller who dedicated it to his son is except a few leaves about that of mahomet no more than a translation of an epitomy made by some ignorant spanish author chiefly from what one of his own fabulous countrymen had written of a fictitious prince named jacob almansor as i have been assured by a gentleman of great knowledge both in the spanish and oriental writers but the style itself so uncouth in some places so meagre in others and incorrect especially in known things places and persons might of itself exclude our author from having any hand it the other piece is styled an introduction to a breviary of the history of england with the reign of king william i entitled the conqueror written by sir walter ralegh it was near fourscore years after his death before this was published yet there are several old manuscript copies of it in the libraries of the curious which entitle him the author of it but it was written at least two years before he published his history of the world because it was inscribed to a person who died so long before the said publication in these words i intend by the help of god and your furtherance right noble earl of salisbury to write a brief history of england from william the first entitled the conqueror to the end of queen elizabeth of perpetual memory but by then his history of the world was finished he was as we have observed also from his own words discouraged from all continuation to these discouragements might be added the ungrateful treatment which was shown to this part he did publish at its first appearance for though we have observed what universal approbation it has met with since the authors death yet how it was rereceivd as soon as it came abroad and made its first visits at court we are yet to relate  those who thought the king must needs be a patron of authors because he was one of the number have been ready to insinuate that his favor increased toward ralegh in proportion to the proofs his pen had given of his abilities therefore that his many excellent writings and especially this history of the world were the most powerful intercessors for his releasment out of the tower as if his majesty in respect to his own honor thought it in vain longer to confine his person since no condition could confine his fame or in regard to raleghs merit that he had well deserved no place should be a barrier to his liberty who had given such extraordinary testimony that no age could set a bound to his knowledge sanderson has described the freedom which not long after ensued to one of those motives where he says sir walter ralegh wearied with long imprisonment and having there spent his time well in the history of the world made his petition more passable to the king whose love to learning granted him now at last his liberty and not long after leave to wander after a design to the western world where he had been in several climates before but others who seem to have known the matter much better or have more ingenuously imparted it assure us that raleghs excellent talents were so far from ingratiating him with the king that though his majesty had been intemperately praised by flatterers for some of the weakest of his own compositions yet he could not forbear out of an impertinent emulation to affect sir walter ralegh the less because of the great repute which followed him for his excellent pen nay we are elsewhere told in answer to sanderson above that raleghs history of the world gave the king so much displeasure that at its first publication it was forbid and particularly for some passages in it which offended the spaniard as also for being too plain with the faults of princes in his preface for it is indeed replenished with many remarkable examples of divine vengeance poured forth on princes of many other nations as well as our own who strove to establish their thrones by oppression and iniquity that passage in answer to sanderson is so far from being denied by this writer that he afterward confirmed it in contradiction to what himself had written as above about raleghs petition being made more passable by his history where after his gross manner of interpretation he says king james and all other princes had cause of complaint because his whole book sets out the eastern monarchs with much glory and exclaims against christian princes as most inhuman tracing all the english sovereigns from the conquest especially henry the eighth whom for his daughters honor sir walter ralegh might have spared from gall and bitterness and a little further king james might perhaps observe more to repress the wickedness of such a person who under pretense of taxing a vice in the father intended cunningly to stain the whole race etc this objection against raleghs character of the king is more particularly ascribed to king james by another writer also beforecited who tells us that after much scorn cast upon raleghs history the king being modestly demanded what fault he found answered as one surprised that ralegh had spoken irreverently of king henry the eighth as if he would have reflected a breach of gratitude upon our historian toward his benefactress the late queen in speaking such truth when he was to give a character of her father as not only others who read it must concur in seeing the historian has so many proofs at his fingers end to confirm it but what that king himself were he alive on whom it was written must also have allowed since it is only a paraphrase upon his own dying confession that he had been a prince who never spared man in his anger nor woman in his lust but if king james could thus object against ralegh for one character and pay him no thanks for another which follows in the same paragraph of that preface and in some parts of the history itself this may perhaps best show where lay the breach of gratitude but however his majesty might think it a kind of blasphemy that any below the dignity of princes should be the censors of them yet that objection aforesaid seems not to be the natural cause says our lastquoted author of his dislike to this history since none ever exclaimed more against that prince than usually king james himself did and others more particularly still are inclined to believe that any liberty ralegh may have taken with the characters of other princes was not so much the real cause of such disgust in king james as through the insinuations of some mischievous sycophants about him who knew well what humor might be most agreeably fed that several parts of the history contained an oblique and artful exposure of himself and his ministry as if truly the general history of the world was chiefly a secret history or satire upon his court and scotch faces were to be seen in it stuck upon old jewish babylonian or assyrian shoulders for as one has observed there was a time when one of our most renowned historians could not comment upon a piece of the old testament without being thought to write a libel upon his own times and the king was almost led to fancy he saw his own features in the face of ninias the son of queen semiramis but surely if he could think his justice censured in the story of ahab s taking away naboth s vineyard and not commended in that of the french kings conduct toward his judge and admiral of france he must not only have been a very captious and selftormenting reader but have satirizd himself more sharply by engrossing of application or acquiescing in resemblances than he could have been by that author had he really intended any but the truth is that conscious minds can find in every example something to chastise themselves and to stomachs vitiated through foul and unwholesome administrations with evil habits the most innocent diet is upbraiding that ralegh soresaw his enemies would make such perverse construction and misuse of his history is evident enough in his own words where mentioning the choice he had made at least exceptionable of the elder times to describe he yet anticipates this objection against this choice also why may it not be said that in speaking of the passed i point at the present and tax the vices of those who are yet living in their persons who are long since dead and have it laid to my charge but this i cannot help though innocent and certainly if there be any who finding themselves spotted like the tigers of old time shall find fault with me for painting them over anew they shall therein accuse themselves justly and me falsely yet such fault there was we see found and so falsely was he accused thus the honor which should reward a public benefit is stifled by private prejudice  we are therefore to seek some other mediator for raleghs deliverance out of prison than his merit by this public benefit and that we shall at last find to be his money though other causes in our common histories are also suggested especially that which seemed most effectual the offer he made of fitting out an expedition to secure and possess for the crown a gold mine in guiana which he had himself discovered when he was formerly in that country and which since that time had been by others so amply testified that further confirmation was not now required so that raleghs being deceived by keymis with ore of a golden complexion which he brought from thence or by any chemical tricks such as secretly slipping real gold with the ore into the meltingpot are foolish untruths now that offer ralegh had made at least three years before he obtained his liberty with no unreasonable expectation of its being accepted since king james had so publicly asserted and confirmed the right of england to that country through sir walter raleghs conquest and discoveries therein with the submission he had gained from the chief lords thereof as to have given commissions and patents for the possession of the same that is to say all from the river of amazons to the dessequebe and all the islands for twenty miles about in his majestys name which were accordingly executed in all due form by captain charles leigh and captain robert harcourt which last left a colony there of thirty persons for three years as may be read at large in the narratives of their several expeditions besides the public invitations and encouragement which afterward ensued to all who would again settle and plant in that new discovered part of america gave the discoverer himself no doubt the greater hopes that his own propositions being not for his private but the public benefit yet at his own expense and that of such friends as he should engage in the adventure could not but be embraced add to this the advantages of his further knowing the riches of this country even while he was in prison not only by the long conversation he had with those indians whom we find here with him in the former part of his confinement but others who from time to time came over to him for during this long imprisonment he held constant intercourse with guiana and was at the charge every year or every second year of sending a ship or more thither to keep them in hopes of being relieved from the spaniards who had again encroachd upon them and cruelly massacred both several of the natives and of his own men so that the number of voyages he set forth for guiana was at least as many if not more than those he is before observed to have fitted out for virginia  but all this experience which should have recommended his offer served at first only to render it unacceptable for the treasurer cecyll being then alive he with two or three others who bore the sway at court were resolved to discountenance it not that they so much doubted the probability that such treasure might remain unpossessd or the knowledge and resolution of ralegh to compass it so much as his disposition toward themselves if by a successful return he should purchase the kings favor therefore to prevent such a rival as he might prove to them the advantage he proposed to the state was neglected nay so deeply had they rooted prejudices in the kings breast toward him in this particular as well as in others beforementioned that when his majesty was solicited by any person in raleghs behalf and royal sollicitors he had he with that implicit reliance on other mens reports which those in supreme station so often bury their own judgments and their justice in would answer that his council knew him better than he did but after cecylls death and now that sir ralph winwood was secretary of state ralegh revived his proposal to him and in a letter told him with relation to those two or three earwigs who were ever crawling about the king and at the mercy of whose representations he had so long lain that it was his only infelicity the king did not know him as well as those courtiers pretended to do for had his majesty known me says he i had never been here where i now am or had i known his majesty they had never been so long there where they now are his majesty not knowing me has been my ruin and his misknowing them has been the ruin of a goodly part of his estate but they are all of them now some living and some dying come to his majestys knowledge we learn furtherout of the said letter that both queen anne who had informed herself from the beginning of all that ralegh had been accused with and her brother the king of denmark at both times of his being in england were thoroughly satisfied of his innocence otherwise they would never have moved his majesty in his behalf and prince henry who had been curious in searching into the nature of his offenses had been frequently a mediator for him as we have read before hereupon says ralegh the wife the brother and the son of a king do not use to sue for men suspect but since they have all done it and with reference to me alone you strengthened by their example may with the more hardiness do the like toward the end ralegh having acknowledged that all he had remaining was owing to the king and that he was ready to sacrifice it all in his majestys service concludes with this noble distinction to die for the king and not by the king is all the ambition i have in the world  this and other like addresses to that new secretary advanced not raleghs request so much but he found it necessary to use stronger interest than what he was here making and more substantial arguments than could flow from a pen for whatever pity of his sufferings his merit and fame of learning now begat in many or by whatever means of the french ambassador with others of our own lords it is pretended in our common accounts of him that he got freedom of repairing for his health to his house at st jamess a year or two before he procured his commission for his voyage to guiana we are more positively and particularly told that sir william st john and sir edward villiers halfbrother to the lady villiers afterward duchess of buckingham procured sir walter ralegh s liberty and had fifteen hundred pounds for their labor it further appears that these used their power with sir george villiers the new rising favorite at court and so obtained the kings consent for raleghs enlargement for there is a letter of raleghs acknowledgments to that favorite in these words sir you have by your mediation put me again into the world i can but acknowledge it for to pay any part of your favor by any service of mine as yet it is not in my power if it succeed well a good part of the honor shall be yours and if i do not also make it profitable unto you i shall show myself exceeding ungrateful in the mean while and till god discover the success i beseech you to reckon me among the number of your faithful servants though the least able w ralegh this letter is dated only march    but probably written in this year last mentioned      because three days afterward as camden has precisely remembered sir walter ralegh was released out of the tower so that he thus purchased his liberty in the thirteenth year of his confinement that is to say after he had been without intermission twelve years three months and five days in the said tower of london besides near three months more at his first commitment thither and during his arraignment at winchester  at this time carr earl of somerset had been about four or five months in the said tower with his countess for the barbarous impoisonment of sir thomas overbury about two years before in the same place to which he had treacherously driven him for only having obstructed the said earls vile and scandalous commerce with that lewd woman while she was young essexs wife these two accidents at this time drew great notice happening as it is observed in a tract ascribed to the lord brook so much beyond all expectation that the one being a special favorite of the king the other a condemned man the one imprisoned the other set at liberty gave great occasion of speech and rumor and so much the more wonder and admiration because of ralegh s wit and policy raleigh is further said by the same author to have given somerset many quips and taunts during his said imprisonment and it may not be improbable toward such an undeserving intruder upon his estate but as this earl of somerset was convicted of felony for the said murder whereby the two hundred thousand pounds he had heaped up and lands to the income of nineteen thousand pounds per annum being again dispersed and as the king had laid that heavy curse upon himself and his posterity which he did if ever he pardoned any of the said murderers it might have been thought that raleghs comparison of himself and that noble malefactor would not have been spoiled when he said that the whole history of the world had not the like precedent of a kings prisoner to purchase freedom and his bosom favorite to have the halter but in scripture in the case of mordecai and haman instead of that ralegh is said by the relater of this passage to have been told the king should reply upon hearing this observation that ralegh might die in that deceit and so he did as this author truly says for the king now saved the life of the one as much to the astonishment of the world as he afterward put the other to death but he could do no less if his favorite was really a master of such secrets as are elsewhere spoken of and this is enough to resolve why the misfortunes of that earl if they may be called such which at the worst were more favorable than his merits in any wise deserved were not equal to his crimes  ralegh being thus at liberty soon appears busy in making preparation for his voyage to this purpose he called in the  000 pounds which he had lent to the countess of bedford reckoned in king james his declaration a competent satisfaction for sherborne though it was afterward valued by the state at  000 l per annum but seeing that not sufficient to fit out a fleet in the manner he found necessary his wife consented also to sell her house and lands at micham in surrey for which he received   00 l all which and more he expended in this expedition and what frenzy could possess him as he says himself thus to dispose of his whole substance and undertake such a toilsome and perilous voyage now that his constitution was impaired by such a long confinement besides age itself sickness and affliction were he not assured thereby of doing his prince service bettering his country by commerce and restoring his family to their estates all from the mines of guiana and says he if i myself had not seen them with my own eyes i have not yet heard who was the purchaser of that estate at micham but there is a letter of raleghs to a nobleman extant which possibly relates thereunto it is to entreat him to make an impartial valuation of some lands to a rising favorite who was to be the purchaser and is penned in the following words i humbly beseech your lordship to give me leave and pardon too if i need it for the answering of those things which you were lately pleased to object against me and that you will charitably also consider both of my demands and of the reasons which embolden me to make them those answers go here in a paper which is enclosed apart and my letter shall say but thus much that the gentleman who is so greatly in favor has many fair fortunes before him and we nothing to look for but misery and that he is better able to give us above the worth of the land than we in condition to abate any part thereof and therefore we humbly beseech your lordship that your compassion and care of honor may be the judge between his prosperous navigation and our shipwreck and that your charity for us and your desire of satisfaction for him may equal the balance between us i hope so heartily to find all just favor at your hands as i will venture upon this to ossure you that i will do all my utmost to make my wife and son forget themselves and be ever mindful of their duty toward your lordship to whom i hope they will be as i am sure myself have been and am a most faithful humble servant  besides the ten thousand five hundred pounds which it cost sir walter ralegh to put himself in equipage for this longproposed voyage a much greater sum than would have paid for his liberty of receding from it or for a formal pardon had he thought he needed and had gone about to purchase it there were many coadventurers who by contributions to the expense thereof entitled themselves to a share in the returns but most of these are called by ralegh a company of volunteers who had never seen the sea nor wars and except some forty gentlemen a very dissolute disorderly and ungovernable crew whom their friends thought it an exceeding good gain to be discharged of at the hazard of some thirty forty or fifty pounds knowing they could not have lived a whole year so cheap at home there were moreover several merchants not only in england but foreign parts who contributed to this mineadventure so confident were they that it was no chimera no supposititious or airy treasure that was promised or pursued one of these merchants afterward knighted and very eminent for his dealings was named peter vanlore who so approved of sir walter raleghs undertaking that he not only sent a letter to his brother sir adrian thibaut in amsterdam requesting him to engage another merchant there to communicate something he knew of the riches in guiana to sir walter ralegh but made that request in raleghs own manner of expression from a copy which he drew up for him this draught as i have it from the said original is as follows brother tibotes there is a merchant in amsterdam that for the love he bears to my honorable friend sir walter ralegh is content to discover somewhat of importance unto him in guiana to which country sir walter ralegh is now preparing to go but he does require assarance from sir walter ralegh that he himself may be assured to enjoy such part of the commodity discovered as he shall agree upon with sir walter ralegh by his deputy mr henry hovenar i do therefore pray you to speak with the party which mr hovenar will bring unto you and to know what assurances he will require which to pleasure sir walter i shall be willing to give that is to say to give him assurance that upon sir walter s return into england the charges being deducted the discoverer shall receive from sir walter such part of the said merchandise as sir walter and he shall agree on although there needs no such assurne to be given because his majesty does assure all sir walter s partners by the great seal of england that they shall truly and quietly enjoy all their parts and shares of what goods merchandise or treasure soever shall be returned out of which great seal of england the discoverer shall have an assignment for so much as belongs unto him to be delivered here in london to whomsoever he shall appoint to receive it then in a new line he concludes thus to mr peter vanlore this is the letter which i desire you to write to your brother in amsterdam and for any assurance you shall give i will again put you in sureties to save you harmless w ralegh this letter is dated july        and if ralegh had his commission for that voyage before this time as it appears he had by his citing it then it must be erroneously dated being near two months after in king jamess declaration here again that commission seems to have been given under the great seal of england and also elsewhere in that declaration it is said to be under the privy seal but there are other things observable of this commission as it is there printed and in other places as we shall see presently  in the mean while we may here observe a little opposition that was made to this voyage and indeed some persons at court who might remember what advances ralegh had formerly made there by the means of several exploits which he undertook at a distance from it and others admonished by conscience that every friendly gale in his navigation would be splitting them upon a rock might well be expected to obstruct as far as they could his progress but none do we hear of so impatient and clamorous against it as the spaniard for there had been now in england about three years an agent from spain named diego sarmiento de acuna better known but not till about the time of raleghs death or perhaps after it by the title of count de gondomar a man who if he gained that influence he did over king james purely by art must be allowed a good share of dexterity in the mysteries of negotiation but as he was adapted by nature to sooth and captivate him no less than by the pretensions of his agency it diminishes the wonders of his success in making that king such a subject to his enchantments and keeping him so many years a prisoner as it were in the tower he had heaped up of airy and glittering promises yet what reward was reserved for all his services here in his own country and how this ardent slave to the will and pleasure of his master was both executioner of his royal pride as well as other passions and sacrifice also at last to them must be left for those to display who have more leisure to dilate upon such retaliations of providence this was the man who as he is represented in king jamess declaration now took great alarm and is said to have made loud and vehement assertions to his majesty in repeated audiences that he knew and had discovered the intention and enterprise of sir walter ralegh to be but hostile and piratical tending to the breach between the two crowns and the danger and destruction of the king his masters subjects in those parts protesting in a sort against it to which that the king should answer as it is there said after raleghs death he would send sir walter ralegh with a limited commission but how limited it was will soon appear and that he durst not upon peril of his head do any such matter and if he did he would surely do justice upon him or send him bound hand and foot into spain with all the gold and goods he should obtain by robbery and bring home were they never so great then the king by sir ralph winwood got both a solemn protestation from ralegh that he had no other intention but only to go to those gold mines and also a close letter to his majesty as it is here in his declaration justly called confirming the same this close letter was both written close to the purpose or in such expressive terms as to have laid open the whole scheme of raleghs voyage and also as a matter to be kept close or with the utmost privacy for it is said that upon such communication his majesty promised on the word of a king to keep it secret and it would have prevented all supposition of disingenuity if this close letter had been fairly exhibited in that declaration had it been when this was penned in the kings possession as it ought according to his royal promise on the contrary this seems to have been the very letter by which through the spanish ambassadors means his master the king of spain was preadmonishd of raleghs whole enterprise and had sent to guiana before he left the british channel to prepare a greater force than his to oppose him as will hereafter appear nay it is visible by what immediately follows in the said declaration both that this close letter how closely soever the contents of it are withheld did reveal the particulars of raleghs naval strength and that the king did divulge it to the spanish ambassador because it was so far from making him recede from his former jealousy that he is discovered to have objected thereupon against the number of ships ralegh had prepared for the said voyage to which ralegh then doubtless made as proper answer as we shall find he did hereafter but in short such a proposal by one carrying the reputation of such an active witty and valiant gentleman especially of so great a commander at sea as his enemies allow he had one who must be thought most wary above all others of incurring king jamess displeasure under which he had so long suffered one who had given such public attestations of his sincerity in the prosecution of this proposal and one who as the greatest proof he could give thereof was actually embarking his whole fortune as well as credit together with those of his friends and relations all finding security for their good behavior without any charge to the crown if they failed and with prospect of great advantage if they succeeded was so far from being overthrown by any remonstrances of the ambassador himself or from being thought a most noble and generous overture by all other men that even the kings honor is acknowledged in his own declaration to have been engaged not to deny his people the adventure and hope of so great riches and yet what character of that kings honor toward his people is exposed in the same leaf of that very declaration where it is pretended that in his own princely judgment he gave no belief to it as being persuaded that in nature there were no such mines entire or that the spaniards so industrious in the chase of treasure would have so long neglected the same is left to the readers distinction but it may be best discovered by the care taken to secure his majestys dividend so clearly and to express many other articles so doubtfully in the commission itself of which we shall now give an impartial abstract whether it was from a magnanimous principle or a mercenary one from upright policy or downright prevarication that the same was granted being as folows  james by the grace of god etc to all to whom these presents shall come etc whereas sir walter ralegh knight intends to undertake a voyage by sea and shipping to the south parts of america or elsewhere within america possessed and inhabited by heathen and savage people to discover some commodities and merchandise profitable for the subjects of our kingdoms whereof the inhabitants make little or no use whence may ensue by commerce some propagation of the christian faith and reformed religion among those idolatrous people and whereas there are diverse merchants etc well disposed to assist sir walter raleigh had they assurance to enjoy their due share of the profits returned sir walter raleigh being under the peril of the law and whereas diverse other gentlemen his kinsmen and friends with several captains and commanders are also desirous to follow and venture their lives with him if they might be commanded by none but himself we upon deliberate consideration desiring the benefit of our subjects also to give our princely furtherance to the said sir walter ralegh and his friends as well as to encourage others in the like laudable enterprises advance the conversion of savages and increase traffic by our subjects of this kingdom have of our special grace etc granted sir walter raleigh full power to carry for the said voyage so many of our subjects or others who will become our subjects as shall willingly accompany him with sufficient shipping armor weapons ordnance munition powder shot etc and all other things as he shall think necessary for the use and defense of him and his company besides liberty to exchange or otherwise dispose of his goods or merchandise also to return into this or other of our dominions with such gold silver bullion or any other wares and they to be converted to the proper use of the said sir walter ralegh and his company paying to us our heirs etc the full fifth part of all such gold and silver bullion and ore of gold or silver pearl or precious stones as shall be so imported with all such customs etc as shall be due for any other goods whatever further to encourage sir walter ralegh and the adventurers we promise in verbo regio that no gold silver or other wares by them imported from those parts so possessed and inhabited shall be seized by us our heirs or any of our officers but that it shall remain the fifth part of the said gold silver bullion etc as before with all other customs and duties being truly paid to the sole use of sir walter ralegh and his company further of our most special grace etc we constitute the said sir walter ralegh to be the sole governor and commander of all persons who shall travel or be with him in the said voyage or in their return and give him full power to correct punish pardon and rule them according to such orders and instructions as the said sir walter ralegh shall establish as well in cases capital and criminal as civil both marine and other so that the said proceedings as near as conveniently as may be are agreeable to the laws of this realm and to the christian faith now professed in the church of england and because in such enterprises great inconveniences have grown by mutinies and disorders for want of sufficient authority we give full power to sir walter ralegh in case of rebellion or mutiny by sea or land to exercise martial law upon just and apparent necessity in as ample a manner as our lieutenant general by sea or land or our lieutenants in the counties of england and we give sir walter ralegh full power to appoint such captains and other commanders and ministers under him as shall be requisite for the better ordering and governing his company we further command the wardens of the cinque ports customers and other officers quietly to permit sir walter ralegh and all who shall adventure with him to pass to the said south or other parts of america possessed and inhabited as aforesaid and to return with any goods whatever and to sell or otherwise dispose of the same to the only use of him and his company paying the fifth part of all gold silver bullion etc as before imported and other customs and duties aforesaid and these presents etc shall be to the said wardens etc sufficient warrant and we grant to the said sir walter ralegh that these our letters patents or the inrollment thereof with all the grants clauses etc therein shall be sufficient and effectual in law any law statute etc notwithstanding witness ourselves the   th day of august in the   th year of our reign of england france and ireland and of scotland the  0th per breve de privato sigillo  this abstract is made from the said commission as it is printed in king jamess declaration and may agree with that which seems also to have been given us from the records whether there was originally any preamble to it we cannot say but there are authors who affirm that in this commission king james called him his trusty and well beloved sir walter ralegh though these may be words of course in such like instruments yet if some words were thus taken out in that recital aforesaid it might give reason of inferring that by the same liberty others have been squeezed in yet even as it is suffered there to appear it is surely far from being so clearly penned in point of those limitations it is said in his majestys declaration he promised the spanish ambassador for here is no limitation to any part of america not only the south parts but elsewhere being authorized and all that are habitable inhabited in some degree or other by heathen and savage people so vague so equivocal and disputable is that distinction not one word of guiana no owning of his own right or the power he had lately given to plant there no privilege for working any mine there nor prohibition to meddle with the king of spains subjects there or elfewhere as another writer has well observed on the contrary full liberty to carry what arms and ammunition they pleased for defense if they should need it and lastly the royal assurance of enjoying unmolested whatever they returned with in short this commission must easily be observed to have been penned how clearly soever pretended as if king james did neither know of sir walter raleghs intention for and at guiana though a little before he had the whole particulars thereof from raleghs own hand or that there were any spaniards planted there though he appears to have known that also from the spanish ambassador himself whose own kinsman as we shall hear was sent during raleghs restraint from spain to build and colonize upon that very spot to which ralegh had now this unlimited commission as we may rather term it to go for it is so much the reverse of that close penned letter wherein ralegh had so expressively and so unreservedly placed his whole trust of this voyage in king james that it seems contrived both to hoodwink the spaniard till the action was over though the king betrayed it himself and to secure loopholes sufficient for the royal authority against his exceptions but they proved so large that it was thought expedient in the end as we shall find that the commission should not be insisted on to limit or restrain any body  whether this indistinct power in that commission made ralegh more or less importunate for his pardon we cannot say some indeed write that he labored mainly to obtain it but they are led into that belief by the declaration aforesaid whereas we find it expressly asserted in a letter of carew raleghs that his father had overtures made him of procuring his pardon for   00 l by sir william st john one of the persons of whom he purchased his freedom therefore one whose interest was the less to be doubted in this particular but that sir walter ralegh conferring a little before his departure from england with sir francis bacon newly made lord keeper of the great seal and not long after lord chancellor upon this pecuniary pardon he positively advised ralegh against it in these words sir the kneetimber of your voyage is money spare your purse in this particular for upon my life you have a sufficient pardon for all that is passed already the king having under his broad seal made you admiral of your fleet and given you power of the martial law over your officers and soldiers but we are elsewhere told that even for less than half that money beforementioned that is to say for  00 l the said sir william st john and also sir edward villiers before spoken of offered sir walter ralegh not only his full pardon but liberty not to go his voyage if he pleased and that he refused both the rather because he was told by sir francis bacon as above that his said commission was as good as a pardon for all former offenses as the law of england could afford him  and now near seven months after the date of his commission began his fleet to appear or rather that part of it which lay in the thames and consisted of seven sail from the survey which was taken thereof by the appointment of charles earl of nottingham the lord admiral on the   th of march in the year last named it appears that the first of them or admiral a brave ship as described by one who might probably have seen it and built by ralegh himself was named the destiny of   0 tons and    pieces or more of ordnance sir walter ralegh general and his son walter captain besides two hundred men whereof fourscore were gentlemenvolunteers and adventures most of them sir walters relations which number was afterward increased second the jason of london   0 tons and    pieces of ordnance captain john pennington vice admiral fourscore men one gentleman and no more third the encounter   0 tons    pieces of ordnance edward hastings captain no men more except the master mentioned but he dying in the indies was succeeeded in the command by capt whitney fourth the thunder   0 tons  0 pieces of ordnance sir warham sentleger captain six gentlemen sixty soldiers ten landmen fifth the flying joan   0 tons    pieces of ordnance john chidley captain twentyfive men sixth the southampton  0 tons six pieces of ordnance john bayley captain twentyfive mariners two gentlemen seventh the page a pinnace    tons three rabnets of brass james barker captain eight sailors but before ralegh left the coast of england he was joined by as many ships more so that his whole fleet consisted of thirteen sail besides his own ship and though we cannot be so particular in the remaining part we may yet learn thus much of it that one ship named the convertine was commanded by capt keymis another called the confidence was under the charge of capt woolaston there was a shallop named the flying heart under sir john fern two flyboats under capt sam king and capt robert smith and a carvel with perhaps another named the chudleigh besides  with the former part of the fleet ralegh set sail from the thames on the   th of march aforesaid which was in the year      and was soon after ready to proceed at the isle of wight when several little accidents fell out to retard his progress for he stayed there some days for sir warham sentleger whose ship the thunder by the negligence of her master was at lee in the thames also after ralegh was got to plymouth capt pennington was not come to the isle of wight and when he did arrive was forced to ride back to london to engage the lady ralegh to pass her word for the money which was to redeem the bread for his ship amounting to thirty pounds without which he could not have gone forward nor could sir john fern proceed till ralegh had supplied him with a hundred pounds by his cousin herbert and procured him another hundred pounds of his friend dr sutcliffe dean of exeter having furnished himself with a third hundred before he came from wales ralegh tarried also for capt whitney who had a third part of his victuals to provide and to assist him ralegh generously sold his plate at plymouth notwithstanding which and raleghs having given him more countenance than any other of his officers whitney ran away from him at the grenades and drew capt woolaston with his ship after him ralegh had further the patience to wait ten or twelve days for captain bayley which he afterward ungratefully requited by deserting also the fleet at the canaries for no apparent reason but raleghs refusing him a french shallop he took in the bay of portugal and yet after ralegh had bought her for fifty crowns that the french might have no cause of complaint bayley might have had her if he had desired it  for these reasons he was forced to linger some months at plymouth losing thereby a fair wind and indeed the season of the year the meanwhile he published in may following such orders throughout his fleet as gained him great applause for the regularity and instruction they established therein a gentleman of his company in a tract he wrote of this voyage having expressed how many ways sir walter ralegh was moved to enterprises of this nature more than any other englishman whatsoever by his wisdom and learning variety of conference and experience of places he had formerly held also how much greater his noble ends have been than any mans whatsoever of our nation who had attempted the like courses he proceeds to the particular government of his fleet which though others says he have in some measure observed yet in all the great volumes which have been written touching voyages there is no precedent of so godly severe and martial government fit to be engraved in every mans soul that covets to do honor to his king and country in the like attempts then exhibits a copy of the said laws articles and commandments which we at this present says he observe and of which it may not therefore be unacceptable hereunder to present the heads bearing this title orders to be observed by the commanders of the fleet and land companies under the charge and conduct of sir walter ralegh knight bound for the south parts of america or elsewhere given at plymouth in devon   may      they first enjoin that divine service should be read morning and evening or if interrupted by foul weather once a day that all swearing and blasphemy shall after admonition be fined that no man refuse obeying his officer in all things commanded for the benefit of the journey or refuse to wait his turn as directed the sailors by the master and boatswain the landmen by their captains lieutenants and others two captains of the watch in every ship to choose two soldiers every night to search between decks that no fire nor candlelight be carried about after the watch set nor burning in any cabin without a lanthorn tobacco forbidden all men but upon the upper deck landmen to learn the names and places of the ropes to assist the sailors upon deck sailors to be trained as they do landmen so that all may be esteemed sailors or soldiers as there is occasion not to chase or board any ship without order of the general to take nothing from any in league with his majesty but in extremity to agree for the price every night to fall astern the generals ship and follow his light and receive instructions of the course to be held every morning if separated by storms to open their sealed billets first on this side the north cape if needful secondly at the south cape third after    degrees and fourth from the height of cape de vert upon discovering any sail at sea either to windward or leeward of the admiral which he cannot discern if she be large and single to strike main topsail and hoise it again so often as they judge it to be  00 tons brthen as if  00 to strike and hoise twice etc upon discovering a small ship to do the like with foretopsail but if many great ships appear both to strike the maintop sail often and hang out the ensign in the maintop if they go large before wind to stand as they do till it may be judged the admiral had seen the said signs and standing but if you went large at the discovery to hale the sheets after a while then go large again so if they have their tacks aboard and you yours aboard at the discovery bear up a little and hale your sheet off again to show us what course they hold if you discover a sail by night to windward of you and you windward of the admiral bear up to acquaint us if you think you might speak with her keep aloof and fire a piece to give us knowledge none to fire any ordnance but in discovering a sail by night in danger of enemies fire or sinking if you fire by day we shall know it is to make a ship strike if by night we shall know you see more sail than your own if you think we hear not in a quarter of an hour fire again if you are in present danger by a leak shoot two pieces soon after one another if by fire three in like manner in foul weather every ship to fit her sails to keep company with the rest and not to run so far ahead by day but it may fall astern the admiral at night if attacked by sea the captain to appoint sufficient assistance to the gunner and if needful the cabbins between decks to be taken down all beds and sacks employed for bulwarks musketeers of every ship to be divided under captains for the forecastle the wast and the poop gunners not to shoot great ordnance at other distance than point blank officers to see no loose powder be carried between decks near linstock or match in hand hogsheads sawed in two filled with water ready on the decks and wet blankets against fire carpenters to be divided in the hold and between decks with leaden plates plugs etc at hand proper number of sailors to be appointed to every sail under proper commanders so that all knowing their charge and places may do their duty without confusion or noise none being to speak but the officers no man to board a ship of the enemy without order every ship under lee of the enemy must labor to recover the wind if the admiral endeavor it or if the enemy be to leeward the whole fleet to follow the admiral or other leading ship within musketshot of the enemy giving so much liberty to the leading ship after her broadside delivered and her sail trimmed then the second ship to give her side so the third and fourth all taking as the first and giving the enemy the other side shall keep him under a perpetual volley and thus to the windermost ship of the enemy till it be battered to pieces or forced up to entangle the rest if the admiral chase and is headmost the next ship to take up his boat unless otherwise ordered the like to be done by those that follow other chasing ships the divided musketeers not to deliver their shot but at such distances as their commander directs ships to be kept clean between decks ordnance not cloyed with trunks and chests provision to be delivered to the steward apparel to be in cloakbags except some few chests that will not pester the ships firearms to be kept clean if out of order the officer to order the armorer to amend them no feasting or drinking between meals or drinking healths on the ships provision every captain by his purser or other officer to take weekly accounts of the victuals no candles to be delivered by the steward to any private man or private use whoever steals apparel victuals etc to be punished as a thief and a murderer no man to strike any officer on pain of death private men striking one another to be punished by court martial players at cards or dice for apparel arms etc to be disarmed and made swabbers cowards upon any landing or otherwise to be disarmed and made laborers to carry victuals for the rest none to land in foreign parts without order from some chief commander and where they land none to force either christian or heathen woman on pain of death when landed in the indies not to eat fruits unknown and such not eaten by birds on the tree or beasts under it not to sleep on the ground or eat new flesh till salted two or three hours to swim in no rivers but where the indians do and to use them with courtesy other orders on the land to be established by general consent when they should arrive there a flag on the mizen shrouds of the admiral was to be the signal for summoning the officers to council see a tract called news of sir walter ralegh etc   to      from page    to      it was the end of june or the beginning of july before all his company joined him and he sailed from plymouth then being encountered with a violent storm foam eight leagues to the west of scilly in which capt chidleys pinnace was sunk and capt king driven into bristol ralegh held it from experience as well as reason the office of a commander of many ships and those of different sailings and conditions rather to take a port and keep his fleet together than to endanger the loss of his masts and rigging or the advantage which enemies might take or the loss of more time in attending another rendezvous by the danger of a separation therefore he put into ireland and was obliged to stay seven weeks there so that the winds only were to be accused now as he observes for their delay and here though by his credit he procured fifty oxen which he distributed among his fleet some of the crew spared not at his return to defame him with having taken care to revictual himself and none of the rest on the   th of august he set forward from cork  when he arrived at the isle of lancerota on the  th of september ralegh sent a request to the governor that he might be admitted to treat for some provisions the governor sent back word that he would confer with ralegh himself if he would come attended but by one gentleman and armed only with their rapiers ralegh taking with him lieutenant bradshaw met the governor who agreed that if he would send up an english factor whose ship then rode in the road whatever the island afforded should be delivered at a reasonable rate ralegh sent the factor but the governor procrastinated and at last sent word that unless he would embark his men which lay on the sea shore the islanders were so jealous they durst not divide from one another to supply him ralegh complied but when half his men were got aboard the islanders began to offer violence upon the rest they slew one and sent the factor to tell ralegh they would part with nothing to him for that they believed his company to be the turkish fleet which had lately destroyed puerto sancto the english hereupon would have gone and helped themselves but ralegh considering what displeasure it might give at home how the merchants might suffer and the poor english factor be ruined complained to the governor of the grand canaries of whom he also desired leave to take water undisturbed but instead of answer when he landed some hundred men in the desert part of the island where they found fresh water there ambush was laid by which one of his men was wounded to death and more had been slain had not captain thornhust and lieutenant hayman two valiant gentlemen seconded by sir warham sentleger and young captain ralegh with half a dozen more made forty of them run away from this unavoidable fray bayley found pretense to turn tail and go home again  in want of water they sailed to gomera one of the strongest and best defended of all these islands and the best port the spaniards being seated upon the very wash of the sea roughly saluted the fleet at its first entrance with their cannon and the english returned their salutation but as soon as ralegh recovered the harbor and commanded there should be no more firing he sent a spaniard he had with him ashore to assure the governor he had no intention to make war with any of the spanish kings subjects and if any harm had been done by his great ordnance to the town it was their fault who by shooting first gave the occasion the governor answered he thought they had been the turkish fleet aforesaid but having been certified they were christians and englishmen and sought nothing but water he was willing to let them take what they pleased if he might be assured they would make no attempt upon the town houses or their gardens and fruits ralegh replied that he would give him his faith and the word of the king of great britain his sovereign that if the people of the town or island should lose so much as an orange or a grape by any of his men without paying for it he would hang him up in the marketplace and ralegh kept his men in such good discipline that the governor in diverse letters for he wrote to him every day acknowledged how punctually ralegh kept his faith with him in regard to the inoffensive behavior of his company and also how much himself was beholden to him for his particular civilities for his countess who was of english extract being a stafford by the mothers side and of the house of horn by the father having sent ralegh some presents of fruit sugar and rusk he returned others of greater value though the presents ralegh returned to this governors lady are not mentioned in his apology whence his progress hitherto is chiefly extracted i find in his own journal aforesaid of this voyage that they consisted of an extract of amber ambergreese a fine cutwork ruff a very excellent picture of mary magdalen and a good quantity of rose water which was of great value and esteem in these parts the earl moreover gave him at his departure on the   st of september a letter to don diego sarmiento the spanish ambassador in england testifying how honorably ralegh had comported himself to the moriscos in these canary islands during the fourteeen days that he was among them before he set sail he discharged a bark of the grand canaries taken by one of his pinnaces coming from cape blanc in africa who complaining that his men had eaten of their fish to the value of six ducats ralegh gave them eight  after having weathered through a violent hurricane and some vast showers of rain besides dangers no less fearful within sickness now beginning to visit his ship he arrived on the  d of october at the isle of bravo and here underwent great hazards and hardships beside the sickness daily spreading among his men for whereas all those who navigated even between cape de vert and america were wont to pass between fifteen and twenty days at most he found the wind so contrary to him and indeed to nature so many storms and showers that he spent near six weeks in the passage from hence by reason whereof and the burning heat of the climate he was in great distress for water here losing anchors cables and watercask besides two more of his company he was driven after two days by a kind of turnado from this island which as well as the others he touched at before mentioned he has well described in his journal of this unfortunate voyage after his return home detraction did not spare to give out that he went to cape de vert knowing it to be infected and thereby loft many of his men whereas he was   0 leagues from that cape according to his own account in his apology and had threescore men ill in his own ship before he came to bravo as we find it in his journal though if he had gone to that cape now after the rains which had fallen there had been little danger of any such infection all places that lie near great rivers in low and moorish grounds do indeed as he rightly observes subject their inhabitants to fevers and agues as even along both sides of our own river thames and other infection is not found either in the indies or in africa except when the easterly wind or breezes are excluded and kept off by some high mountains from the valleys whereby the air wanting motion stagnates and becomes exceedingly unhealthful as at nombre de dios and some other places but says he as good success admits of no examination so the contrary allows of no excuse  hence they proceeded on the  th of october toward guiana but the sickness revisited and destroyed many of those whom the storms spared carrying off numbers of his ablest men both for sea and land no less than fortytwo of his own ship ending their voyage with their lives mostly in this month at least before they reached the coast about the   th of the same month when their sickness began to be at the height and they at the greatest distance from any shore they were many other ways also distressed for when they began to be in scarcity of water they were also becalmed yet ever threatened with extremity of tempestuous weather from the strange and unusual alterations in the atmosphere one while the horizon muffled as it were in such thick and fearful darkness that they were forced to steer a day or two by candlelight at other times arched and overshot with gloomy discolorations so that watery rainbows were continually invading their eyes or heavy showers their bodies and dead calms retarding their ships afterward at trinidad ralegh observed besides two watergalls no less than fifteen rainbows in one day and one of them bent as it were both ends together making a perfect circle and these were ever followed with wet weather for as he also noted especially of the morning rainbow it did not here produce a fair day as in england but one good effect ensued that when their water was so scarce near the latter end of this month that the ships crew was reduced to half allowance they saved some hogheads which fell from the clouds and all quenched their thirst with great cans of this bitter draught as ralegh describes that rain water to have been on the last day of this month as he was raised abruptly out of his bed in a sweat by the noise which a sudden great gust had occasioned in his ship he got a cold which turned to a burning fever and cast him down for twenty days together in which time he received no other sustenance than a few stewed prunes but drink every hour both day and night and sweated so excessively that he was forced to shift three times every day and as often at night at last the violence of his disease was abated by the oranges and other fruits he had received at gomera of the governors lady which he had carefully preserved in sand to his great refreshment and without which as he owns himself he could not have lived but it was double the time before he could recover in any tolerable degree from this sharp visitation  in this slow and sickly manner they arrived at last on the   th of november at the north cape of wiapoco and here ralegh sent for his old servant leonard the indian who had been in england three or four years with him but he was removed so far up in the country there was no pursuing him therefore he stood away for caliana which is in   degrees on the coasts of guiana at the first discovery called port howard where the cassique was also his servant and had lived with him in the tower of london two years there he arrived in a day or two having passed the island noted for its multitude of birds and silkbearing trees and from thence sent for his servant harry the indian who with other cassiques came and brought him great store of cassavi bread and roasted mullets with plantanes pinas pistacias etc but ralegh ventured not to eat of the pinas which tempted him exceedingly till after a day or twos airing on the shore in a tent which was there pitched for him then he also eat some armadillo and a little pork and began to gather strength here also he landed his sick men and recovered many and here he buried captain edward hastings the lord huntingtons brother who died ten days or more before and with him his sergeant major heart and captain henry snedale the charge of whose ship ralegh gave to his servant captain robert smith of cornwall here he also set up his barges and shallops which they brought from england in quarters cleansed his ships trimmed up his casks and supplied them with water fixed up a forge and made such iron works as they wanted thus on that shore and this river they employed and refreshed themselves for about three weeks during which time ralegh was very much caressed by the indians of his old acquaintance aforesaid and the other natives of this place who cherished him daily with the best provisions that the country yielded and offered him all kind of obedience even to the making him their sovereign prince and ruler if he would abide and settle among them so fresh continued his memory and such unanimous impressions of homage and respect had his former behavior still left upon them which offer he mentions with the greatest modesty and indifference in the dispatch he now sent to england for in this interval captain peter alley one of his company who was much troubled with a vertiginous disorder in his head having got leave to return home and the opportunity of a dutch vessel which lay there ralegh among other letters sent one by him to his lady dated from caliana the   th of november herein says he i cannot write to you but with a weak hand for i have suffered the most violent calenture for fifteen days that ever man did and lived but god that gave me a strong heart in all my adversities has also now strengthened me in the hellfire of heat we had two most grievous sicknesses in our ship of which fortytwo have died and there are yet many sick but having recovered the land of guiana this    th of november i hope we shall recover them we are yet two hundred men and the rest of our fleet are reasonably strong strong enough i hope to perform what we have undertaken if the diligent care at london to make our strength known to the spanish king by his ambassador has not taught the spanish king to fortify all the entrances against us howsoever we must make the adventure and if we perish it shall be no honor for england nor gain for his majesty to lose among many others an hundred as valiant gentlemen as england has in it then having spoken of bayleys running away from him the unnatural weather they had labored through and their tedious passage with the present of fruits which had so much relieved him as is before observed besides the death of some principal officers and recommendation of himself to some friends in london especially his son carew he concludes thus to tell you that i might be here king of the indians were a vanity but my name has still lived among them here they feed me with fresh meat and all that the country yields all offer to obey me at this time also a gentleman of his company having drawn up a discourse in praise of guiana and in honor of this adventure especially of the principal discoverer ralegh himself it being dated from caliana november the   th sent it also into england by the same bearer and it was printed the following year  on the  th of december they left this river and came next day to the triangle islands but were all in danger of leaving their bones upon the sholes before they got thither for they were laid aground especially raleghs larger ship for the space of twentyfour hours or more and had it not been fair weather would never have got off the coast having not above two fathom of water here after a few days when all the fleet was gathered together it being considered in a general consultation that rolegh himself who had grappled with the sickness for six weeks and was now rather so much relapsed than recovered that he could not move otherwise than as he was carried in a chair they resolved that there was no thoughts of his undertaking the passage up the orenoque in person and further though they could never understand by keymis who was the first of any nation that had entered the main mouth of that river nor by any of their mariners who had traded there many years for tobacco what certainty the water was of yet having found by experience that ships at eleven foot water lay aground three days in passing up therefore there was no attempting it with raleghs ship which being heavier and charged with near forty pieces of ordnance drew seventeen foot nor would his son with the rest have ventured with the provisions they had through any other persons assurance or resolution of staying to relieve them at a place appointed against the forces expected to approach but that of his father and their general so it was resolved by all that the five larger ships should ride at punta de gallo in trinidad under ralegh to secure their retreat and the five lesser for this was now the whole number of his fleet with five or six foot companies of fifty men each should enter the river according to this determination the fleet was here divided that is to say captain whitney in the encounter woolaston in the confidence king in the supply smith in a pink and hall in a carvel the companies had for their leaders captain charles parker and captain north brothers to the lord mounteagle and the lord north young ralegh captain thornhurst of kent captain penningtons lieutenant who seems to be another hall and captain chidleys lieutenant prideux sir warham st ledger raleghs lieutenant who had the charge of these companies fell sick at caliana so it was conferred on george ralegh sir walters nephew who had served with great commendation in the low countries and captain keymis had the chief charge for their guidance and landing within the river but keymis having laid down the plan of his intended attempt upon the mine and undertaken to discover it with six or eight persons in sir john fernes shallop ralegh upon consideration disliking that method of procedure determined to alter it and therefore gave him his instructions in the following words  keymis whereas you were resolved after your arrival into the oronoque to pass to the mine with my cousin herbert and six musketeers and to that end desired to have sir john fernes shallop i do not allow of that course because you cannot land so secretly but that some indians on the river side may discover you who giving knowledge thereof to the spaniard you may be cut off before you recover your boat i therefore advise you to suffer the captains and companies of the english to pass up westward of the mountain aio from whence you have no less than three miles to the mine and to encamp between the spanish town and you if there is any town near it that being so secured you may make trial what depth and breadth the mine holds and whether or no it will answer our hopes and if you find it royal and the spaniards begin to war upon you then let the serjeantmajor repel them if it is in his power and drive them as far as he can but if you find the mine is not so rich as to persuade the holding of it and it requires a second supply then shall you bring but a basket or two to satisfy his majesty that my design was not imaginary but true though not answerable to his majestys expectation for the quantity of which i never gave assurance nor could on the other side if you shall find any great number of soldiers are newly sent into the orenoque as the cassique of caliana told us there were and that the passages are already enforced so as without manifest peril of my son yourself and the other captains you cannot pass toward the mine then be well advised how you land for i know that a few gentlemen excepted what a scum of men you have and i would not for all the world receive a blow from the spaniard to the dishonor of the nation i myself for my weakness cannot be present neither will the company land except i abide by the ships the galleons of spain being daily expected piggot the sergeant major is dead sir warham st ledger my lieutenant without hope of life and my nephew george ralegh your serjeantmajor now but a young man it is therefore on your judgment that i rely who i trust god will direct for the best let me hear from you as soon as you can you shall find me at punta de gallo dead or alive and if you find not my ships there yet there you shall find their ashes for i will fire with the galleons if it come to extremity but run away i will never  with these instructions those five ships set forward parting from ralegh and the rest of the fleet at the islands aforesaid with a months provision on the  0th of december but when they found a new spanish town called st thome consisting of about   0 houses though lightly built with a chapel a convent of franciscans and a garrison erected on the main channel of the orenoque about twenty miles distant from the place where antonio berreo the governor taken by ralegh in his first discovery and conquest here attempted to plant keymis and the rest thought themselves obliged through fear of leaving the enemys garrison between them and their boats to deviate from their instructions which enjoined them first to carry a little party to make trial of the mine under a shelter of their own camp and then to deal with the spanish town as it should give cause by permitting or offering to prevent them so they concluded to land in one body and encamp between the mine and the town whereby though themselves were something stronger their boats were subject to the same exposure and the mine left untried contrary to raleghs order for about three weeks after their departure landing by night it seems nearer the town than they suspected and meaning to rest themselves on the riverside till morning they were in the nightime set upon by the spanish troops apprizd of and forearmd for their coming as we shall see this charge was so unexpected and struck the common soldiers with such amazement and confusion that had not the captains and some other valiant gentlemen made head and animated the rest they had all been cut to pieces but the rest by their example soon rallying made such a vigorous defense against the spaniards that they drove them to a retreat till in the warmth of their pursuit the english found themselves at the spanish town before they knew where they were here the battle was renewed afresh upon them being assaulted by the governor himself don diego palameca and four or five captains at the head of their companies against whom captain walter ralegh a brave and sprightly young man now twentythree years of age but fonder of glory than safety not tarrying for the musketeers rushed foremost at the head of a company of pikes and having killed one of the spanish captains was himself shot by another but pressing still forward with his sword upon erinetta probably the captain who had shot him this spaniard with the buttend of his musket felled him to the ground and after these words it is said in king jamess declaration p    that young ralegh likeliest to know his fathers secret when he led his soldiers upon this town used these or the like words come on my hearts here is the mine that we must expect they that look for any other mine are fools as if ralegh was at so much toil hazard and expense only to break the peace and drive a pack of poor spaniards out of a worthless town nor does it seem likely that if young ralegh knew this to be his fathers secret that he would thus disclose it but rather if he did utter such an expression that he suddenly invented it to give his men hopes of booty knowing that would best excite them to bravery lord have mercy upon me and prosper your enterprise young ralegh spoke no more hereupon john plessington his sergeant thrust the said spanish captain through the body with his halbert two commanders more of the spaniards were at the same time slain one by john of morocco another of young raleghs company and lastly the governor himself also lost his life in the said engagement which happened as camden reckons the second of january  the leaders being thus all dispatched and many of their soldiers the rest fled and were dispersed some to shelter about the market place from whence they killed and wounded the english at pleasure so as they saw no way left to be safe but by firing the town about their ears and driving them to the woods and mountains whence they still kept the english waking with perpetual alarms others were more careful to defend the passages to their mines of which they had three or four not far distant than they had been to defend the town itself but for the magazine of tobacco which one writer among other erroneous representations of this voyage thought might countervail the charge of it could it with some other things have been preserved it seems not to have been consumed by the english because ralegh had enough thereof soon after to have paid for the victualling of his fleet if there had been occasion as himself has related  all obstructions seeming thus removed capt keymis had now a fair opportunity to make what trial he pleased at the mine and that he did attempt the discovery will appear by the consequence as his preparations do in the letter he wrote to ralegh six days after the action aforesaid though it came not long after to his hands herein having opened in as gradual and discreet a manner as he could how gallantly his son fell in this exploit and observed that if his extraordinary valor and vigor of mind had not led them all on it had never been attempted nor performed as it was to his surviving honor having also observed that four of the best houses in town belonged to refiners though he had seen no coin or bullion but only a little plate he adds now i propose god willing to visit the mine not eight miles from the town sooner i could not go by reason of the murmurings the discords and vexations wherewith the serjeantmajor is perpetually tormented concluding with these words i have sent your lordship a parcel of scattered papers and reserve a cartload one roll of tobacco one tortoise with some oranges and lemons praying god to give you strength and health of body and a mind armed against all extremities i rest ever to be commanded this  th of january      your lordships keymis  indeed ralegh had need of those prayers on his own part at this time not only in his sickness but even in the intervals he had of recovery for here to give some account of him in this time of separation we may observe that he lay with the five larger ships under himself capt john pennington his vice admiral one of the most sufficient gentlemen for the sea that england has says he sir warham st ledger another valiant and worthy gentleman sir john fern and captain chidley of devon mostly at punta de gallo and other ports about trinidad no less than a hundred and fifty miles from the rest of his fleet making the adventure up the oronoque yet in daily apprehensions of meeting with the spanish armada sent purposely to lay wait for and destroy him which it would probably have done after the great sickness which had so much weakened his men and under this disadvantageous division of his ships but that the enemy luckily waited for him in a wrong place besides it having been falsely rumored in his fleet that he brought out of england twentytwo thousand broadpieces of gold with him some of his crew traitorously conspired to sail away while he was gone ashore in his barge to take views and make discoveries of the country which he was sometimes wont to do as at terra de brea or the pitchland as he calls it from the bitumenous substance which so remarkably issues there as he has well described and when he traversed some woods to seek the trees that yield that precious balsam whereof he got a small quantity which smelt like angelica so to have left him a prey to famine wild beasts or the no less unmerciful spaniards by whom he might have been flayed alive as other englishmen who came but to traffic had formerly been add to this the many provocations he received from the spaniards who were in any of the ports where his men landed only to exchange a few commodities for tobacco or other products of the country not only by the most opprobrious language but discharging sometimes a volley of twenty muskets at a time upon them whereby sir john fern had some of his men killed and lastly the uneasiness he was continually in that he could hear no tidings of the rest of his fleet thus detached upon the adventure and though some indian spies were brought to him in the beginning of february by one of whom who could speak the spanish tongue he was first informed that the english in orenoque were reported by some tivitivas he had spoken with to have taken st thome and slain diego de palameca the governor with captain erinetta and captain john rues that the rest fied and that two english captains were likewise killed though the same was soon after also asserted with other particulars by another indian yet ralegh would not set them down till he knew the truth which afterward endeavoring to compass of other indians said to have been at the taking of that town whom he sent in pursuit of they escaped and he was not certified in the report even near the middle of this month for so far his own journal extends  in the mean while keymis made an attempt for the mine and had set forward with captain thornhurst mr w herbert sir john hamden and others but at their first approach near the bank where they intended to land he received from an ambuscade of spaniards in the woods who had probably gathered there with expectation of his coming that way to the mine a volley of shot which slew two of his company hurt six others and wounded captain thornhurst so dangerously in the head that he languishd thereof three months after this blow first staggered the resolution of keymis who then as he reflected more upon the state of their condition was more overpowered with doubts and discouragements insomuch that though the english under him might have been informed of two or three mines more beside this which keymis had undertaken to lead them to by a mulatto who had waited on the late governor in his chamber and as he has written in his letter beforementioned knew all things that concerned his master this servant afterward by no other means than courteous usage discovered the same to ralegh himself and not only the places where those mines lay but more particularly that two of them gold ones were in the possession of don pedro rodrigo de parama and hermian frontino and a silver one in the possession of francisco fasardo and that the cause of their remaining unwrought was that they wanted negroes to work them for by a law of charles the emperor the indians could not be constrained and the spaniards neither would nor could endure the labor yet did the english now decline all endeavor either to be directed to these though but few miles distant from the town or proceed to possess that which keymis was to conduct them to though within a few hours march nay when the ships were upon their return and they had sailed down the river as far as the country of carapana one of the natural lords who had reserved that part of guiana to the late queen and having heard that the english had abandoned st thome and left no forces as he hoped they would have done had sent a great canoe laden with store of fruits and provisions to the captains also by one of his men who had learned the spanish tongue during his long slavery under the spaniards had offered them a rich gold mine in his own country to engage their stay further proffering to leave sufficient pledge for any english person they should send to examine it and when captain leak with another of the company named molineux offered themselves to go the greater part nevertheless refused to suffer them this declension of his offer so heightened carapanas desire to make it acceptable that he sent again leaving one of his men still aboard who entreated to detain them but two days and carapana would himself aged as he was bring them a sample of the ore who though still rejected and the ships under sail yet sent once more a boat after them up to the mouth of the river in hopes to the very last of retrieving them as the said captain leak parker molineux and half a dozen officers more are by ralegh nominated to attest but the adventurers among other dissuasives from all temptation to continue there any longer harbored a notion that the spaniards had secretly agreed with and employed those indians only to trepan the english which appeared but a weak and illgrounded apprehension to ralegh for such treachery might have been easily prevented had they waited the arrival of the old indian chief who would have brought the ore to their very ships and what advantage in betraying them says he could there be when the guianians offered to leave hostages six for one moreover one of the indians whom the english found in fetters when they took st thome and brought with them aboard could have told them that the very cassique who sent to show them the gold mine in his country was unconquered and at enmity with the spaniard and could have assured them withal that such mines were in that country possessed by the said cassique but no entreaty or invitation would retain them and so they returned about the middle of february to punta de gallo after the fleet had been thus divided and they absent above two months from sir walter ralegh as himself has informed us whereby it appears that the fleet united at or very soon after the time he discontinued his journal and it appears no where in that journal that any inhuman offer was made to remove from punta de gallo to the charibees many leagues off where he knew famine must overtake the land soldiers before they could overtake him as his enemies suggested besides he cleared himself in such a solemn manner of this aspersion at his death as leaves not the least stain of cruelty any where but upon their characters who slandered him with it  it is possible that keymis might at his first return be favorably received and ss familiarly admitted to raleghs table as before for a disappointment of this consequence was not to be too readily broached on one side nor reprehended on the other besides as some mitigation of their ill success and inducement to further hopes keymis produced two ingots of gold which had been reserved at st thome as the king of spains quota or proportion together with several other valuable spoils of the governor keymis also brought with him a large quantity of papers letters memorials schemes plans and maps found in the said governors study which gave some singular lights into the state and condition of spain with respect to many of the american plantations among these papers were found four letters which plainly discovered not only raleghs whole enterprise to have been betrayed but his life thereby put into the power of the spaniards themselves the king of spains first letter sent to guiana by a bark of aviso to arm the indians against raleghs coming was dated    march      at madrid which letter says ralegh in his to sir ralph winwood i have here enclosed sent you the rest i reserve not knowing whether they may be intercepted or not the second of that kings was dated  d of may      sent also by a caravel to diego de palameca governpr of guiana el dorado and trinidad the third of his majestys was sent by the bishop of puerto rico and delivered to ihat governor the   th of july following and the fourth was sent from the farmer and secretary of his customs in the indies at the same time thus raleghs letter to winwood from st christophers in his remains last edition p     compared with some manuscript copies of it in the harleyan library etc others tell us these advertisements and preparations were the cause of all the resistance that was made at st thome that raleghs whole design under his own hand was delivered by king james to gondomar and that his own letter thereof to king james was found in the governor of st thomes closet which letter he brought back and showed to the lords of the council see observations on sanderson s history p    thus also in the statetrials vol i p     and in dr welwoods memoirs it is said raleghs plan which king james promised to keep secret was sent by gondomar to spain and thence to the indies before ralegh left the thames and the very original paper was found in the spanish governors closet and by whom even to the breaking of that peace if any was broken for which he was afterward exclaimed against ralegh himself has related though ralegh his charged this matter of betraying him to the spaniards in plain terms both in his letter to the secretary of state which follows as above and in his apology one or both of which king james had certainly read it is yet observable that this topic is not so much as touched upon in his majestys declaration but entirely sunk in silence for he thought this such black and cruel usage that he forbore not in a letter which he wrote about a month after this time from the isle of st christophers to sir ralph winwood the secretary of state to show his sense of it in these words it pleased his majesty to value us at so little as to command me upon my allegiance to set down under my hand the country and the very river by which i was to enter it to set down the number of my men and burden of my ships and what ordnance every ship carried which being made known to the spanish ambassador and by him sent to the king of spain a dispatch was made and letters sent from madrid before my departure out of the thames by the contents of those spanish letters it further appears that three hundred spanish soldiers and ten pieces of ordnance were commissioned to be sent from their respective garrisons against the adventurers up the orenoque that is a hundred and fifty men from nuevo reyno de granada under the command of captain antonio musica and another hundred and fifty from puerto rico to be conducted under francisco zanchio there was also prepared an armada by sea to set upon ralegh himself and the ships with him by which says he we had not only been torn to pieces but all those in the river had also perished they being of no force for the sea fight for we had resolved to have burnt by their sides and to have died there had the armada arrived but belike they stayed for us at margarita by which they knew we must pass toward the indies in another letter which he wrote the next day from the same island to his wife ralegh says never was poor man exposed to slaughter as i was then having related the particulars of the forces beforementioned sent to destroy him through the communication of his scheme to the court of spain by the spanish ambassador he concludes this part with these words it were too long to tell you how we were preserved if i live i shall make it known  but the indignation which ralegh must have conceived at the sight of these letters was not a little heightened when he came to hear that keymis had made no actual trial at the mine and the reasons he gave for having relinquished it he alleged indeed that after the salley of the spaniards upon them from the woody banks which had disabled several of his men at their first attempt to land he began to consider they had not then able men enough left to work the mine though indeed it lay not so deep as to need all those pioneers and implements which in king jamess declaration ralegh is objected against for not carrying with him as may appear by the first discovery of this mine in the former part of these sheets keymis also argued they had not men enough to keep this mine though they should escape further danger in the difficult passage to it which he feared much they should not the spaniards being more careful to preserve it as was said than the town and the ways to it aspera y fragosa as ralegh has observed agreeable to that infirtility and unaptness for cultivation which acosta and other naturalists have described in those grounds which are impregnate with such treasures keymis urged further that they wanted sufficient provisions for the number remaining having been much longer up the river than they expected and that they could not carry enough from the town up the mountain their company being divided the greater part in the town itself and those too weak to defend it that he further found all regard to order and obedience broke through as soon as capt ralegh was dead and feared the fatal news of his death would either not find his sick father alive or hasten his end that to attempt the discovery and fail through any of these discouragements he thought would be more detrimental than wholly at this time to decline it that to discover it for a pack of profligates and mutineers was more than they deserved and to discover it for ralegh himself not likely to live and unpardoned was as whispered in the company for a man non ens in the law above all that it would therefore be a greater error to find it for the spaniards than to pretend it could nowhere be found lastly that these arguments approved of by the majority were confirmed by the alarm they received at the discovery of the letters aforesaid in the governors closet whereby they were led every moment to expect a fresh enforcement of the enemy against them from each end of the river therefore separate as the fleet was and not able to make resistance they all agreed to return  however specious these arguments or some of them might be raleigh was in no wise pacified with them he utterly disavowed the whole conduct of keymis before several of his company and the ignorance he had pretended to them told him that a blind man might have found the place by the marks and directions himself had set down under his own hand and that his care of losing more men in passing the woods was but feigned for after his sons death it was known he had no care for any man surviving and therefore had he brought home but one hundred weight of ore though with the loss of as many men it would have given the king satisfaction preserved his reputation and encouraged a return the next year with greater force to have held the country for his majesty to whom it belonged for the riches and fruitfulness whereof himself had formerly so largely attested but since he had suffered his wilfulness in spite of his knowledge to defeat their whole undertaking he should indeed be glad if keymis could make those reasons for not opening the mine passable with the state but that he himself could not justify the neglect keymis grew deeply discontented hereat and continued so several days afterward he came to me in my cabin says ralegh and showed me a letter he had written to the earl of arundel excusing himself for not discovering of the mine using the same arguments and many others which he had done before and prayed me to allow thereof but ralegh no way satisfied declared that as keymis could plead no ignorance he could admit of no excuse being wounded in his credit with the king past all recovery and that this could admit of no reparation keymis seeing ralegh resolved not to favor his folly retired as one knowing not what course to take yet expressing perhaps also some design of giving further satisfaction and went out of my cabin into his own says ralegh where having shut himself in ralegh soon after heard a pistol go off and sending up to know who discharged it keymis made answer he fired it himself because it had been long charged about half an hour after his boy going into his cabin found him dead with much blood by him having a long knife thrust through his left pap into his heart and his pistol lying by him with which it appeared that he had shot himself but the bullet being small and having only cracked a rib he dispatched effectually with the knife the letters in the remains aforesaid p         and the apology p    james howel says that captain keymis the main instrument for the discovery of the mine pistold himself in a desperate mood of discontent in his cabin in the convertine which not being raleghs ship would remove keymiss death still further from all surmise that he had any such foul play done him to prevent telling of tales as sanderson and other prejudiced writers have maliciously insinuated the observator on his history of king james calls it a bse aspersion and sanderson in his answer instead of producing any authority in his own justification is for meddling no further with it so refers to his history as a matter too large to be inserted again but what entirely clears the affair is king jamess declaration for had there been the least shadow of suspicion that ralegh had been any way concerned in keymiss unfimely end we may be well persuaded that declaration would not have been silent thereof which has amassed and aggravated so many frivolous circumstances in this voyage against him and this as i compute happened about the latter end of february aforesaid or perhaps the former part of march because ralegh mentions it in the letters he wrote this month into england before referred to therefore the death of keymis could not happen in the following summer as one author mistakes and whereas some had given it out that keymis slew himself through remorse that he had seduced and deluded so many gentlemen with an imaginary mine ralegh will not allow that to have been the cause but ascribes it entirely to his own positive and passionate temper and says that he would not have laid violent hands on himself for any mans opinion nor when he did adds ralegh could he have said unto me that he was ignorant of the place and knew of no such mine for what cause had i then to have rejected his excuses or to have laid his obstinacy to his charge further urging that several captains whom ralegh names might be put to their oaths whether or no keymis did not confess to them coming down the river at a place where they cast anchor that he could from thence have gone to the mine in two hours  after this accident it was determined in a council of the officers to make for newfoundland to repair and refresh their ships but before as well as after they arrived there great disorders arose some took to courses of their own head and ran away from him as was beforementioned and many others proved so refractory and ungovernable that when he came to the isle of st christophers he was forced under the conduct of his cousin mr herbert to ship them home of whom though he had showed some uncommon generosity to some of them he says in the letter he wrote from thence to his wife on the   d of march i know then will not spare to wound me and further declares there is never a base slave in all the fleet that has taken the pains and care that i have done that has slept so little and traveled so much my friends will not believe them and for the rest i care not in another letter he sent from hence at the same time to sir ralph winwood he writes to the same sense and further adds but these being gone i shall says he be able if i live to keep the sea till the end of august with some four reasonable good ships for to that number was his fleet now reduced by the time here proposed of continuing at sea there might have now been thoughts of some course to qualify the misadventure of the mine and enable them to re attempt it perhaps by some little trading voyages but how probable that he should design any thing so far as the east indies or that with such small force he intended to go for the western islands to attack the mexico fleet and surprise the carracks as in the kings declaration is laid to raleghs charge we shall leave for others to decide it is plain that nothing of this was put in practice for when they came to newfoundland the company in his own ship mutinyd and those who were for staying aboard whom wilson calls the major part made ralegh says he take an oath not to go home but by their allowance but the declaration says that the greater number were for returning to england and that ralegh getting on the seabank put it to the question whereupon the voices divided starboard and larboard and that when he perceived the greater number voted for their return he went to that side and voted so too but manifestly to the hazard of his life was his voting on either side in the same declaration we are further led to believe he afterward offered his own ship which was of great value to his company if they would only set him aboard a french bark and that he made the same offer to some of his officers when he was come back to ireland as not knowing how things would be construed and being loath to put his head under the kings girdle but he did and we shall see the consequence of it  by the time that ralegh arrived on the coast of ireland the sacking of st thome the firing of the town and the slaughter of the spaniards to the number of four or five hundred men were largely descanted on by his enemies as by his friends were his own more particular misfortunes in the long and dangerous sickness he had endured his disappointment in the mine the consumption of so much treasure the loss of his gallant son the violent end of his old servant captain keymis and above all the general disorder defection and dispersion of his own fleet all together it became not so much a national as a universal topic of discourse and attention every one censuring or commiserating as their interest or affections moved it is remembered by camden that captain john north brother to the lord north a valiant gentleman and who was much esteemed by ralegh for his faithful conduct under him throughout this voyage was the first who related the deplorable news of this unfortunate expedition to king james on the   th of may      he seems to have done it in a very just and pathetical manner and it might have had a good effect had that kings pity been as easily touched as his fear among authors some who had been for registering this commission of king james with that granted by alphonso king of naples to bertram his captive moor whom he entrusted both with his liberty and a large sum of money to buy him some fine horses in barbary for which his jester gave him a prime place in his fools chronicle were now upon the expectation of a return ready with the same jester to blot out the king and enroll the captive for a fool but others looked upon this action of raleghs in a nobler and more elevated light and as what for the integrity of acquitting his fiduciary pledges was rather to be compared with the generous act of that brave roman consul attilius regulus who to keep his promise and his faith returned to his enemies the carthaginians under whom he had been a prisoner though he knew that he went to inevitable death  and now the spanish ambassador having by special advertisements gained the earliest intelligence of all that had passed at guiana and how among the rest his own kinsman the governor had been slain broke into the kings presence in a turbulent manner and bawling out for his majestys audience only of one word assaulted him with the abrupt and repeated exclamation of piratas piratas piratas at last he found breath and words to enlarge upon the matter so effectually as what tended not only to the infringement of his majestys promise but that happy union between the two crowns in their royal progeny now the match between prince charles and dona maria with all the advantages it was pregnant with was in such a hopeful degree of maturity even to the involving of both nations in the most durable and dreadful hostilities that the pacifick king of great britain was ready to do any thing in the world to appease him and hush it up to this purpose his royal proclamation was forthwith published on the   th of june setting forth that whereas we gave liberty to sir walter ralegh and others to undertake a voyage to guiana where they had pretended a probability of discovering gold mines etc we did by express limitation and caution restrain and forbid them from attempting any act of hostility upon any territories or subjects of foreign princes with whom we are in amity and more particularly those of our dear brother the king of spain in respect of his dominions in that continent which notwithstanding they have by hostile invasion of the town of st thome etc broken and infringed we have therefore held fit to make public declaration of our utter mislike and detestation of the said insolences and for the better detection and clearing up of the truth we charge all our subjects that have any understanding or notice thereof to repair to any of our privy council and make known their whole knowledge that we may thereupon proceed to the exemplary punishment and coercion of all such as are found guilty of so scandalous and enormous outrages  the next thing to be thought of was a proper and plausible instrument for the apprehension of sir walter ralegh when he should come ashore such a one was sir lewis stucley soon found to be and not sir john as one writer erroneously christens him who was vice admiral of devon not lieutenant of the tower as the same negligent author mistakes again one who though raleghs countryman and as all others but stucley say his kinsman too yet most officiously undertook that charge through the sordid prospect of profit so unnatural says wilson and servile is the spirit when it has an allay of baseness there being many others fitter for that employment however his orders were to bring up this great malefactor in a fair and courteous manner according to his majestys gracious and mild course as it is called in his declaration and though we are told by one otherwise misguided in his account of this expedition by some distorted representations of it in those times that the world much wondered so great a wise man as sir walter ralegh would return to cast himself upon so inevitable a rock as it was feared he would nevertheless as we are assured by captain samuel king an old officer of raleghs who bore him company all this while and has left us a particular narrative of whatsoever occurred in their journey from their landing now at plymouth to their final arrival at london that he no sooner put into the harbor and heard of the proclamation aforesaid against him than he resolved to surrender himself voluntarily into his majestys hands and to that intent both moored his ship and sent his sails ashore the first day he landed which i take to have been in the beginning of july and after he had been absent upon this voyage a full twelvemonth moreover though he soon met here with several discouraging reports also concerning the spanish ambassadors stay at london only for his coming up to prosecute him as my said manuscript author has it ralegh still continued firm in that resolution the said ambassador is in some common memoirs said to have been sent for over to spain at this time and in some again that his commission was expired but others think that impatience to deliver the success of his negotiations spurred him away according to instruction when he had got full assurance that ralegh should be dispatched at some rate or other whatever he could say for himself for he departed for spain three weeks before ralegh came to london having left the remainder of his business in the hands of some espaniolizd partisans at court whom he had made sure here since we are to take our leave of this don diego sarmiento the following remarks upon him may not be thought very digressory since they mostly tend to the further illustration of sir walter raleghs story his first coming into england is remembered by sir john finet in his observations touching foreign ambassadors to have been in      being aged then as i compute from a date upon one of his pictures    years some have intimated that the spanish ambassador could not with all his worrying and baiting of king james prevail so effectually for the destruction of sir walter ralegh how easy and tempting soever it might be to trample over the fence that is already broken down but that he was forced to belabour the point with spanish gold among those creatures who had the greatest influence at court for as one writes the bargain was made and ralegh was devoted for a sacrifice before they knew whether he was successful or not and if we may believe the accounts that are left upon record of that part of history the king of spain gave a good sum of money for his head some have gone so sar as to tell us who had the money at least a good part of it if this be true the english court had in it at that time some of the most infamous people that were ever concerned in any administration as to those who reprove the king himself with it i shall say no more than this they ought to have been very sure of the truth of it before they recorded a thing of a british king so much beneath the character of any monarch in the world viz to take money of an enemy for the blood of their own subjects and of such subjects too as were most dangerous to the very enemy they were sold to which is neither less nor more than selling their own safety as well as innocent blood see an historical account of the voyages and adventures of sir walter ralegh   vo      p    howeever it was the spanish ambassador seems to have left the english court well satisfied on the   th and embarked for spain on the  0th of july      having first emptied all the prisons in england of romish priests many of whom he carried with him home further to grace his triumphs but this ambassador returned to england in the beginning of march      under pretense of pursuing that delusive negotiation and was lodged not without murmurs at the bishop of elis house in holborne he was also trick d out with titular honors the usual reward of such services as his were being newly made conde de gondomar as sir john finet observes otherwise in the whole not so substantially rewarded at home as the slavish pains he took abroad to please his prince was thought to deserve as for the pernicious practices of this spanish ambassador in england which might gain him those airy gratuities they are unfolded in a tract entitled vox populi or news from spain translated according to the spanish copy which may serve to forewarn both england and the united provinces how far to trust to spanish pretenses  in tis treatise gondomar is represented in a spanish council lately held at aragon and delivering his chief services to have been  st his working a dislike between king james and his house of commons persuading him to to rule by his prerogative and as for money to furnish himself by the marriage with spain and by domestic projects without any subsidy also that he hereby kept england from furnishing its navy  dly his showing only a colorable resistance of our east india trade as being rather hurtful than helpful to the state by carrying out our solid treasures and bringing home spice silk feathers and toys besides wasting our mariners  dly his opposing our westindian voyages most strenuously as what would raise another england to withstand their new spain in america therefore that he crossed all the undertakings for virginia and the bermudas causing the recusonts who were sharers to withdraw their ventures and discourage the work  thly that by this means likewise he kept the voluntary forces from venice till it was almost too late to succor them  thly that he stickled hard for the cautionary towns which the late king philip called the keys of the low countries and  thly that the last and not the least service he did was in overthrowing sir walter raleghs voyage and pursuing him i need not say almost to death says he if all things hit right and all strings hold further that his commission would not let him tarry to be a specta or of his execution which i desired the rather says he that by concession i might have wrung from the inconsiderate english an acknowledgment of my masters right in those places punishing him for attempting there though they might prescribe for the first foot and this i did to stop their mouths hereafter and because i would quench the heat and valor of that nation that none should ever dare hereafter to undertake the like or be so hardy as to look out at sea or breathe upon our coast and lastly because i would bring to ignominious death that old pirate who is one of the last now living bred under that english virago and by her fleshed in our blood and ruin to do this i had many agents first diverse courtiers who were hungry and gaped wide for spanish gold secondly some who bare him at heart for inveterate quarrels thirdly some foreigners who having in vain sought the elizir heretofore hope to find it in his head fourthly all men of the komish faith who are of the spanish faction and would have been my blood hounds to hunt him or any such to death willingly and lastly i left behind me such an instrument composed artificially of a secular understanding and a religious profession as he is every way adapted to screw himself into the clset of the heart and to work upon feminine levity who in that country have masculine spirits to command and pursue their plots unto death how much soever this may be called a fictitious speech it is founded on such matters of fact that rushworth and others of our most serious historians have admitted the substance thereof as perfect history  in      about easter gondomar committed a gross solecism in politics by suffering his ungovernable passion so to expose his leiger honor by striking william lithgow the scotch traveller whom he had long deceived with promises of reparation for the imprisonment tortures and robberies committed on him by the inquisition at malaga as may be read in the book of his travels that the said ambassador got his ears soundly boxd by him before a numerous crowd of noble witnesses his fistula says lithgow meaning i think his cane though alluding to his disease was contrabanded by a fist and for victory favor lent me authority he was imprisoned for it nine weeks in the marshalsa whence i returned says he with more credit than he left england with honesty in june following as camden tells us gondomar was reported to be imprisoned in spain for so much promoting the match and that the infanta was to be married to the grand duke of tuscany   however before he left england an excellent letter seems to have been written by ralegh in his own defense and conveyed to the king which as we have it in print runs thus may it please your most excellent majesty if in my journey outward bound i had my men murdered at the islands and yet spared to take revenge if i did discharge some spanish barks taken without spoil if i did forbear all parts of the spanish indies wherein i might have taken twenty of their towns on the seacoasts and did only follow the enterprise i undertook for guiana where without any directions from me a spanish village was burnt which was new set up within three miles of the mine by your majestys favor i find no reason why the spanish ambassador should complain of me  if it were lawful for the spaniards to murder twentysix englishmen tying them back to back and then cutting their throats when they had traded with them a whole month and came to them on the land without so much as one sword and it may not be lawful for your majestys subjects being charged first by them to repel force by force we may justly say o miserable english  if parker and mecham took campeachy and other places in the honduras seated in the heart of the spanish indies burnt towns and killed the spaniards and had nothing said unto them at their return and myself who forbore to look into the indies because i would not offend must be accused i may as justly say o miserable ralegh  if i have spent my poor estate lost my son suffered by sickness and otherwise a world of hardships if i have resisted with manifest hazard of my life the robberies and spoils with which my companions would have made me rich if when i was poor i could have made myself rich if when i had gotten my liberty which all men and nature itself do much prize i voluntarily lost it if when i was sure of my life i rendered it again if i might elsewhere have sold my ship and goods and put five or six thousand pounds in my purse and yet brought her into england i beseech your majesty to believe that all this i have done because it should not be said they your majesty had given liberty and trust to a man whose end was but the recovery of his liberty and who had betrayed your majestys trust  my mutineers told me that if i returned for england i should be undone but i believed in your majestys goodness more than in all their arguments sure i am the first that being free and able to enrich myself yet has embraced poverty and peril and as sure i am that my example shall make me the last but your majestys wisdom and goodness i have made my judges who have ever been and shall ever be your majestys most humble vassal walter ralegh  when ralegh had settled his affairs in the west of england he began his journey to london pursuant to his first resolution but before he came to ashburton twenty miles from plymouth he was met by sir lewis stucley who said he had orders for arresting him and his ship ralegh answered he had saved him the labor and done it to his hands and though at that time stucley had no warrant as our ms author aforesd goes on for such arrest either from the king or the lords of the council for it seems that his haste was so great and his heart so set upon some supposed purchase that he could not stay for a warrant yet ralegh being told by him that he had such a verbal commission from the secretary did in no wife resist even that authority so they went back together to plymouth and lay at sir christopher harris his house where sir walter ralegh was so little watched that he was sometimes two or three days without seeing sir lewis stucley and ralegh himself says that stucley left him nine or ten days to go where he listed while he rode about the country however as we learn from captain king it did at last come into raleghs mind whether upon some private advices how insuperably the prejudice of his enemies was working against him or any suggestions of his own how he might work a reconciliation more successfully from abroad it is not said but contrive he did to convey himself out of the kingdom therefore while they were at plymouth he employed our author the said captain king to provide him a bark that would carry him over into france king jamess declaration says ralegh dealt with for a bark as for a friend and proffered twelve crowns for the passage stucley says he dealt with two captains of french barks the declaration says ralegh was then under no guard and stucley that he was then under his keeping but leaving these inconformities to others i here follow captain king who informs us that himself procured the vessel which is most likely and that he detained it nigh four days riding at anchor beyond command of the fort the first night about one of the clock they secretly took boat to have gone aboard but before they reached the bark ralegh whether through some more prevailing thought that might arise of a generous reliance upon the king or a more confident dependence upon the justice of his cause or for any thing he left behind or would have first left either in writing or otherwise does not yet appear but certain it is he changed his resolution and returned to his lodging unsuspected by any one the next day he sent money to the master of the bark to retain him one night more and yet ralegh never went nigh him afterward  it has been objected as captain king goes on who does not say by whom but i find it in the kings declaration that ralegh was obliged to return because the night was so dark that he could not find the vessel but i says the captain who was with him will take my oath that if he had been only willing to have rowed a quarter of a mile further he might have seen her besides if that night would not have served one of the other three would the wind being fair and the tide falling out conveniently  after this says captain king stucley received a warrant to bring up sir walter ralegh but with no more speed than his health would permit and he took to his assistance one manourie a french quack upon what occasion says king i here willingly omit as well because i would not meddle with any instrument of state as because i little suspecting what followed was somewhat careless in the observance of their carriage  in their journey they baited and lodged at diverse gentlemens houses of raleghs acquaintance upon the road from some of whom hearing more distinctly the nearer he approached it what a storm his enemies had brewed at court he began to regret his having neglected the opportunity he had at plymouth of retiring which he discoursed of to his lady and to me says captain king who told him he could blame none but himself but after that peremptory warrant which a pursuivant brought down for the speedy bringing up of his person he began again to meditate upon a retreat though as he grew more desirous it grew more difficult therefore when he had made such inland advancement on his journey as to have no means left that would favor him by water he once more employed me says captain king who was always ready to do any thing that might procure his safety being well assured in my own conscience though he sought to absent himself till the spanish fury was over yet as he always said that no misery should make him disloyal to his king or country and although manourie in his declaration sets down that sir walter ralegh should to him in private speak ill of his majesty yet i must protest till my last hour that in all the years i followed him i never heard him name his majesty but with reverence i am sorry the assertion of that man should prevail so much against the dead  the particulars of captain kings employment for this second escape we shall respite a while to make way for those which according to the due course of time must now be recurd to out of that frenchmans declaration as captain king calls it above and shall do it with such justice as not to omit or disguise any of the ill words against his majesty ascribed to ralegh therein but can only do it from that which was suffered to appear after raleghs death annexed to king jamess declaration and thereby choose rather to hazard a trespass upon the patience of some readers who may think it a detail of improbable at least insignificant objections than incur the censure of partiality from others in omitting it since king james and consequently his council thought it would pass for matter of such importance by their making it so great a part of what was hoped would justify his proceedings against ralegh and of such authority as to need no other evidence not that it is there too expressively or positively called manouries declarations or his confession or examination upon oath but by a pretty light pliable phrase it is said the story himself reports to have passed in this manner  upon saturday the   th of july sir walter ralegh sir lewis stucley and the said manourie went to he at mr drakes where the letters of commission from the privy council were brought to sir lewis stucley and that ralegh hereat changing countenance exclaimed with an oath is it possible my fortune should return upon me thus again this hastening their departure they advanced on sunday morning nearer to london about four miles and baited at mr horseys that here ralegh first caused manourie to be founded what was in his heart suspecting apparently that he was designed as a spy over him by his old domestic captain king who discoursing manourie upon raleghs calamities said i wish we were all at paris manourie answered i would we were all at london what should we do at paris because said king as soon as we come to london they will commit sir walter to the tower and cut off his head manourie said he hoped better things and that according to his ability he was ready to do him all honest service after dinner they set forward for sherborne and here ralegh is said to tell manourie all that was his and the king had unjustly taken it from him manourie and raleghs retinue lay in the town that night but ralegh himself and stucley at old mr parhams on monday they got to salisbury where as ralegh was walking on foot down the hill and had found by enquiry that manourie had got some physic about him he desired him to prepare a vomit against morning for i know said he as he is here represented with a surprising faith already in such a man twill be good to evacuate bad humors and by this means i shall gain time to work my friends order my assairs and perhaps pacify his majesty otherwise as soon as i come to london they will have me to the tower and cut off my head which i cannot escape without counterfeiting sickness which your vomits will effect without suspicion accordingly that at salisbury he complained of a dimness of sight with a dizziness in his head and when he was conducted toward his chamber that he staggered and struck himself with such violence against a pillar in the gallery as made stucley think he was sick indeed and in that belief manourie left him for that time on tuesday morning ralegh sent his lady with the greatest number of his servants forwards to london and now it was he also sent captain king thither on the expedition aforesaid whom we shall meet with there prepared for the same as soon as manourie is brought to an end of this same story then comes a servant of raleghs into stucleys chamber and declares his master was out of his wits that he left him in his shirt upon all four scratching and gnawing the rushes on the planks stucley sent manourie who found him in bed and asking what he ailed he answered nothing but that he did it on purpose that then ralegh asked for the vomit and took it without any hesitation at stucleys entrance that he fell a raving and before his vomit operated had such strong convulsions upon him that stucley and all the help he could get were not strong enough to prevent the contraction of his sinews as fast as the company could draw them straight insomuch that stucley caused him to be chafed and fomented but that ralegh truly afterward laughed at it to manourie and said such a confident is he now grown he had made stucley a perfect physician  in the next place ralegh must be observed to take some repose so manourie is shut into the room with him and having dissuaded him from a more violent vomit because his first did not yet work ralegh asked if he knew not of some preparation which would make him look ghastly and iksome outwardly and not affect the vitals or make him inwardly sick after a pause manourie assured him he could furnish him with an harmless ointment which would yet soon make him all over like a leper whereby we are told ralegh said the lords would be afraid to approach him and that it would move their pity besides soon after he had been thus anointed on the brows arms and breast the blisters rose successfully and so soon ripened to their full discolourations that stucley at his next visit perceiving raleghs body all broke out in purple spots with yellow heads and the rest of his skin so inflamed with heat concluded he was struck over with the plague and that it was highly contagious but asking manouries opinion he truly concealed all for that as yet he knew nothing of raleghs intended flight but thought it was only to gain time to satisfy his majesty however away went stucley to the grave bishop andrews then upon the point of his translation to winchester and soon made known what a frightful figure sir walter ralegh was become described all the tokens upon him and in the end returned with two doctors and one bachelor of physic all their skill could not enlighten them with one spark of knowledge in the nature of his distemper but they gave their opinion in writing that the patient could not be removed into the air without manifest hazard of his life and manourie set his hand to it  here ralegh is described to have been much delighted that matters went on so prosperously especially that the vomit worked so thoroughly in the presence of these learned doctors but having apprehended they would inspect his water he directed manourie to rub the urinal with a certain dug which turned all to such a dismal color and such a disagreeable scent that if heaven did not prescribe the patient must perish for nothing could the physicians do but pronounce the disease mortal further that he then made manourie bind his arm about with the black silk ribband which he took from his poniard but that not distempering his pulse agreeable to expectation he had more blisters raised the next day by this time his physic having opened his stomach and made him hungry he got manourie secretly to buy a leg of mutton and three loaves which he fed upon in private and by this subtilty was thought to have fasted three days that is to friday the last of july ever feigning great indisposition and uneasiness in company but when alone for to get the opportunity of being so was the chief source of all the artifice he did here really put in practice he wrote his declaration or apology and is said to have got manourie to make him a transcript of it which was as the penman of this story further says since presented to his majesty but by an expression of that ambiguity and latitude whether we are designed to understand it was before or after raleghs death that penman intelligent enough in other parts of manouries said story and the rest of the kings declaration for they were both of them visibly cast in one mould might think it not necessary to be so here it was surely a most vexatious stratagem that ralegh should unexpectedly make such a provoking vindication of his voyage and thereby defeat the preparations that were making to cut him off for it but however it may in the opinion of posterity have cleared his innocence among his cotemporaries it could not secure his safety  the same night as the story goes on apparently to rase inflammations beyond his own person he insinuated to stucley that he thought he had taken pon at mr pahams for that he was a papist and kept a priest in his house but desired and particularly to monsieur that it might not be spoken of a while after being in his bedchamber undressed and no body present but his friend manourie he is said to have taken a lookingglass in his hand to admire his spotted face and to have merrily observed to his said confident how they should one day laugh for having thus cozened the king council physicians and spaniards and all  on the first of august being the day that the king arrived in his progress at salisbury ralegh is said to have taken manourie in private and having opened a red leather trunk put into his hand nine pieces of spanish gold saying there is twenty crowns in pistoles which i give you for your physical receipts and the victuals you bought me and i will give you fifty pounds a year if you will do what i tell you and if sir lewis stucley asks what conference you have had with me tell him that you comfort me in my adversity and that i make you no other answer than what is here written giving him a piece of paper containing these words ve la m manourie lacceptance de tous mes travaux perte de mon estate et de mon fills mes maladies et douleurs ve la ceffect de ma confience au roy as much as to say behold there m manourie the fruit of all my toils the loss of my fortune and of my son the sickness i have endured and the sorrows behold there the effect of that faith i reposed in his majesty but behold where  for that ve la or voila repeated as it is plainly points at some more copious or convincing evidence which accompanied this expression and more particularly demonstrated those losses and afflictions to have been the fruit of raleghs trust or faith in the king to which these words appear but a bare direction and which therefore seems here to have been suppressed which paper of ralegh s own handwriting was afterward produced by manourie  and now ralegh is pretended to practice more unreservedly still about the escape with manourie as being all in his power to aid him and he the only person trusted by stucley whereupon he proposes that ralegh at his coming to london should lie perdue at a friend of manourie s in shirelane which did not long engage his approbation for ralegh resolved otherwise telling this only person trusted by stucley through an incredible profuseness of communication that he had sent captain king to hire him a bark below gravesend which would go with all winds and another little boat to carry him to it adding that to hide himself in london he should be always apprehensive of a discovery by the general searchers that are there but that to escape he must get leave to go to his own house and being there he would so handle the matter as to slip from stucley through a backdoor into the boat with ease for no body would dream he could go on foot seeing him so feeble as he seemed to be then that manourie should say why would you fly your apology and your last declaration do they not sufficiently justify you and that ralegh should silence him with tell me no more a man that fears is never secure  in the next place ralegh is said to have procured the kings license to be at his own house when he should come to london and that when manourie hereupon observed his majesty seemed not inclined to take away his life since he suffered him to repair to his own habitation for the recovery of his health that ralegh should reply they used all these kinds of flatteries to the duke of bion to draw him fairly into prison and then they cut off his head adding i know they have concluded among them it is expedient that a man should die to reassure the traffic which i have broken with spain thereupon says our story he broke forth into the most hateful and traitorous words against the kings own person but it surprisingly omits them all to object only his ending with this improbable rant that if he could but save himself for this time he would plot such plots as should make the king think himself happy to send for him again and restore him to his estate with advantage yea and would force the king of spain to write into england in his favor  nay when manourie as we are further persuaded showed such care and concern for stucley as to ask what would become of him if ralegh escaped whether he would be put to death or lose his office and estate ralegh is said to answer not to death but he would be imprisoned for a while yet his lands were assured to his eldest son and for the rest it was no part of his care then manourie asks if it were not treason in himself to be aiding to his escape no answers ralegh you are a foreigner however if you pretend to know any thing they will put you in prison but what if i am discovered to have a hand in your escape says the other why follow me into france your own country replies ralegh quit all and i will make amends for all  as they traveled between andover and stains manourie as this story that is ascribed to him acknowledges discovered ralegh s intended escape to stucley who thenceforth used extraordinary diligence in guards and watches upon him which ralegh perceiving as it is also owned nevertheless trusts manourie with a new proposal at stains in these words i see it is not possible to escape by our two means alone stucley is so watchful and sets such strict guard upon me and will be too hard for us with all our cunning therefore there is no way but to make him of our council and if we can persuade him to let me save myself i will give him in hand the worth of two hundred pounds sterling upon these words he drew forth and showed manourie a jewel made in the fashion of hail powdered with diamonds having a ruby in the middle valued at a hundred and fifty pounds sterling and putting it into his hands said besides this jewel he shall have fifty pounds in money pray tell him as much from me and persuade him to it i know he will trust you  this overture being made by manourie stucley after some parley sent back word by him to ralegh that he would accept of his offer and bad him tell ralegh he was content to do as he had desired but would choose rather to go with him than tarry behind with shame and reproach directing manourie further to ask how this could be done without losing his office of vice admiral which cost him six hundred pounds also to what place they should go how they should live afterward and what means he would carry with him to furnish this intended escape ralegh obviates all this with praying him to tell stucley that if he would swear unto him not to discover him he would tell him his whole intent and that for the first point though stucley were to lose his office he should yet be no loser that as soon as he was got into france or holland his wife was to send him a thousand pounds and that he should carry with him only a thousand crowns in money and jewels to serve at present after supper ralegh is further represented so open so contrary to all his former character and beyond all manner of belief as to say o if i could escape without stucley i should do bravely but it is no matter i will carry him along and afterward dispatch myself of him well enough then manourie having apprised stucley of all that passed brought them together ralegh showed the jewel and probably delivered it for stucley showed himself content and it was probably upon the acceptance of it but desired a little respite to dispose of his office manourie having thus seen the agreement made took his leave of them for london the part designed for him ending here after having said to ralegh he did not think of seeing him again while he was in england ralegh at parting gave him by a letter to a person at radford an iron furnace with a distillatory of copper belonging to it and charged him to tell every body he met how sick he was and that he left him in an extreme looseness that very night  but as ralegh had dispatched captain king to london with instructions to be in readiness for him he kept moving on when there fell out an accident which gave him fresh hopes to facilitate his escape for when he came to his inn at brentford he was met by a frenchman named la chesnay a follower of le clerc agent from the french king who told ralegh the said french agent was very desirous to speak with him as soon as he got to london about some affairs which highly concerned his safety accordingly the next night after ralegh was at london the said le clerc and la chesnay came to visit him at his house and there le clerc offered him a french bark which he had prepared for him to escape in and withal his letters recommendatory for his safe conduct and reception to the governor of calais and to send a gentleman expressly that should attend and meet him there but ralegh understanding the french bark not to be so ready nor so fit as that he had already proposed for himself gave him thanks and told him that he would make use of his own bark but for his letters and the rest of his offer that he should be beholden to him because his acquaintance in france was worn out ralegh might say this to get his recommendation the stronger but indeed his fame was now in high request at the french court for one of the noblest scholars in france nicholas claudius fabricius lord of peresk writing soon after a letter over to camden concludes it with these words highly in his favor  the french agent having formed a design of conveying sir walter ralegh to france monsieur de la chesnaye was examined before the lords of the council who confessed that le clerc had employed him for that purpose le clerc was then cited to appear before them but as punctilios often arise in relation to ambassadors so here a dispute sprung up which seemed to add to the indignation already conceived against sir walter for le clerc refused to answer any interrogatories till the lords of the council should stand up and be uncovered as he was insisting that sir w becher when agent for king james in france had claimed a right to the same privilege and was granted it to which the lords replied that different countries had different forms but in order to set all objections aside they removed out of the council chamber into a private room where no ceremony was observed and le clerc being confronted by le chesnaye confessed the whole affair king james being informed thereof le clerc was forbid all further exercise of his charge and ordered not to appear at court till it was known whether or no the french king approved of his conduct   with this passage and a word or two only of raleghs attempt to escape after he came to london it not being thought proper here to expatiate upon the arts used in betraying it ends the tedious fardel of objections accumulated to render him unworthy of mercy in the kings declaration and the story ascribed to the obscure frenchman aforesaid in it but unconfirmed by any affidavit or evidence upon oath which in other such cases have been thought necessary vouchers therefore how far to be called heinous offenses acts of hostility depredations abuses of his charge impostures and declensions of justice the reader may now first give his own judgment and then compare it with what has been before said of these accusations by others upon the great murmurs which arose at the putting sir walter ralegh to death king james published a declaration which instead of mitigating the affair only aggravated it in the eye of the world and an author writing on this subject says that his crime was in having more merit than such a prince kw how to value for his attempt at guiana was even by his very enemies judged reasonable   and now comes on the remainder of captain kings narrative wherein he tells us that from salisbury he was sent before to london to provide a boat and to lay her as low as tilbury and that he was also advised to put one cotterell in trust who had been raleghs servant for the provision of a wherry as soon as king came to london he dealt with cotterell who seemed as willing to do sir walter service as himself but telling him of one heart who had been boatswain to the said captains ship and had a ketch of his own with him the captain therefore agreed and gave him money to get it in readiness having vowed secrecy upon the reward which the captain further promised him but he had no sooner received the thirty pieces of silver than he betrayed the design to mr william herbert who as suddenly divulged it but king not suspecting any discovery still fed heart with money to keep the ketch at tilbury  on friday night which was the  th of august sir walter ralegh came to london when captain king attended on him at his lodgings but was told by ralegh that he could in no wise get ready to go off that night it seems to be the next day that stucley got his warrant to indemnify him for any contract he should enter into with sir walter ralegh or to authorize his compliance with any offer he should make him for his escape or in short as others have not spared to call it a license to betray him for though ralegh might now have been secured in a direct and undisguised manner yet the glory was to do it insidiously and under the vizor of friendship being not more suitable to the genius of predominant power than necessary on the present occasion to give room for so many more little circumstances of objection as might occur to supply the place of one wanting that should have been capital and this night it was that the french ambassador aforesaid came to raleghs house and made the proposal before recited but when capt king came to him again the same night ralegh said there was no going now without stucley whom he doubted not but he should engage to go along with him and that the next night without failure he would meet the captain at the towerdock as for mr herbert aforesaid he was employed in garrowing sir walter raleghs house as the captain phrases it while ralegh being thus drawn out of it by stucley under pretense of bearing him company might be the more unexpectedly seized with all such private papers as he should have about him in hopes no doubt that by one means or other something might turn out to make a charge of sufficient weight against him but in the conclusion says our said author all the papers which were found proved to be no other than what might without any discredit have been laid open to all the world  capt king went as he further tells us on sunday night to the place appointed with two wherries and sir walter ralegh also came thither having put on a false beard and a hat with a green hatband he was accompanied with sir lewis stucley young stucley and his own page then asking captain king if all things were ready he answered they were and that the cloakbag and the four pistols were in the boat stucley then saluted captain king and asked whether thus far he had not distinguished himself an honest man to which king answered that he hoped he would continue so  after they entered the boats and divided the pistols they had not rowed above twenty strokes before the watermen told them that mr herbert had lately taken boat and made as if he would have gone through bridge but returned down the river after them this raised some apprehension in ralegh but upon stucleys encouragement they rowed on yet ralegh not well satisfied called captain king near to him who was in the other boat with young stucley and heart and intimated that he could not go forward unless he was sure of the watermen whom he then also spoke to asking whether if any should come to arrest them in the kings name they would row forwards or return at this the great boobies were so frightened that they cried and answered they knew no body there but captain king who had hired them to gravesend and that they neither dared nor would go any further ralegh said that a brabbling matter with the spanish ambassador was the cause that of necessity he must go to tilbury to embark for the low countries and that he would give them ten pieces of gold for their pains  then began stucleys part cursing and damning himself that he should be so unfortunate as to venture his life and fortune with a man so full of doubts and fears he swore that if the watermen would not row on he would kill them and persuaded ralegh that there was no such danger as he suspected of which opinion capt king also still was thus the time passed till they drew near greenwich when a wherry crossed them which ralegh said came to discover them king sought to dissuade him from this supposition and told him that if they could but reach gravesend he would hazard his life to get to tilbury these delays spent the tide and the watermen said it was impossible to get to gravesend before morning hereupon ralegh would have landed at purfleet and heart would have possessed him that though it was night he could procure him horses to tilbury stucley appeared very zealous for this proposal and said that upon that condition he could be content to carry the cloakbag on his own shoulders half a mile but king told him that if they could not go by water it was impossible at that time of night to get horses to go by land  by this time they had rowed as far as woolwich or rather about a mile beyond which might be to a reach called the gallions near plumstead here approaching two or three ketches heart began to doubt whether any one of them was his upon this ralegh concluded they were all betrayed and bid the watermen turn back hoping to have got to his own house before morning and began to examine heart very strictly who pretended he had given his men express charge not to stir from tilbury till he came down but this would not induce ralegh to proceed before they had rowed back a furlong they espied another wherry and hailing her they said they were for the king ralegh perceiving they were some of mr herberts crew proposed to stucley seeing they were discovered and in respect to his safety that he might remain still in his custody and that stucley should openly declare to the watermen he was his prisoner which he did here stucley and he fell into private discourse contriving how ralegh might reach his house and how stucley might save himself harmless by saying that he only pretended to go along with ralegh in order to discover his intentions and seize upon his private papers then they whispered some time together and ralegh taking some things out of his pockets whether more rubies powdered with diamonds our author does not say and gave them to stucley who all this while not only hugged and embraced him as it seemed with the greatest tenderness but made the utmost protestations of love friendship and fidelity when they were got back to greenwich stucley said that he durst not carry ralegh to his house but persuaded him to land which they did the other strange boat landing at the same time in which the men they perceived belonged to mr w herbert and sir william st john the same who had made good profit of ralegh before as we have read upon greenwich bridge stucley told capt king it would be for sir walters good that he should pretend he was consenting with him to betray his master king not able to fathom the depth of this policy as he tells us refused it thinking he should not only thereby belly his own conscience but make himself odious to the world therefore though ralegh himself made some motion of it to him he could not how serviceable soever it might prove be guilty of so much insincerity toward him then stucley arrested the captain in his majestys name and committed him to the charge of two of mr herberts men after this they all went to a tavern and by the way captain king heard ralegh say sir lewis these actions will not turn out to your credit ralegh was kept apart from king till morning when as they entered into the tower ralegh said to him stucley and cotterell have betrayed me adding for your part you need be in fear of no danger but as for me it is i am the mark that is shot at then captain king being forced to take his leave left ralegh to his tuition with whom i do not doubt says he but his soul rests and so concludes his narrative  here the curious reader would probably be willing to know what stucley had to say for himself upon this business and this i have some opportunity of relating from the tract he published at raleghs death in his own defense which though for its authors behavior aforesaid it has been so much disregarded that of all the historians general and particular who have written of sir walter ralegh and some few of them whose characters are pretty well known to his disparagement i never met with one who has shown it so much credit as to quote it yet as i have found some few passages not altogether useless in explaining other parts of this life so those which concern this part i have thought proper more particularly here to insert in observance to a good biographical maxim which enjoins us as far as the parts they bear in our narrative will permit to show a due respect to the characters of all men and consequently not in favor of any to prostitute our own  in this tract which is properly enough addressed to the king one of the earliest motives to revenge in that poor instrument of state as stucley no less properly calls himself against ralegh appears to be a pretense that ralegh had abridgd stucleys father of an incredible dividend in a prize many years before taken at sea whereof a more particular account has been before given in its proper place as the last motive will appear to be what ralegh said of this stucley in his dying speech but the arguments stucley makes use of for having betrayed him are drawn first from raleghs having pretended to be poisoned at sir edward parhams house who was stucleys kinsman for he reports ralegh to have said though the gentleman would not hurt me yet there might be priests that did it for i remember after my mornings draught of a cup of ale which sir edward parham offered me in the hall i felt presently a kind of excoriation in my bowels as if some jesuit had been the butler now says stucley when i saw the pustles break out upon him at salisbury my compassion i confess was too credulous to report it but that being thus deceived himself and thereby wronging his kinsman it moved his indignation against ralegh for abusing both so that in short he drew ralegh to his destruction by a lie because he had induced stucley to asperse his kinsman with one and though divinity would not as stucley owns yet reason of state would hold it lawful to lie for the discovery of treason in service to the commonwealth then he endeavors to reconcile himself to the commonwealth by answering the objection of his being so instrumental to the depriving it of so sufficient a member as had not left his equal behind him in these words no man denies but he had many sufficiencies in him but what were these but so many weapons of practice and danger against the state if he escaped being so deeply tainted in so many points of discontent dishonesty and disloyalty he knew as he had written that as in nature so in policy a privatione ad habitum not fit regressio and therefore being desperate of any fortune here agreeable to the height of his mind who can doubt but he would have made up his fortune elsewhere upon any terms against his sovereign and country in another place which relates to raleghs last endeavors of escaping he tells the king on the saturday when i received your majestys commission by my cousin herbert i received also intelligence by him that at that instant ralegh was flying from my custody without my privity not having as yet made him any semblance of condescent so that i almost came upon him unawares even as he was putting on his false beard and other disguisements which declares he did still distrust your goodness doubtless out of the conscience of his guiltiness whatever he writ or said to the contrary and is it any marvel then that he was angry with me at his death for bringing him back besides being a man as he was thought of so great a wit it was no small grief that a man of so mean wit as i should be thought to go beyond him yea but you should not have used such craft to go beyond him no sic ars deluditur art neque enim lex justior ulla est quam necis artifices art perire sua but why did you not execute your commission bravely to his apprehension on him in his house why my commission was to the contrary to discover his pretensions and to seize his secret papers etc and can any honest subject question my honesty in the performance of such a commission which tended to discover the secret intentions of an illaffected heart to my sovereign how can any dislike this in me and not bewray his own dishonest heart unto the state yea but though another might have done this yet how might you do it being his kinsman and his friend surely if i had been so yet in a public employment and trust laid upon me i was not to refuse it much less to prefer private kindness and amity before my public duty and loyalty for what did i know the dangerous consequence of these matters which were to be discovered or who knows them yet of those that make themselves my competent judges but if there were no kindred or amity between us as i avow there never was what bond then might tie me to him but the tie of compassion to his miseries which was in my sovereigns heart to distribute when he saw time that did command me and not in the dispensation of me nor of any other instruments power that is to be commanded these are his arguments and he concludes his pamphlet with making two humble petitions to his most excellent majesty first seeing that i your poor loyal subject am burdened and oppressed with the testimony of a bitter enemy of a perjured and condemned man against all reason conscience and law that i may have your majestys leave to the confirmation of the truth which i have avowed to be sufficient to receive the sacrament upon it in your majestys chapel but if he did receive the sacrament to confirm the truth of his assertions for this seems to be the meaning of his words if they have or were intended to have any how that would justify the falsehood of his actions and how his taking of the sacrament would be of any credit to him who has owned that divinity would not hold his practices lawful or how clear him for the violation of that trust and fidelity he had before taken the sacrament as we shall hear presently to maintain he was not thought a casuist or even instrument of state enough to resolve the last petition is that his majesty would be so gracious as to suffer a declaration to come forth from the state for the clearing of these matters and further satisfaction of the world which plainly discovers that this pamphlet sent out under the name of this instrument was a mere concerted preparative to the said declaration which so observantly followed it like a fomentation to supple the minds of the uneasy people that the sovereign unguent might enter more effectually but how little satisfaction the said declaration gave we have already noted and for stucleys performance it made not so much as himself easy being in his own opinion so insufficient to deface the black and odious stains of his conduct that he was forced to write an apology besides and that was so little regarded as never to have been thought worthy of the press whether his life was more successful than his writings and how it fared with him after this piece of courtservice may be gathered from several authors some historical compurgators of this reign and consequently no friend to raleghs memory yet own that stucleys destiny was suitable to his dealings being afterward hanged say they for clipping of gold but those who had better intelligence and knew the truth more particularly have delivered it more perfectly where they affirm that stucley having for a bag of money falsified his faith which he had confirmed by the tie of the holy sacrament he was before the year came about caught clipping the same coin in the kings own house at whitehall which he had received as the reward of his perfidiousness for which being eondemned to be hanged he was driven to sell himself to his shirt to purchase his pardon of two knights then to avoid the sight and scorn of mankind withdrew himself to a little island in the severn sea called the isle of lundy and there died a poor distracted beggar which as we find it elsewhere sufficiently confirmed was in less than two years after raleghs death thus horribly did the deceivers reward prove his punishment and thus we leave this notable monument of unprosperous treachery  ralegh as was before mentioned was now prisoner again in the tower of london being brought thither on monday morning the  0th of august about two or three days after a committee was selected to examine into the aforesaid escape it being a matter luckily capable and highly necessary to be enlarged upon in order to fill up the measure of accusation such a premeditated flight was therefore declaimed against as a crime so heavy and so heinous such a disdain or despair of his majestys mercy as was greatly to be expected could never obtain his forgiveness then again for sir walter ralegh to alienate himself thus from his native country by means of a foreign power was stretched out to the idea of a separation as horrid as the breach of some huge rock or promontory from the main land when its foundation was sapd and washed away by undermining waves  the arguments ralegh now returned to extenuate this mighty transgression having been by no author transmitted to us it is not impossible but they were with the rest of his justification before those commissioners during the time of this his last imprisonment industriously stifled there is notwithstanding one of his own letters on this subject descended by means of the press to us it is directed by the error of the editor it seems to the duke though as yet no more than marquis of buckingham and dated the   th of october herein says ralegh with relation to his late attempted escape that which does comfort my soul in this offense is that even in the offense it self i had no other intent than his majestys service and to make his majesty know that my late enterprise was grounded upon a truth and which with one ship speedily set out i meant to have assured or to have died being resolved as it is well known to have done it from plymouth bad i not been restrained hereby i hoped not only to recover his majestys gracious opinion but have destroyed all those malignant reports which had been spread of me that this is true that gentleman whom i so much trusted my keeper and to whom i opened my heart cannot but testify and wherein if i cannot be believed living my death shall witness yea that gentleman cannot but avow it that when we came back toward london i desired to save no other treasure than the exact description of those places in the indies that i meant to go hence as a discontented man god i trust and my own actions will dissuade his majesty whom neither the loss of my estate thirteen years imprisonment and the denial of my pardon could beat from his service nor had the opinion of being counted a fool or rather distract by returning as i did balanced with my love to his majestys person and estate any place at all in my heart  it was that last severe letter from the lords for the speed bringing of me up and the impatience of dishonor that first put me in fear of my life or enjoying it in a perpetual imprisonment never to recover my reputation lost which strengthened me in my late and too lamented resolution if his majestys merey do not abound if his majesty do not pity my age and scorn to take the extremest and utmost advantage of my errors if his majesty in his charity do not make a difference between offenses proceeding from a lifesaving natural impulsion without all ill intent and those of an ill heart and that your lordship remarkable in the world for the nobeness of your disposition do not vouchsafe to become my intercessor whereby your lordship shall bind an hundred gentlemen of my kindred to honor your memory and bind me for all the time of that life which your lordship shall beg for me to pray to god that you may ever prosper and overbind me to remain your most humble servant w ralegh    though all other events and motions in this expedition were now also racked and tenterd by his adversaries though the commissioners who were perhaps the same mentioned in a kind of oblique manner at the end of the kings declaration as witnesses thereof came now constantly to the tower to pick out or catch hold of any thing that might contribute some plausible matter to condemn him yet after the examinations reexaminations and confrontments of the most discontented persons in the late voyage none of all the depositions upon oath that are pretended to have been taken or were really wormd out of them were ever thought so material by the said commissioners as to have been distinctly brought to light either in that declaration or elsewhere against sir walter ralegh much less may we expect to meet with any of the arguments urged by himself in his own defense during this inquisition or close and private manner of sisting him from so many quarters and yet if they had been fairly presented to the public it is not thought they could have given the world greater satisfaction or have cleared him better than what he had just before written both in his letter to the lord carew and at the end of his apology to prove the authority he had for the late action at guiana the integrity of his conduct in it with the reason and necessity thereof wherein it appears he absolutely depended on the honor of king james to continue now as he had begun the maintenance of his right to that country which ralegh had lawfully possessed for the crown at least so far as not to renounce or circumvent his own commission otherwise how well he knew that if he made the least opposition to any resistance of his attempt he was liable to be pursued as an invader or if he returned with any gold to be persecuted as a plunderer by the spaniards and if he did neither that he was still no less liable to be accused as an impostor by his coadventurers but in this latter respect all suspicion was clearly removed even from those who by their losses in this voyage would have been most readily prompted to make such reproach when they found ralegh prove himself as in these writings to the face of mankind such a far greater loser than any of the rest hereby as was before observed and as for the other two objections ralegh has also made it no less amply evident in the same pieces how glaringly he must appear to the world a mere premeditated or designed sacrifice to one of them if king james should maim his sovereignty of its title to guiana or now disclaimed the undertaking there which he had before authorized for therein he has showed that his majesty was well resolved of his right in those parts bordering the orenoque to the south as far as the amazons by having formerly given the english leave to plant and inhabit there and that his own proposal to go thither was not accounted of as what would endanger the peace even by the spanish ambassador who pretended it to be needless that ralegh should carry such strength with him if he intended no other enterprise for that he should work any mine there without disturbance but had a good reason returned by ralegh for that strength from the example of sir john hawkins further showing that for the spaniards to set up a town upon the orenoque was such a usurpation and that their king should thereupon call himself king of guiana was as unreasonable as if he were to call himself king of ireland because he took possession at smerwick and built a fort there having also shown that no peace could be broken there by him where no peace was maintained by the spaniards both from their bloody usage of the english who had lately been to trade there and from the words in the king of spains late letters to the governor who first called us enemies when he hoped to cut us in pieces says ralegh and having failed peacebreakers when to be an enemy and a peacebreaker in one and the same action is impossible moreover that here the spaniards began the first slaughter that their town was not burnt by any knowledge or permission of his nor his directions to the mine followed lastly having observed how little the spaniards can endure that the english nation should look upon any part of america being above a fourth part of the whole known world though the hundredth part was never possessed by the spaniards and withal the many ill consequences of acknowledging that we have offended the king of spain by landing in guiana even to the ruin of our navigation trade power and dominion in this quarter of the globe where there was as much room and reason for advancing the honor and riches of england as of any state in christendom he concludes his apology with these words i have said it already and i will say it again that if guiana be not his majestys the working of a mine there and the taking of a town there had been equally perilous for by doing the one i had robbed the king of spain and been a thief and by the other a disturber or breaker of the peace  now it is plain that king james so much waved his right to guiana at least till ralegh was put to death for then he assumed it again by the power he gave for another expedition to those parts about a year after the death of sir walter ralegh king james granted captain roger north a commission to inhabit and settle a colony near the river amazons in guiana but was soon awed by gondomar so much that on the   th of may    0 he issued a proclamation to recall that gentleman from the said undertaking and committed his brother the lord north to the fleet prison for hastening the said voyage however irresolutely according to custom he revoked it that as we observe in his declaration not only the place which ralegh went to is pretended to be out of his commission but the title he stood upon to be no ways compatible with it yet so incontestably did ralegh make it appear no doubt in his examinations at present no less than in the writings abovementioned that if any peace could be broken where no peace had been maintained it must either be by king james himself in first granting a commission to plunder another prince for he knew where ralegh was going and no where declines his knowledge that the spaniards were settled there and then betraying it to procure a defeat of the very attempt he had empowered or else by the spaniards themselves in resisting his endeavors to put it in execution that after all this questioning canvasing and heaping up of allegations against him the council could not think it justifiable to take away sir walter raleghs life for all that had passed at guiana yet as he must be put to death they found a way to appease the spaniards with his blood by making this last action at st thome the efficient cause but the obsolete condemnation at winchester fifteen years past the nominal cause of his destruction as a course whereby both the law would be judicially satisfied and the title be left for fear of displeasure undecided so in the whole it was resolved there should be room enough to revoke the kings former mercy as it appears in his declaration and that ralegh might lose his head upon his former attainder king james says osborne gave up this incomparable jewel to the will of this monster in ambition the spaniard under the pretense of a superannuated transgression contrary to the opinion of the most honest sort of gownmen who maintained that his majestys pardon lay inclusively in the commission he gave him upon his setting out to sea it being incongruous that he who remained under the notion of one dead in the law should as a general dispose of the lives of others not being himself master of his own but the spanish faction then absolute at court and sole managers of the kings power no less than his justice did so far tender his catholic majestys full satisfaction in the procuring of his death the only man of note left alive who had helped to beat them in the year      that no absurdity lying in the way of his prosecution could deter them from making use of his former condemnation remembering withal how far his wit had puzzled them at winchester and how much the jury who condemned him there were touched in their consciences which made it the less probable they should be able to impannel one so wicked as would do it then besides no peace beyond the line was a belief so rivetted in the opinion of all as he could not have been indicted anew without the kings producing the original articles by which his accusers would have been convinced of malice or his prince of folly memoirs of king james p  0  notwithstanding the repugnancies apparent in such a conclusion to men of penetration among whom carew ralegh has very well observed thereupon that his father was condemned for being a friend to the spaniards and lost his life by the same sentence for being their enemy see howels letters vol ii p     and the tract entitled a brief relation of sir walter raleghs troubles etc where carew ralegh s words are p   as follows here justice was indeed blind blindly executing one and the same person upon one and the same condemnation for things contradictory for sir walter ralegh was condemned for being a friend to the spaniard and lst his life for being their utter enemy thus kings when they wi do what they please please not him they should god and having made their power subservient to their will deprive themselves of that just power whereby where are  to them   a method however of dispatching him being thus piecd out the king or those with whom he left the management of this affair when he went upon his progress appeared very eager for bringing it to a period therefore as the shortest way a privy seal was sent to the judges forthwith to order execution but they considering there ought to be some face of regularity in the matter and a little finger in the court of justice to slide it off with as much decency and smoothness as the business would allow of demurd upon that extrajudicial manner of proceeding therefore on friday the   d of october there was a conference held upon the form or manner how prisoners who have been attainted of treason and set at liberty should be brought to execution between all the justices of england as one of them judge haton tells us wherein the question being put whether a privy seal was sufficient it being directed to the justices of the kings bench to command them to award execution against sir walter ralegh or how they should proceed before execution be awarded it was resolved by all that he ought to be brought to the bar y habas corpus to the lieutenant of the tower and then demanded if he could say any thing why execution should not be awarded for the proceedings against him being before commissioners they are delivered only into the court of kings bench or they might have remained in a bag or a chest and no roll made thereof and so long time passing it is not a legal course that he should be commanded by a privy seal or great seal to be executed without being demanded what he has to say for he might have a pardon or he might say that he was not the same person as if one be outlawed of felony and taken he shall not be presently hanged but he shall be brought to bar and so demanded etc upon this resolution a privy seal came to the justices of the kings bench commanding them to proceed against him according to law in what sense he was so proceeded against may be better understood by that notice which on the   th of october being the next day ralegh received from the commissioners to prepare for death and by his not being suffered when he soon after appeared in court before the judges according to law to make any defense of himself for what had been the occasion of his coming thither as may be seen by the following abstract of the said proceedings which i have been favored with from authentic copies  on wednesday the   th of october sir walter ralegh at eight oclock in the morning was awaked out of a fit of a fever with summons presently to appear at the kings bench bar at westminster and soon after nine oclock he was by writ of habeas corpus brought thither the writ being delivered to the judges by sir walter apsley and sir walter ralegh s conviction at winchester read the attorney mr henry yelverton set forth that the prisoner having been fifteen years since convicted of high treason and then received the judgment of death his majesty of his abundant grace had been pleased to show mercy unto him till now that justice calls to him for execution sir walter ralegh continued he has been a statesman and a man who in regard to his parts and quality is to be pitied he has been as a star at which the world have gazed but stars may fall nay they must fall when they trouble the sphere wherein they abide it is therefore his majestys pleasure now to call for execution of the former judgment and i now require order for the same then the clerk of the crown mr fanshaw having read the record of the conviction and judgment the prisoner holding up his hand was asked what he could say why execution should not be awarded against him ralegh told the lords his voice was grown weak by his late sickness and an ague he had at that instant upon him in which he was brought thither therefore as it appears in another copy of these proceedings before referred to desired the relief of a pen and ink but the lord chief justice sir henry montague telling him he spoke audibly enough he went on to this effect that he hoped the judgment he received to die so long since could not now be strained to take away his life since by his majestys commission for his late voyage it was implied to be restored in giving him power as marshal on the life and death of others and since he undertook the same to honor his sovereign and enrich his kingdom with gold of the ore whereof this hand said he has found and taken in guiana then beginning to mention by what unavoidable and unblameable means the said enterprise miscarried the lord chief justice interrupted and told him whatever he spoke touching his voyage was not to the purpose also that his commission could be of no service to him that treason was not pardoned by implication and that he must say something else to the purpose otherwise they must proceed to give execution ralegh then finding whatever he should offer in his own justification would be no way to the purpose put himself upon the kings mercy yet gave some reasons why he hoped the king would take compassion upon him concerning that judgment which was so long past in which both his majesty was of opinion and there were some present who could witness that he had hard usage the lord chief justice advised him to the wisdom of submission and told him he was called to grant execution upon the judgment given fifteen years since all which time he had been as a man dead in the law but the king in mercy spared him that he might think it heavy if this were done in cold blood but it was not so for new offnces had stirred up his majestys justice to revive what the law had formerly cast upon him i know continued he that you have been valiant and wise and i doubt not but you retain both these virtues for now you shall have occasion to use them your faith has heretofore been questioned but i am resolved you are a good christian for your book which is an admirable work does testify as much i would give you counsel but i know you can apply unto yourself far better than i am able to give you yet with the good neighbor in the gospel he was for pouring some oil into his wounds though far was it from yielding the refreshment he promised by reason of the severity wherewith he so sharpened the infusion i give you the oil of comfort said he though in respect that i am a minister of the law mixed with vinegar nay the judge further gave him how unnecessary soever he just before owned it to be one lecture upon sorrow sorrow said he will not avail you in some kind for were you pained sorrow would not ease you were you afflicted sorrow would not relieve you were you tormented sorrow would not content you and yet the sorrow for your sins would be an everlasting comfort to you then another also upon death you must do as that valiant captain did said he who perceiving himself in danger said in defiance of death death thou expectest me but maugre thy spite i expect thee fear not death too much nor fear death too little not too much lest you fail in your hope nor too little lest you die presumptuously and here i must conclude my prayers to god for it and that he would have mercy on your soul so he ended with saying execution is granted  ralegh then desired that he might not be cut off so suddenly for that he had something to do in discharge of his conscience something to satisfy his majesty and something the world in he desired further that he might be heard at the day of his death and concluded with calling on god to be his judge before whom he should shortly appear that he was never disloyal to his majesty which i will justify said he where i shall not fear the face of any king on earth thus the manuscripts here chiefly followed conclude but in the more ancient copy of these proceedings ralegh s conclusion to the same sense is thus more copiously expressed i most humbly beseech your lordships that you will grant me some time before my execution that i may settle my affairs and my mind more than they yet are for i have much to do both for my reputation conscience and loyalty and i would beseech the favor of pen ink and paper to express myself something thereby and to discharge myself of some trust of worldly matters that were put in me which leisure i beseech you think that i crave not for to gain one minute of life for now being old sickly in disgrace and certain to go to it life is wearisome to me and i do lastly beseech your lordships that when i come to die i may have leave to speak freely at my farewell to satisfy the world only that i was ever loyal to the king and a true lover of this commonwealth for this i will seal with my blood so craving their prayers he was led away to the gate house near the palaceyard  the king was all this while retired as it were or at some remoteness from this tragical scene and as i have received it from particular tradition in hertfordshire as if he would have diverted himself not only from the sight or report but even the thoughts of it yet what an effectual and expeditious hand he had in it may further appear by his special warrant for the execution which was produced ready signed as if it at westminster in a manner as soon as the sentence was over being dated the same day and directed to his chancellor verulam herein his gracious majesty dispensing with the manner of execution according to his former judgment and releasing him of the same to be drawn hanged and quartered says our pleasure is instead thereof to have the head only of the said sir walter ralegh cut off at or within our palace of westminster commanding the said chancellor hereupon to direct two several writs under the great seal one to the lieutenant of the tower or his deputy for the delivery of sir walter ralegh to the sheriffs of middlesex at the said palace and the other to the said sheriffs for the receiving the said sir walter ralegh from the said lieutenant and for executing him there for which this to be his warrant and discharge against us our heirs and successors for ever  we find about the same time some petitions presented to the king in behalf of sir walter ralegh which were strengthened with the solicitations of some persons in great power and esteem with his majesty but shall not wonder at their having no effect with him to mitigate this peremptory and rigorous doom if it be true as an author who had opportunity enough of observing his disposition and abilities sufficient to give a clear judgment of it has said thereof with relation to sir walter ralegh that king james so far participated of the humor of a pusillanimous prince as to pardon any sooner that those injured by himself as for ralegh we find not that he harbored the least expectation or desire of a reprieve for that all the oppressions of age sickness obloquy spoil and loss of all his means besides the other indignities he now lay under banished every wish of redress in this world but by that dissolution which puts an end to all worldly miseries appears pretty evident in the letter he seems to have written but a short time before his death to the king in which he rather acknowledges some former tendencies to favor and compassion than desires any repetition of them and gives a very good reason for having no further prospect of any thing substantial therein where he says i have not spared my labor my poor estate and the hourly hazard of my life but god has otherwise disposed of all and now end the days of my hope but if the days of his hope had ended when he landed at plymouth the days of his life had probably been augmented to a much greater number not if it had been prolonged into many other acts that they might have adorned it with such unfading renown as that one whereby with such universal admiration he finished it that letter aforesaid he concludes with the generous profession of being in nothing so miserable as in that i could never meet with an occasion says he wherein to be torn in pieces for your majestys service but his majesty chose rather to let his own name and memory be torn in pieces for raleghs honor and not only by all indifferent or impartial judges but by his own countrymen bishop burnet speaking of some great errors in king jamess reign goes on thus besides these public actings king james suffered much in the opinion of all people by his strange way of using one of the greatest men of that age sir walter ralegh against whom the proceedings at first were much censured but the last part of them was thought both barbarous and illegal a little further speaking of the same king he says his reign in england was a continual course of mean practices the first condemnation of sir walter ralegh was very black but the executing him after so many yrars and after an employment that had been given him was counted a barbarous sacrificing him to the spaniards history of his own times vol        fol    and    and even by antagonists to one another in other parts of history than suffer any mercy to interfere with that sordid but deceitful and soon after derided pursuit of a profitable alliance with the crown of spain  whether any such conditions were offered him at this time to lengthen the short line of an uncomfortable existence which were either so extortionate as ralegh could not comply with them or so base and detestable as to be worse than death the particulars are not come to light unless some glimpses thereof may be discerned in that epigram he wrote a little while before his end in allusion to the light of a candle which is as follows cowards may fear to die but courage stout rather than live in snuff will be put out   moreover how sublimely his thoughts were now sequestered or elevated from all worldly considerations and with what serenity what steadiness he did in a manner possess the joys of a better state before he could be driven to it is visible in that poem he wrote about the same time on the pilgrimage his soul was suddenly to make to the regions of eternity which he concludes with this distich of death and judgment heaven and hell who often thinks must needs die well   and that his faith was no less steadfast in the hopes of a resurrection we are as convincingly assured by those verses which this last night of his life he probably wrote also here in the gate house they being found there in his bible and according to the most ancient copies i can meet with penned in these words  even such is time who takes in trust our youth our joys and all we have and pays us but with earth and dust who in the dark and silent grave when we have wandered all our ways shuts up the story of our days but from that earth that grave and dust the lord shall raise me up i trust the next morning being thursday the   th of october and the lordmayorsday sir walter ralegh was conducted by the sheriffs of middlesex to the old palaceyard in westminster where there was a large scaffold erected before the parliament house for his execution he had on a wrought nightcap under his hat a ruff band a black wrought velvet nightgown over a haircolourd satin doublet and a black wrought waistcoat a pair of black cut taffety breeches and ashcolored silk stockings he mounted the scaffold with a cheerful countenance and saluted the lords knights and gentlemen of his acquaintance there present then proclamation being made by an officer for silence he introduced his speech with informing them that as he was yesterday taken out of his bed in a strong fit of a fever which much weakened him and whose untimeliness forbearing no occasion or place he expected it again today therefore did first implore god that he would preserve him from the interruptions thereof at this time and next desired the audience if any disability of voice or dejection of countenance should appear in him that they would impute it rather to the disorder of his body than any dismay of mind then pausing a little he sat down and directed himself toward a window where the lords arundel northampton doncaster with other nobles were sitting and begun his speech but they being at some distance from the scaffold he apprehended they did not plainly distinguish his words therefore said he would strain his voice for that he would willingly have them hear him to which the lord arundel answered they would rather come down to the scaffold which he and some others did then sir walter ralegh having saluted them severally began again as follows  i thank god that he has sent me to die in the light and not in darkness i likewise thank god that he has suffered me to die before such an assembly of honorable witnesses and not obscurely in the tower where for the space of thirteen years together i have been oppressed with many miseries and i return him thanks that my fever has not taken me at this time as i prayed to him it might not that i might clear myself of some accusations unjustly laid to my charge and leave behind me the testimony of a true heart both to my king and country  there are two main points of suspicion that his majesty has conceived against me and which i conceive have specially hastened my coming hither therefore i desire to clear them to your lordships and resolve you in the truth thereof the first is that his majesty has been informed i have had some plot or confederacy with france for which he had some reasons though grounded upon a weak foundation one was that when i returned to plymouth i endeavored to go to rochel which was because i would fain have made my peace before i came to england another reason was that again i would have bent my course to france upon my last intended escape from london being the place where i might have the best means of making such peace and the best safeguard during that terror from above these joined with the coming of the french agent to my house here in london only to confer about my said voyage together with the report of my having a commission from the king of france might occasion my being so suspected in this particular and his majesty to be so displeased with me but this i say for a man to call god to witness at any time to a falsehood is a grievous sin to call him as witness to a falsehood at the point of death when there is no time for repentance is a crime far more impious and desperate therefore for me to call that majesty to witness an untruth before whose tribunal i am instantly to appear were beyond measure sinful and without hope of pardon i do yet call that great god to witness that as i hope to see him to be saved by him and live in the world to come i never had any plot or intelligence with the french king never had any commission from him nor saw his hand or seal that i never had any practice or combination with the french agent nor ever knew or saw such a person till i met him in my gallery unlooked for if i speak not true o lord let me never inter into thy kingdom  the second suspicion or imputation was that his majesty has been informed i had spoken disloyally of him the only witness of this was a base frenchman a renegade a chemical fellow whom i soon knew to be perfidious for being drawn by him into the action of freeing myself at winchester in which i confess my hand was touched he being sworn to secrecy overnight revealed it the next morning it is strange that so mean a fellow could so far incroach himself into the favor of the lords and gaping after some great reward could so falsely accuse me of seditious speeches against his majesty and be so credited but this i here speak it is no time for me to flatter or to fear princes i who am subject only unto death and for me who have now to do with god alone to tell a lie to get the favor of the king were in vain and yet if ever i spoke disloyally or dishonestly of the king either to this frenchman or any other ever intimated the least thought hurtful or prejudicial of him the lord blot me out of the book of life  i confess i did attempt to escape and it was only to save my life i likewise confess that i feigned myself to be indisposed at salisbury but i hope it was no sin for the prophet david did make himself a fool and suffered spittle to fall upon his beard to escape from the hands of his enemies and it was not imputed unto him as a sin what i did was only to prolong time till his majesty came in hopes of some commiseration from him  but i forgive that frenchman and likewise sir lewis stucley the wrongs he has done me with all my heart for i have received the sacrament this morning of mr dean and i have forgiven all men but in charity to others am bound to caution them against him and such as he is for sir lewis stucley my keeper and kinsman has affirmed that i should tell him my lord carew and my lord of doncaster here did advise me to escape but i protest before god i never told him any such thing neither did these lords advise me to any such matter it is not likely i should acquaint two privy counselors of my escape or that i should tell him my keeper it was their advice neither was there any reason to tell it him or he to report it for it was well known he left me six eight or ten days together alone to go whither i listed while he rode about the country he further accused me that i should show him a letter whereby i did signify that i would give him ten thousand pounds to escape but god cast my soul into everlasting fire if ever i made such proffer of ten thousand pounds or one thousand pounds but indeed i showed him a letter that if he would go with me there should be order taken for the discharge of his debts when he was gone neither had i one thousand pounds for if i had i could have made my peace better with it otherwise than by giving it stucley further he gave out when i came to sir edward parhams house who had been a follower of mine and gave me good entertainment i had there received some dram of poison when i answered that i feared no such thing for i was well assured of those in the house and therefore wished him to have no such thought now i will not only say that god is the god of revenge but also of mercy and i desire god to forgive him as i hope to be forgiven then casting his eye upon his note of remembrance he went on thus  it was told the king that i was brought perforce into england and that i did not intend to return again whereas captain charles parker mr tresham mr leak and diverse others that knew how i was dealt withal by the common soldiers will witness to the contrary they were an hundred and fifty of them who mutinyd against me and sent for me to come to them for unto me they would not come they kept me close prisoner in my cabin and forced me to take an oath that i would not go into england without their consent otherwise they would have cast me into the sea after i had taken this oath i did by wine gifts and fair words so work upon the mastergunner and ten or twelve of the faction that i won them to desist from their purposes and intended when i returned home to procure their pardon in the mean while proposed that i would dispose of some of them in ireland to which they agreed and would have gone into the north parts from which i dissuaded them and told them they were redshanks who inhabited there so drew them to the south and the better to clear myself of them was forced to get them an hundred and fifty pounds at kingsale otherwise i had never got from them  there was a report also that i meant not to go to guiana at all and that i knew not of any mine nor intended any such matter but only to get my liberty which i had not the wit to keep but it was my full intent to go for gold for the benefit of his majesty myself and those who went with me with the rest of my countrymen though he that knew the head of the mine would not discover it when he saw my son was slain but made himself away then turning to the earl of arundel he said my lord you being in the gallery of my ship at my departure i remember you took me by the hand and said you would request one thing of me which was whether i made a good voyage or a bad that i would return again into england which i then promised and gave you my faith i would so you did said his lordship it is true and they were the last words i said to you another slander was raised of me that i should have gone away from them and have left them at guiana but there were a great many worthy men who accompanied me always as my serjeantmajor and diverse others whom he named that knew it was none of my intention also it has been said that i stinted them of fresh water to which i answer every one was as they must be in a ship furnished by measure and not according to their appetites this course all seamen know must be used among them and to this straight were we driven another opinion was held that i carried with me sixteen thousand pieces of gold and that all the voyage i intended was but to gain my liberty and this money into my hands but as i shall answer it before god i had no more in all the world directly or indirectly than one hundred pounds whereof i gave about fortyfive pounds to my wife but the ground of this false report was that twenty thousand pounds being adventured and but four thousand appearing in the surveyors books the rest had my hand to the bills for diverse adventures but as i hope to be saved i had not a penny more than one hundred pounds these are the material points i thought good to speak of i am at this instant to render my account to god and i protest as i shall appear before him this that i have spoken is true  i will borrow but a little time more of mr sheriff that i may not detain him too long and herein i shall speak of the imputation laid upon me through the jealousy of the people that i had been a persecutor of my lord of essex that i rejoiced in his death and stood in a window over against him when he suffered and puffed out tobacco in defiance of him when as god is my witness that i shed tears for him when he denied and as i hope to look god in the face hereafter my lord of essex did not see my face at the time of his death for i was far off in the armory where i saw him but he saw not me it is true i was of a contrary faction but i take the same god to witness that i had no hand in his death nor bare him any ill affection but always believed it would be better for me that his life had been preserved for after his fall i got the hatred of those who wished me well before and those who set me against him set themselves afterward against me and were my greatest enemies and my soul has many times been grieved that i was not nearer to him when he died because as i understood afterward he asked for me at his death and desired to have been reconciled to me  and now i entreat that you all will join with me in prayer to that great god of heaven whom i have grievously offended being a man full of all vanity who has lived a sinful life in such callings as have been most inducing to it for i have been a soldier a sailor and a courtier which are courses of wickedness and vice that his almighty goodness will forgive me that he will cast away my sins from me and that he will receive me into everlasting life so i take my leave of you all making my peace with god  then proclamation being made that all men should depart the scaffold he prepared himself for death giving away his hat and gap and money to some attendants who stood near him when he took leave of the lords and other gentlemen he entreated the lord arundel to desire the king that no scandalous writings to defame him might be published after his death concluding i have a long journey to go therefore must take my leave then having put off his gown and doublet he called to the headsman to show him the ax which not being suddenly done he said i prythee let me see it do thou think that i am afraid of it having fingered the edge of it a little he returned it and said smiling to the sheriff this is a sharp medicine but it is a sound cure for all diseases and having entreated the company to pray to god to assist and strengthen him the executioner kneeled down and asked him forgiveness which ralegh laying his hand upon his shoulder granted then being asked which way he would lay himself on the block he answered so the heart be right it is no matter which way the head lies as he stooped to lay himself along and reclined his head his face being toward the east the headsman spread his own cloak under him after a little pause he gave the sign that he was ready for the stroke by lifting up his hand and his head was struck off at two blows his body never shrinking or moving his head was showed on each side of the scaffold and then put into a red leather bag and with his velvet nightgown thrown over it was afterward conveyed away in a mourning coach of his ladys his body as we are told was buried hard by in the chancel of st margarets church near the altar but his head was long preserved in a case by his widow for she survived him twentynine years as i have found by some anecdotes remaining in the family and after her death it was kept also by her son carew with whom it is said to have been buried  thus have we seen how sir walter ralegh after a shining and conspicuous series of actions against the enemies of his country and for the improvement of navigation as well as the enlargement and enrichment of the british empire under one sovereign was deprived of his liberty his estate and his life under another how sir walter ralegh who had been one of the greatest scourges of spain was made a sacrifice to it how the services of sir walter ralegh i say in camp in court by land by sea with sword and pen were an honor to queen elizabeths reign and how his sufferings at winchester at westminster by imprisonment by law with slander and the ax were the disgrace of king jamess writers vary in their accounts of his age but the most credible historians inform us that he was sixtysix years old at his execution yet was it conjectured by the extraordinary effusion of blood from his veins that he had stock and strength enough left of nature to have survived many yaars his death was managed by him as one author has observed with so high and religious a resolution as if a roman had acted a christian or rather a christian a roman and this is confirmed by sir richard huttons evidence who says he died in a good and religious manner spoke much and without any fear of death submitted himself to the block by his death he gained great reputation in this life and by the grace and mercy of god remission of his sins and eternal life hereafter  and now since it is time to close the scene let this glorious and gallant cavalier whose enemies have confessed he was one of the weightiest and wisest men that this island ever bred rest in his grave and may his virtues live in posterity whom to inspire therewith the felicities of commemoration however here disposed of seem to have signally combined having transmitted many ample testimonies how emulous the harmony of record and the spirit of communication have been to restore those honors to his memory which were torn from his person and make historical compensation for such honorable calamities and that so early that from this speedy growth of his fame through his extraordinary merits and misfortunes the learned and judicious mr nathanael carpenter who wrote but few years after his death drew that comprehensive character which has so much engaged the concurrence of all succeeding writers where he says who has not known or read of that prodigy of wit and fortune sir walter ralegh a man unfortunate in nothing else but in the greatness of his wit and advancement whose eminent worth was such both in domestic policy foreign expeditions and discoveries in arts and literature both practic and contemplative that it might seem at once to conquer both example and imitation but lest a private judgment should be suspected more liable to the ignorance of a stranger or the affection of a friend and that there may be no room left to doubt either of such manifold worth in sir walter ralegh or that it was all made a sacrifice of state to the enemies and deceivers of the state we have reserved as most convincing the acknowledgments of an enemy who made him that sacrifice here to conclude with for king james soon after raleghs execution beginning to see how he was and would be deluded by the spaniard made one of his ministers write to h s agent in spain to let that state know they should be looked upon as the most unworthy people in the world if they did not now act with sincerity since his majesty had given so many testimonies of his and now of late by causing sir walter ralegh to be put to death chiefly for the giving them satisfaction further to let them see how in many actions of late his majesty had strained upon the affections of his people and especially in this last concerning sir walter ralegh who died with a great deal of courage and constancy lastly that he should let them know how able a man sir walter ralegh was to have done his majesty service yet to give them content he has not spared him when by preserving him he might have given great satisfaction to his subjects and had at command upon all occasions as useful a man as served any prince in christendom  the trial of sir walter ralegh knight for high treason at winton the   th of november   0    jac i the commissioners were the right hon henry howard earl of suffolk ld chamberlain charles blunt earl of devon lord henry howard afterward earl of northampton robert cecil earlof salisbury edward lord wotton of morley sir john stanhope vicechamberlain ld chapter just of eng popham ld chief justice of the common pleas anderson mr justice gawdie mr justice warburton and sir william wade first the commission of oyer and terminer was read by the clerk of the crownoffce and the prisoner bid hold up his hand  and then presently the indictment which was in effect as follows  that he did conspire and go about to deprive the king of his government to raise up sedition within the realm to alter religion to bring in the roman superstition and to procure foreign enemies to invade the kingdom that the lord cobham the th of june last did meet with the said sir walter ralegh in durham house in the parish of st martins in the fields and then and there had conference with him how to advance arabella stuart to the crown and royal throne of this kingdom and that then and there it was agreed that cobham should treat with aremberg ambassador from the archduke of austria to obtain of him  00000 crowns to bring to pass their intended treasons it was agreed that cobham should go to albert the archduke to procure him to advance the pretended title of arabella from thence knowing that albert had not sufficient means to maintain his own army in the low countries cobham should go to spain to procure the king to assist and further her pretended title  it was agreed the better to effect all this conspiracy that arabella should write three letters one to the archduke another to the king of spain and a third to the duke of savoy and promise three things first to establish a firm peace between england and spain secondly to tolerate the popish and roman superstition thirdly to be ruled by them in contracting of her marriage  and for the effecting these traitorous purposes cobham should return by the isle of jersey and should there find sir walter ralegh captain of the said isle and take counsel of ralegh for the distributing of the aforesaid crowns as the occasion or coffeehouse of the subjects should give cause and way  and further that cobham and his brother brook met on the  th of june last and cobham told brook all these treasons to the which treasons brook gave his assent and did join himself to all these and after on the thursday following cobham and brook did speak these words that there would never be a good world in england till the king meaning our sovereign lord and his cubs meaning his royal issue were taken away  and the more to disable and deprive the king of his crown and to confirm the said cobham in his intents ralngh did publish a book falsely written against the most just and royal title of the king knowing the said book to be written against the just title of the king which book cobham after that received of him farther for the better effecting these traitorous purposes and to establish the said brook in his intent the said cobham did deliver the said book unto him the   th of june and further the said cobham on the   th of june for accomplishment of the said conference and by the traitorous instigation of ralegh did move brook to incite arabella to write to the three forenamed princes to procure them to advance her title and that she after she had obtained the crown should promise to perform three things viz   peace between england and spain   to tolerate with impunity the popish and roman superstitions   to be ruled by them three in the contracting of her marriage  to these motions the said brook gave his assent and for the better effecting of the said treasons cobham on the   th of june by the instigation of ralegh did write letters to count aremberg and did deliver the said letters to one matthew de lawrency to be delivered to the said count which he did deliver for the obtaining of  00000 crowns which money by other letters count aremberg did promise to perform the payment of and this letter cobham received the   th of june and then did cobham promise to ralegh that when he had received the said money he would deliver  000 crowns to him to which motion he did consent and afterward cobham offered brook that after he should receive the said crowns he would give to him  000 thereof to which motion brook did assent  to the indictment sir walter ralegh pleaded not guilty  the jury sir ralph conisby knt sir thomas fowler knt sir edward peacock knt sir william row knt henry goodyer esquire roger wood esquire thomas walker esquire thomas whitby esquire thomas highgate gent robert kempthorn gent john chawkey gent robert brumley gent sir walter ralegh was asked whether he would take exceptions to any of the jury  ralegh i know none of them they are all christians and honest gentlemen i except against none   e suff you gentlemen of the kings learned council follow the same course as you did the other day   ralegh my lord i pray you i may answer the points particularly as they are delivered by reason of the weakness of my memory and sickness   popham chief justice after the kings learned council have delivered all the evidence sir walter you may answer particularly to what you will   heal the kings sergeant at law you have heard of raleghs bloody attempts to kill the king and his royal progeny and in place thereof to advance one arabella stuart the particulars of the indictment are these first that ralegh met with cobham the  th of june and had conference of an invasion of a rebellion and an insurrection to be made by the kings subjects to depose the king and to kill his children poor babes that never gave offense here is blood here is a new king and governor in our king consists all our happiness and the true use of the gospel a thing which we all wished to be settled after the death of the queen here must be money to do this for money is the sinew of war where should that be had count aremberg must procure it of philip king of spain   or  00000 crowns and out of this sum ralegh must have  000 then there must be friends to effect this cobham must go to albert archduke of austria from whom aremberg was ambassador at that time in england and what then he must persuade the duke to assist the pretended title of arabella from thence cobham must go to the king of spain and persuade him to assist the said title since the conquest there was never the like treason but out of whose head came it out of raleghs who must also advise cobham to use his brother brook to incite the lady arabella to write three several letters as aforesaid in the indictment all this was on the  th of june then three days after brook was acquainted with it after this cobham said to brook twill never be well in england till the king and his cubs are taken away afterward ralegh delivered a book to cobham treacherously written against the title of the king it appears that cobham took ralegh to be either a god or an idol gobham endeavors to set up a new king or governor god forbid mine eyes should ever see so unhappy a change as for the lady arabella she upon my conscience has no more title to the crown than i have which before god i utterly renounce cobham a man bred in england has no experience abroad but ralegh a man of great wit military and a swordman now whether these things were bred in a hollow tree i leave to them to speak of who can speak far better than myself   sir edward coke the kings attorney i must first my lords before i come to the cause give one caution because we shall often mention persons of eminent places some of them great monarchs whatever we say of them we shall but repeat what others have said of them i mean the capital offenders in their confessions we prosessing law must speak reverently of kings and potentates i perceive these honorable lords and the rest of this great assembly are come to hear what has been scattered upon the wreck of report we carry a just mind to condemn no man but upon plain evidence here is mischief mischief in summo gradu exorbitant mischief my speech shall chiefly touch these three points imitation supportation and defense  the imitation of evil ever exceeds the precedent as on the contrary imitation of good ever comes short mischief cannot be supported but by mischief yea it will so multiply that it will bring all to confusion mischief is ever underpropd by falsehood of foul practices and because all these things did concur in these treasons you shall understand the main as before you did the bye  the treason of the bye consists in these points first that the lord gray brook markham and the rest intended by force in the night to surprise the kings court which was a rebellion in the heart of the realm yea in the heart of the heart in the court they intended to make him that is a sovereign subject to their power purposing to open the doors with muskets and calivers and to take also the prince and council then under the kings authority to carry the king to the tower and to make a state of the admiral when they had the king there to extort three things from him first a pardon for all their treasons secondly a toleration of the roman superstition which their eyes shall sooner fall out than they shall ever see for the king has spoken these words in the hearing of many i will lose the crown and my life before ever i will alter religion and thirdly to remove counselors in the room of the lord chancellor they would have placed one watson a priest absurd in humanity and ignorant in divinity brook of whom i will speak nothing lord treasurer the great secretary must be markham oculus patriae a hole must be found in my lord chief justices coat gray must be earl marshal and master of the horse because he would have a table in the court marry he would advance the earl of worcester to a higher place all this cannot be done without a multitude therefore watson the priest tells a resolute man that the king was in danger of puritans and jesuits so to bring him in blindfold into the action saying that the king is no king till he be crowned therefore every man might right his own wrongs but he is rex natus his dignity descends as well as yours my lords then watson imposes a blasphemous oath that they should swear to defend the kings person to keep secret what was given them in charge and seek all ways and means to advance the catholic religion then they intend to send for the lord mayor and the aldermen in the kings name to the tower lest they should make any resistance and then to take hostages of them and to enjoin them to provide for them victuals and munition gray because the king removed before midsummer had a further reach to get a company of swordmen to assist the action therefore he would stay till he had obtained a regiment from ostend or austria so you see these treasons were like sampsons foxes which were joined in their tails though their heads were severed   ralegh you gentlemen of the jury i pray remember i am not charged with the bye being the treason of the priest   attorney you are not my lords you shall observe three things in the treasons first they had a watchword the kings safety their pretense was bonum in se their intent was malum in se secondly they avouched scripture both the priests had scriptum est perverting and ignorantly mistaking the scriptures thirdly they avouched the common law to prove that he was no king till he was crowned alleging a statute of    eliz this by way of imitation has been the course of all traitors  in the  0th of edward ii isabella the queen and the lord mortimer gave out that the kings person was not safe for the good of the church and commonwealth  the bishop of carlisle did preach on this text my head is grieved meaning by the head the king that when the head began to be negligent the people might reform what is amifs  in the  d of henry iv sir roger claringdon accompanied with two priests gave out that richard ii was alive when he was dead  edward iii caused mortimers head to be cut off for giving couusel to murder the king  the  d of henry vii sir henry stanley found the crown in the dust and set it on the kings head when fitzwater and garret told him that edward v was alive he said if he be alive i will assist him but this cost him his head  edmund de la pole duke of suffolk killed a man in the reign of king henry vii for which the king would have him hold up his hand at the bar and then pardoned him yet he took such offense thereat that he sent to the noblemen to help to reform the commonwealth and then said he would go to france and get power there sir roger compton knew all the treason and discovered windon and others that were attainted  he said there was another thing that would be stood upon namely that they had but one witness then he vouched one appleyards case temp eliz a traitor in norfolk who said a man must have two accusers helmes was the man that accused him but mr justice catlin said that that statute was not in force at that day his words were thrust her into the ditch  then he went on speaking of accusers and mad this difference an accuser is a speaker by report when a witness is he that upon his oath shall speak his knowledge of any man  a third sort of evidence there is likewise and this is held more forcible than either of the other two and that is when a man by his accusation of another shall by the same accusation also condemn himself and make himself liable to the same fault and punishment this is more forcible than many witnesses so then so much by way of imitation then he defined treason there is treason in the heart in the hand in the mouth in consummation comparing that in cord to the root of a tree in ore to the bud in manu to the blossom and that which is in consummatione to the fruit  now i come to your charge you of the jury the greatness of treason is to be considered in these two things determinatione finis and electione medicorum this treason excels in both for that it was to destroy the king and his progeny these treasons are said to be crimen laesae majestatis this goes farther and may be termed crimen extirpandae regiae majestatis and totius progeniei suae i shall not need my lords to speak any thing concerning the king nor of the bounty and sweetness of his nature whose thoughts are innocent whose words are full of wisdom and learning and whose works are full of honor although it be a true saying nunquam nimis quod nunquam satis but to whom do you bear malice to the children   ralegh to whom speak you this you tell me news i never heard of   attorney oh sir do i i will prove you the notoriousest traitor that ever came to the bar after you have taken away the king you would alter religion as you sir walter ralegh have followed them of the bye in imitation for i will charge you with the words   ralegh your words cannot condemn me my innocence is my defense prove one of these things wherewith you have charged me and i will confess the whole indictment and that i am the horriblest traitor that ever lived and worthy to be crucified with a thousand thousand torments   attorney nay i will prove all thou art a monster thou have an english face but a spanish heart now you must have money aremberg was no sooner in england i charge thee ralegh but thou incitedst cobham to go unto him and to deal with him for money to bestow on discontented persons to raise rebellion in the kingdom   ralegh let me answer for myself   attorney thou shall not   ralegh it concerns my life   lord chief justice popham sir walter ralegh mr attorney is but yet in the general but when the kings council have given the evidence wholly you shall answer every particular   attorney oh do i touch you   lord cecil mr attorney when you have done with this general charge do you not mean to let him answer to every particular   attorney yes when we deliver the proofs to be read ralegh procured cobham to go to aremberg which he did by his instigation ralegh supped with cobham before he went to aremberg after supper ralegh conducted him to durham house from whence cobham went with lawrency a servant of arembergs unto him and went in by a backway cobham could never be quiet until he had entertained this motion for he had four letters from ralegh aremberg answered the money should be performed but knew not to whom it should be distributed then cobham and lawrency came back to durham house where they found ralegh cobham and ralegh went up and left lawrency below where they had secret conference in a gallery and after cobham and lawrency departed from ralegh your jargon was peace what is that spanish invasion scottish subversion and again you are not a fit man to take so much money for procuring of a lawful peace for peace procured by money is dishonorable then cobham must go to spain and return by jersey where you were captain and then because cobham had not so much policy or at least wickedness as you he must have your advice for the distribution of the money would you have deposed so good a king lineally descended of elizabeth eldest daughter of edward iv why then must you set up another i think you meant to make arabella a titular queen of whose title i will speak nothing but sure you meant to make her a stale ah good lady you could mean her no good   ralegh you tell me news mr attorney   attorney oh sir i am the more large because i know with whom i deal for we have to deal today with a man of wit   ralegh did i ever speak with this lady   attorney i will track you out before i have done englishmen will not be led by persuasion of words but they must have books to persuade   ralegh this book this book was entitled a defense of the queens proceedings against mary queen of scotland written by one robert snag see the arraignment of sir walter ralegh by sir thomas overbury  to      was written by a man of your profession mr attorney   attorney i would not have you impatient   ralegh methinks you fall out with yourself i say nothing   attorney by this book you would persuade men that he is not the lawful king now let us consider some circumstances my lords you know my lord cobham for whom we all lament and rejoice lament in that his house which has stood so long unspotted is now ruinated rejoice in that his treasons are revealed is neither politician nor swordman ralegh was both united in the cause with him and therefore cause of his destruction another circumstance is the secret contriving of it humphry stafford claimed sanctuary for treason ralegh in his machiavilian policy has made a sanctuary for treason he must talk with none but cobham because says he one witness can never condemn me for brook said unto sir griffith markham take heed how you do make my lord cobham acquainted for whatsoever he knows ralegh the witch will get it out of him as soon as ralegh was examined on one point of treason concerning my lord cobham he wrote to him thus i have been examined of you and confessed nothing further you sent to him by your trusty francis kemish that one witness could not condemn and therefore bad his lordship be of good courage came this out of cobhams quiver no but out of raleghs machiavelian and devilish policy yea but cobham did retract it why then did you urge it now then see the most horrible practices that ever came out of the bottomless pit of the lowest hell after that ralegh had intelligence that cobham had accused him he endeavored to have intelligence from cobham which he had gotten by young sir john payton but i think it was the error of his youth   ralegh the lords told it me or else i had not been sent to the tower   attorney thus cobham by the instigation of ralegh entered into these actions so that the question will be whether you are not the principal traitor and he would nevertheless have entered into it why did cobham retract all that same first because ralegh was so odious he thought he should fare the worse for his sake   dly he thought thus with himself if he be free i shall clear myself the better after this cobham asked for a preacher to confer with pretending to have dr andrews but indeed he meant not to have him but mr galloway a worthy and reverend preacher who can do more with the king as he said than any other that he seeing his constant denial might inform the king thereof here he plays with the preacher if ralegh could persuade the lords that cobham had no intent to travel then he thought all should be well here is forgery in the tower cobham must write to sir thomas vane a worthy man that he meant not to go into spain which letter ralegh devised in cobhams name   ralegh i will wash my hands of the indictment and die a true man to the king   attorney you are the absolutest traitor that ever was   ralegh your phrases will not prove it mr attorney   attorney cobham writes a letter to my lord cecil and does will mellis his man to lay it in a spanish bible and to make as though he found it by chance this was after he had intelligence with this viper then he was false   lord cecil you mean a letter intended to me i never had it   attorney no my lord you had it not you my masters of the jury respect not the wickedness and hatred of the man respect his cause if he be guilty i know you will have care of it for the preservation of the king the continuance of the gospel authorized and the good of us all   ralegh i do not hear yet that you have spoken one word against me here is no treason of mine done if my lord cobham be a traitor what is that to me   attorney all that he did was by thy instigation thou viper for i thou thee thou traitor   ralegh it becomes not a man of quality and virtue to call me so but i take comfort in it it is all you can do   attorney have i angered you   ralegh i am in no case to be angry   c j popham sir walter ralegh mr attorney speaks out of the zeal of his duty for the service of the king and you for your life be valiant on both sides  now they proceed to the reading the proofs   the lord cobhams examination read  he confesses he had a pasport to go into spain intending to go to the archduke to confer with him about these practices and because he knew the archduke had not money to pay his own army from thence he meant to go to spain to deal with the king for the  00000 crowns and to return by jersey and that nothing should be done until he had spoken with sir walter ralegh for distribution of the money to them which were discontented in england at the first beginning he breathed out oaths and exclamations against ralegh calling him villain and traitor saying he had never entered into those courses but by his instigation and that he would never let him alone  here mr attorney willed the clerk of the crownoffice to read over these last words again he would never let him alone  the lord cobhams examination  besides he spoke of plots and invasions of the particulars whereof he could give no account though ralegh and he had conferred of them because he was as he said confounded with them further he said he was afraid of ralegh that when he should return by jersey that he would have him and the money to the king being examined of sir arthur gorge he freed him saying they never durst trust him but sir arthur savage they intended to use because they thought him a fit man  ralegh let me see the examination this is absolutely all the evidence can be brought against me poor shifts you gentlemen of the jury i pray you understand this this is that which must either condemn or give me life which must free me or send my wife and children to beg their bread about the streets this is what must prove me a notorious traitor or true subject to the king let me see my accusation that i may make my answer   clerk of the council i did read it and show you all the examinations   ralegh at my first examination at windsor my lords asked me what i knew of cobhams practice with aremberg i answered negatively and as concerning arabella i protest before god i never heard one word of it if that be proved let me be guilty of a thousand treasons it is a strange thing you will impute that to me when i never heard so much as the name of arabella stuart but only the name of arabella  after being examined i told my lords that i thought my lord cobham had conference with aremberg l suspected his visiting of him for after he departed from me at durham house i saw him pass by his own stairs and passed over to st marysaviours where i knew lawrency a merchant and a follower of aremberg and therefore likely to go unto him my lord cecil asked my opinion concerning lawrency i said that if you do not apprehend lawrency it is dangerous he will fly if you do apprehend him you shall give my lord cobham notice thereof i was asked likewise who was the greatest man with my lord cobham i answered i knew no man so great with him as young wyat of kent  as soon as cobham saw my letter to have discovered his dealing with aremberg in his fury he accused me but before he came to the stairfoot he repented him and said he had done me wrong when he came to the end of his accusation he added that if he had brought this money to jersey that i would have delivered him and the money to the king mr attorney you said this never came out of cobhams quiver he is a simple man is he so simple no he has dispositions of his own he will not easily be guided by others but when he has once taken head in a matter he is not easily drawn from it he is no babe but it is strange for me to devise with cobham that he should go to spain to persuade the king to disburse so much money he being a man of no love in england and i having resigned my room of chiefest command the wardenship of the stannaries is it not strange for me to make myself robin hood or a kitt or a cade i knowing england to be in better estate to defend itself than ever it was i knew scotland united ireland quieted denmark assured which before was suspected i knew that having lost a lady whom time had surprised we had now an active king a lawful successor the state of spain was not unknown to me i had written a discourse which i had intended to present unto the king against peace with spain i knew the spaniards had six repulses three in ireland and three at sea and once in      at cales by my lord admiral i knew he was discouraged and dishonored i knew the king of spain to be the proudest prince living but now he comes creeping to the king my master for peace i knew whereas before he had in his ports six or seven score sail of ships he has now but six or seven i knew of twentyfive millions he had from his indies he has scarce one left i knew him so poor that the jesuits in spain who were wont to have such large allowance were fain to beg at the churchdoor was it ever read or heard that any prince should disburse so much money without a sufficient pawn i knew her own subjects the citizens of london would not lend her majesty money without lands in mortgage i knew the queen did not lend the states money without flushing brill and other towns for a pawn and can it be thought he would let cobham have so great a sum  i never came to the lord cobhams but about matters of his profit as the ordering of his house paying of his servants boardwages etc i had of his when i was examined four thousand pounds worth of jewels for a purchase a pearl of three thousand pounds and a ring worth five hundred pounds if he had had a fancy to run away he would not have left so much to have purchased a lease in feefarm i saw him buy three hundred pounds worth of books to send to his library at canterbury and a cabinet of thirty pounds to give to mr attorney for drawing the conveyances and god in heaven knows not i whither he intended to travel but for that practice with arabella or letters to aremberg or any discourse with him or in what language he spoke unto him if i knew any of these things i would absolutely confess the indictment and acknowledge myself worthy a thousand deaths  cobhams second examination read  the lord cobham being required to subscribe to an examination there was showed a note under raleghs hand the which when he had perused he paused and after brake forth into these speeches oh villain oh traitor i will now tell you all the truth and then said his purpose was to go into flanders and into spain for the obtaining the aforesaid money and that ralegh had appointed to meet him in jersey as he returned home to be advised of him about the distribution of the money  popham lord chief justice when cobham answered to the interrogatories he made scruple to subscribe and being urged to it he said if he might hear me affirm that a person of his degree ought to set his hand he would i lying then at richmond for fear of the plague was sent for and i told him he ought to subscribe otherwise it were a contempt of a high nature then he subscribed the lords questioned with him further and he showed them a letter as i thought written to me but it was indeed written to my lord cecil he desired to see the letter again and then said oh wretch oh traitor whereby i perceived you had not performed that trust he had reposed in you   ralegh he is as passionate a man as lives for he has not spared the best friends he has in england in his passion my lords i take it he that has been examined has ever been asked at the time of his examination if it be according to his meaning and then to subscribe methinks my lords when he accuses a man he should give some account and reason of it it is not sufficient to say we talked of it if i had been the plotter would not i have given cobham some arguments whereby to persuade the king of spain and answer his objections i knew westmorland and bothwell men of other understandings than cobham were ready to beg their bread  sir thomas fowler one of the jury did sir walter ralegh write a letter to my lord before he was examined concerning him or not   attorney yes   lord cecil i am in great dispute with my self to speak in the case of this gentleman a former dearness between me and him tied so firm a knot of my conceit of his virtues now broken by a discovery of his imperfections i protest did i serve a king that i knew would be displeased with me for speaking in this case i would speak whatever came of it but seeing he is compacted of piety and justice and one that will not mislike any man for speaking a truth i will answer your question  sir walter ralegh was staid by me at windsor upon the first news of copley that the kings person should be surpised by my lord gray and mr george brook when i found brook was in i suspected cobham then i doubted ralegh to be a partaker i speak not this that it should be thought i had greater judgment than the rest of my lords in making this haste to have him examined ralegh following to windsor i met with him upon the terrace and willed him as from the king to stay saying the lords had something to say to him then he was examined but not concerning my lord cobham but of the surprising treason my lord gray was apprehended and likewise brook by brook we found that he had given notice to cobham of the surprising treason as he delivered it to us but with as much sparingness of a brother as he might we sent for my lord cobham to richmond where he stood upon his justification and his quality sometimes being froward he said he was not bound to subscribe wherewith we made the king acquainted cobham said if my lord chief justice would say it were a contempt he would subscribe whereof being resolved he subscribed there was a light given to aremberg that lawrency was examined but that ralegh knew that cobham was examined is more than i know   ralegh if my lord cobham had trusted me in the main was not i as fit a man to be trusted in the bye   lord cecil ralegh did by letter acquaint us that my lord cobham had sent lawrency to aremberg when he knew not he had any dealings with him   lord h howard it made for you if lawrency had been only acquainted with cobham and not with you but you knew his whole estate and were acquainted with cobhams practice with lawrency and it was known to you before that lawrency depended on aremberg   attorney   ralegh protests against the surprising treason   that he knew not of the matter touching arabella i would not charge you sir walter with a matter of falsehood you say you suspected the intelligence that cobham had with aremberg by lawrency   ralegh i thought it had been no other intelligence but such as might be warranted   attorney then it was but lawful suspicion but to that whereas you said that cobham had accused you on passion i answer three ways   i observed when cobham said let me see the letter again he paused and when he did see that count aremberg was touched he cried out o traitor o villain now will i confess the whole truth   the accusation of a man on hear say is nothing would he accuse himself on passion and ruinate his cause and posterity out of malice to accuse you   could this be out of passion mark the manner of it cobham had told this at least two months before to his brother brook you are fools you are on the bye ralegh and i are on the main we mean to take away the king and his cubs this he delivered two months before so mark the manner and the matter he would not turn the weapon against his own brother and accuse himself to accuse you   ralegh has cobham confessed that   lord chief justice this is spoken by mr attorney to prove that cobhams speech came not out of passion   ralegh let it be proved that cobham said so   attorney cobham says he was a long time doubtful of ralegh that he would send him and the money to the king did cobham fear lest you would betray him in jersey then of necessity there must be trust between you no man can betray a man but he that is trusted in my understanding this is the greatest argument to prove that he was acquainted with cobhams proceedings ralegh has a deeper reach than to make himself as he said robin hood a ket or cade yet i never heard that robin hood was a traitor they say he was an outlaw and whereas he says that our king is not only more wealthy and potent than his prededecessors but also more politic and wise so that he could have no hope to prevail i answer there is no king so potent wise and active but he may be overtaken through treason whereas you say spain is so poor discoursing so largely thereof it had been better for you to have kept in guiana than to have been so well acquainted with the state of spain besides if you could have brought spain and scotland to have joined you might have had hope to prevail for his six overthrows i answer he has the more malice because repulses breed desire of revenge then you say you never talked with cobham but about leases and letting lands and ordering his house i never knew you clerk of the kitchen etc if you had fallen on your knees at first and confessed the treason it had been better for you you say he meant to have given me a cabinet of thirty pounds perhaps he thought by those means to have anticipated me therewith but you say all these are circumstances i answer all this accusation in circumstance is true here now i might appeal to my lords that you take hold of this that he subscribed not to the accusation   lord h howard cobham was not then pressed to subscribe   attorney his accusation being testified by the lords is of as great force as if he had subscribed ralegh says again if the accuser be alive he must be brought face to face to speak and alleges    edw iii that there must be two sufficient witnesses that must be brought face to face before the accused and alleges  0 and    eliz   ralegh you try me by the spanish inquisition if you proceed only by the circumstances without two witnesses   attorney this is a treasonable speech   ralegh evertere hominem justum in causa sua injustum est good my lords let it be proved either by the laws of the land or by the laws of god that there ought not to be two witnesses appointed yet i will not stand to defend this point in law if the king will have it so it is no rare thing to be falsely accused a judge condemned a woman in sarum for killing her husband on the testimony of one witness afterward his man confessed the murder when she was executed who after being touched in conscience for the judgment was used to say quod nunquam de hoc facto animam in vita sua purgaret it is also commanded by the scripture deuteronomy xvii in ore duorum aut trium testium etc and xix non stabit unus testis contra aliquem etc  if christ requires it as it appears mat xviii if by the statute civil law and gods word it be required that there must be two witnesses at the least bear with me if i desire one  i would not desire to live if i were privy to cobhams proceedings i had been a slave a villain a fool if i had endeavored to set up arabella and refused so gracious a lord and sovereign but urge your proofs   lord chief justice you have offered questions on diverse statutes all which mention two accusers in case of indictments you have deceived yourself for the laws of    ed iii and   ed vi are repealed it suffices now if there be proofs made either under hand or by testimony of witnesses or by oaths it needs not the subscription of the party so there be hands of credible men to testify the examination   ralegh it may be an error in me and if those laws be repealed yet i hope the equity of those laws remains still but if you affirm it it must be a law to posterity the proof of the common law is by witness and jury let cobham be here let him speak it call my accuser before my face and i have done   attorney scientia seeleris est mera ignorantia you have read the letter of the law but understand it not here was your anchorhold and your rendezvous you trust to cobham either cobham must accuse you or not accuse you if he did then it would not hurt you because he is but one witness if he did not then you are safe   ralegh if ever i read a word of the law or statute before i was prisoner in the tower god confound me   attorney now i come to prove the circumstances of the accusation to be true cobham confessed he had a pasport to travel hereby intending to present overtures to the archduke and from thence to go to spain and there to have conference with the king for money you say he promised to come home by jersey to make merry with you and your wife   ralegh i said in his return from france not spain   attorney further in his examination he says nothing could be set down for the distribution of the money to the discontented without conference with ralegh you said it should have been for procurement of peace but it was for raising rebellion further cobham says he would never have entered into these courses but by your instigation and that you would never let him alone your scholar was not apt enough to tell us all the plots that is enough for you to do that are his master you intended to trust sir arthur savage whom i take to be an honest and true gentleman but not sir arthur gorge   ralegh all this is but one accusation of cobhams i hear no other thing to which accusation he never subscribed nor avouched it i beseech you my lords let cobham be sent for charge him on his soul on his allegiance to the king if he affirm it i am guilty   lord cecil it is the accusation of my lord cobham it is the evidence against you must it not be of force without his subscription i desire to be resolved by the judges whether by the law it is not a forcible argument of evidence   the judges my lord it is   ralegh the king at his coronation is sworn in omnibus judiciis suis aequitatem non rigorem legis observare by the rigor and cruelty of the law it may be a forcible evidence   lord chief justice that is not the rigor of the law but the justice of the law else when a man has made a plain accusation by practice he might be brought to retract it again   ralegh oh my lord you may use equity   lord chief justice that is from the king you are to have justice from us   anderson the law is if the matter be proved to the jury they must find you guilty for cobhams accusation is not only against you there are other things sufficient   lord cecil now that sir walter ralegh is satisfied that cobhams subscription is not necessary i pray you mr attorney go on   ralegh good mr attorney be patient and give me leave   lord cecil an unnecessary patience is a hindrance let him go on with his proofs and then refel them   ralegh i would answer particularly   lord cecil if you would have a table and pen and ink you shall   then paper and ink was given him  here the clerk of the crown read the letter which the lord cobham did write in july which was to the effect of his former examination further saying i have disclosed all to accuse any falsely were to burden my own conscience  attorney read copley s confession the  th of june he says he was offered  000 crowns to be in this action   here watsons additions were read  the great mass of money from the count was impossible etc  brooks confession read  there have letters passed says he between cobham and aremberg for a great sum of money to assist a second action for the surprising of his majesty  attorney it is not possible it was of passion for it was in talk before three men being severally examined who agreed in the sum to be bestowed on disaffected persons that gray should have   000 crowns and ralegh should have  000 or  0000 crowns   cobhams examination july     if the money might be procured says he then a man may give pensions being asked if a pension should not be given to his brother brook he denied it not  lawrencys examination  within five days after aremberg arrived cobham resorted unto him that night that cobham went to aremberg with lawrency ralegh supped with him  attorney ralegh must have his part of the money therefore now he is a traitor the crown shall never stand one year on the head of the king my master if a traitor may not be condemned by circumstances for if a tells b and b tells c and c d etc you shall never prove treason by two witnesses   raleghs examination was read  he confesses cobham offered him  000 crowns which he was to have for the furtherance of the peace between england and spain and that he should have it within three days to which he said he gave this answer when i see the money i will tell you more for i had thought it had been one of his ordinary idle conceits and therefore made no account thereof  ralegh the attorney has made a long narration of copley and the priests which concerns me nothing neither know i how cobham was altered for he told me if i would agree to further the peace he would get me  000 crowns i asked him who shall have the rest of the money he said i will offer such a nobleman who was not named some of the money i said he will not be persuaded by you and will extremely hate you for such a motion let me be pinched to death with hot irons if ever i knew there was any intention to bestow the money on discontented persons i had made a discourse against the peace and would have printed it if cobham changed his mind if the priests if brook had any such intent what is that to me they must answer for it he offered me the money before aremberg came that is difference of time   serj philips ralegh confesses the matter but avoideth it by distinguishing of times you said it was offered you before the coming of aremberg which is false for you being examined whether you should have such money of cobham or not you said yea and that you should have it within two or three days nemo moriturus praesumitur mentiri   lord henry howard allege me any ground or cause wherefore you gave ear to my lord cobham for receiving pensions in matters you had not to deal with   ralegh could i stop my lord cobhams mouth   lord cecil sir walter ralegh presses that my lord cobham should be brought face to face if he asks things of favor and grace they must come only from him that can give them if we sit here as commissioners how shall we be satisfied whether he ought to be brought unless we hear the judges speak   lord chief justice this thing cannot be granted for then a number of treasons should flourish the accuser may be drawn by practice whilst he is in person   judge gaudy the statute you speak of concerning two witnesses in case of treason is found to be inconvenient therefore by another law it was taken away   ralegh the common trial of england is by jury and witnesses   lord chief justice no by examination if three conspire a treason and they all confess it here is never a witness yet they are condemned   judge warburton i marvel sir walter that you being of such experience and wit should stand on this point for so many horsestealers may escape if they may not be condemned without witnesses if one should rush into the kings privychamber whilst he is alone and kill the king which god forbid and this man be met coming with his sword drawn all bloody shall not he be condemned to death my lord cobham has perhaps been labored withal and to save you his old friend it may be that he will deny all that which he has said   ralegh i know not how you conceive the law   lord chief justice nay we do not conceive the law but we know the law   ralegh the wisdom of the law of god is absolute and perfect haec fac and vives etc but now by the wisdom of the state the wisdom of the law is uncertain indeed where the accuser is not to be had conveniently i agree with you but here my accuser may he is alive and in the house susanna had been condemned if daniel had not cried out will you condemn an innocent israelite without examination or knowledge of the truth remember it is absolutely the commandment of god if a false witness rise up you shall cause him to be brought before the judges if he be found false he shall have the punishment which the accused should have had it is very sure for my lord to accuse me is my certain danger and may be a means to excuse himself   lord chief juctice there must not such a gap be opened for the destruction of the king as would be if we should grant this you plead hard for yourself but the laws plead as hard for the king i did never hear that course to be taken in a case of treason as to write to one another or speak to one another during the time of their imprisonment there has been intelligence between you and what underhand practices there may be i know not if the circumstances agree not with the evidence we will not condemn you   ralegh the king desires nothing but the knowledge of the truth and would have no advantage taken by severity of the law if ever we had a gracious king now we have i hope as he is such are his ministers if there be but a trial of five marks at the common law a witness must be deposed good my lords let my accuser come face to face and be deposed   lord chief justice you have no law for it god forbid any man should accuse himself upon his oath   attorney the law presumes a man will not accuse himself to accuse another you are an odious man for cobham thinks his cause the worse that you are in it now you shall hear of some stirs to be raised in scotland   part of copleys examination  also watson told me that a special person told him that aremberg offered to him a thousand crowns to be in that action and that brook said the stirs in scotland came out of raleghs head  ralegh brook has been taught his lesson   lord h howard this examination was taken before me did i teach him his lesson   ralegh i protest before god i meant it not by any privycounsellor but because money is scant he will juggle on both sides   raleghs examination  the way to invade england were to begin with stirs in scotland  ralegh i think so still i have spoken it to diverse of the lords of the council by way of discourse and opinion   attorney now let us come to those words of destroying the king and his cubs   ralegh o barbarous if they like unnatural villains should use those words shall i be charged with them i will not hear it i was never falfe to the crown of england i have spent  0000 crowns of mine own against the spanish faction for the good of my country do you bring the words of these hellish spiders clark watson and others against me   attorney thou have a spanish heart and thyself art a spider of hell for thou confessest the king to be a most sweet and gracious prince and yet have conspired against him   watsons examination read  he said that george brook told him twice that his brother the lord cobham said to him that you are but on the bye but ralegh and i are on the main  brooks examination read  being asked what was meant by this jargon the bye and the main he said that the lord cobham told him that gray and others were in the bye he and ralegh were on the main being asked what exposition his brother made of these words he said he is loath to repeat and after says by the main was meant the taking away of the king and his issue and thinks on his conscience it was infused into his brothers head by ralegh  cobhams examination read  being asked if ever he had said it will never be well in england till the king and his cubs were taken away he said he hod answered before and that he would answer no more to that point  ralegh i am not named in all this there is a law of two sorts of accusers one of his own knowledge another by hearsay   earl of suffolk see the case of arnold   lord chief justice it is the case of sir william thomas and sir nicholas arnold   ralegh if this may be you will have any mans life in a week   attorney ralegh says that cobham was in a passion when he said so would he tell his brother any thing of malice against ralegh whom he loved as his life   ralegh brook never loved me until his brother had accused me he said nothing   lord cecil we have heard nothing that might lead us to think that brook accused you he was only in the surprising treason for by accusing you he should accuse his brother   ralegh he does not care much for that   lord cecil i must judge the best the accusation of his brother was not voluntary he pared every thing as much as he could to save his brother   cobhams examination read  he says he had a book written against the title of the king which he had of ralegh and that he gave it to his brother ralegh said it was foolishly written  attorney after the king came within twelve miles of london cobham never came to see him and intended to travel without seeing the queen ahd the prince now in this coffeehouse you gave him the book and he gave it to his brother   ralegh i never gave it him he took it off my table for i well remember a little before that time i received a challenge from sir amias preston and for that i did intend to answer it i resolved to leave my estate settled therefore laid out all my loose papers amongst which was this book   lord howard where had you this book   ralegh in the old lordtreasurers study after his death   lord cecil did you ever show or make known the book to me   ralegh no my lord   lord cecil was it one of the books which was left to me or my brother   ralegh i took it out of the study in my lord treasurers house in the strand   lord cecil after my fathers decease sir walter ralegh desired to search for some cosmographical decriptions of the indies which he thought were in his study and were not to be had in print which i granted and would have trusted sir walter ralegh as soon as any man though since for some infirmities the bands of my affection to him have been broken and yet reserving my duty to the king my master which i can by no means dispense with by god i love him and have a great conflict within myself but i must needs say sir walter used me a little unkindly to take the book away without my knowledge nevertheless i need make no apology in behalf of my father considering how useful and necessary it is for privycounsellors and those in his place to intercept and keep such kind of writings for whosoever should then search his study may in all likelihood find all the notorious libels that were writ against the late queen and whosoever should rumage my study or at least my cabinet may find several against the king our sovereign lord since his accession to the throne   ralegh this book was in manuscript and the late lord treasurer had wrote in the beginning of it with his own hands these words this is the book of robert snagg and i do own as my lord cecil has said that i believe they may also find in my house almost all the libels that have been writ against the late queen   attorney you were no privycounsellor and i hope never shall be   lord cecil he was not a sworn counselor of state but he has been called to consultations   ralegh i think it a very severe interpretation of the law to bring me within compass of treason for this book writ so long ago of which nobody had read any more than the heads of the chapters and which was burnt by brook without my privity admitting i had delivered the same to my lord cobham without allowing or approving but discommending it according to cobhams first accusation and put the case i should come to my lord cecil as i have often done and find a stranger with him with a packet of libels and my lord should let me have one or two of them to peruse this i hope is no treason   attorney i observe there was intelligence between you and cobham in the tower for after he said it was against the kings title he denied it again   sir william wade first my lord cobham confesses it and after he had subscribed it he revoked it again to me he always said that the drift of it was against the kings title   ralegh i protest before god and all his works i gave him not the book   note sir robert wroth speaks or whispereth something secretly   attorney my lords i must complain of sir robert wroth he says this evidence is not material   sir robert wroth i never spoke the words   attorney let mr sergeant philips testify whether he heard them   lord cecil i will give my word for sir robert wroth   sir robert wroth i will speak as truly as you mr attorney for by god i never spoke it   lord chief justice wherefore should this book be burnt   ralegh i burned it not   serj philips you presented your friend with it when he was discontented if it had been before the queens death it had been a less matter but you gave it him presently when he came from the king which was the time of his coffeehouse   ralegh here is a book supposed to be treasonable i never read it commended it or delivered it nor urged it   attorney this is cunning   ralegh every thing that does make for me is cunning and every thing that makes against me is probable   attorney lord cobham says that kemish came to him with a letter torn and did with him not to be dismayed for one witness could not hurt him   ralegh this poor man has been close prisoner thee eighteen weeks he was offered the rack to make him confess i never sent any such message by him i only writ to him to tell him what i had done with mr attorney having of his at that time a great pearl and a diamond   lord h howard no circumstance moves me more than this kemish was never on the rack the king gave charge that no rigor should be used   commissioners we protest before god there was no such matter intended to our knowledges   ralegh was not the keeper of the rack sent for and he threatened with it   sir william wade when mr solicitor and my self examined kemish we told him he deserved the rack but did not threaten him wiih it   commissioners it was more than we knew   cobhams examination read  he said kemish brought him a letter from ralegh and that part which was concerning the lords of the council was rent out that he was examined and cleared him of all and that the lord h howard said because he was discontent he was fit to be in the action and further that kemish said to him from ralegh that he should be of good comfort for one witness could not condemn a man for treason  lord cecil cobham was asked whether and when he heard from you he said every day   ralegh kemish added more i never bad him speak these words   nota mr attorney here ofsered to interrupt him lord cecil it is his last discourse give him leave mr attorney   ralegh i am accused concerning arabella concerning money out of spain my lord chief justice says a man may be condemned with one witness yea without any witnefs cobham is guilty of many things conscientia mill testes he has accused himself what can he hope for but mercy my lords vouchsafe me this grace let him be brought being alive and in the house let him avouch any of these things i will confess the whole indictment and renounce the kings mercy   lord cecil here has been a touch of the lady arabella stuart a near kinswoman of the kings let us not scandal the innocent by confusion of speech she is as innocent of all these things as i or any man here only she received a letter from cobham to prepare her which she laughed at and immediately sent it to the king so far was she from coffeehouse that she laughed him to scorn but you see how far the count of aremberg did consent   the lord admiral nottingham being by in a standing with the lady arabella spoke to the court the lady does here protest upon her salvation that she never dealt in any of these things and so she willed me to tell the court   lord cecil the lord cobham wrote to my lady arabella to know if he might come to speak with her and gave her to understand that there were some about the king that labored to disgrace her she doubted it was but a trick but brook says his brother moved him to procure arabella to write letters to the kings of spain but he says he never did   ralegh the lord cobham has accused me you see in what manner he has forsworn it were it not for his accusation all this were nothing let him be asked if i knew of the letter which lawrency brought to him from aremberg let me speak for my life it can be no hurt for him to be brought he dares not accuse me if you grant me not this favor i am strangely used campian was not denied to have his accusers face to face   lord chief justice since he must needs have justice the acquitting of his old friend may move him to speak otherwise than the truth   ralegh if i had been the infuser of all these treasons into him you gentlemen of the jury mark this he said i have been the cause of all his miseries and the destruction of his house and that all evil has happened unto him by my wicked counsel if this be true whom has he cause to accuse and be revenged on but on me and i know him to be as revengeful as any man on earth   attorney he is a party and may not come the law is against it   ralegh it is a toy to tell me of law i defy such law i stand on the fact   lord cecil i am afraid my often speaking who am inferior to the lords here present will make the world think i delight to hear myself talk my affection to you sir walter ralegh was not extinguished but slaked in regard of your deserts you know the law of the realm to the which your mind does not contest that my lord cobham cannot be brought   ralegh he may be my lord   lord cecil but dare you challenge it   ralegh no   lord cecil you say that my lord cobham your main accuser must come to accuse you you say he has retracted i say many particulars are not retracted what the validity of all this is is merely left to the jury let me ask you this if my lord cobham will say you were the only instigator of him to proceed in the treasons dare you put yourself on this   ralegh if he will speak it before god and the king that ever i knew of arabellas matter or the money out of spain or of the surprising treason i put myself on it gods will and the kings be done with me   lord howard how if he speak things equivalent to what you have said   ralegh yes in a main point   lord cecil if he say you have been the instigator of him to deal with the spanish king had not the council cause to draw you hither   ralegh i put myself on it   lord cecil then sir walter ralegh call upon god and prepare yourself for i do verily believe my lords will prove this excepting your faults i call them no worse by god i am your friend the heat and passion in you and the attorneys zeal in the kings service makes me speak this   ralegh whosoever is the workman it is reason he should give account of his work to the workmaster but let it be proved that he acquainted me with any of his conferences with aremberg he would surely have given me some account   lord cecil that follows not if i set you on work and you give me no account am i therefore innocent   attorney for the lady arabella i said she was never acquainted with the matter now that ralegh had conference in all these treasons it is manifest the jury has heard the matter there is one dyer a pilot that being in lisbon met with a portugal gentleman who asked him if the king of england was crowned yet to whom he anfwered i think not yet but he shall be shortly nay says the portugal gentlemen that shall he never be for his throat will be cut by don ralegh and don cobham before he be crowned  dyer was called and sworn and delivered this evidence   dyer i came to a merchants house in lisbon to see a boy that i had there there came in a gentleman into the house and enquiring what countryman i was i said an englishman whereupon he asked me if the king was crowned and i answered that i hoped he should be so shortly nay faith he he shall never be crowned for don ralegh and don cobham will cut his throat ever that day come   ralegh what infer you upon this   attorney that your treason has wings   ralegh if cobham did practice with aremberg how could it not but be known in spain why did they name the duke of buckingham with jack straws treason and the duke of york with jack cade but that it was to countenance his treason  consider you gentlemen of the jury there is no cause so doubtful which the kings council cannot make good against the law consider my disability and their ability they prove nothing against me only they bring the accusation of my lord cobham which he has lamented and repented as heartily as if it had been for a horrible murder for he knew that all this sorrow which should come to me is by his means presumptions must proceed from precedent or subsequent facts i have spent  0000 crowns against the spaniard i had not purchased forty pounds a year if i had died in guiana i had not left  00 marks a year to my wife and son i that have always condemned the spanish faction methinks it is a strange thing that now i should affect it remember what st austing says sic judicate tanquam ab alio mox judicandi unus judex unum tribunal if you would be contented on presumptions to be delivered up to be slaughtered to have your wives and children turned into the streets to beg their bread if you would be contented to be so judged judge so of me   serj philips i hope to make this so clear as that the wit of man shall have no color to answer it the matter is treason in the highest degree the end to deprive the king of his crown the particular treasons are these first to raise up rebellion and to effect that to procure money to raise up tumults in scotland by divulging a treasonable book against the kings right to the crown the purpose to take the life of his majesty and his issue my lord cobham confesses sir walter ralegh to be guilty of all these treasons the question is whether he be guilty as joining with him or instigating of him the course to prove this was by my lord cobhams accusation if that be true he is guilty if not he is clear so whether cobham say true or ralegh that is the question ralegh has no answer but the shadow of as much wit as the wit of man can devise he uses his bare denial the denial of a defendant must not move the jury in the star chamber or in the chancery for matter of title if the defendant be called in question his denial on his oath is no evidence to the court to clear him he does it in propria causa therefore much less in matters of treason cobhams testisication against him before then and since has been largely discoursed   ralegh if truth be constant and constancy be in truth why has he forsworn that that he has said you have not proved any one thing by direct prooss but all by circumstances   attorney have you done the king must have the last   ralegh nay mr attorney he which speaks for his life must speak last false repetitions and mistakings must not mar my cause you should speak secundum allegata and probata i appeal to god and the king in this point whether cobhams accusation be sufficient to condemn me   atterney the kings safety and your clearing cannot agree i protest before god i never knew a clearer treason   ralegh i never had intelligence with cobham since i came to the tower   attorney go too i will lay thee upon thy back for the confidentest traitor that ever came at a bar why should you take  000 crowns for a peace   lord cecil be not so impatient good mr attorney give him leave to speak   attorney if i may not be patiently hcard you will encourage traitors and discourage us i am the kings sworn servant and must speak if he be guilty he is a traitor if not deliver him   note here mr attorney sat down and would speak no more until the commissioners urged and entreated him after much ado he went on and madc a long repetitiom of all the evidence for the direction of the jury and at the repeating of some things sir walter ralegh interrupted him and said he did him wrong attorney thou art the most vile and execrable traitor that ever lived   ralegh you speak indiscreetly barbarously and uncivilly   attorney i want words sufficient to express thy viperous treasons   ralegh i think you want words indeed for you have spoken one thing half a dozen times   attorney thou art an odious fellow thy name is hateful to all the realm of england for thy pride   ralegh it will go near to prove a measuring cast between you and me mr attorney   attorney well i will now make it appear to the world that there never lived a viler viper upon the face of the earth than thou and therewithal drew a letter out of his pocket saying further my lords you shall see this is an agent that has writ a treatise against the spaniard and has ever so detested him this is he that has spent so much money against him in service and yet you shall all see whether his heart be not wholly spanish the lord cobham who of his own nature was a good and honorable gentleman till overtaken by this wretch now finding his conscience heavily burdened with some courses which the subtilty of this traitor had drawn him into my lords he could not be at rest with himself nor quiet in his thoughts until he was eased of that heavy weight out of which passion of his mind and discharge of his duty to his prince and his conscience to god taking it upon his salvation that he wrote nothing but the truth with his own hands he wrote this letter now sir you shall see whether you had intelligence with cobham within four days before he came to the tower if he be wholly spanish that desired a pension of   00 pounds a year from spain that spain by him might have intelligence then ralegh is a traitor he has taken an apple and pinned a letter unto it and threw it into my lord cobhams window the contents whereof were this it is doubtful whether we shall be proceeded with or no perhaps you shall not be tried this was to get a retractation oh it was adams apple whereby the devil did deceive him further he wrote thus do not as my lord of essex did take heed of a preacher for by his persuasion be confessed and made himself guilty i doubt not but this day god shall have as great a conquest by this traitor and the son of god shall be as much glorified as when it was said vicisti galileae you know my meaning what though cobham retracted yet he could not reandst nor sleep until he had confirmed it again if this be not enough to prove him a traitor the king my master shall not live three years to an end   nota here mr attorney produced the lord cobhams letter writ to the commissioners the night before raleghs trial viz nov    and as he read it inserted some speeches i have thought it fit to set down this to my lords wherein i profess on my soul to write nothing but the truth i am come new near to the period of my time therefore i confess the truth before god and his angels ralegh four days before i came to the tower caused an apple eves apple to be thrown in at my chamber window the effect of it was to entreat me to right the wrong that i had done him in saying that i should have come home by jersey which under my hand to him i have retracted his first letter i answered not which was thrown in the same manner wherein he prayed me to write him a letter which i did he sent me word that the judges were at mr attorneys house and that there was good hope the proceedings against us should be staid he sent me another time a little tobacco at arembergs coming ralegh dealt with me to procure him a pension of   00 pounds a year for which he promised that no action should be against spain but he would give knowledge beforehand he told me the states had audience with the king ah is not this a spanish heart in an english body he has been the original cause of my ruin for i had no dealing with aremberg but by his instigation he has been also the cause of my coffeehouse he advised me not to be overtaken with preachers as essex was and that the king would better allow of a constant denial than to accuse any  attorney o damnable atheist he has learned some text of scripture to serve his own purpose but falsely alleged he counsels him not to be counseled by preachers as essex was he died the child of god god honored him at his death thou wast by when he died et lupus and turpes instant morientibus ursae he died indeed for his offense the king himself spoke these words he that shall say essex died not for trea on is punishable   ralegh you have heard a strange tale of a strange man now he thinks he has matter enough to destroy me but the king and all of you shall witness by our deaths which of us was the ruin of the other i bid a poor fellow throw in the letter at his window written to this purpose you know you have undone me now write three lines to justify me in this i will die that he has done me wrong why did not he acquaint me with his treasons if i acquainted him with my dispositions   attorney but what say you now of the letter and the pension of   00 l per annum   ralegh i say that cobham is a base dishonorable poor soul   attorney is he base i return it into thy throat on his behalf but for thee he had been a good subject   lord chief justice i perceive thou art not so clear a man as you have protested all this while for you should have discovered these matters to the king   nota here ralegh pulled a letter out of his pocket which the lord cobham had written to him but a few days before he wrote that above to the lords and desired my lord cecil to read it because be only knew his hand the effect of it was as follows cobhams letter of justification to ralegh  seeing myself so near my end for the discharge of my own conscience and freeing myself from your blood which else will cry vengeance against me i protest upon my salvation i never practiced with spain by your procurement god so comfort me in this my affliction as you are a true subject for any thing that i know i will say as daniel purus sum a sanguine hujus so god have mercy on my soul as i know no treason by you ralegh now i wonder how many souls this man has he damns one in this letter and another in that   here was much ado mr attorney alleged that his last letter was politickly and cunningly urged from the lord cobham and that the first was simply the truth and that lest it should seem doubtful that the first letter was drawn from the lord cobham by promise of mercy or hope of favor the lord chief justice willed that the jury might herein be satisfied whereupon the earl of devonshire delivered that the same was merely voluntary and not extracted from the lord cobham upon any hopes or promise of pardon nota this was the last evidence whereupon a marshal was sworn to keep the jury private the jury departed and staid not a quarter of an hour but returned and gave their verdict guilty serj hele demanded judgment against the prisoner  clerk of the crown sir walter ralegh thou have been indicted arraigned and pleaded not guilty for all these several treasons and for trial thereof have put thyself upon thy country which country are these who have found thee guilty what can thou say for thyself why judgment and execution of death should not pass against thee   ralegh my lords the jury have found me guilty they must do as they are directed i can say nothing why judgment should not proceed you see whereof cobham has accused me you remember his protestations that i was never guilty i desire the king should know of the wrongs done unto me since i came hither   lord chief justice you have had no wrong sir walter   ralegh yes of mr attorney i desire my lords to remember three things to the king   i was accused to be a practiser for spain i never knew that my lord cobham meant to go thither i will ask no mercy at the kings hands if he will affirm it   i never knew of the practice with arabella   i never knew of my lord cobhams practice with aremberg nor of the surprising treason   lord chief justice in my conscience i am persuaded that cobham has accused you truly you cannot deny but that you were dealt with to have a pension to be a spy for spain therefore you are not so true to the king as you have protested yourself to be   ralegh i submit myself to the kings mercy i know his mercy is greater than my offense i recommend my wife and son of tender years unbrought up to his compassion   lord chief justice i had thought i should never have seen this day to have stood in this place to give sentence of death against you because i thought it impossible that one of so great parts should have fallen so grievously god has bestowed on you many benefits you had been a man fit and able to have served the king in good place you had brought yourself into a good state of living if you had entered into a good consideration of your estate and not suffered your own wit to have entrapped yourself you might have lived in good comfort it is best for man not to seek to climb too high lest he fall nor yet to creep too low lest he be trodden on it was the posie of the wisest and greatest counselor of his time in england in medio spatio mediocria firma locantur you might have lived well with  000 l a year for so i have heard your revenues to be i know nothing might move you to be discontented but if you had been down you know fortunes wheel when it is turned about rises again i never heard that the king took away any thing from you but the captainship of the guard which he did with good reasons to have one of his own knowledge whom he might trust in that place you have been taken for a wise man and so have showed wit enough this day again for monopolies for wine etc if the king said it is a matter that offends my people should i burden them for your particular good i think you could not well take it hardly that his subjects were eased though by your private hindrance two vices have lodged chiefly in you one is an eager ambition the other corrupt covetousness ambition in desiring to be advanced to equal grace and favor as you have been before time that grace you had then you got not in a day or year for your covetousness i am sorry to hear that a gentleman of your wealth should become a base spy for the enemy which is the vilest of all other wherein on my conscience cobham has said true by it you would have increased your living   00 l a year this covetousness is like a canker that eats the ironplace where it lives your case being thus let it not grieve you if i speak a little out of zeal and love to your good you have been taxed by the world with the defense of most heathenish and blasphemous opinions which i list not to repeat because christian ears cannot endure to hear them nor the authors and maintainers of them be suffered to live in any christian commonwealth you know what men said of harpool you shall do well before you go out of the world to give satisfaction therein and not to die with these imputations on you let not any devil persuade you to think there is no eternity in heaven if you think thus you shall find eternity in hellfire in the first accusation of my lord cobham i observed his manner of speaking i protest before the living god i am persuaded he spoke nothing but the truth you wrote that he should not in any case confess any thing to a preacher telling him an example of my lord of essex that noble earl that is gone who if he had not been carried away with others had lived in honor to this day among us he confessed his offenses and obtained mercy of the lord for i am verily persuaded in my heart he died a worthy servant of god your conceit of not confessing any thing is very inhuman and wicked in this world is the time of confessing that we may be absolved at the day of judgment you have showed a fearful sign of denying god in advising a man not to confess it now comes in my mind why you may not have your accuser face to face for such a one is easily brought to retract when he sees there is no hope of his own life it is dangerous that any traitors should have any accefs one to another or conference when they see themselves must die they will think it best to see their fellow live that he may commit the like treason again and so in some sort seek revenge  now it rests to pronounce the judgment which i wish you had not been this day to have received of me for if the fear of god in you had been answerable to your other great parts you might have lived to have been a singular good subject i never saw the like trial and i hope i shall never see the like again   the judgment but since you have been found guilty of these horrible treasons the judgment of the court is that you shall be had from hence to the place whence you came there to remain until the day of execution and from thence you shall be drawn upon a hurdle through the open streets to the place of execution there to be hanged and cut down alive and your body shall be opened your heart and bowels plucked out and your privymembers cut off and thrown into the fire before your eyes then your head to be stricken off from your body which shall be divided into four quarters to be disposed of at the kings pleasure and god have mercy upon your soul  finis
